<h1>Banned Information in the U.S.</h1>

<p>Here is a list of things on the Internet that the U.S. government has
made it illegal for you to see. <b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome
to U.S. citizens who have defied their government's tyranny to view these
pages.</p>

<ul>

<li><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
	href="http://www.eff.org/BlueRibbon/sites.html">EFF's
	list of banned sites</a> includes the Venus di Milo,
	<cite>Huckleberry Finn</cite> and numerous other examples</li>

<li>the Bible, especially the Old Testament, which has numerous prohibited
descriptions of indecent behavior, including adultery, sodomy, inbreeding,
masturbation and just plain sex</li>

<li><img src="/images/news.gif" alt="[NEWS]"><a
href="news:alt.binaries.pictures.erotica">alt.binaries.pictures.erotica</a>
is one of several Usenet news groups dedicated to "filthy, indecent, lewd or
lascivious" images.</li>

<li>World Wide Web search engines, like <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]">
<a href="http://www.infoseek.com/">InfoSeek</a>, because their databases
contain titles that are prohibited</li>

<title>LP on CDA</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 10, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Party on Internet Censorship</h1>

<p>On February 10, 1996, anticensorship activists held a rally outside
the White House in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.,</a>
protesting Congress' passage of
<a href="/revolution/express/techno/exon/">Internet censorship</a>.</p>

<p>Representing the <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian
Party</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">William Winter</a> delivered
the following speech:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You, the citizens of the Internet, have reason to distrust politicians
and political parties.</p>

<p>After all, the Republicans and Democrats just revoked your First 
Amendment rights, and criminalized the speech that flows from your
computers.</p>

<p>So, when a representative of a political party comes before you, it is
reasonable of you to ask: "Where do you stand on the issue of electronic free 
speech?"</p>

<p>And it's understandable that you might ask, "Prove your support for 
electronic free speech."</p>

<p>Well, there is one political party that has its commitment to 
electronic free speech written right into its party platform. It's the 
Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>Our Platform states: "We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of 
speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications 
media, including laws concerning electronic bulletin boards, communications 
networks, and other interactive electronic media. We hold them to be the 
functional equivalent of speaking halls and printing presses in the age of 
electronic communications, and as such deserving of full freedom."</p>

<p>There is one political party that turned its Web site black for 48 
hours as part of the world-wide campaign to symbolically protest the new 
censorship law. It's the Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>And there is one political party that joined the Internet coalition to
fight electronic censorship, along with the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a>,
Wired magazine, the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,
and People for the American Way. It's the Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party's commitment to electronic free speech is 
absolute. We do not waver, or back down, or compromise on this issue.</p>

<p>Like you, Libertarians know that the so-called Communications Decency 
Act is a case of 20th-century politicians using 19th-century laws to control 
21st-century technology.</p>

<p>Like you, we understand that this bill threatens to interrupt the 
rapid evolution of electronic information systems -- an area where America 
leads the world in innovation. </p>

<p>Like you, we understand that this bill will have a chilling effect on 
new technologies. A more certain way of guaranteeing permanent second-class 
status for America is hard to imagine.</p>

<p>Like you, we recognize that this bill isn't needed. The marketplace is
rapidly moving to remedy any concerns parents might have about indecent 
material being available to children. </p>

<p>Like you, we know that his bill usurps the role of parents. We know 
that parents, not Justice Department bureaucrats, should determine what 
children see, hear, or download. </p>

<p>And we know that it's especially hypocritical for Republicans -- who 
bemoan other government programs which weaken the family -- to vote for 
paternalistic laws appointing Washington bureaucrats as the family censor.</p>

<p>Like you, we understand that this bill is censorship -- an effort by 
politicians to restrict the freedom of the electronic press. As such, it is a 
clear violation of the First Amendment. </p>

<p>Like you, we Libertarians are opposed to government censorship in any 
form -- whether it is high-tech cyber-censorship, or old-fashioned book 
burning.</p>

<p>Like you, we believe that cyberspace deserves the same robust, 
expansive definition of free speech as any other communications medium.</p>

<p>Like you, we understand that censorship is censorship ... and, like 
you, we won't tolerate it! </p>

<p>The Libertarian Party is on your side. </p>

<p>And, like you, we'll keep fighting until this bill -- and every other 
attempt to censor the Internet -- is revoked, rejected, and repealed! </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Indecency Act to be challenged</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: press release June 24, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Online Newspaper to Challenge Exon Act</h1>

<p>The <cite>American Reporter</cite>, an online magazine staffed by thirty
journalists from the Society of Professional Journalists's Internet discussion
list, is challenging the indecency provisions of the Telecommunications
Reform Bill recently enacted into law.</p>

<p>Joe Shea, <cite>American Reporter's</cite> Editor-in-Chief, promises
a "battle royal" in the courts. "We are prepared in every respect to take
our challenge to the United States Supreme Court at the earliest
opportunity," Shea said in a June 24, 1995 news release.</p>

<p>Stephen W. Russell, a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> state
court judge and associate professor of criminal justice at the
University of Texas at
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>, wrote <a href="reporter.html">"The X-On Congress"</a> for the
<cite>American Reporter</cite>, violating the law by commenting indecently
on the U.S. Congress who passed it.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>,
law firm of Arent Fox, Kintner, Plotkin and Kahn
will donate pro bono legal services to challenge the law immediately upon
publication of the article. The law firm is the same one that defended
the famous "Seven Dirty Words" case, in which the FCC prohibited the
radio broadcast of a George Carlin monologue.</p>

<title>Leahy vs. CDA</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, D.C (USA); USA -->
<!-- Time: February 9, 1996 -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Leahy Opposes CDA</h1>

<p>U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/vt/">Vermont</a>) opposed
the <a href="index.html">Communications Decency Act of 1996</a> from
its inception. After it passed, he sponsored a bill to repeal the CDA.
Following are his floor comments when introducing the bill on
February 9, 1996.</p>

<h2>Leahy's Floor Statement on Repealing the CDA</h2>

<p>Mr. President, last week, the Congress passed
   telecommunications legislation. The President signed it into law this
   week. For a number of reasons, and I stated them in the Chamber at the
   time, I voted against the legislation. There were a number of things
   in that legislation I liked and I am glad to see them in law. There
   were, however, some parts I did not like, one of them especially.
   Today I am introducing a bill to repeal parts of the new law, parts I
   feel would have far-reaching implications and would impose
   far-reaching new Federal crimes on Americans for exercising their free
   speech rights on-line and on the Internet.
   
   <p>The parts of the telecommunications bill called the "Communications
   Decency Act" are fatally flawed and unconstitutional. Indeed, such
   serious questions about the constitutionality of this legislation have
   been raised that a new section was added to speed up judicial review
   to see if the legislation would pass constitutional muster. The
   legislation is not going to pass that test.
   
   <p>The first amendment to our Constitution expressly states that
   "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." The new
   law flouts that prohibition for the sake of political posturing. We
   should not wait to let the courts fix this mistake. Even on an
   expedited basis, the judicial review of the new law would take months
   and possibly years of litigation. During those years of litigation
   unsuspecting Americans who are using the Internet in unprecedented
   numbers and more every day, are going to risk criminal liability every
   time they go on-line.
   
   <p>Let us be emphatically clear that the people at risk of committing a
   felony under this new law are not child pornographers, purveyors of
   obscene materials or child sex molesters. These people can already be
   prosecuted and should be prosecuted under longstanding Federal
   criminal laws that prevent the distribution over computer networks of
   obscene and other pornographic materials harmful to minors, under 18
   U.S.C. sections 1465, 2252 and 2423(a); that prohibit the illegal
   solicitation of a minor by way of a computer network, under 18 U.S.C.
   section 2252; and that bar the illegal luring of a minor into sexual
   activity through computer conversations, under 18 U.S.C. section
   2423(b). In fact, just last year, we passed unanimously a new law that
   sharply increases penalties for people who commit these crimes. In
   fact, just last year, we passed unanimously a new law that sharply
   increases penalties for these people.
   
   <p>There is absolutely no disagreement in the Senate, no disagreement
   certainly among the 100 Senators about wanting to protect children
   from harm. All 100 Senators, no matter where they are from, would
   agree that obscenity and child pornography should be kept out of the
   hands of children.
   
   <p>All Senators agree that we should punish those who sexually exploit
   children or abuse children. I am a former prosecutor. I have
   prosecuted people for abusing children. This is something where there
   are no political or ideological differences among us.
   
   <p>I believe there was a terribly misguided effort to protect children
   from what some prosecutors somewhere in this country might consider
   offensive or indecent online material, and in doing that, the
   Communications Decency Act tramples on the free speech rights of all
   Americans who want to enjoy this medium.
   
   <p>This legislation sweeps more broadly than just stopping obscenity from
   being sent to children. It will impose felony penalties for using
   indecent four-letter words, or discussing material deemed to be
   indecent, on electronic bulletin boards or Internet chat areas and
   news groups accessible to children.
   
   <p>Let me give a couple of examples: You send E-mail back and forth, and
   you want to annoy somebody whom you talked with many times before --
   it may be your best buddy -- and you use a four-letter word. Well, you
   could be prosecuted for that, although you could pick up the phone,
   say the same thing to him, and you commit no crime; or send a letter
   and say the same word and commit no crime; or talk to him walking down
   the street and commit no crime.
   
   <p>To avoid liability under this legislation, users of e-mail will have
   to ban curse words and other expressions that might be characterized
   as indecent from their online vocabulary.
   
   <p>The new law will punish with 2-year jail terms someone using one of
   the "seven dirty words" in a message to a minor or for sharing with a
   minor material containing indecent passages. In some areas of the
   country, a copy of Seventeen Magazine would be considered indecent,
   even though kids buy it. The magazine is among the 10 most frequently
   challenged school library materials in the country. Somebody sends an
   excerpt from it, and bang, they could be prosecuted.
   
   <p>The new law will make it a crime "to display in a manner available to"
   a child any message or material "that, in context, depicts or
   describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
   community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs..." That
   covers any of the over 13,000 Usenet discussion groups, as well as
   electronic bulletin boards, online service provider chat rooms, and
   Web sites, that are all accessible to children.
   
   <p>This "display" prohibition, according to the drafters, "applies to
   content providers who post indecent material for online display
   without taking precautions that shield that material from minors."
   
   <p>What precautions will Internet users have to take to avoid criminal
   liability? These users, after all, are the ones who provide the
   "content" read in news groups and on electronic bulletin boards. The
   legislation gives the FCC authority to describe the precautions that
   can be taken to avoid criminal liability. All Internet users will have
   to wait and look to the FCC for what they must do to protect
   themselves from criminal liability.
   
   <p>Internet users will have to limit all language used and topics
   discussed in online discussions accessible to minors to that
   appropriate for kindergartners, just in case a child clicks onto the
   discussion. No literary quotes from racy parts of Catcher in the Rye
   or Ulysses will be allowed. Certainly, online discussions of safe sex
   practices, or birth control methods, and of AIDS prevention methods
   will be suspect. Any user who crosses the vague and undefined line of
   "indecency" will be subject to two years in jail and fines.
   
   <p>This worries me considerably. I will give you an idea of what happens.
   People look at this, and because it is so vague and so broad and so
   sweeping, attempts to protect one's self from breaking the law become
   even broader and even more sweeping.
   
   <p>A few weeks ago, America Online took the online profile of a Vermonter
   off the service. Why? Because the Vermonter used what AOL deemed a
   vulgar, forbidden word. The word -- and I do not want to shock my
   colleagues -- but the word was "breast." And the reason this Vermonter
   was using the word "breast"? She was a survivor of breast cancer. She
   used the service to exchange the latest information on detection of
   breast cancer or engage in support to those who are survivors of
   breast cancer. Of course, eventually, America Online apologized and
   indicated they would allow the use of the word where appropriate.
   
   <p>We are already seeing premonitions of the chilling effect this
   legislation will have on online service providers. Far better we use
   the laws on the books today to go after child pornographers, to go
   after child abusers.
   
   <p>What strikes some people as "indecent" or "patently offensive" may
   look very different to other people in another part of the country.
   Given these differences, a vague ban on patently offensive and
   indecent communications may make us feel good but threatens to drive
   off the Internet and computer networks an unimaginable amount of
   valuable political, artistic, scientific, health and other speech.
   
   <p>For example, many museums in this country and abroad are going hi-tech
   and starting Web pages to provide the public with greater access to
   the cultural riches they offer. What if museums, like the Whitney
   Museum, which currently operates a Web page, had to censor what it
   made available online out of fear of being dragged into court? Only
   adults and kids who can make it in person to the museum will be able
   to see the paintings or sculpture censored for online viewing under
   this law.
   
   <p>What about the university health service that posts information online
   about birth control and protections against the spread of AIDS? With
   many students in college under 18, this information would likely
   disappear under threat of prosecution.
   
   <p>What happens if they are selling online versions of James Joyce's
   Ulysses or of Catcher in the Rye? Can they advertise this? Can
   excerpts be put online? In all likelihood not. The Internet is
   breaking new ground important for the economic health of this country.
   Businesses, like the Golden Quill Book Shop in Manchester Center,
   Vermont can advertise and sell their books around the country or the
   world via the Internet. But now, advertisers will have to censor their
   ads.
   
   <p>For example, some people consider the Victoria's Secret catalogue
   indecent. Under this new law, advertisements that would be legal in
   print could subject the advertiser to criminal liability if circulated
   online. You could put them in your local newspaper, but you cannot put
   it online.
   
   <p>In bookstores and on library shelves, the protections of the First
   Amendment are clear. The courts are unwavering in the protection of
   indecent speech. In altering the protections of the first amendment
   for online communications, I believe you could cripple this new mode
   of communication.
   
   <p>At some point you have to start asking, where do we censor? What
   speech do we keep off? Is it speech we may find politically
   disturbing? If somebody wants to be critical of any one Member of
   Congress, are we able to keep that off? Should we be able to keep that
   off? I think not. There is a lot of reprehensible speech and usually
   it becomes more noted when attempts are made to censor it rather than
   let it out in the daylight where people can respond to it.
   
   <p>The Internet is an American technology that has swept around the
   world. As its popularity has grown, so have efforts to censor it. For
   example, complaints by German prosecutors prompted an online service
   provider to cut off subscriber access to over 200 Internet news groups
   with the words "sex", "gay" or "erotica" in the name. They censored
   such groups as "clarinet.news.gays," which is an online newspaper
   focused on gay issues, and "gay-net.coming-out", which is a support
   group for gay men and women dealing with going public with their
   sexual orientation.
   
   <p>German prosecutors have also tried to get AOL to stop providing access
   to neo-Nazi propaganda accessible on the Internet. No doubt such
   material is offensive and abhorrent, but nonetheless just as protected
   by our First Amendment as indecent material.
   
   <p>In China, look what they are trying to do. They are trying to create
   an "intranet" that would heavily censor outside access to the
   worldwide Internet. We ought to be make sure it is open, not censored.
   We ought to send that out as an example to China.
   
   <p>Americans should be taking the high ground to protect the future of
   our home-grown Internet, and to fight these censorship efforts that
   are springing up around the globe. Instead of championing the First
   Amendment, however, the Communications Decency Act tramples on the
   principles of free speech and free flow of information that has fueled
   the growth of this medium.
   
   <p>We have to be vigilant in enforcing the laws we have on the books to
   protect our children from obscenity, child pornography and sexual
   exploitation. Those laws are being enforced. Just last September,
   using current laws, the FBI seized computers and computer files from
   about 125 homes and offices across the country as part of an operation
   to shut down an online child pornography ring.
   
   <p>I well understand the motivation for the Communications Decency Act.
   We want to protect our children from offensive or indecent online
   materials. This Senator --and I am confident every other Senator--
   agrees with that. But we must be careful that the means we use to
   protect our children does not do more harm than good. We can already
   control the access our children have to indecent material with
   blocking technologies available for free from some online service
   providers and for a relatively low cost from software manufacturers.
   
   <p>Frankly, and I will close with this, Mr. President, at some point we
   ought to stop saying the Government is going to make a determination
   of what we read and see, the Government will determine what our
   children have or do not have.
   
   <p>I grew up in a family where my parents thought it was their
   responsibility to guide what I read or would not read. They probably
   had their hands full. I was reading at the age of 4. I was a voracious
   reader, and all the time I was growing up I read several books a week
   and went through our local library in the small town I grew up in very
   quickly. That love of reading has stood me in very good stead. I am
   sure I read some things that were a total waste of time, but very
   quickly I began to determine what were the good things to read and
   what were the bad things. I had read all of Dickens by the end of the
   third grade and much of Robert Louis Stevenson. I am sure some can
   argue there are parts of those that maybe were not suitable for
   somebody in third grade. I do not think I was severely damaged by it
   at all. That same love of reading helped me get through law school and
   become a prosecutor where I did put child abusers behind bars.
   
   <p>Should we not say that the parents ought to make this decision, not us
   in the Congress? We should put some responsibility back on families,
   on parents. They have the software available that they can determine
   what their children are looking at. That is what we should do. Banning
   indecent material from the Internet is like using a meat cleaver to
   deal with the problems better addressed with a scalpel.
   
   <p>We should not wait for the courts. Let us get this new
   unconstitutional law off the books as soon as possible.</p>

<h1>EFF's Analysis of Communications Decency Act</h1>

<p><cite>Consitutional problems with the Communications Decency Amendment:
A legislative analysis by the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier
Foundation</a></cite></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On June 14, 1995, the United States Senate approved by a vote of 84-16 an
amendment to the Senate's omnibus telecommunications-deregulation bill
that raises grave Constitutional questions and poses great risks for the
future of freedom of speech on the nation's computer-communications
forums.</p>

<p>Sponsored by Sen. Jim Exon (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a>),
the amendment originated as an
independent bill titled Communications Decency Act of 1995 (CDA), and is
intended, according to its sponsor, both to prohibit "the [computer]
equivalent of obscene telephone calls" and to prohibit the distribution to
children of materials with sexual content.</p>

<p>As drafted, however, the legislation not only fails to solve the problems
it is intended to address, but it also imposes content restrictions on
computer communications that would chill First-Amendment-protected speech
and, in effect, restrict adults in the public forums of computer networks
to writing and reading only such content as is suitable for children.</p>

<h2>Specific Provisions of the CDA</h2>

<p>The Communications Decency Act would change the language of Title 47,
United States Code, Section 223, a section that primarily does two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>it prohibits "obscene or harassing" phone calls and other, similar,
abusive uses of the telephone, and</p></li>

<li><p>it imposes regulation (promulgated and administered by the Federal
Communications Commission) on telephone services that provide so-called
"indecent" content and prohibits those services from providing legally
obscene content.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The amending language drafted by Sen. Exon and passed by the Senate
substantially restructures and alters the provisions of this section in an
effort to bring computer communications under the statute. If the
Senate-approved language becomes law, provisions in the amended statute
will:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Expand the scope of the statute from telephones to "telecommunications
devices" (such as computers, modems, and the data servers and conferencing
systems used by Internet sites and by commercial providers like America
Online and CompuServe);</p></li>

<li><p>Define as a criminal offense any communication that is legally obscene
or indecent if that communication is sent over a telecommunications device
"with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person";</p></li>

<li><p>Penalize any person or entity who, by use of a telecommunication
device, "knowingly ... makes or makes available" any content or material
that is legally obscene; and</p></li>

<li><p>Penalize any person or entity who "knowingly ... makes or makes
available" to a person under the age of 18 any content or material that is
"indecent."</p></li>

<p>The CDA outlines affirmative defenses for persons or entities who might
otherwise be liable under the statute's criminal provisions.</p>

<p>In spite of the efforts of Sen. Exon to address in this revision of his
legislation those criticisms and constitutional issues raised by earlier
drafts of it, the language of the CDA as passed by the Senate is riddled
with flaws that threaten the First Amendment rights both of online service
providers and of individual citizens.</p>

<h2>The CSA Would Criminalize Constitutionally Protected Speech</h2>

<p>None of the CDA's prohibitions of "obscene" communications raise any
constitutional issues; it is well-settled law that obscene content is not
protected under the Constitution. In contrast, CDA's restrictions on
"indecent" speech are deeply problematic. </p>

<p>What is "indecent" speech and what is its significance? In general,
"indecent" speech is nonobscene material that deals explicitly with sex or
that uses profane language. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that
such "indecency" is Constitutionally protected. Further, the Court has
stated that indecent speech cannot be banned altogether -- not even in
broadcasting, the single communications medium in which the federal
government traditionally has held broad powers of content control.</p>

<p>The section of the CDA dealing with "obscene or harassing" communications
penalizes not only the sending of "obscene" communications, but also those
that are "indecent." This prohibition of indecent content, even though
limited somewhat in application by the section's intent requirement, is
unconstitutional on its face.</p>

<p>In <cite>Sable Communications v. FCC</cite> (1989), a case involving
dial-in phone-sex services, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, even though a
ban on <em>obscenity</em> in "dial-a-porn" services is constitutional, a ban
on <em>indecency</em> is not. Citing earlier holdings, the Court said that
"[t]he government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit
for children." 

<p>What are some examples of "indecent" content? The most famous example
probably is the George Carlin comedy monologue that was the basis of the
Supreme Court case <cite>F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation</cite> (1978). In that
monologue, Carlin discusses the "Seven Dirty Words" that cannot be uttered
in broadcast media. Other examples of "indecency" could include passages
from John Updike or Erica Jong novels, certain rock lyrics, and Dr. Ruth
Westheimer's sexual-advice column. Under the CDA, it would be criminal to
"knowingly" publish such material on the Internet unless children were
affirmatively denied access to it. It's as if the manager of a Barnes &
Noble outlet could be sent to jail simply because children could wander
the bookstore's aisles and search for the racy passages in a Judith Krantz
or Harold Robbins novel.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has consistently held, both before and after its
landmark obscenity decision in <cite>Miller v. California</cite> (1973), that
while sexual material and profane language can be regulated in some specifically
defined contexts (e.g., the FCC can require that "indecent" content in
broadcasting be limited to certain hours of the broadcasting schedule when
children are less likely to be exposed), in general indecency is fully protected
by the First Amendment. The Court has even recognized that profane
language may be essential to political speech, since the emotional power
of particular words may be as important as their intellectual content. As
Justice Harlan commented in <cite>Cohen v. California</cite> (1971), "One man's
vulgarity is another's lyric."</p>

<p>It's important to note that not every application of this part of the CDA
would be unconstitutional. If the "obscene or harassing" offense language
been limited to instances in which the speaker intends to "threaten," it
would have raised no constitutional problems. (A threat of blackmail or
physical violence, for example, is not protected speech.)  But the CDA goes
beyond threats -- it criminalizes the use of "indecent" language even when the
speaker merely intends for his content to be "annoying," and this 
prohibition treads squarely on speakers' First Amendment rights. After
all, the First Amendment was drafted to protect offensive, annoying, and
disturbing speech -- there is little need for protection of pleasant and
uncontroversial speech, since few people feel impelled to ban it. As
Justice Douglas observed in <cite>Terminiello v. Chicago</cite> (1949), free
speech "may best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest,
creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people
to anger." For example, a citizen offended by the passage of the CDA who 
shouts an indecent comment at his U.S. Senator may very well intend to 
annoy the Senator -- nevertheless, such expression is protected under 
the First Amendment. It is constitutionally absurd that speech that would 
be protected if shouted on the street would turn the speaker into a felon 
if sent by e-mail.</p>

<h2>By Granting the FCC Regulatory Control Over the Content and Availability
of Computer Communications, the CDA Violates the First Amendment.</h2>

<p>Is it constitutional for Congress to declare that computer communications
are a medium like broadcasting, where it is allowable for the FCC to
impose content-related regulations? Clearly not. Prior to Sen. Exon's
proposed changes to Section 223, the FCC has had content control over only
two specific types of communications media:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>broadcasting media like TV and radio (and broadcasting-related
technologies, such as cable TV), and</p>

<li><p>the narrow class of telephone-based commercial services that requires
the assistance and support of government-regulated common carriers.</p>
</ul>

<p>In no other communications medium does the government have the
constitutional authority to impose broad regulation of indecent content.</p>

<p>The justification for the federal government's special role in regulation
of broadcasting is twofold. The first rationale for such a broad
regulatory role was the "scarcity of frequencies" argument, which appears
the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</cite>
(1969). In that case, the Court held that there is a finite number of
workable broadcasting frequencies, and that the scarcity of this important
public resource entails that the airwaves be allocated and supervised by
the federal government in order to best serve the public interest. The
second rationale for a special government role in broadcasting appears in
<cite>FCC v. Pacifica Foundation</cite> (the "Seven Dirty Words" case discussed
above). In this case the Court argued that broadcasting is an especially
"pervasive" medium that intrudes into the privacy of the home, creating a
constant risk that adults will be exposed to offensive material, and
children to indecent material, without warning.</p>

<p>The justification for regulation of the telephone-based services is
grounded in the government's special role in supervising common carriers.
Since the telephone systems of this country, many of which amount to
monopolies, are common carriers, they are appropriately under the
jurisdiction of the FCC. It makes sense for phone-sex services, which rely
on the cooperation of common carriers, to fall under FCC jurisdiction as
well.</p>

<p><em>Neither the broadcasting rationales nor the common-carrier rationale
support government content control over computer communications.</em></p>

<p>First of all, the new medium of computer-based communications -- which may
take place over everything from large-scale Internet access providers and
commercial conferencing systems to the PC-based bulletin-board system
running in a hobbyist's basement -- isn't afflicted with "scarcity."
Computing hardware itself is increasingly inexpensive, for example, and
one of the basic facts of modern computer communication is that whenever
you add a computer to the Internet, you <em>increase</em> the Internet's size
and capabilities.</p>

<p>Secondly, computer-based communications aren't "pervasive" as that term is
used in the Pacifica case. In the world of broadcasting, content is
"pushed" at audiences by TV and radio stations and broadcasting networks
-- audiences are primarily passive recipients of programming. In computer
communications, in contrast, content is <em>pulled</em> by users from various
locations and resources around the globe through the Internet or from the
huge data servers maintained by services like Prodigy and American Online.
Exposure to content is primary <em>driven by user choice</em>. For users with
even minimal experience, there is little risk of unwitting exposure to
offensive or indecent material.</p>

<p>Finally, online service providers aren't common carriers and don't want to
be -- it is the nature of this kind of service that providers must reserve
the right to make certain basic choices about content. In contrast, a
common carrier like AT&T or BellSouth has to "take all comers." (If online
service providers were treated as common carriers, we might imagine a day
when the FCC requires that an NAACP-sponsored BBS carry hateful messages
from members of the Ku Klux Klan.)</p>

<p>In sum, the narrow constitutional justifications for content regulation of
two specific types of media do not extend to the traditional print
media, films or oral conversations. Clearly, there is no Constitutional
rationale for extending intrusive content-regulatory control to online
communications. This means that the CDA's "shoehorning" of online
communications into the jurisdiction of the FCC is itself
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>It is clear that Congress could not constitutionally grant the FCC the
power to tell The New Yorker not to print profane language -- even though
<em>children</em> might come across a copy of The New Yorker. Surely it is
equally clear that Congress cannot grant the FCC the authority to dictate
how providers like Netcom and CompuServe handle content that contains such
language.</p>

<h2>Computer Communications Pose Different Problems and Require Different
Solutions From Those of Other Media</h2>

<p>Even if the federal government had the constitutional authority to
regulate indecency in computer communications, it would be required by the
First Amendment to employ only the "least restrictive means" in doing so.
In the Sable case, Court noted that there are less restrictive means than
a total ban for protecting children from indecent content on phone-sex
services. These include such measures as requiring various procedures to
verify customers' ages and to deny services to minors.</p>

<p>The Exon language creates an affirmative defense for online service
providers who implement the same types of procedures that the FCC now
requires of phone-sex services. But what works for phone-sex services
clearly would not work for computer-communications services. In this
fundamentally different medium, those FCC-enforced procedures are not a
"least restrictive means" -- in fact, they are potentially among the most
restrictive.</p>

<p>The language that penalizes anyone who "makes or makes available" indecent
content to a minor would require an access provider like Netcom to cease
carrying the entire alt.sex.* hierarchy, the great majority of which is
First-Amendment-protected speech. Suppose Netcom tried to avail
itself of legal immunity for transmitting indecency by, say, limiting
subscriber access to the "indecent" Usenet newsgroups to Netcom
subscribers age 18 or over. Since Netcom, like all Internet access
providers, is also a Usenet distribution node, *the company would still be
liable*, since, by passing "indecent" Usenet traffic through, it would
"make available" that indecent content to minors elsewhere on the Net who
aren't Netcom customers.</p>

<p>Note: this analysis is not meant to imply that <em>no</em> government
regulation of computer communications would meet the "least restrictive
means." As a practical matter, this medium is <em>uniquely suited</em> to
measures that simultaneously protect sensitive users and children from
offensive content and allow the full range of constitutionally protected
speech on the Net. Since both the computers that users employ to read the
Net and those that providers use to administer the Net are highly
intelligent and programmable devices, it is relatively easy to design
tools that individuals can use to filter offensive content and that
parents can use to screen content for their children. The government's
promotion of the development and implementation of such tools, if done in
a way consistent with First Amendment guarantees, would likely qualify as
a "least restrictive means." </P>

<p>Furthermore, there are constitutional reasons for favoring policies that
empower individuals and families to make their own content choices. In
<cite>Wisconsin v. Yoder</cite> (1972), the Supreme Court acknowledged that
the right of parents to determine what is appropriate for their children is
constitutionally protected. Filtering tools could be the fundamental means
of preserving family values while exploring global computer networks.</P>

<h2>Adults Should Not Be Limited To Only What Is Appropriate For Children</h2>

<p>The effect of the CDA's provisions regarding indecent content and minors
would be both dramatic and disastrous. If enacted, the CDA would
effectively turn all the public areas of the Net -- and all of the distributed
global conferencing system known as Usenet -- into the equivalent of the
Children's Room at the public library. Traditionally, every large public
library has a Children's Room -- a confined area of the library with
content deemed safe for children. Outside of the Children's Room, the rest
of the library is geared toward, and available to, adults.</p>

<p>The Exon language would turn the Net as a whole into the <em>inverse</em>
of the public library -- the public spaces, including Usenet, would be
regulated as safe for children, while adults would have to talk about adult
content (detailed discussions of sexual content in the work of James Joyce,
explanations of Shakespeare's bawdy puns, or descriptions of proper
techniques for safe sex, to name some examples) in confined, nonpublic
(and probably non-global) subforums or "rooms." There would be no more
wide-ranging debates with the full set of potential international
participants about the merits of <cite>The Satanic Verses</cite> -- after all,
that book has indecent content. We'd have to be content with the narrower range
of participants we could lure to an "adult" room on CompuServe or AOL -- a
small group of paying subscribers rather than a large population of
discussants from commercial and noncommercial systems alike. The CDA would
diminish and perhaps destroy the intellectual diversity and vibrancy of
the Net.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The CDA represents the kind of "top-down," government-centered attempt to
regulate the content that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the
nature of this new medium. Legislation like the CDA -- particular when
based on regulatory approaches for wholly different media -- are certain
to create more practical and constitutional problems than they solve. It
is especially ironic that the Exon amendment, which would chill the
development of online services and communities and "dumb down" the content
of the Net's public spaces to a grade-school level, has been attached to a
bill deregulating communications infrastructure. This deregulation
has been presented as a boost to the pace of development of the very
technology to support these services and communities.</p>

<p>EFF believes that parents, not Congress or the FCC, have the primary right
and responsibility to determine what is appropriate for their children to
see. Furthermore, it is clearly wrong for Congress to attempt to make
outlaws out of adults for engaging in public speech that may not be
suitable for minors.  As Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter ruled in
<cite>Butler v. Michigan</cite> (1957):</p>

<p>"The State insists that, by thus quarantining the general reading public
against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield
juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general
welfare. Surely this is to burn the house to roast the pig. The incidence
of this enactment is to reduce the adult population of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> to
reading only what is fit for children."</p>

<p>And a legislative approach that was bad for the adult population of
Michigan nearly 40 years ago is surely just as bad for the adult
population of the Net today.</p>

<title>Export Controls Lawsuit</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Berkeley, California; San Francisco, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: licenses required 1993;
	suit filed February 1995;
	refusal to dismiss April 1996;
	ruling December 18, 1996 -->

<h1>Export Controls Ruled Unconstitutional</h1>

<p>The U.S. government considers
<a href="index.html">encryption technology</a> a munition,
placing it under the same export controls as bombs. These controls
have a strong chilling effect on academic freedom, requiring
researchers to register as international arms dealers and obtain
licenses in order to publish and discuss cryptographic research.
Penalties for violations include up to ten years in prison and up
to $1 million in fines.</p>

<p>In December 1996, a federal judge ruled current restrictions
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In 1993, University of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</a>
graduate student Daniel Bernstein was told by the State Department
that he could not publish his encryption program on the Internet
without a munitions license. In February 1995 Bernstein, along with the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,
sued the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing that export controls are
an unconsitutional prior restraint of speech.</p>

<p>The Justice Department requested that the suit be dismissed,
arguing that computer software code is not speech, and that the
courts do not have jurisdiction over national security. In April 1996,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a>, California U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel
refused, ruling that software code is speech and while the court cannot
address case-by-case rulings regarding national security it can address
broader issues. "This court can find no meaningful difference between
a computer language, and German or French," wrote Patel in her opinion.</p>

<p>In December 1996, Patel ruled that export restrictions then in place were
"an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment."
However, it is unclear whether the ruling allows encryption software to
be exported, or only a description of the algorithms. Further, since
it only applies to restrictions in effect at the time of the ruling,
the federal government may ignore the ruling and wait for another
challenge to slightly different rules that went into effect in January
1997.</p>

<p>Bernstein now teaches mathematics at the University of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illionois</a> at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>.</p>

<h1>The Story of PGP</h1>

<p>[Written on March 2nd, this is appearing in the April 1995, editions of
<cite>MicroTimes</cite>, with total circulation exceeding 230,000 in
California.]</p>

<p>(c)1995 <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/JimWarren.html">Jim Warren</a>.
Permission herewith granted to redistribute-in-full for any nonprofit use.</p>

<p> I write this today, March 2nd, because I envision the possibility of
somehow being enjoined from speaking or writing about this, by a federal
grand jury in San Jose, next Tuesday.</p>

<h2>Subpoena follows op-ed</h2>

<p>On Wednesday, February 22nd, an op-ed piece that I wrote appeared in the
San Jose <cite>Mercury News</cite>, captioned, "Encryption could stop computer
crackers." In the wake of massive Internet break-ins, I urged adopting
nationwide, standardized, by-default, end-to-end data-communications and
file encryption using the most-secure scrambling technologies that are
publicly known and published worldwide. I criticized the FBI and NSA
(National Security Agency) for zealously - and successfully - opposing all
such protection, thus seriously endangering innocent citizens and
law-abiding businesses.</p>

<p>On February 26th, a similar op-ed of mine appeared in the Sunday
edition of the combined San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> and San Francisco
<cite>Chronicle</cite>,
emphasizing the unnecessary danger and billions of dollars of losses
resulting from the government's preoccupation with protecting and
greatly-enhancing its eavesdropping capabilities.</p>

<p>Three days later, two U.S. Customs Special Agents appeared at my
home, unannounced, and soon handed me a federal grand jury subpoena. I am,
"commanded to appear and testify before the Grand Jury of the United States
District Court," on March 7th.</p>

<p> The subpoena was dated February 27th - the first workday after the Sunday
Examiner's op-ed piece.</p>

<p>Whoever said government is inefficient?</p>

<h2>Interview recording prohibited</h2>

<p>The agents - two pleasant, businesslike young women - said they were here
about <a href="/revolution/by_name/Z/PhilZimmermann.html">Phil Zimmermann</a>
 and his encryption software known as PGP, "Pretty Good Privacy."</p>

<p>I laughed and said, "Oh - okay, come on in," and led them up to my
office, grabbing a tape-recorder along the way.</p>

<p>I sat down and - prominently turning on the recorder - said,
without being confrontational, that I'd like to record the interview.</p>

<p>Woppps! - flag on the play. They said they would want to take a copy of the
tape with them when they left. That was fine with me, so I turned off my
recorder and went for a second recorder from my car.</p>

<p>Drat! - I wish I'd left the recorder running, because when I
returned, they had decided they needed approval from Assistant U.S.
Attorney Bill Keane, the AUSA in charge of investigating Zimmermann and
PGP.</p>

<p>They called Keane. He was out. They left a message, then said that
- in the absence of his approval - they would have to forego the interview,
and made motions to leave. I was curious about what they wanted, and it
occurred to me that I probably couldn't record my testimony before the
grand jury, anyway. So after some discussion, we agreed not to record. In
the process, they offered to allow me to copy their interview notes - which
I thought was a rather-neat show of good faith.</p>

<p>However, before we began, the senior agent looked at me with a
moment of clear hesitancy and suspicion, and asked several times that I
verify that our conversation was not being recorded. I did, pointing out
that it would be a criminal misdemeanor - in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> - if I recorded
them in this private place without their knowledge.</p>

<p>Part-way through the interview, Keane returned his agent's call. I
asked if he say why we couldn't record the interview, with both of us
having a tape. He said only that he didn't wish to have it done.</p>

<p>Apparently we citizens aren't the only ones who are paranoid.</p>

<h2>Realworld Big Brother</h2>

<p>The interview was relaxed, candid and cordial. The agents said they were
just seeking the facts of what actually happened - to wit:</p>

<p> On April 10, 1991, shortly after the Gulf War, a message from
WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL cascaded across the computer nets, warning
about one sentence in buried in a massive "anti-terrorism" bill authored by
Senators Biden and DeConcini. Their Senate Bill 266 declared, "It is the
sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and
manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall ensure
that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text
contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately
authorized by law."</p>

<p>Bill Murray, then a computer-security consultant to the NSA, wrote:</p>

<p>"The referenced language requires that manufacturers build
trap-doors into all cryptographic equipment and that providers of
confidential channels reserve to themselves, their agents, and assigns the
ability to read all traffic.</p>

<p>"Are there readers of this list that believe that it is possible
for manufacturers of crypto gear to include such a mechanism and also to
reserve its use to those "appropriately authorized by law" to employ it?</p>

<p>"Are there readers of this list who believe that providers of
electronic communications services can reserve to themselves the ability to
read all the traffic and still keep the traffic 'confidential' in any
meaningful sense?</p>

<p>"Is there anybody out there who would buy crypto gear or
confidential services from vendors who were subject to such a law?</p>

<p>"David Kahn asserts that the sovereign always attempts to reserve
the use of cryptography to himself.  Nonetheless, if this language were to
be enacted into law, it would represent a major departure. An earlier
Senate went to great pains to assure itself that there were no trapdoors in
the DES [federally-adopted Data Encryption Standard]. Mr. Biden and Mr.
DeConcini want to mandate them.</p>

<p>"The historical justification of such reservation has been
"national security;" just when that justification begins to wane, Mr. Biden
wants to use "law enforcement." Both justifications rest upon appeals to
fear.</p>

<p>"In the United States the people, not the Congress, are sovereign;
it should not be illegal for the people to have access to communications
that the government cannot read. We should be free from unreasonable search
and seizure; we should be free from self-incrimination.</p>

<p>"The government already has powerful tools of investigation at its
disposal; it has demonstrated precious little restraint in their use.</p>

<p>"Any assertion that all use of any such trap-doors would be only
"when appropriately authorized by law" is absurd on its face.  It is not
humanly possible to construct a mechanism that could meet that requirement;
any such mechanism would be subject to abuse.</p>

<p>"I suggest that you begin to stock up on crypto gear while you can
still get it."</p>

<p> The net went ballistic over this Orwellian mandate.</p>

<h2>PGP - Pretty Good Privacy</h2>

<p>Prior to this, <a href="/revolution/by_name/Z/PhilZimmermann.html">Phil
Zimmermann</a>, a sometime cryptographer and small computer
consultant near the University of Colorado in Boulder, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>, had been
developing a PC implementation of public-key encryption, as described in the
open literature, published worldwide more than a decade earlier. He had idle
thoughts of possibly making it available as shareware, perhaps for
educational purposes for fellow crypto hobbyists. He called it, "PGP" -
Pretty Good Privacy.</p>

<p>But public-key crypto using any reasonably-robust key-sizes is
reputed to be uncrackable. And intentionally building a back-door into a
beautiful crypto implementation is about like welding a tractor tire on the
back of a classic '63 Corvette - obscene!</p>

<p>

<p>Kelly Goen, located in the San Francisco Bay area, was also interested in
crypto. He and Zimmermann became acquainted - as is common among technoids
with similar interests. In that context, Zimmermann apparently gave Goen a
copy of PGP - also common behavior among us propeller-heads.</p>

<h2>S. 266 goads guerrilla crypto</h2>

<p>When Murray's message flashed across the nets, thousands of us were
infuriated - and frightened. In the wake of the Gulf War, S. 266 seemed
likely to become law, permanently prohibiting Americans from having the
privacy protection that technology could easily provide.</p>

<p>S. 266 would also prohibit PGP - at least in any respectable form.</p>

<p>So - with more than a little of the spirit of freedom that is the
heritage of all Americans - and the help citizens "stock up on crypto gear
while you still can," it was decided to make this privacy protection tool
available to everyone, immediately. Goen would upload copies - fully
annotated sources, binaries and documentation - to as many BBSs (bulletin
board systems) and host-computers around the United States as possible.
Zimmermann agreed - especially since S. 266 would soon outlaw PGP.</p>

<h2>A night-time call</h2>

<p>Goen sent email to <cite>MicroTimes</cite> on May 24th, saying, "the intent
here is to invalidate the socalled trap-door provision of the new senate bill
coming down the pike before it has a possibility of making it into law." He
said we could publish details about it, "provided of course mum is the word
until the code is actually flooded to the networks at large."</p>

<p>He also called me - as a <cite>MicroTimes</cite> columnist, and
probably because I had organized the recently-completed First Conference on
Computers, Freedom & Privacy, or maybe because of my comments on the net
critical of the S. 266 mandate.</p>

<p>I had several conversations with Goen, and later with Zimmermann -
who seemed more passive about the project. Now, four years after the fact, this
is re-constructed from random notes I took at the time, plus my recollections -
some of which remain quite vivid.</p>

<h2>D-Day, defending freedom</h2>

<p>On a weekend around the first of June, Goen began uploading complete PGP to
systems around the U.S. He called several times, telling me his progress.</p>

<p>He was driving around the Bay Area with a laptop, acoustic coupler
and a cellular phone. He would stop at a pay-phone; upload a number of
copies for a few minutes, then disconnect and rush off to another phone
miles away.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to get as many copies scattered as widely as
possible around the nation before the government could get an injunction
and stop him.</p>

<p> I thought he was being rather paranoid. In light of the following, perhaps
he was just being realistic.</p>

<h2>Government counter-attacks</h2>

<p>About two years after the PGP uploads, the government began threatening to
prosecute Zimmermann for illegal trafficking in munitions - cryptography.
[He was first visited by U.S. Customs agents on Feb. 17, 1993.]  For more
than two years, they have been investigating whether he "exported" PGP. It
appears at press-time that they will probably prosecute him.</P>

<p>The allegation seems to be that, since he permitted someone else -
over whom he had no control anyway - to upload PGP to some Internet hosts
inside the United States, Zimmermann thus exported this controlled
munition!</p>

<p>This ignores the fact that most of those same Internet hosts also
have DES crypto software from AT&T, Sun, SCO and BSD, part of their
standard domestic Unix systems. The DES is under the same export
prohibition as PGP. The same is true for RSA's public-key crypto tools that
reside on thousands of Internet hosts around the nation.</p>

<p>This bizarre lunacy also ignores that public-key was published,
worldwide, fifteen years ago, and is available from numerous foreign
software competitors including entrepreneurs in former Easter Bloc
countries - as is the DES.</p>

<p> Based on what they told me at the time and everything I've learned since
then:</p>

<p>Zimmermann never even uploaded PGP files for public access.</p>

<p>Goen studiously limited his uploads to U.S. systems, as permitted
by law and routinely done with identically-regulated AT&T and RSA software.</p>

<p>They certainly didn't care about exporting PGP. Hell, most of the
rest of the world already purchases public-key products from numerous
vendors except U.S. companies.</p>

<p> They did want to pre-empt S. 266 before it became law - just as millions of
people do all the time regarding all sorts of pending legislation. And the
offending mandate was later deleted from S. 266, anyway.</p>

<p>Zimmermann and Goen wanted to protect this nation's citizens. S. 266
wasn't threatening other nation's citizens; it was threatening Americans!</p>

<h2>Why the persecution?</h2>

<p>Some apologists say the government is just trying to clarify the law.
Bull!</p>

<p>If that's what they want, they should investigate and prosecute
AT&T or Sun or SCO or RSA. Each makes millions peddling systems to U.S.
Internet host-owners that include identically-controlled crypto modules,
particularly including RSA public-key packages that are at-least as
powerful as PGP.</p>

<p>But thugs don't pick on targets that can defend themselves. Goons
go for the frail and weak and helpless - like Phil Zimmermann.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a rogue prosecutor trying to make a name for himself. But
apparently Keane can't seek a grand jury indictment for this "crime"
without clearance from the Department of Justice in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a>.</p>

<p> Maybe it's just our government wasting thousands of staff hours and
millions of dollars to publicly flog Zimmermann as a lesson to any other
pissant citizen who dares to do what AT&T, Sun and RSA can do with
impunity.</p>

<p> This appears to be nothing less than an arrogant, oppressive government
using all of its might and all of its power to flail and torture one poor
citizen, to teach him that he is dirt and intimidate everyone else.</p>

<p> Is this what our nation has become?  Is this the America we want?</P>

<h2>Coincidental subpoena?</h2>

<p>As a footnote, I must say that my initial assumption was that the agents'
arrival two days after my op-ed piece appeared was simply coincidental -
that they were just-now getting around to tying-up loose ends of this
wasteful multi-year investigation. They said they were responding to a
letter I had sent to the grand jury a year or two earlier, when I first
heard they were investigating Zimmermann.</p>

<p>As I write this, and try to maintain some slight semblance of
reason, about half the time I think the timing was accidental - and half
the time I think I'm being naive.</p>

<h2>A frightening experience</h2>

<p>But I gotta tell ya, I awakened hours before dawn this morning, wondering
if somehow I was going to be the next victim of this governmental
obscenity. The government's stated policy is to attack opponents with
overpowering force. They are certainly doing that to Zimmermann.</p>

<p>I feel threatened and intimidated - and furious and outraged that
it should be happening in <em>my</em> nation, prosecuted by <em>my</em>
government.</p>

<p> I cry for what Phil Zimmermann must be going through. He had little
financial resources to begin with; this has already cost him, dearly. For
almost two years, he has been under the horrifying threat of wasting all of
his assets including his home, just to defend himself against the
outrageous abuse of a federal government that will go to any expense to
"win."</p>

<p>And if Zimmermann loses, he goes to prison for years of mandatory
incarceration. When he comes out, his young daughter will be a teen-ager.
All because he dared to write a cryptographic program that the government
couldn't crack, that someone else made available to U.S. citizens.</p>

<p> If there is any justice remaining in this nation, this screams out for
immediate redress!</p>

defense fund in care of his attorney, Phil DuBois, 2305 Broadway, Boulder

<h1>Feds Won't Prosecute PGP Creator</h1>

<p>January 11, 1996 public email message from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/Z/PhilZimmermann.html">Phil Zimmermann</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My lead defense lawyer, Phil Dubois, received a fax this morning from
the Assistant US Attorney in Northern District of California, William
Keane.  The letter informed us that I "will not be prosecuted in connection
with the posting to USENET in June 1991 of the encryption program
Pretty Good Privacy.  The investigation is closed."</p>

<p>This brings to a close a criminal investigation that has spanned the
last three years.  I'd like to thank all the people who helped us in
this case, especially all the donors to my legal defense fund. Apparently,
the money was well-spent.  And I'd like to thank my very capable defense
team:  Phil Dubois, Ken Bass, Eben Moglen, Curt Karnow, Tom Nolan, and 
Bob Corn-Revere.  Most of the time they spent on the case was pro-bono.  
I'd also like to thank Joe Burton, counsel for the co-defendant.</p>

<p>There are many others I can thank, but I don't have the presence of mind
to list them all here at this moment.  The medium of email cannot express

<title>Clipper Chip Announcement</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: April 16, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>White House Announces Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>THE WHITE HOUSE<br>
Office of the Press Secretary<br>
For Immediate Release, April 16, 1993<br>
STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY<br></p>

<p> The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.</p>

<p> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.</p>

<p> For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.</p>

<p> Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.</p>

<p> A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.</p>

<p> This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. </p>

<p> A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the
"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique
"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.</p>

<p> The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.</p>

<p> To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.</p>

<p> The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;</p>
<li><p>the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
calls and data, under proper court or other legal
order, when necessary to protect our citizens;</p>
<li><p>the effective and timely use of the most modern
technology to build the National Information
Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
the competitiveness of American industry in the global
marketplace; and </p>
<li><p>the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
high technology products.</p>
</ul>

<p> The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.</p>

<p> The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.</p>

<p> Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.</p>

<p> Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.  </p>

<p> For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of
Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Q & A</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: from press release April 16, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The White House's Clipper Chip Q & A</h1>

<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE</p>

<p> Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?</p>

<p> A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.</p>

<p> Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?</p>

<p> A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.</p>

<p> Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?</p>

<p> A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.</p>

<p> Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  </p>

<p> A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.</p>

<p> Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?</p>

<p> A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.</p>

<p> Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?</p>

<p> A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.</p>

<p> Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?</p>

<p> A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.</p>

<p> Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?</p>

<p> A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>, and will
sell the chip to encryption device
manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
to other vendors in the future.</p>

<p> Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? </p>

<p> A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.</p>

<p> Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?</p>

<p> A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.</p>

<p> The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.</p>

<p> Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  </p>

<p> A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.</p>

<p> Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?</p>

<p> A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Critique</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: chip announced April 16, 1993 -->

<body>

<h1>Critique of the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p> April 1993 letter from Sameer Parekh (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:zane@genesis.mcs.com">zane@genesis.mcs.com</a>):</p>

<p>The Clinton administration on Friday unveiled their plan for
establishing a standard data encryption system for voice communications.
President Clinton says that he wants to bring the United States
into the twenty-first century. This proposal is bringing us to 1984. I
will mention first the technical reasons why the system is inadequate.</P>

<p>The encryption algorithim is classified; only a select group of
people will be allowed to examine the algorithim for flaws. The members
of the cryptographic community continually and persistently emphasize
that the only way to ensure security in a cryptographic system is to
have as many people as possible analyze and try to break it for as long
as possible. A system which has been examined by a small segment of the
population should not be trusted.</p>

<p> Release of the algorithim is crucial to verification of a good
encryption method. The earlier Data Encryption Standard (DES) for data
storage encryption was a very strong standard; the academic world
examined it and after a number of months found weaknesses, spawning the
now-standard "triple-DES" system which is more secure.</p>

<p> From what little is known about the encryption system, it
appears to be a weak system. Such a weak system lends itself to
easy decryption by an unauthorized party. It would lend a false sense of
security to laypersons in the field who do not realize that a key of
such simplicity could be cracked easily by any talented criminal. The
necessarily secure communications between a doctor and his patient could
be thus breached. If the system were strong, the government would use it
for internal use, but according to the AT&T release, the government will
not be using the same chip which is marketed to consumers.</p>

<p>Apart from the technical flaws in the system, there are many
political problems with this big brother proposal. First, there is the
assumption that the government has a right to spy on its own citizens.
The proposal for this wiretap chip includes the registration of keys
with two escrow agencies.  This proposal is purported to allow law
enforcement to keep track of "terrorists" and "drug-dealers." The first
flaw in this key-escrow system is that no self-respecting criminal will
use a cryptography system which can be easily tapped by law enforcement
officials -- they will use strong cryptography. The only people who
may end up using the wiretap encryption system will be law-abiding
laypeople who don't fully understand cryptography. (Law-abiding citizens
who do understand cryptography will use strong cryptography to preserve
their privacy from a talented criminal.) </p>

<p> The proposal states that in order to obtain the key of a wiretap
chip user a law enforcement agency must first establish that they have a
valid interest in the key. Translated out of legalese, that means that
all a government agency will have to do to get access to all of the
private communications, for example, between a lawyer and her client
will be to fill out the necessary forms. Registering cryptographic keys
with the government is similar to giving the IRS the keys to your house
and filing cabinet. A criminal who wants access to the communications
between a priest and confessor needs only to find a corrupt judge.</p>

<p> The chip is being manufactured exclusively by one company. The
release stated that the Attorney shall request (i.e. coerce)
telecommunication product manufacturers to use this product.  This
aspect of the system is a government-mandated monopoly. Such monopolies
result in high prices and the elimination of market forces which drive
the improvement of technology. (One needs only look at the state of the
Soviet Union to see how the lack of market forces affects consumer
technology.)</p>

<p> The system exposes our President's hypocrisy because of his
campaign promise to protect womens' rights to privacy and that he will
see a Supreme Court nominee who believes that the Bill of Rights
guarantees a right to privacy. By mandating a weak cryptosystem he is
reneging on his promise to provide privacy rights to the nation's
citizenry. If Clinton supported a right to privacy to limit government
interference with regards to abortions, he must limit government
interference with regards to communication.</p>

<p> Another element of Clinton's hypocrisy lies in his promise to
reduce the budget deficit. By introducing additional responsibilities
for government agencies (keeping track of the millions of keys
registered in escrow) he is only using our tax dollars to invade our
privacy, tax dollars which are better spent lowering the budget deficit.</p>

<p> What I fear most from the proposal is that if the wiretap chip
becomes the standard, strong cryptography will be declared illegal. If
such is the case, then only criminals will have access to strong
cryptography. As I have stated above -- the wiretap chip will not be used
by criminals because of the obvious flaws in the crypto-system --
criminals will use strong crypto, while law-abiding citizens will have
to use a system which can be easily defeated by any criminal.</p>

<p> Strong cryptography already exists for data communications, for
<em>free</em>. Strong cryptography for voice communications for free is only
a few months away for people who own a personal computer. There is no
way that making strong cryptography illegal will stop it -- it will only
turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Petition</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: early 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Electronic Petition to Stop the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>In response to the White House's Clipper chip proposal, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/CPSR.html">Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility</a> (CPSR) organized an electronic
petition to urge Clinton to withdraw the proposal.</p>

<p>Petition "signers" sent a message to Clipper.petition@cpsr.org with the
message "I oppose Clipper."</p>

<p>CPSR maintains <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://cpsr.org/dox/clipper.html">more information about Clipper</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The CPSR Petition</h2>

<p>The President<br>
The White House<br>
Washington, DC  20500<br></p>

<p> Dear Mr. President:</p>

<p> We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed encryption
proposal now under consideration by the White House.  We wish to
express our concern about this plan and similar technical standards
that may be proposed for the nation's communications infrastructure.</p>

<p> The current proposal was developed in secret by federal agencies
primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not privacy
protection.  Critical aspects of the plan remain classified and thus
beyond public review.</p>

<p> The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for comments conducted
by the Department of Commerce last year, less than a handful of
respondents supported the plan.  Several hundred opposed it.</p>

<p> If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
new products will face extensive government obstacles. Cryptographers
who wish to develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be
discouraged.  Citizens who anticipate that the progress of technology
will enhance personal privacy will find their expectations
unfulfilled.</p>

<p> Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary basis
and suggest that other technical approaches will remain viable.  The
government, however, exerts enormous influence in the marketplace, and
the likelihood that competing standards would survive is small.  Few
in the user community believe that the proposal would be truly
voluntary.</p>

<p> The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that if
this proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on a
voluntary basis, privacy protection will be diminished, innovation
will be slowed, government accountability will be lessened, and the
openness necessary to ensure the successful development of the
nation's communications infrastructure will be threatened.</p>

<p> We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper
proposal.</p>

<title>EFF Fights Clipper Chip</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>EFF Opposes Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electonic Frontier
Foundation</a> (EFF) opposed the Clinton administration's
Clipper Chip proposal by supporting Rep. Maria Cantwell's bill, <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.eff.org/ftp/eff/Legislation/Bills_by_sponsor/cantwell_hr3627.bill">H.R.
3627</a>, to liberalize control of encryption technology.</p>

<p>Supporters on the net could send e-mail to cantwell@eff.org with the subject "I
support HR 3627" and a body expressing reasons for such support. EFF printed
out the messages and gave them to Rep. Cantwell. The Cantwell bill was never
passed, and Cantwell lost her re-election bid in 1994.</p>

<p>From a February 1994 message by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/JerryBerman.html">Jerry Berman</a>,
Executive Director of EFF:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Administration announced that it
plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip encryption scheme
a national standard, and to discourage the development and sale of
alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the government succeeds
in this effort, the resulting blow to individual freedom and privacy could
be immeasurable ...</p>

<p> Rep. Cantwell introduced H.R. 3627 in the House of Representatives on
November 22, 1993.  H.R. 3627 would amend the Export Control Act to move
authority over the export of nonmilitary software with encryption
capabilities from the Secretary of State (where the intelligence community
traditionally has stalled such exports) to the Secretary of Commerce. The
bill would also invalidate the current license requirements for
nonmilitary software containing encryption capablities, unless there is
substantial evidence that the software will be diverted, modified or
re-exported to a military or terroristic end-use ...</p>

<p> We've been fighting Clipper Chip and Digital Telephony in the policy arena
and will continue to do so. But there's another way to fight those
initiatives, and that's to make sure that powerful alternative encryption
technologies are in the hands of any citizen who wants to use them. The
government hopes that, by pushing the Clipper Chip in every way short of
explicitly banning alternative technologies, it can limit your choices for
secure communications.</p>

<title>Safire Criticizes Clipper Chip</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 14, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Sink the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>Columnist William Safire attacked the Clipper Chip in the February 14,
1994 <cite>New York Times</cite> ("Sink the Clipper Chip").</p>

<p>Safire criticized law enforcement and intelligence officials for using
outdated thinking towards new technology. Safire pointed out that the proposal
would miss its target because "no self-respecting vice overlord or terrorist
or local drug-runner would buy or use clipper-chipped American
telecommunications equipment."</p>

<p>Safire criticized the proposal for violating privacy: "In effect, its
proposal demands we turn over to Washington a duplicate set of keys to our
homes, formerly our castles, where not even the king in olden times could
go."</p>

<p>Safire continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of individual 
liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a judge 
rubber-stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone, everything we 
write on a computer, every order we give to a shopping network or bank 
or 800 or 900 number, every electronic note we leave our spouses or 
dictate to our personal-digit-assistant genies.</p>

<p>Add to that stack of intimate data the medical information derived from 
the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all carry. 
Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available from all
our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test scores. 
Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce proceedings, 
welfare records, field investigations for job applications, raw files 
and C.I.A.  dossiers available to the Feds, and you have the individual citizen
standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat.</p>

<h1>Jackboots on the Infobahn</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/B/JohnBarlow.html">John Perry Barlow</a></p>

<p>[Note: The following article will appear in the April 1994 issue of
<cite>Wired</cite>.  We, the editors of <cite>Wired</cite>, are net-casting it
now in its pre-published form  as a public service. Because of the vital and
urgent nature of its message, we believe readers on the Net should hear and
take action now. You are free to pass this article on electronically; in fact
we urge you to replicate it throughout the net with our blessings. If you do,
please keep the copyright statements and this note intact. For a complete
listing of Clipper-related resources available through WIRED Online, send email
to <img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:infobot@wired.com">infobot@wired.com</a> with the following
message: "send clipper.index". - The Editors of <cite>Wired</cite>]</p>

<p>On January 11, I managed to schmooze myself aboard Air Force 2. It was 
flying out of LA, where its principal passenger had just outlined his 
vision of the information superhighway to a suited mob of television,
show-biz, and cable types who  fervently hoped to own it one day - if they
could ever figure out what the hell it was.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
 the speech had 
been wildly encouraging. The administration's program, as announced by Vice 
President Al Gore, incorporated many of the concepts of open competition, 
universal access, and  deregulated common carriage that we'd been pushing 
for the previous year.</p>

<p> But he had said nothing about the future of privacy, except to cite among 
the bounties of the NII its ability to "help law enforcement agencies 
thwart criminals and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications 
to commit crimes."</p>

<p> On the plane I asked Gore what this implied about administration policy on 
cryptography. He became as noncommittal as a cigar-store Indian. "We'll be 
making some announcements.... I can't tell you anything more." He hurried 
to the front of the  plane, leaving me to troubled speculation.</p>

<p> Despite its fundamental role in assuring privacy, transaction security, and 
reliable identity within the NII, the Clinton administration has not 
demonstrated an enlightenment about cryptography up to par with the rest of 
its digital vision.</p>

<p> The Clipper Chip - which threatens to be either the goofiest waste of 
federal dollars since President Gerald Ford's great Swine Flu program or, 
if actually deployed, a surveillance technology of profound malignancy - 
seemed at first an ugly legacy  of the Reagan-Bush modus operandi. "This is 
going to be our Bay of Pigs," one Clinton White House official told me at 
the time Clipper was introduced, referring to the disastrous plan to invade 
Cuba that Kennedy inherited from Eisenhower.</P>

<p> (Clipper, in case you're just tuning in, is an encryption chip that the 
National Security Agency and FBI hope will someday be in every phone and 
computer in America. It scrambles your communications, making them 
unintelligible to all but their  intended recipients. All, that is, but the 
government, which would hold the "key" to your chip. The key would 
separated into two pieces, held in escrow, and joined with the appropriate 
"legal authority.")</p>

<p> Of course, trusting the government with your privacy is like having a 
Peeping Tom install your window blinds. And, since the folks I've met in 
this White House seem like extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers - 
hell, a lot of them are Deadheads -  I was sure that after they were fully 
moved in, they'd face down the National Security Agency and the FBI, let 
Clipper die a natural death, and lower the export embargo on reliable 
encryption products.</P>

<p> Furthermore, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the 
National Security Council have been studying both Clipper and export 
embargoes since April. Given that the volumes of expert testimony they had 
collected overwhelmingly opposed  both, I expected the final report would 
give the administration all the support it needed to do the right thing.</p>

<p> I was wrong. Instead, there would be no report. Apparently, they couldn't 
draft one that supported, on the evidence, what they had decided to do 
instead.</p>

<h2>The Other Shoe Drops</h2>

<p> On Friday, February 4, the other jackboot dropped. A series of 
announcements from the administration made it clear that cryptography would 
become their very own "<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnia</a>
of telecommunications" (as one staffer put 
it). It wasn't just that the old  Serbs in the National Security Agency and 
the FBI were still making the calls. The alarming new reality was that the 
invertebrates in the White House were only too happy to abide by them. 
Anything to avoid appearing soft on drugs or terrorism.</p.

<p> So, rather than ditching Clipper, they declared it a Federal Data 
Processing Standard, backing that up with an immediate government order for 
50,000 Clipper devices. They appointed the National Institutes of Standards 
and Technology and the  Department of Treasury as the "trusted" third 
parties that would hold the Clipper key pairs. (Treasury, by the way, is 
also home to such trustworthy agencies as the Secret Service and the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.)</p>

<p> They reaffirmed the export embargo on robust encryption products, admitting 
for the first time that its purpose was to stifle competition to Clipper. 
And they outlined a very porous set of requirements under which the cops 
might get the keys to your  chip. (They would not go into the procedure by 
which the National Security Agency could get them, though they assured us 
it was sufficient.)</p>

<p> They even signaled the impending return of the dread Digital Telephony, an 
FBI legislative initiative requiring fundamental reengineering of the 
information infrastructure; providing wiretapping ability to the FBI would 
then become the paramount  design priority.</p>

<h2>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</h2>

<p> Actually, by the time the announcements thudded down, I wasn't surprised by 
them. I had spent several days the previous week in and around the White 
House.</p>

<p> I felt like I was in another remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
My friends in the administration had been transformed. They'd been subsumed 
by the vast mindfield on the other side of the security clearance membrane, 
where dwell the  monstrous bureaucratic organisms that feed on fear. They'd 
been infected by the institutionally paranoid National Security Agency's 
Weltanschauung.</p>

<p> They used all the telltale phrases. Mike Nelson, the White House point man 
on the NII, told me, "If only I could tell you what I know, you'd feel the 
same way I do." I told him I'd been inoculated against that argument during 
Vietnam. (And it does  seem to me that if you're going to initiate a 
process that might end freedom in America, you probably need an argument 
that isn't classified.)</p>

<p> Besides, how does he know what he knows? Where does he get his information? 
Why, the National Security Agency, of course. Which, given its strong 
interest in the outcome, seems hardly an unimpeachable source.</p>

<p> However they reached it, Clinton and Gore have an astonishingly simple 
bottom line, to which even the future of American liberty and prosperity is 
secondary: They believe that it is their responsibility to eliminate, by 
whatever means, the  possibility that some terrorist might get a nuke and 
use it on, say, the World Trade Center. They have been convinced that such 
plots are more likely to ripen to hideous fruition behind a shield of 
encryption.</p>

<p> The staffers I talked to were unmoved by the argument that anyone smart 
enough to steal a nuclear device is probably smart enough to use PGP or 
some other uncompromised crypto standard. And never mind that the last 
people who popped a hooter in the  World Trade Center were able to get it 
there without using any cryptography and while under FBI surveillance.</p>

<p> We are dealing with religion here. Though only ten American lives have been 
lost to terrorism in the last two years, the primacy of this threat has 
become as much an article of faith with these guys as the Catholic 
conviction that human life begins  at conception or the Mormon belief that 
the Lost Tribe of Israel crossed the Atlantic in submarines.</p>

<p> In the spirit of openness and compromise, they invited the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation to submit other solutions to the "problem" of the 
nuclear-enabled terrorist than key escrow devices, but they would not admit 
into discussion the argument that  such a threat might, in fact, be some 
kind of phantasm created by the spooks to ensure their lavish budgets into 
the post-Cold War era.</p>

<p> As to the possibility that good old-fashioned investigative techniques 
might be more valuable in preventing their show-case catastrophe (as it was 
after the fact in finding the alleged perpetrators of the last attack on 
the World Trade Center), they  just hunkered down and said that when 
wiretaps were necessary, they were damned well necessary.</p>

<p> When I asked about the business that American companies lose because of 
their inability to export good encryption products, one staffer essentially 
dismissed the market, saying that total world trade in crypto goods was 
still less than a billion  dollars. (Well, right. Thanks more to the 
diligent efforts of the National Security Agency than to dim sales 
potential.)</p>

<p> I suggested that a more immediate and costly real-world effect of their 
policies would be to reduce national security by isolating American 
commerce, owing to a lack of international confidence in the security of 
our data lines. I said that Bruce  Sterling's fictional data-enclaves in 
places like the Turks and Caicos Islands were starting to look real-world 
inevitable.</p>

<p> They had a couple of answers to this, one unsatisfying and the other scary. 
The unsatisfying answer was that the international banking community could 
just go on using DES, which still seemed robust enough to them. (DES is the 
old federal Data  Encryption Standard, thought by most cryptologists to be 
nearing the end of its credibility.)</p>

<p> More frightening was their willingness to counter the data-enclave future 
with one in which no data channels anywhere would be secure from 
examination by one government or another. Pointing to unnamed other 
countries that were developing their own  mandatory standards and 
restrictions regarding cryptography, they said words to the effect of, 
"Hey, it's not like you can't outlaw the stuff. Look at <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">France</a>."</p>

<p> Of course, they have also said repeatedly - and for now I believe them - 
that they have absolutely no plans to outlaw non-Clipper crypto in the US. 
But that doesn't mean that such plans wouldn't develop in the presence of 
some pending "emergency."  Then there is that White House briefing 
document, issued at the time Clipper was first announced, which asserts 
that no US citizen "as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable 
commercial encryption product."</p>

<p> Now why, if it's an ability they have no intention of contesting, do they 
feel compelled to declare that it's not a right? Could it be that they are 
preparing us for the laws they'll pass after some bearded fanatic has 
gotten himself a surplus nuke  and used something besides Clipper to 
conceal his plans for it?</p>

<p> If they are thinking about such an eventuality, we should be doing so as 
well. How will we respond? I believe there is a strong, though currently 
untested, argument that outlawing unregulated crypto would violate the 
First Amendment, which surely  protects the manner of our speech as clearly 
as it protects the content.</p>

<p> But of course the First Amendment is, like the rest of the Constitution, 
only as good as the government's willingness to uphold it. And they are, as 
I say, in the mood to protect our safety over our liberty.</p>

<p> This is not a mind-frame against which any argument is going to be very 
effective. And it appeared that they had already heard and rejected every 
argument I could possibly offer.</p>

<p> In fact, when I drew what I thought was an original comparison between 
their stand against naturally proliferating crypto and the folly of King 
Canute (who placed his throne on the beach and commanded the tide to leave 
him dry), my government  opposition looked pained and said he had heard 
that one almost as often as jokes about roadkill on the information 
superhighway.</p>

<p> I hate to go to war with them. War is always nastier among friends. 
Furthermore, unless they've decided to let the National Security Agency 
design the rest of the National Information Infrastructure as well, we need 
to go on working closely with  them on the whole range of issues like 
access, competition, workplace privacy, common carriage, intellectual 
property, and such. Besides, the proliferation of strong crypto will 
probably happen eventually no matter what they do.</P>

<p> But then again, it might not. In which case we could shortly find ourselves 
under a government that would have the automated ability to log the time, 
origin and recipient of every call we made, could track our physical 
whereabouts continuously,  could keep better account of our financial 
transactions than we do, and all without a warrant. Talk about crime 
prevention!</p>

<p> Worse, under some vaguely defined and surely mutable "legal authority," 
they also would be able to listen to our calls and read our e-mail without 
having to do any backyard rewiring. They wouldn't need any permission at 
all to monitor overseas calls.</p>

<p> If there's going to be a fight, I'd rather it be with this government than 
the one we'd likely face on that hard day.</p>

<p> Hey, I've never been a paranoid before. It's always seemed to me that most 
governments are too incompetent to keep a good plot strung together all the 
way from coffee break to quitting time. But I am now very nervous about the 
government of the  United States of America.</p>

<p> Because Bill 'n' Al, whatever their other new-paradigm virtues, have 
allowed the very old-paradigm trogs of the Guardian Class to define as 
their highest duty the defense of America against an enemy that exists 
primarily in the imagination - and is  therefore capable of anything.</p>

<p> To assure absolute safety against such an enemy, there is no limit to the 
liberties we will eventually be asked to sacrifice. And, with a Clipper 
Chip in every phone, there will certainly be no technical limit on their 
ability to enforce those  sacrifices.</p>

<h2>Get Congress to Lift the Crypto Embargo</h2>

<p> The administration is trying to impose Clipper on us by manipulating market 
forces. By purchasing massive numbers of Clipper devices, they intend to 
induce an economy of scale which will make them cheap while the export 
embargo renders all  competition either expensive or nonexistent.</p>

<p> We have to use the market to fight back. While it's unlikely that they'll 
back down on Clipper deployment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
believes that with sufficient public involvement, we can get Congress to 
eliminate the export embargo.</p>

<p> Rep. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, has a bill (H.R. 3627) before the 
Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee 
on Foreign Affairs that would do exactly that. She will need a lot of help 
from the public. They may not  care much about your privacy in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">DC</a>, but they 
still care about your vote.</p>

<p> Please signal your support of H.R. 3627, either by writing her directly or 
e-mailing her at cantwell@eff.org. Messages sent to that address will be 
printed out and delivered to her office. In the subject header of your 
message, please include the  words "support HR 3627." In the body of your 
message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. You may also express 
your sentiments to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, the House Committee on 
Foreign Affairs chair, by e-mailing hamilton@eff.org.</p>

<p> Furthermore, since there is nothing quite as powerful as a letter from a 
constituent, you should check the following list of subcommittee and 
committee members to see if your congressional representative is among 
them. If so, please copy them your  letter to Rep. Cantwell.</p>

<p> Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee:</p>

<p> Democrats: Sam Gejdenson (Chair), D-Connecticut; James Oberstar, D-
Minnesota; Cynthia McKinney, D-Georgia; Maria Cantwell, D-Washington; Eric

York; Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Ed Royce, R-California.</p>

<p> BOYCOTT CLIPPER DEVICES AND THE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE THEM.</p>

<p> Don't buy anything with a Clipper Chip in it. Don't buy any product from a 
company that manufactures devices with Big Brother inside. It is likely 
that the government will ask you to use Clipper for communications with the 
IRS or when doing business  with federal agencies. They cannot, as yet, 
require you to do so. Just say no.</p>

<p> LEARN ABOUT ENCRYPTION AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES TO YOUR UNWIRED FRIENDS</p>

<p> The administration is banking on the likelihood that this stuff is too 
technically obscure to agitate anyone but nerds like us. Prove them wrong 
by patiently explaining what's going on to all the people you know who have 
never touched a computer and  glaze over at the mention of words like 
"cryptography."</p>

<p> Maybe you glaze over yourself. Don't. It's not that hard. For some hands-on 
experience, download a copy of PGP - Pretty Good Privacy - a shareware 
encryption engine which uses the robust RSA encryption algorithm. And learn 
to use it.</p>

<p> GET YOUR COMPANY TO THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING REAL CRYPTOGRAPHY IN ITS PRODUCTS</P>

<p> If you work for a company that makes software, computer hardware, or any 
kind of communications device, work from within to get them to incorporate 
RSA or some other strong encryption scheme into their products. If they say 
that they are afraid to  violate the export embargo, ask them to consider 
manufacturing such products overseas and importing them back into the 
United States. There appears to be no law against that. Yet.</p>

<p> You might also lobby your company to join the Digital Privacy and Security 
Working Group, a coalition of companies and public interest groups - 
including IBM, Apple, Sun, Microsoft, and, interestingly, Clipper phone 
manufacturer AT&T - that is  working to get the embargo lifted.</p>

<p> ENLIST!</p>

<p> Self-serving as it sounds coming from me, you can do a lot to help by 
becoming a member of one of these organizations. In addition to giving you 
access to the latest information on this subject, every additional member 
strengthens our credibility  with Congress.</P>

<p> Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation by writing membership@eff.org.</p>

<p> Join <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CPSR.html">Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility</a> by e-mailing cpsr.info@cpsr.org. CPSR is also
organizing a protest, to which you can
lend your support by sending e-mail to clipper.petition@cpsr.org with
"I oppose Clipper" in the message body. Ftp/gopher/WAIS to cpsr.org

<p> In his LA speech, Gore called the development of the NII "a revolution." 
And it is a revolutionary war we are engaged in here. Clipper is a last 
ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old 
Industrial Era, to establish  imperial control over cyberspace. If they 
win, the most liberating development in the history of humankind could 
become, instead, the surveillance system which will monitor our 
grandchildren's morality. We can be better ancestors than that.</p>

<title>White House Backs Clipper Chip</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 14, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>White House Maintains Support For Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>From the February 14, 1994 <cite>Newsbytes</cite>:</p>

<p> The Administration is trying to back away from remarks by Vice President Al
Gore which might indicate it's retreating from a plan to use "Clipper Chip"
encryption.</p>

<p>... Gore's remarks, made at a National Information Infrastructure Advisory
Committee meeting, which advises the President on the Information
Superhighway, were quickly passed around the Internet, where some interpreted
them as meaning the Administration is seeking a face-saving way out of the
controversy. But Lorraine Voles, a Gore spokeswoman, denied this to
Newsbytes: "He's not off the reservation at all," with the Clipper Chip. "All
the Vice President was trying to do was say we'd look at better ways to do
it," declining to elaborate further.</p>

<p> That could mean offering the decryption keys to different agencies, but
that's unlikely to satisfy opponents ...</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Flaws</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: June 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Flaws in the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>From p. 60 of the June 13, 1994 <cite>Newsweek</cite>:</p>

<p> ...  The Clipper chip, after all, was invented by the
same government whose space satellite vanished on route to Mars and who
can't delete dead men from its computerized Social Security rolls.  Now
computer scientist Matthew Blaze, 32, of AT&T Bell Labs has found that
Clipper is flawed, too ...</p>

<p> The flaw, finds Blaze, lies in how the encryption system begins a
transmission.  Say a person computer contains the souped-up version of
the Clipper chip on the Tessera card, which fits laptops and many PCs.
Before the computer sends encrypted e-mail, it transmits a 128-bit
string that includes the serial number of its encryption device, a
number identifying which of myriad codes is being used, and digits that
check the first two.  Together, these strings are the chip's LEAF (Law
Enforcement Access Field) .  The receiving computer must recognize the LEAF as
valid before it can decode the message.  The LEAF also tells an
authorized wiretapper which key it needs to decrypt the subsequent
messages.  (Two federal agencies hold the keys to Clipper codes, and
release them only to law-enforcement officials with a court order for a
cybertap.)  Armed with the key, agents easily unscramble the message.
But, Blaze explains in the draft of a paper obtained by Newsweek,
someone who wants to foil eavesdroppers could transmit a rogue LEAF.
When the FBI used the LEAF to retrieve the key to the code, it would
come up with the wrong one.  It would, to be simplistic, substitute A
for 1 and B for 2, when in fact the code used Z for 1 and Y for 2.  The
"decoded" message would be gibberish.</P.

<p> Even the NSA agrees with Blaze's analysis.  But it emphasizes that the
flaw does not apply, for technical reasons, to voice, fax and low-speed
data transmissions.  Blaze's discovery "in no way reduce[s] the chip's
inherent security," said the NSA in a rare statement.  It affects only
computer-to-computer, e-mail encryption -- which is, nevertheless, a big
share of what the government wants to be able to tap.  Also, the NSA
argues that generating rogue LEAFs is "not practical in real-world
applications."  But in fact the process would take, on average, only
half an hour, so anyone with patience and the ability to download a
rogue-LEAF software program could do it, says AT&T security specialist
David Maher.  But there is a greater worry.  "What else might we find,"
asks IBM's Mark Holcomb, "if we were allowed to examine" the encryption
code itself?  NSA has kept it secret, telling industry that it can't be
cracked -- trust us.  After Blaze's discovery, that's going to be a lot
harder to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've lost the author and date of the following response:</p>

<p>Presumably, Clipper cannot distinguish between a data stream that
actually represents audio data, and a stream that has already been
pre-encoded.  The result is that the Clipper-processed data stream would
look like a valid sequence of data.  And, in fact, it <em>would be</em> valid.
The only problem is, the government would, at best, only be able to
decrypt the outermost code. This destroys the utility of Clipper
(from the standpoint of the NSA) not only for "high speed and e-mail
encryption, but also for the kinds of low speed data (voice, fax) that
Blaze's new technique is not claimed to work for.</p>

<p>We should not be complacent, however.  Clipper, if it does nothing else
bad, is bad because it <em>identifies</em> the source of a particular data
stream.  To an organization like the NSA, that is <em>extraordinarily</em>
valuable information, even if the data can't be decoded.  What they
really want is for cellular telephones and PCS's (Personal Communication
System) to identify themselves, so that they can trace users.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Retreat</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: July 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>White House Tones Down Clipper Chip Proposal</h1>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/StantonMcCandlish.html">
Stanton McCandlish</a>:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Clinton Administration announced that it is taking several
large, quick steps back in its efforts to push EES or Clipper
encryption technology.  Vice-President Gore stated in a letter to
Rep. Maria Cantwell, whose encryption export legislation is today being
debated on the House floor, that EES is being limited to voice
communications only.</p>

<p>The EES (Escrowed Encryption Standard using the Skipjack algorithm, and
including the Clipper and Capstone microchips) is a Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) designed by the National Security Agency, and
approved, despite a stunningly high percentage anti-EES public comments on
the proposal, by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Since
the very day of the announcement of Clipper in 1993, public outcry against
the key "escrow" system has been strong, unwavering and growing rapidly.</p>

<p>What's changed?  The most immediate alteration in the White House's
previously hardline path is an expressed willingness to abandon the EES
for computer applications (the Capstone chip and Tessera card), and push
for its deployment only in telephone technology (Clipper).  The most
immediate effect this will have is a reduction in the threat to the
encryption software market that Skipjack/EES plans posed.  </p>

<p>Additionally, Gore's letter indicates that deployment for even the telephone
application of Clipper has been put off for months of studies, perhaps
partly in response to a draft bill from Sens. Patrick Leahy and Ernest
Hollings that would block appropriation for EES development until many
detailed conditions had been met.</p>

<p>And according to observers such as Brock Meeks (Cyberwire Dispatch) and
Mark Voorhees (Voorhees Reports/Information Law Alert), even Clipper is
headed for a fall, due to a variety of factors including failure in
attempts to get other countries to adopt the scheme, at least one state
bill banning use of EES for medical records, loss of NSA credibility after
a <a href="flaws.html">flaw in the "escrowed" key system</a> was discovered
by Dr. Matt Blaze of Bell Labs, a patent infringement lawsuit threat (dealt
with by buying off the claimant), condemnation of the scheme by a former
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> Defense
Minister, world wide opposition to Clipper and the
presumptions behind it, skeptical back-to-back House and Senate hearings on
the details of the Administration's plan, and pointed questions from lawmakers
regarding monopolism and accountability.</p>

<p>[<b>Revolution</b> note: Politicians are sneakier than McCandlish gives
them credit for.  Opportunists used the 1995 <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> federal building
bombing to rush through a Counter-Terrorism Bill that included funding for
Clipper.]</p>

<p>One of the most signigicant concessions in the letter is that upcoming
encryption standards will be "voluntary," unclassified, and exportable,
according to Gore, who also says there will be no moves to tighten export
controls.</p>

<p>[<b>Revolution</b> note: FBI Director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a> later said he
would seek
a ban on other forms of encryption if criminals don't use Clipper. Since few
criminals would be so foolish as to use Clipper, you can bet on an attempted
encryption ban.]</p>

<p>Though Gore hints at private, rather than governmental, key "escrow," the
Administration does still maintain that key "escrow" is an important part of
its future cryptography policy.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">EFF</a> would like to extend
thanks to all who've participated in our online
campaigns to sink Clipper.  This retreat on the part of the Executive
Branch is due not just to discussions with Congresspersons, or letters
from industry leaders, but in large measure to the overwhelming response from
users of computer-mediated communication - members of virtual communities
who stand a lot to gain or lose by the outcome of the interrelated
cryptography debates.  Your participation and activism has played a key
role, if not the key role, in the outcome thus far, and will be vitally
important to the end game!</p>

<p>Below is the public letter sent from VP Gore to Rep. Cantwell.</p>

<hr>

<p>July 20, 1994<br>
The Honorable Maria Cantwell<br>
House of Representatives<br>
Washington, D.C.,  20515<br></p>

<p> Dear Representative Cantwell:</p>

<p> I write to express my sincere appreciation for your efforts to move
the national debate forward on the issue of information security and export
controls.  I share your strong conviction for the need to develop a
comprehensive policy regarding encryption, incorporating an export policy
that does not disadvantage American software companies in world markets
while preserving our law enforcement and national security goals.</p>

<p> As you know, the Administration disagrees with you on the extent to
which existing controls are harming U.S. industry in the short run and the
extent to which their immediate relaxation would affect national security. 
For that reason we have supported a five-month Presidential study.  In
conducting this study, I want to assure you that the Administration will
use the best available resources of the federal government.  This will
include the active participation of the National Economic Council and the
Department of Commerce.  In addition, consistent with the Senate-passed
language, the first study will be completed within 150 days of passage of
the Export Administration Act reauthorization bill, with the second study
to be completed within one year after the completion of the first.  I want
to personally assure you that we will reassess our existing export controls
based on the results of these studies.  Moreover, all programs with
encryption that can be exported today will continue to be exportable.</p>

<p> On the other hand, we agree that we need to take action this year
to assure that over time American companies are able to include information
security features in their programs in order to maintain their admirable
international competitiveness.  We can achieve this by entering into an new
phase of cooperation among government, industry representatives and privacy
advocates with a goal of trying to develop a key escrow encryption system
that will provide strong encryption, be acceptable to computer users
worldwide, and address our national needs as well.</p>

<p> Key escrow encryption offers a very effective way to accomplish our
national goals,  That is why the Administration adopted key escrow
encryption in the "Clipper Chip" to provide very secure encryption for
telephone communications while preserving the ability for law enforcement
and national security.  But the Clipper Chip is an approved federal
standard for telephone communications and not for computer networks and
video networks.  For that reason, we are working with industry to
investigate other technologies for those applications.</p>

<p> The Administration understands the concerns that industry has
regarding the Clipper Chip.  We welcome the opportunity to work with
industry to design a more versatile, less expensive system.  Such a key
escrow system would be implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or
any combination thereof, would not rely upon a classified algorithm, would
be voluntary, and would be exportable.  While there are many severe
challenges to developing such a system, we are committed to a diligent
effort with industry and academia to create such a system.  We welcome your
offer to assist us in furthering this effort.</p>

<p> We also want to assure users of key escrow encryption products that
they will not be subject to unauthorized electronic surveillance.  As we
have done with the Clipper Chip, future key escrow systems must contain
safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization and
should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system.  Escrow
holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without legal
authorization.</p>

<p> We also recognize that a new key escrow encryption system must
permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option.  It is
also possible that as key escrow encryption technology spreads, companies
may established layered escrowing services for their own products.  Having
a number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more
choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure communications.</p>

<p> I assure you the President and I are acutely aware of the need to
balance economic an privacy needs with law enforcement and national
security.  This is not an easy task, but I think that our approach offers
the best opportunity to strike an appropriate balance.  I am looking
forward to working with you and others who share our interest in developing
a comprehensive national policy on encryption.  I am convinced that our
cooperative endeavors will open new creative solutions to this critical
problem.</p>

<p> Sincerely, Al Gore</p>

<title>Commercial Key Escrow</title>
<!-- Place: workshop Gaithersberg, Maryland (USA); USA -->
<!-- Time: workshop September 6-7, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Commercial Key Escrow</h1>

<p>In September 1995, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
held a workshop to discuss their Commercial Key Escrow proposal, intended
to reinvigorate the besieged <a href="index.html">Clipper Chip</a> proposal.</p>

<p>The U.S. government's "key escrow" idea is to have encryption products
with built-in back doors for law enforcement. Police would be able to
decrypt any encrypted transmission (telephone conversation, computer disk,
etc.) with their skeleton key.</p>

<p>The original Clipper proposal would have the federal government hold
("escrow") the decryption keys. The newer "Son of Clipper" Commercial Key
Escrow proposal would have private companies hold the keys.</p>

<p>Commercial Key Escrow is subject to the same criticisms as the original
proposal. The proposal is entirely weighted to the benefit of the intelligence
and law enforcement communities, with little respect for business or
individual needs. Strong encryption to evade key escrow is widely available.
Free speech includes speaking encrypted.</p>

<body>

<h1>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</h1>

<p>On Black Thursday, February 8, 1996, after a year of controversy, the
U.S. government enacted the <a href="act.html">Telecommunications Act of
1996</a>, censoring the Internet and other telecommunications networks.
The blatantly unconstitutional law prohibited the transmission of "indecent"
material and information about abortions on telecommunications networks
such as the Internet. Speech that would be perfectly legal in conversation
or in print was <a href="banned.html">banned in the U.S.A.</a>.</p>

<p>In June 1996, a panel of federal judges found that the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution applies to the Internet, guaranteeing
free speech and rendering the indecency provisions of the law null and
void.</p>

<h2>The Exon Act</h2>

<p>On February 1, 1995, U.S. Sen. James Exon (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a>) introduced
the Communications Decency Act. His proposal broadened existing
law by subjecting individuals to up to a $100,000 fine or two years in prison
for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message transmitted
over a telecommunications network to a minor or with intention to "annoy,
abuse, threaten or harass."</p>

<p>The initial language of the bill additionally made the telecommunications
network provider (such as an Internet provider or telephone company) criminally
liable for such actions of their users. Later amendments removed this
provision, although providers would still be held liable if they are aware
of the transmission or if they do not a "reasonable effort" (defined by the
FCC) to prevent minors from accessing the material.</p>

<p>In March 1995, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously adopted
a version of the Exon proposal as an amendment to the telecommunications
reform bill. In June 1995, the Senate attached the Exon amendment to the
telecommunications reform bill by a vote of 84-16. On February 1, 1996,
the final bill passed the Senate by a vote of 91-5, and the House of
Representatives by a vote of 414-16. On February 8, 1996, the bill was
signed into law by President Clinton.</p>

<h2>The Internet Reaction</h2>

<p>The Internet community reacted strongly to the threat.
115,000 Internet users signed an online petition to stop the
Exon bill. When the bill passed, thousands of World Wide Web sites protested,
many by participating in a <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.vtw.org/speech/">Web blackout</a>
(setting web pages' backgrounds to black) and displaying images of a
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.eff.org/BlueRibbon/">blue ribbon</a>. Protesters
<a href="winter.html">rallied</a> outside the White House after the
bill passed.</p>

<p>The ACLU challenged the law twice in court, first getting the
Department of Justice to agree not to enforce the law for seven days
while constitutional issues are settled, and then to
<a href="ciec.html">challenge the law</a> in a broad coalition.
An online newspaper <a href="challenge.html">challenged
the law</a> with an indecent commentary on it. Senator Patrick Leahy
offered a <a href="leahy.html">bill to repeal it</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the challenges, a panel of federal court judges was
convened to decide the issue. On June 12, 1996, the panel unanimously rules
that free speech applies to the Internet, rendering the indecency
provisions unenforceable. The Clinton administration promises to
appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of It All</h2>

<p>This asinine affront to American rights exemplefies the approach
of freedom-killers. Today's would-be tyrants always invoke "the children."
The same people who are bankrupting the country; who are ensuring there
will be no <a href="/revolution/community/welfare/ss/">Social Security</a>
remaining when the next generation retires; who are sending American kids
overseas to fight foreign wars; who are diminishing in every respect
U.S. citizens' birthrights of property and freedom; these
are the people who want to protect children! These are the honorable men
and women, trying to protect us. God save us from our protectors.</p>

<p>Note to U.S. voters: this law enjoyed the widespread support of both
Democrats and Republicans. Bob Dole voted for the Exon amendment, as did
supposed "libertarian Republicans" like Phil Gramm, Jon Kyl, Connie Mack and
Paul Coverdell. Democrats were no better, with the Clinton administration
leading the charge. Only Libertarians are worth your vote! The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was the <em>only</em> political party that participated in the net-wide
anti-CDA campaign, the <em>only</em> party to participate in the Web
blackout, and the <em>only</em> party to condemn the censorship.</p>

<h1>American Reporter's Challenge to Censorship</h1>

<p>The following is the full text of the article written by
the American Reporter to challenge the censorship provisions of
the U.S. Telecommunications Act.</p>

<hr>

<h2>THE X-ON CONGRESS:  INDECENT COMMENT ON AN INDECENT SUBJECT</h2>

<p>by  Steve Russell<br>
American Reporter Correspondent</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">SAN
ANTONIO</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> -- You
motherfuckers in Congress have dropped over the edge of the earth this
time.  I understand that very few of the swarm of
 high dollar lobbyists around the Telecommunications Bill had any interest
 in content regulation -- they were just trying to get their clients an
 opportunity to dip their buckets in the money stream that cyberspace may
 become -- but the public interest sometimes needs a little attention.
 Keeping your eyes on what big money wants, you have sold out the First
 Amendment.</p>

<p> First, some basics.  If your children walked by a public park and heard
 some angry sumbitches referring to Congress as "the sorriest bunch of
 cocksuckers ever to sell out the First Amendment" or suggesting that
 "the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists'
 dicks and fuck the people who sent you there," no law would be violated
 (assuming no violation of noise ordinances or incitement to breach the
 peace).  If your children did not wish to hear that language, they could
 only walk away.  Thanks to your heads-up-your-ass dereliction of duty,
 if they read the same words in cyberspace, they could call the FBI!</p>

 <p>Cyberspace is the village green for the whole world. It is the same as the
 village green our Founders knew as the place to rouse the rabble who became
 Americans, but it is also different.  Your blind acceptance of the dubious --
 make that dogass dumb -- idea that children are harmed by hearing so-called
 dirty words has created some pretty stupid regulations without shutting down
 public debate, but those stupid regulations will not import to cyberspace
 without consequences that even the public relations whores in Congress
 should find unacceptable.</p>

 <p>In cyberspace, there is no time.  A posted message stays posted until it is
 wiped.  Therefore, there is no way to indulge the fiction that children do
 not stay up late or cannot program a VCR.  In cyberspace, there is no place.
 The "community standards" are those of the whole world.  An upload from
 Amsterdam can become a download in Idaho.  By trying to regulate obscenity
 and indecency on the Internet, you have reduced the level of expression
 allowed consenting adults to that of the most anal retentive blueballed
 fuckhead U.S. attorney in the country. The Internet is everywhere you can
 plug in a modem.  Call Senator Exon an "ignorant motherfucker" in Lincoln,
 <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a> and find
 yourself prosecuted in Bibleburg,
 <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ms/">Mississippi</a>.</p>

 <p>In cyberspace, you cannot require the convenience store to sell Hustler in
 a white sleeve.  The functional equivalent is gatekeeper software, to which
 no civil libertarian has voiced any objection. Gatekeeper software cannot be
 made foolproof, but can you pandering pissants not see that any kid smart
 enough to hack into a Website is also smart enough to get his hands on a
 hard copy of Hustler if he really wants one?</p>

 <p>In cyberspace, there is the illusion of anonymity but no real privacy.
 It is theoretically possible for any Internet server to seine through all
 messages for key words (although it seems likely the resulting slowdown
 would be noticeable).  Perhaps some of you read about America On Line's
 attempt to keep children from reading the word "breast?"  An apparently
 unforeseen consequence was the shutdown of a discussion group of breast
 cancer survivors.  Don't you think more kids are aware of "teat"
 (pronounced "tit") than of "breast?"  Can skirts on piano legs, er, limbs
 be far behind?</p>

 <p>But silly shit like this is just a pimple on the ass of the long-term
 consequences for politics, art and education.  You have passed a law that
 will get less respect than the 55 m.p.h. speed limit dead bang in the middle
 of the First Amendment.  Indecency is nothing but a matter of fashion;
 obscenity is the same but on a longer timeline.  This generation freely
 reads James Joyce and Henry Miller and the Republic still stands.
 The home of the late alleged pornographer D. H. Lawrence is now a beautiful
 writers' retreat in the mountains above Taos, managed by the University of
 New Mexico.</p>

 <p>Universities all have Internet servers, and every English Department has at
 least one scholar who can read Chaucer's English -- but not on the Internet
 anymore.  Comparative literature classes might read Boccaccio -- but not on
 the Internet anymore.  What if some U. S. Attorney  hears about Othello and
 Desdemona "making the beast with two backs" -- is interracial sex no longer
 indecent anywhere in the country, or is Shakespeare off the Internet?</p>

 <p>Did you know you can download video and sound from the Internet?
 Yes, that means you can watch other people having sex if that is interesting
 to you, live or on tape.  Technology can make such things hard to retrieve,
 but probably not impossible.  And since you have swept right past obscenity
 and into indecency, the baby boomers had better keep their old rock 'n roll
 tapes off the Internet.</p>

 <p>When the Jefferson Airplane sang "her heels rise for me," they were not
 referring to a dance step.  And if some Brit explains the line about
 "finger pie" in Penny Lane, the Beatles will be gone.  All of those school
 boards that used to ban "The Catcher in the Rye" over cussing and spreading
 the foul lie that kids masturbate can now go to federal court and get that
 nasty book kept out of cyberspace.</p>

 <p>But enough about the past.  What about rap music?  No, I do not care much
 for it either -- any more than I care for the language you shitheads have
 forced me to use in this essay -- but can you not see the immediate
 differential impact of this law by class and race?  What is your defense -
 -that there are no African-Americans on the Internet, since they are too
 busy pimping and dealing crack?  If our educational establishment has any
 sense at all, they will be trying to see more teens of all colors on the
 Internet, because there is a lot to be learned in cyberspace that has
 nothing to do with sex.</p>

 <p>There are plenty of young people in this country who have legitimate
 political complaints.  When you dickheads get done with
 <a href="/revolution/community/welfare/ss/">Social Security</a>,
 they will be lucky if the retirement age is still in double digits.
 But thanks to the wonderful job the public schools have done keeping sex
 and violence out, we have a lot of intelligent kids who cannot express
 themselves without indecent language. I have watched lawyers in open court
 digging their young clients in the ribs every time the word "fuck" slipped
 out.</p>

 <p>Let's talk about this fucking indecent language bullshit.  Joe Shea, my
 editor, does not want it in his newspaper, and I respect that position.
 He might even be almost as upset about publishing this as I am about
 writing it. I do use salty language in my writing, but sparingly, only
 as a big hammer.  Use the fucking shit too fucking much and it loses its
 fucking impact --see what I mean?  Fiction follows different rules, and if
 you confine your fiction writing to how the swell people want to see
 themselves using language, you not only preclude literary depiction of
 most people but you are probably false to the people you purport to depict.</p>

 <p>Do you remember how real language used by real people got on the air and in
 the newspapers?  Richard Nixon, while he was president, speaking in the
 White House about official matters.  A law professor and a nominee for
 Supreme Court Justice arguing about pubic hairs and porno movies during
 Senate hearings. Are these matters now too indecent for the Internet?
 How much cleansing will be required of the online news services?
 Answer: Enough cleansing to meet the standard of what is appropriate
 for a child in the most restrictive federal judicial district.</p>

 <p>This is bullshit -- unconstitutional bullshit and also bad policy bullshit.
 To violate your ban on indecency, I have been forced to use and overuse
 so-called indecent language.  But if I called you a bunch of goddam
 motherfucking cocksucking cunt-eating blue-balled bastards with the morals
 of muggers and the intelligence of pond scum, that would be nothing compared
 to this indictment, to wit: you have sold the First Amendment,
 your birthright and that of your children.  The Founders turn in their
 graves.  You have spit on the grave of every warrior who fought under the
 Stars and Stripes.</p>

 <p>And what mess of pottage have you acquired in exchange for the rights of a
 free people?  Have you cleansed the Internet of even the rawest pornography?
 No, because it is a worldwide system.  You have, however, handed the
 government a powerful new tool to harass its critics: a prosecution for
 indecent commentary in any district in the country.</p>

 <p>Have you protected one child from reading dirty words?  Probably not, if you
 understand what the economists call "substitution" -- but you have leveled
 the standards of political debate to a point where a history buff would not
 dare to upload some of the Federalist v. Anti-Federalist election rhetoric
 to a Website.</p>

 <p>Since the lobby reporting requirements were not law when the censorship
 discussion was happening, I hope you got some substantial reward for what
 you gave up.  Thirty pieces of silver doesn't go far these days.</p>

<h1>Cryptography</h1>

<p>Cryptography is the art of making and breaking codes. Crypto is
at the center of electronic privacy, being able to communicate privately
with whom you choose -- and keeping everyone else, including
government agents, from listening in.</p>

<p>The United States considers encryption technology a munition,
putting it under the same export controls used for nuclear weapons.
Ironically, the computer source code for an encryption algorithm can
be exported outside the United States without controls, but an
electronic copy of the same code is restricted.</p>

<p>Topics in crypto:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pgp/">Pretty Good Privacy</a>: protection for the masses
<li><a href="escrow/">Key escrow</a>: encryption with built-in
	wiretap, including the notorious Clipper Chip</a>
<li><A href="bernstein.html">Export controls ruled unconstitutional</a></li>
</ul>

<title>Clipper Chip</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>The "Clipper Chip" is a general name for a proposal originating in the
Bush administration and pushed by the Clinton administration to establish
a federal encryption standard that includes a "back door" for law
enforcement.</p>

<p>Clipper is actually comprised of several parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Skipjack encryption algorithm, which is classified, forms the
basis for the Clipper components.
<li>The Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is intended to replace the current
Digital Encryption Standard (DES). EES involves components using the Skipjack
algorithm, with skeleton keys held by federal agencies. Law enforcement
officials (with a warrant of course, trust us) could obtain the escrowed
keys to decrypt any EES-encrypted data.
<li>The Clipper chip itself implements EES for telephones.
<li>The Capstone chip implements EES for computers.
<li>The Tessera card is a PC card containing Capstone.
</ul>

<p>When the Clinton White House announced plans to implement EES, the online
community reacted strongly. As a result, plans for Capstone and Tessera were
put on hold. Although the administration initially said they never intended
to ban other means of encryption, FBI director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a> later said he would
seek such a ban if criminals didn't use EES (duh).</p>

<p>EES met strong online opposition, and several Congressman promised to
block appropriations for EES. After the 1995
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/okc/">Federal Building bombing</a>,
reptilian opportunists like Clinton seized the chance to rush through a
Counter-Terrorism Bill, which included funding for Clipper.</p>

<p>To try to rescue the sinking Clipper Chip, U.S. federal agencies
proposed a variation called Commercial Key Escrow, in which private
companies would hold the skeleton keys and provide them to police
when presented with a warrant.</p>

<h1>Tamara Clark</h1>

<p>Tamara Clark is a <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian
Party</a> activist who has been prominent
in the <a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpnv/">Libertarian Party
of Nevada</a> and the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpaz/">Libertarian Party
of Arizona</a>,
having been Chair of both organizations, as well as a Libertarian
National Committee (LNC) representative. In February 1996, she resigned her
LNC post and withdrew from LP activity after being disgusted with
other Libertarians' personal attacks and innuendos against her.</p>

<p>In 1992, Clark ran a high-profile campaign for Nevada State Senate,
garnering major endorsements and eventually winning 46% of the vote.
In 1994, Clark started two campaigns before finally withdrawing from
the races. The Libertarian National Committee censured her when she
refused to provide them an accounting of her contributors, which she
believed would be used by her opponents to harass her supporters.</p>

<p>From a February 13, 1996 post by Clark to Libernet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I participated in - eventually becoming vice chairman of the campaign - the
first referendum ever in the country that put the question of abortion
choice to a vote of the people. Not only did I help organize the successful
statewide Nevada petition drive (1989-1991), but we also faced highly
active opposition from "Operation Rescue," with clinic blockades almost
every weekend for a year. So, we launched the lawsuit that also became the
first ever in the country to stop Operation Rescue and others from blocking
the clinics by making the blockers pay restitution to the clinics each and
every time they walked onto their property.</p>

<p>Finally, the voters of Nevada had to cast ballots on our referendum in two
successive elections, since we were amending the state constitution. ...
we won with 84 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>... Then there was the business Employee Head Tax (a tax levied against
business owners, penalizing them for each new hire, though with a "cap"
which benefitted the state's largest employers, the hotel-casinos - thus
falling heaviest on small businesses.) From the first months the Democratic
governor proposed this to the Democratic Legislature, I was the chair of
Nevadans for Lower Taxes, an organization of small business owners.</p>

<p>... There was my state Senate race in 1992, in which I became the first
Libertarian ever to win the endorsement of the state's largest newspaper
(the Las Vegas Review-Journal, circ. 160,000), not to mention the first
Libertarian ever endorsed for such a race by the Chamber of Commerce. I
also interviewed for and received endorsements from 18 other organizations.
It made big news that a Libertarian was doing so well. Then, starting the
very day after the election, there was the front page in the Las Vegas Sun
(the Democratic daily) about what a great candidate I had been and about
how there might have been some "problems" in the election.</p>

<p>"Problems"? The fraud had many aspects. Start with the stories about all
the candidates who were going to challange the results - several
Republicans as well as me. (Although midday exit polling on election day -
admittedly based on small samples - reported me ahead, and although the
first live network affiliate TV report of the just-opened absentee ballots
announced me leading 56-44 in a two-way race, the computers "had to be shut
down" for more than an hour just after counting started. When they came up
again, I was losing 56-44, a mirror-image reversal which turned out to be
the final official tally.)</p>

<p>Then there were all the stories about how I and some of the other
candidates were in the election department every day finding all kinds of
problems with how they processed the absentee ballots. Then there were the
stories about the grand juries that the state Legislature requested to look
into the election problems. The county Registrar of Voters was demoted,
then fired. I was appointed to a committee to search for a new registrar -
and I was clearly identified as a Libertarian in all these stories.</p>

<p>... In September of 1993 I became front page news again, for reasons I
hope none of you ever have to go through. I lost my pre-school aged son in an
auto accident that happened in my front yard.</p>

<p>... My run for a 1994 office in Nevada was aborted. I started campaigns
for two different offices in turn, but the Republicans and Democrats had become
much more savvy about blocking me from another two-way race, shifting
candidates into races against me at the last minute before candidate
registration closed, to create three and ever four-way races which I
considered unwinnable - a waste of contributors' money. This, combined with
our financial straits, meant that by September of 1994 I was already in
Arizona, where that affiliate party offered me a much-needed temporary
salary to manage a number of very strong campaigns.</p>

<p>What I did was refuse to provide detailed information on my 1994 Nevada
vendors to the National Committee. That's what I was censured for. So far
as I know, I'm the only candidate in the history of the party who's ever
been asked for such information.</p>

<h1>Don Ernsberger</h1>

<p>Don Ernsberger is a long-time libertarian activist. In a November 1996
message to the LPUS mailing list, Ernsberger gave his reasons for leaving
politics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the conclusion of the 1996 LP National Convention last July I ended
my 32 year involvement in politics and 25 year involvement with the
Libertarian Party ... The American culture is fundamentally anti-ideological,
hostile to and fearful of personal liberty ... I have ended my Don Quixote
days.</p>

<body>

<h1>John Gilmore</h1>

<p>John Gilmore, co-founder of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,
is an activist for online freedoms.</p>

<p>He has an extensive technical background in Internet technologies.
He was one of the first employees at Sun Microsystems and has worked
on many fundamental hardware and software technologies. In addition
to EFF, he co-founded the "alt" hierarchy of Usenet news, a successful
Internet service provider, the cypherpunks cryptography group, and
a company that made money supporting free software.</p>

<p>Through EFF, he has worked for freedom of online expression, fighting
cryptography restrictions and censorship. In 1996, while seeking nomination
as a trustee of the Internet Society, he said, "EFF's policy on cryptography
is pretty much solely my doing. Our stance on censorship and on using
market mechanisms rather than regulation is also something I'm proud of."</p>

<body>

<h1>Ernest Hancock</h1>

<p>Ernest Hancock has been Chair of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> of
Maricopa County,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> since
December 1993. Maricopa County contains <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>.</p>

<p>As Hancock said in a May 12, 1995 posting to Libernet, his motivation stems
from a personal incident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1989 I was exposed to very  bad corruption in the Arizona Department of
Commerce that extended to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington D.C.</a> and
every elected position and
bureaucracy I came in  contact with. A young Republican at the age of 28,
married with 4 children, I was scared. I came face to face with some of the
most  powerful people in this country and was told how they knew what was  best
for me and my family. At this point I never even heard of the Libertarian
Party, But, I didn't need a platform or a Constitution to tell me what was
planned for this country was evil.</p>

<p>After presenting very damning evidence of corruption to a powerful  director
of a part of the U.S. Commerce Dept. in Washington, I was told,  "Yea Kid, and
what are you going to do about it?" Well, I told him that I didn't know what
one person could do ... but I was going to find out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hancock was part of a successful lawsuit to change Arizona's election
code.</p>

<h1>International Society for Individual Liberty</h1>

<p>The International Society for Individual Liberty (ISIL) is one of the
prime movers of the modern libertarian movement. ISIL was formed with the
merger of the Society for Individual Liberty (SIL) and Libertarian Internatinal
(LI).</p>

<p>The original SIL was started in 1969, and can lay claim to being the
first libertarian organization to spring from the modern libertarian
movement.</p>

<p>ISIL publishes the <cite>Freedom Network News</cite> and a series of
position papers, both available on their Web site.
ISIL runs Freedom's Forum Bookstore, which sells a wide selection
of libertarian books and publishes books under the name of Cobden Press.</p>

<title>Thomas Jefferson</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Thomas Jefferson</h1>

<p>Thomas Jefferson is as close to a patron saint as the libertarian
movement gets. His influence may very well be the primary reason the
United States Constitution and Bill of Rights are so radically oriented
towards freedom.</p>

<p>As author of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, Jefferson made the
claim that government is there to protect liberty, not to protect us from
liberty.</p>

<p>As third President of the United States, Jefferson abolished all
internal taxation, supporting a much-reduced federal government on small
tariffs alone.</p>

<p>Jefferson's huge contributions to human liberty make Libertarians willing
to overlook his few statist tendencies. He owned slaves, but in his defense
he condemned slavery and recommended abolishing it whenever he could. He
supported public education, but then he had no experience by which to judge
it.</p>

<title>Roger MacBride</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Roger MacBride (1929 - 1995)</h1>

<p>Roger Lea MacBride was an early Libertarian celebrity. In 1972, he was an
Presidential elector for the Republican Party, but cast his electoral vote for
the <A href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> candidates
rather than Richard Nixon. He went on to be the 1976
Libertarian presidential nominee and helped make the Libertarian Party the
nation's third largest political party. Later in life he returned to the
Republican Party and chaired the Republican Liberty Caucus.</p>

<p>MacBride was an avid reader. He met Rose Wilder Lane, daughter of Laura
Ingalls Wilder. Lane introduced him to libertarian ideas. Lane and MacBride
became close friends; he called her "Grandma" and produced the television
series based on Wilder's <cite>Little House on the Prairie</cite> books. Lane
left him her estate.</p>

<p>MacBride was elected to the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/vt/">Vermont</a> state
legislature as a Republican. He
became a Republican presidential elector for the 1972 election, and refusing to
cast his vote for Richard Nixon, instead voted for Libertarian Party candidates
<a href="/revolution/by_name/H/JohnHospers.html">John Hospers</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/TonieNathan.html">Theodora Nathan</a>.
The Libertarian Party nominated MacBride for President at their 1975
convention. MacBride's vigorous campaigning helped propel the Libertarians to
becoming the nation's third-largest political party.</p>

<p>After his death, the <cite>Libertarian Party News</cite> published <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.lp.org/lp/lpn/9504-MacBride.html">"Roger MacBride"</a> in his

<h1>Jay D. Manifold</h1>

<p>Jay D. Manifold is the current chair of the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lptx/">Libertarian Party of
Texas</a>, and has been an
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">LP</a> activist for many years.
In a January 17, 1996 post to Libernet, Manifold described his background:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My background is as follows: I became a libertarian in November
1978 while attending the University of Chicago, and joined the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpmo/">Missouri Libertarian
Party</a> in April of 1981.  Over the next
several years I served in various state party offices, including
state chair, vice-chair, secretary, and district representative,
and ran for Congress in the 5th District in 1986.  I attended
every state convention and was a delegate to the National
Conventions held at Denver in 1981 and Seattle in 1987.</p>

<p>In late 1989 and early 1990 my job took me to <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>.  After
relocating and settling in, I became active in the Texas LP in
1991.  I again served as a district representative with the
state party and ran for State Representative in the 103rd
District in 1992.  I have attended every state convention and
state conference beginning in 1991 and was a delegate to the
National Conventions held at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>
in 1991 and Salt Lake City
in 1993.  In mid-1993 I was asked to serve as vice-chair of the
Texas LP by then-chairman Joe Barnett.  I agreed and was 
confirmed by a vote of the executive committee.  In June of 1994
I was elected state chair at our convention in
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>.</p>

<p>... In 1987 I supported Russell Means at 
Seattle.  Subsequently I gathered approximately 1,000 signatures
in the effort to put Ron Paul on the ballot in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a>.  In 
1991 I supported Dick Boddie at Chicago.  Subsequently I served as
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
Coordinator for the Andre Marrou campaign, helping raise approximately
$4,000.</p>

and is active with the

<body>

<h1>Robert Nozick (1939 - )</h1>

<p>Robert Nozick is one of the most influential figures in the history of the
modern libertarian movement. His 1975 book <cite>Anarchy, State and
Utopia</cite> was one of three books defining early libertarian philosophy, the
other two being <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/MurrayRothbard.html">Rothbard's</a>
<cite>Libertarian Manifesto</cite> and <a
href="/revolution/by_name/H/JohnHospers.html">Hospers'</a>
<cite>Libertarianism</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Anarchy, State and Utopia</cite> argued that inequality is not unjust,
and that egalitarianism was inherently unjust because it must rely on the use
of force.</p>

<p>Nozick won a full professorship in philosophy at Harvard University at age
30 in 1969.</p>

<p>Smith is the author of many science fiction novels. In responding to a
charge of racism, he posted a nice summary of his ouvre to Libernet, excerpted
below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hero of my first novel, <cite>The Probability Broach</cite>, and my
second, <cite>The Venus Belt</cite>, is a full-blooded Ute Indian whose wife is
a freckled strawberry blonde and whose best friend is the 137-year-old Mexican
widow of a Russian prince.  These are the books that also introduced sapient
chimpanzees, gorillas, porpoises and killer whales to science fiction, all
inhabitants of the "North American Confederacy", an amalgamation of the United
States, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Mexico/">Mexico</a>, and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>The brave protagonist of my third novel, <p>Their Majesties'
Bucketeers</cite>, is a meter-high, hairy, nine-legged, crab-like firefighting
detective whose species has three genders.</p>

<p>The viewpoint character of my fourth novel, <cite>The Nagasaki
Vector</cite>, is Jewish, although he doesn't keep kosher as far as I know (I
never asked him) and he speaks with a decidedly West Texican accent. He's
followed constantly by three tiny aliens who think he's God, and his flying
saucer has fallen in love with him.</p>

<p>YD-038, the hero of my fifth novel, <cite>Tom Paine Maru</cite>, is an
escapee from the kind of world that liberals have spent the last 60 years
trying to build for us.</p>

<p>With <cite>The Gallatin Divergence</cite>, my sixth novel, we're back to the
Ute Indian again, who gets time-traveled to the 18th century by a physicist who
also happens to be a <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> -- a porpoise.</p>

<p>Somewhere in there, I also wrote three books -- recently combined and
reprinted as <cite>The Lando Calrissian Adventures</cite> -- about the guy in
<cite>Star Wars</cite> who owned the <cite>Millenium Falcon</cite> before Han
Solo did.</p>

<p>Now in my tenth novel, <cite>The Wardove</cite>, we have a rock band in the
distant future, one of whose girl singers is having an affair with an alien who
looks like a cross between a helium balloon and an umbrella.</p>

<p>The hero of <cite>The Crystal Empire</cite>, my eleventh novel, is a white
guy, I confess, and he's even an unabashed sort of Nordicoid semi-Viking, make
what you will of that.  The three loves of his life are a voluptuous blonde, a
beautiful Indian, and finally a Moslem princess (it's a long book) who helps
him
battle an alliance of Renaissance Aztecs and Ming-plus Dynasty Chinese.</p>

<p>I never did decide what race the hero of my twelfth novel, <cite>Brightsuit
Macbear</cite> was, although he's the great-grandson of that Ute who started
the whole thing, way back when.  His best friend is one of those nine-legged
crabs.</p>

<p>Lucky thirteen, <cite>Taflak Lysandra</cite>, concerns a young lady of
Australian Aboriginal extraction and her father, the American coyote with a
cybernetically augmented brain who adopted her. She starts off being unhappy
(like many adolescents are) because she doesn't have blue eyes, freckles, or a
turned-up nose, but learns to be happy with her looks because, as she discovers
in the end, compared to the kind of person she is inside, they're basically
unimportant.</p>

<p>Except for an occasional alien, <em>everyone</em> in my fourteenth novel,
<cite>Henry Martyn</cite>, is white. They're descended (900 years removed) from
the last remaining guilt-ridden middle-class liberals in the Solar System, who
were exiled to a faraway star cluster when everybody else finally got
thoroughly fed up with them.</p>

<p>Otherhandwise, in numbers fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen -- <cite>Contact
and Commune</cite>, <cite>Converse and Conflict</cite>, and <cite>Concert and
Cosmos</cite>, respectively -- hardly anybody's white, because of an especially
nasty kind of "affirmative action" carried out by the American Soviet Socialist
Republic.  I do have talking molluscs, though.  These books, by the way,
collectively known (by their proud author) as the "Forge of the Elders
Trilogy", proved so politically incorrect that the publisher canceled the third
volume!</p>

<p>Which brings us to my eighteenth novel, <cite>Pallas</cite> -- available now
on fine paperback racks everywhere -- in which a little half-Cambodian,
half-Vietnamese boy refugees out of a UN agricultural commune.  Over the course
of his long, productive life, he loves three white women (one, for complicated
reasons, with a Sikh surname) while battling a White American Male former US
Senator you may even recognize, although the resemblance is purely
coincidental.</p>

<p>The hero of <cite>Lever Action</cite>, my nineteenth book, is <em>me</em>
(it's a collection of two decades' worth of essays and speeches).</p>

<p>Finally, my twentieth novel, <cite>Bretta Martyn</cite>, will take us back
to the strange universe of Throwaway White Liberals I mentioned earlier.</p>

<title>Lysander Spooner</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Lysander Spooner (1808-1887)</h1>

<p>Lysander Spooner was a late nineteenth century anarchist. The American
anarchist movement provided a crucial step in the development of libertarian
philosophy, coming between the American abolitionists and the Austrian
School economists.</p>

<p>Spooner's classic work, <cite>No Treason</cite>, attacks the moral
authority of government, supporting instead a system of voluntary
agreements.</p>

<p>Spooner was a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a> lawyer
active in the abolitionist and anarchist
movements. In challenge to the newly established
U.S. postal monopoly, he set up his own post office, the American Letter
Mail Company. While he was forced
out of business by government prosecution, his model of competition forced
the Post Office to lower its stamp rates for the first and only time in
its history.</p>

</head>
<body>

<h1>Linda Thompson</h1>

<p>Dr. Linda Thompson is an Internet character who has been prominent in the
militia and Waco movements.</p>

<p>Thompson issued the "Thompson Ultimatum" demanding that Congress repeal the
twentieth century, and parts of the nineteenth, and calling for militia
enforcement of the ultimatum. She later claimed that the ultimatum was simply
to stir controversy and get people to offer better alternatives.</p>

<p>Thompson's theory about the Waco fire is that it was started by a
flamethrower tank. This idea was discredited, and now government apologists
use it as a straw man to avoid discussing real evidence of government
wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Thompson is sarcasm-impaired, and has threatened to sue me for libel
based on the above "defamatory and false" paragraphs. She also believes
federal agents have planned to assassinate her.</p>

<h1>Jerome Tuccille</h1>

<p>Jerome Tuccille was one of the early leaders of the modern libertarian
movement. He wrote in several libertarian journals before the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was established and became active in the party when it was.</p>

<p>Tuccille was the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpny/">Free Libertarian Party
of New York's</a> 1974 gubernatorial
candidate. He garnered publicity by sending a blonde in a body suit riding
through Central Park on a horse named Taxpayer. <cite>Newsweek</cite> said
Tuccille "hardly believes in government at all," noting his support for the
free market; legalizing prostitution, abortion and drugs; and ending taxes,
subsidies, tariffs, quotas, land use controls and antidiscrimination laws.</p>

<p>In the 1980's Tuccille went on to become an investment author. His
son, J.D. Tuccille (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:tooch@aol.com">tooch@aol.com</a>) is also a writer, currently
an editor with the online version of the New York <cite>Daily News</cite>.</p>

<title>Cal Warburton</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Cal Warburton (1910 - 1995)</h1>

<p>Calvin "Cal" Warburton was the first sitting legislator to switch
parties to the
<A href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>, and the
first Libertarian legislator
in the lower 48 states. Warburton was a Republican State
Representative in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a> when,
at age 81, he switched to the Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>"I have joined the Libertarian Party because it is the party of 
freedom -- economic freedom, personal freedom, social freedom, and judicial 
freedom," Warburton announced at a July 16, 1991 press conference in the
Legislative Office Building in Concord, New Hampshire. Warburton had served
seven terms in the New Hampshire state legislature as a Republican.</p>

<p>In 1992, Warburton was re-elected to the state legislature as a Libertarian
representing Raymond and Epping. Warburton declined to run for re-election
in 1994.</p>

<p>As a Libertarian legislator, Warburton filed bills to allow property tax
abatements for parents who sent their children to private schools, require
the state government to divest of private businesses, curb the soaring
spending in the state's Executive Department, and repeal a business tax
increase introduced by the Republican governor. All measures were defeated
by Republicans and Democrats in the legislature.</p>

<p>Before he became a legislator, Warburton earned a degree in theology
from Boston University, served as an Army chaplain for eleven years, and
was a Methodist minister in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ks/">Kansas</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>
and New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Warburton was very active in the Libertarian Party, serving two
terms in the state legislature, running unsuccessfully in 1992 and 1994
for the party's gubernatorial nomination, speaking at Libertarian meetings
across the state, advising Libertarian candidates and working the polls
on election day.</p>

<p>Warburton underwent surgery for an aorta aneurysm in early December 
1994, which left him in a coma. He recovered from the coma, and remained
active in the Libertarian Party until his death, on October 18, 1995, at
age 85.</p>

</head>

<body>

<h1>George Washington</h1>

<p>George Washington, American Revolutionary, Founding Father, was the first
President of the United States.</p>

<p>Libertarians respect Washington for the role he played in American
independence, but Washington seemed more concerned with
social order than with liberty. Thinkers like <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas Jefferson</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/P/ThomasPaine.html">Thomas Paine</a> are closer
to current libertarian thought. (Of course this is in
relative terms; Washington would be infinitely preferable to any of the
scumbags the Presidency has seen lately.)</p>

<title>L. Neil Smith</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>L. Neil Smith</h1>

<p>L. Neil Smith is a Libertarian science fiction author and gun rights
activist. He is founder and International Coordinator of the Libertarian
Second Amendment Caucus, Secretary and Legislative Director of the Weld
County Fish & Wildlife Association and an
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a> Life Member.</p>

<p>Smith is the author of many science fiction novels. In responding to a
charge of racism, he posted a nice summary of his ouvre to Libernet, excerpted
below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hero of my first novel, <cite>The Probability Broach</cite>, and my
second, <cite>The Venus Belt</cite>, is a full-blooded Ute Indian whose wife is
a freckled strawberry blonde and whose best friend is the 137-year-old Mexican
widow of a Russian prince.  These are the books that also introduced sapient
chimpanzees, gorillas, porpoises and killer whales to science fiction, all
inhabitants of the "North American Confederacy", an amalgamation of the United
States, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Mexico/">Mexico</a>, and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>The brave protagonist of my third novel, <p>Their Majesties'
Bucketeers</cite>, is a meter-high, hairy, nine-legged, crab-like firefighting
detective whose species has three genders.</p>

<p>The viewpoint character of my fourth novel, <cite>The Nagasaki
Vector</cite>, is Jewish, although he doesn't keep kosher as far as I know (I
never asked him) and he speaks with a decidedly West Texican accent. He's
followed constantly by three tiny aliens who think he's God, and his flying
saucer has fallen in love with him.</p>

<p>YD-038, the hero of my fifth novel, <cite>Tom Paine Maru</cite>, is an
escapee from the kind of world that liberals have spent the last 60 years
trying to build for us.</p>

<p>With <cite>The Gallatin Divergence</cite>, my sixth novel, we're back to the
Ute Indian again, who gets time-traveled to the 18th century by a physicist who
also happens to be a <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> -- a porpoise.</p>

<p>Somewhere in there, I also wrote three books -- recently combined and
reprinted as <cite>The Lando Calrissian Adventures</cite> -- about the guy in
<cite>Star Wars</cite> who owned the <cite>Millenium Falcon</cite> before Han
Solo did.</p>

<p>Now in my tenth novel, <cite>The Wardove</cite>, we have a rock band in the
distant future, one of whose girl singers is having an affair with an alien who
looks like a cross between a helium balloon and an umbrella.</p>

<p>The hero of <cite>The Crystal Empire</cite>, my eleventh novel, is a white
guy, I confess, and he's even an unabashed sort of Nordicoid semi-Viking, make
what you will of that.  The three loves of his life are a voluptuous blonde, a
beautiful Indian, and finally a Moslem princess (it's a long book) who helps
him
battle an alliance of Renaissance Aztecs and Ming-plus Dynasty Chinese.</p>

<p>I never did decide what race the hero of my twelfth novel, <cite>Brightsuit
Macbear</cite> was, although he's the great-grandson of that Ute who started
the whole thing, way back when.  His best friend is one of those nine-legged
crabs.</p>

<p>Lucky thirteen, <cite>Taflak Lysandra</cite>, concerns a young lady of
Australian Aboriginal extraction and her father, the American coyote with a
cybernetically augmented brain who adopted her. She starts off being unhappy
(like many adolescents are) because she doesn't have blue eyes, freckles, or a
turned-up nose, but learns to be happy with her looks because, as she discovers
in the end, compared to the kind of person she is inside, they're basically
unimportant.</p>

<p>Except for an occasional alien, <em>everyone</em> in my fourteenth novel,
<cite>Henry Martyn</cite>, is white. They're descended (900 years removed) from
the last remaining guilt-ridden middle-class liberals in the Solar System, who
were exiled to a faraway star cluster when everybody else finally got
thoroughly fed up with them.</p>

<p>Otherhandwise, in numbers fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen -- <cite>Contact
and Commune</cite>, <cite>Converse and Conflict</cite>, and <cite>Concert and
Cosmos</cite>, respectively -- hardly anybody's white, because of an especially
nasty kind of "affirmative action" carried out by the American Soviet Socialist
Republic.  I do have talking molluscs, though.  These books, by the way,
collectively known (by their proud author) as the "Forge of the Elders
Trilogy", proved so politically incorrect that the publisher canceled the third
volume!</p>

<p>Which brings us to my eighteenth novel, <cite>Pallas</cite> -- available now
on fine paperback racks everywhere -- in which a little half-Cambodian,
half-Vietnamese boy refugees out of a UN agricultural commune.  Over the course
of his long, productive life, he loves three white women (one, for complicated
reasons, with a Sikh surname) while battling a White American Male former US
Senator you may even recognize, although the resemblance is purely
coincidental.</p>

<p>The hero of <cite>Lever Action</cite>, my nineteenth book, is <em>me</em>
(it's a collection of two decades' worth of essays and speeches).</p>

<p>Finally, my twentieth novel, <cite>Bretta Martyn</cite>, will take us back
to the strange universe of Throwaway White Liberals I mentioned earlier.</p>

and <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>.</p>

<p>Browne also made four professional appearances during this time, at the 1995

<title>Bombing on Seismogram</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA);

<!-- Time: April 19, 1995; May 23, 1995 -->

<h1>Oklahoma City Bombing Recorded on Seismogram</h1>

<p>Seismic waves generated by the April 19, 1995 <a
href="index.html">federal building bombing</a>
in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> were recorded by at least two seismometers in the area.
One seismograph, the Oklahoma Geological Survey's, was located sixteen miles
from the blast site near Norman, Oklahoma. The other seismograph was located
four miles from the blast site in the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma
City.</p>

<p>Both seismographs showed two or three events (ground motion)
happening around the time the bomb is supposed to have gone off. Many people
have speculated that the later events are the result of a second bomb, but
scientists have generally disagreed.</p>

<p>As reported by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Hugh Davies in the April 23, 1995
<cite>Sunday Telegraph</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>The Sunday Telegraph</cite> has received copies of a seismogram from
the Geological Survey at the University of Oklahoma showing that there may have
been two bomb blasts, 10 seconds apart. The FBI says that there was only one
blast.</p>

<p>But the director of the institute, Charles Mankin, says that "this is
clearly not a refraction. The two surface waves had the same amplitude, wave
form, and shape. It's very puzzling."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. Geological Survey together with the Oklahoma Geological Survey
conducted experiments to investigate the issue. The USGS/OGS recorded the
May 23, 1995 demolition of the federal building's remains, comparing them
to the recording of the bombing.</p>

<p>The scientists differed in the interpretation. The USGS issued a June 1,
1995 press release, reporting that they believe the two seismogram events
were from a single bomb. They also said the events were about twice as long
as would be expected from an ammonium nitrate bomb. They did not publish a
report for peer review.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David Deming</a>,
a Ph.D geophysicist and assistant professor of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of Oklahoma, updated Libernet several times regarding the progress
of the investigation. In posts to Libernet on April 26, May 18, May 23, May 29,
August 17 and September 14, 1995, Deming described his research into the
matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The record does show three distinct arrivals, timed at 9:02:02, 9:02:13, and
9:02:23 am, CST.  The first arrival appears to be distinctly different from the
other two, and is similar to micro-earthquake activity which is very common on
other sections of the record.</p>

<p>... The demolition [of the Federal Building's remains] was recorded on the
same seismometer, but, according to Dr. Charles Mankin, director of the
Oklahoma Geological Survey, looks "nothing like" the original blast event(s).
I have not seen the record myself. The preliminary interpretation would argue
against an interpretation of the second event on the April 19 record as
"the building falling down".</p>

<p>... I have also spoken with several people in the immediate vicinity of
the blast site.  They unanimously report hearing only one blast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deming said that the two-explosion hypothesis "has now been discredited,"
explaining that "if the two arrivals at the FNO station 16.23 miles from the
blast site were separated by 10 seconds, then the 2 arrivals at the Omniplex
seismograph, 4.21 miles from the blast site, should have been separated by
10 seconds or less - yet they were separated by 16 seconds."</p>

<p>Deming reports that Ray Brown, a seismologist who interpreted
the April 19 seismograms for the Oklahoma Geological Survey, believes
the seismic data are most consistent with an extended period of
explosive activity rather than a single, discrete explosion.</p>

<p>The unexplained factor in the seismograms is how one truck bomb
could produce the same length of disturbance (approximately ten seconds)
as the demolition, when the demolition consisted of a series of staggered
explosions plus the building falling down.</p>

<p>According to Deming, Brown said, "The first seismic episode can be related
to the truck bomb. ...  Explosive energy at a level above that used for the
demolition and below that used for the truck bomb is judged to be the likely
cause of the second episode of seismic activity at the Murrah Building."
Dr. Brown can be reached at the Oklahoma Geological Survey, 100 East Boyd
Street, Sarkey's Energy Center, Room N-131, Norman, Oklahoma 73019, or by
phone at (405) 325-3031.</p>

<title>Science Funding</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: book published 1992 -->
</head>

<h1>Science Funding</h1>

<p>This book review of <cite>Science Funding</cite>, by Joseph P. Martino, 
(c) 1992 (Transaction Publishers, ISBN 1-56000-033-3, 392 pages)
was written by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/BarryFagin.html">Barry Fagin</a>
and posted on an Internet mailing list.</p>

<hr>

<p>A couple of months ago, I thought it might be interesting to look at
applying public choice theory to science funding. I thought that by bringing
the principles of public choice theory to bear, the "public goods" argument
could be satisfactorily refuted and scientists would better understand why
federal support for R&D is neither necessary nor desirable.</p>

<p>Last month, however, I learned that a research scientist has spent a
considerable amount of time over the past few years doing just this.
His name is Joseph Martino, and the results of his research have just
been published in a book titled <cite>Science Funding: Politics and
Porkbarrel</cite>. Completed with the assistance of the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason Foundation</a> and
other groups, Martino's book weaves history, economics, and science together to
show the problems associated with governmental support of research.</p>

<p>The book is extensively researched, with a large amount of data on federal
support of R&D. Martino attempts to address every argument advanced in
favor of governmental support of research, and is able to marshall
considerable evidence against it. Briefly, the classic argument in favor
of federal support of R&D was first given by Kenneth Arrow in 1962. Arrow
states that a firm will increase spending on research only so long as the
marginal return on it exceeds the marginal return from other investment
opportunities. Problems arise when the firm's return is less than the
return to society as a whole (i.e. when it can't "appropriate" all the
benefits of the research). Under these conditions, society would be better
off if the firm spent more money on research, although the firm would lose
money. Under these conditions, society will be better off if government funds
the additional research, equating marginal social cost with marginal social
benefit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the flaws in this argument are not obvious to most
scientists,
and in fact as far as I can tell they have never been refuted satisfactorily
in the scientific press. Martino notes that Arrow's argument has three
problems, any one of which is sufficient to render it invalid:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Empirical observations show that under competitive conditions
firms can actually <em>overinvest</em> in R&D, in the sense that private
and social benefit is less than social cost.</p></li>

<li><p>Even if firms do actually underinvest in R&D, there is no way for
government to determine, <em>even in theory</em>, the level of funding 
necessary to equate marginal social costs with marginal social 
benefits. The social return from foregone investments if government
funding of research is increased simply cannot be calculated. Given
what we now know about centralized planning and distributed decision
making, it is clear that the federal government cannot and never will
be able to determine the "right" amount of money to spend on research.
The answer according to scientists will always be "more".</p></li>

<li><p>Arrow's argument implicitly assumes that government is a neutral
agent, weighing costs and benefits in an attempt to achieve optimal
outcomes. But we know from public choice theory that this is simply
not so. Agents of government are human beings who, like the rest of
us, respond to incentives. The incentive structure created by
government virtually guarantees that even if the right amount of
research funding could be calculated, it would not be spent on
nonappropriable research. Instead, it would be spent on politically
useful research, rent seeking, and other non-productive activities.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The book is also enlightening in its survey of scientists attitudes,
many of whom believe steady funding to be an entitlement. Numerous
scientists who responded to a survey wanted "automatic funding if
continuous publication is present", "longer grant periods with fewer
strings on renewal", and so forth.  As a study in sociology, Martino's
book is a depressing reminder of how pervasive the entitlement mentality
has become, even among the intellectual and professional class.</p>

<p>Martino's book is available from Transaction Publishers, Rutgers --
The State University, New Brunswick, NJ, 08903.</p>

<title>LPMD Ballot Status</title>
<!-- Place: Maryland (USA) -->
<!-- Time: May - June 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LP-Maryland Wins Ballots Status</h1>

<p>In 1995 the Libertarian Party of Maryland (LPMD) gained official ballot
status as a certified party. The LPMD is the only party other than the
Republicans and Democrats to qualify.</p>

<p>Certification means that Libertarians will automatically have their
presidential nominee placed on state ballots, and  that
all voter registration forms will now carry the Libertarian Party option.</p>

<p>The party needed 10,000 valid signatures to be certified. On May 9, 1995,
the Libertarian Party of Maryland filed 13,817 signatures with the State
Administrative Board of Election Law (SABEL). Of those, SABEL determined that
9,954 were valid, 46 short of certification. On May 25, the party submitted
125 more signatures, of which 81 were found valid, giving the party a total
of 10,035 valid signatures.</p>

<p>On June 6, SABEL administrator Gene M. Raynor announced, "The Libertarian
Party is now an established political party under Maryland law." In addition,
Jack Schwartz, Chief Counsel for Opinions and Advice from Attorney General
J. Joseph Curran Jr.'s office issued a determination on May 25 that the
Libertarian Party's Constitution and Bylaws conform with Article 33 of the
Maryland Code.</p>

<h1>LP-Maryland Fundraising</h1>

<p>March 10, 1995, from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/JesseMarkowitz.html">Jesse Markowitz</a>:</p>

<p>The Maryland Libertarian Party recently completed a major membership drive. 
Our drive consisted of a letter to all of our recent prospects, our expired
members and our current members.  The letter and inserts were designed and
produced by the Monticello group.  This was a <em>very</em> successful 
mailing.  We had an overall response rate of over 10%, and received just over
$4.00 for every dollar we spent on the mailing.</p>

<p>These memberships have all been forwarded to National, and should be
recorded during the month of March.  There were over 75 memberships. I can't
tell how many National memberships were new as opposed to renewals, so I can't
tell you how our membership numbers will change on the March listings.

<title>Marijuana Clubs</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Washington, DC (USA); San Francisco, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1991 - 1995 -->

<h1>Cannabis Buyers' Clubs</h1>

<p>In <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a>, there is a place that sells 40 pounds
of marijuana per week to eight thousand people -- over the counter.</p>

<p>Since 1991, more than two dozen "Cannabis Buyers' Clubs" have
sprung up in the U.S. to sell marijuana for medical purposes. The
Buyers' Clubs are modeled after clubs set up by AIDS victims to
purchase experimental drugs from abroad that were not yet approved
in the U.S.</p>

<p>The first Buyers' Club was opened by an HIV-positive man in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington,
D.C.</a>, to supply marijuana to AIDS patients suffering from wasting syndrome.
Marijuana has proven to be medically useful against a variety of ailments,
from glaucoma to lack of appetite. The clubs require picture id and a letter
of recommendation from a physician, and call the physician to verify the
recommendation.</p>

<p>The San Francisco club is the largest, with nearly 8,000 members
and approximately $60,000 in weekly sales.
The directory, Dennis Peron, is trying to get medical marijuana
legalized in California.</p>

<p>Local authorities generally tolerate or actively sanction the clubs,
but the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency is trying to "get tough," making
three club-related arrests in 1995.</p>

<title>Informant Involved with Nichols</title>

<h1>FBI Informant Talked With Nichols</h1>

<p>An FBI informant talked with James Nichols <em>in 1988</em> about blowing
up the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> federal building, according to FBI documents obtained by
a Freedom of Information request.</p>

<p>Associated Press reported that an unnamed FBI informant visited James
Nichols, brother of bombing suspect Terry Nichols, at his Decker, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>
farm in December 1988. James Nichols was upset at the U.S. government, whom
he blamed for the terrorist <a
href="/revolution/multi/war/lockerbie.html">bombing of PanAm
Flight 103</a> over <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/Lockerbie.html">Lockerbie</a>,
Scotland.</p>

<p>At the meeting, Nichols diagrammed the Oklahoma City federal building and
discussed how a "megabomb" could level it.</p>

<p>The FBI would not discuss why the informant visited Nichols.</p>

<p>Nichols denies the conversation ever took place.</p>

<title>Democrat Hitchhiker</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Democrat Hitchhiker</h1>

<p>A boy is hitchhiking on a country road. A car stops for him, and the
driver asks, "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"</p>

<p>"Democrat," says the boy, and the car speeds off.</p>

<p>Another car stops, and the driver asks, "Are you a Republican or a
Democrat?"</p>

<p>"Democrat," says the boy, and the car speeds off.</p>

<p>This happens two or three times, and the boy decides he's giving the
wrong answer. The next car that stops is a convertible driven by a
beautiful blonde. "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?" she asks.</p>

<p>"Republican," says the boy, and she lets him in.</p>

<p>But as they're driving along, the wind from the open top begins to push
the blonde's skirt higher and higher up her legs. And the boy finds himself
becoming aroused.</p>

<p>Finally he can't control himself any longer. "Stop!" he hollers. "Let
me out! I've only been a Republican for ten minutes and already I feel
like screwing somebody!"</p>

<p>-- popular joke from the 1930's, reprinted in <a
href="/revolution/by_name/O/PJORourke.html">P.J. O'Rourke's</a>
<cite>Republican Party Reptile</cite>.</p>

<title>Quotes on Political Parties</title>

<h1>Quotes on Political Parties</h1>

<hr>
<h2>O'Rourke on the American Political System</h2>

<p>The American political system is like a gigantic Mexican Christmas
fiesta. Each political party is a huge pi&ntilde;ata -- a
papier-mach&eacute; donkey, for example. The donkey is filled with full
employment, low interest rates, affordable housing, comprehensive medical
benefits, a balanced budget and other goodies. The American voter is
blindfolded and given a stick. The voter then swings the stick wildly in
every direction, trying to hit a political candidate on the head and
knock some sense into the silly bastard.</p>

<p>-- <a href="/revolution/by_name/O/PJORourke.html">P.J. O'Rourke</a>,
in <cite>Parliament of Whores</cite></p>

<hr>
<h2>Teddy on the Two-Party System</h2>

<p>The old parties are husks, with no real soul within either, divided on
artificial lines, boss-ridden and privilege-controlled, each a jumble of
incongruous elements, and neither daring to speak out wisely and
fearlessly on what should be said on the vital issues of the day.</p>

<p>-- Theodore Roosevelt</p>

<hr>
<h2>On Affiliation</h2>

<p>I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.</p>

<p>-- Will Rogers</p>

<title>The Lacey Act</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: law updated 1981 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Any Bugs to Declare?</h1>

<p>December 1994, from Kenelm W. Philip (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:fnkwp@aurora.alaska.edu">fnkwp@aurora.alaska.edu</a>) of the
Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, printed in <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~entomology/FleaNews/FleaNews49.html">
<cite>Flea News</cite></a> Volume 49:</p>

<p>Aside from the dangers involved in field trips to remote parts of the world,
the life of a museum entomologist used to be fairly tame. However, in 1981 all
that changed. An obscure law called the Lacey Act was updated - and museum
entomologists now lead complicated, and possibly dangerous, lives. What does
the Lacey Act do? It makes it a federal crime, punishable by a $150,000 fine,
to import, export, or take across a state line, any wildlife which was
originally obtained in violation of any foreign, U.S. federal, state or Indian
tribal law that protects wildlife. In 1981, the definition of 'wildlife' was
expanded to include the entire animal kingdom. (Wild plants indigenous to the
U.S. which are listed under CITES [Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] or protected under state law are
also covered).</p>

<p>For example, collecting an insect, even a mosquito or a cockroach in a
National
Park or National Wildlife Refuge without a permit, and then taking the specimen
to another state, is a violation of the Lacey Act. Note as well that 'wildlife'
includes any part of an organism (blood, DNA, etc.).</p>

<p>Many foreign countries have requirements for permits to take scientific
specimens out of the country. The Lacey Act means it is now a U.S. federal
crime to fail to comply with these permit rules - and ignorance is no excuse. A
number of Fish and Wildlife Service enforcement agents in the lower 48 [states]
have stated that the Lacey Act is retroactive in the following sense: if a
museum has a 100-year old insect specimen that was originally (for example)
taken from a foreign country without the requisite permit, that specimen is now
in violation of the Lacey Act. Most major museums in the country have numerous
specimens that have suddenly become contraband.</p>

<p>All this is bad enough - but then the Fish and Wildlife Service got into the
act by promulgating its own regulations. In order to bring scientific insect
specimens into the U.S., or take them out of the U.S., the researcher now has
to fill out F&WS Form 3-177. This form was originally designed for use by
commercial importers of wildlife materials and products. It requires the
importer/exporter to list every species of animal in the shipment, and the
number of individuals of each species.</p>

<p>Museum entomologists may return from a field trip with several thousand
specimens, or even tens of thousands of specimens - and many, sometimes most,
of these will probably be undetermined. You are allowed to bring in
undetermined material - provided that you re-file Form 3-177 every
180 days until all the material has been determined to species! In many groups
of insects it may take years, or even decades, to determine to species every
specimen in even a small collection, so Form 3-177 amounts to a serious
paperwork burden to any museum whose staff is actively working on foreign
material.</p>

<p>Failure to file the form makes you guilty of smuggling. Fortunately most
F&WS enforcement agents will make exceptions to the Form 3-177 requirement in
cases where the material cannot be enumerated (as for the millions of organisms
present in soil samples). Travelers who have picked up diseases in foreign
parts do not have to inventory their microorganisms.</p>

<p>Other consequences of these F&WS regulations are: entomologists are being
told that imported/exported specimens may not be sent through the mail, and
that all imports and exports of specimens must take place through a limited
number (nine) of official Ports of Entry. Packages of insect specimens are
being opened and 'inspected' by people with no entomological training and no
appreciation of how fragile such specimens are. Some foreign museums are
considering refusing to lend material (especially type specimens) until the
rules change.</p>

<p>Recently proposed changes in the F&WS regulations would add a provision that
importing eight or more similar specimens would create the presumption of
commercial use! A reported conversation with the author of this provision
indicated that eight beetles would be considered 'similar' regardless of how
many species (or families) were involved.</p>

<p>One of the major ways that the insect collection at the National Museum of
Natural History grows is through donations of private collections. The NMNH has
announced a new policy for donations: all specimens must be accompanied by
copies of all relevant collecting permits or by written evidence that no such
permits were required. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is requiring similar
documentation on all specimens sent to them from foreign countries for
determination.</p>

<p>These laws and regulations are seriously impeding taxonomic and other work
on insects and other 'lower' organisms, at the exact time that research on
biodiversity is becoming of critical importance. The laws passed by
well-meaning individuals, in a climate of opinion that has been affected by
concern for the environment (and possibly by animal-rights groups) - with
absolutely no understanding of the way insects and other lower organisms differ
from vertebrates. Scientific collecting is no danger to insect populations! The
fecundity of insects is so high that sheer destruction of habitat and
competition from introduced species are the only factors of any importance for
species survival.</p>

<p>What should we do about this situation? The only hope for the future of
entomological research is to get the Lacey Act, and the requirements for Form
3-177, changed so that for insects and other lower organism only threatened and
endangered species are covered. The original Lacey Act even had a sentence
beginning: "Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the importation of dead
natural-history specimens for museums or for scientific collections ...", which
seems to have been forgotten.</p>

<p>Life on earth rests on lower organisms. We could vanish and life would go on
- but if insects vanish we will all vanish with them. Research on insects needs
to be untrammeled, for our own good. As far as biodiversity research goes, the
current regulations amount to shooting oneself in
the foot.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>In September 1995, Philip updated the situation: the Fisheries and Wildlife
Service is revising regulation to make it easier for scientists to import and
export museum specimens. The basic problems of the Lacey Act remain, but some
of the worst features are being changed.</p>

<title>Stevia</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: importation banned May 1991 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The FDA: Protecting the American Public From Competition</h1>

<p>The apparent purpose of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
is to keep unsafe products off the shelves. The FDA fails, like all
government agencies fail, because of perverse incentives.</p>

<p>If a private organization fails at its goals, people generally
stop giving it money (buying its goods or contributing to its cause).
If a public agency fails, not only does its budget stay the same, but
often the agency can ask for <em>more</em> money because it obviously
does not have enough. Thus, public agencies have built-in incentives
for failure.</p>

<p>Second, public agencies have an advantage their private counterparts
don't -- the use of force. That capability attracts the attention of
people who want to use force to subsidize themselves or stifle their
competition. Thus, public agencies almost always wind up being manipulated
for purposes other than their apparent ones.</p>

<h2>Stevia</h2>

<p><i>Stevia rebaudiana</i> is an herb native to Paraguay and Brazil,
where inhabitants have used it for hundreds of years as a sweetener.
Stevia contains noncaloric sweeteners called glycosides, for which it
is grown commercially in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Central America,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/">the United States</a>,
Israel, Thailand and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a>.</p>

<p>Stevia is widely used in some countries; its extracts comprise
over 40% of the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japanese</a> sweetener market,
and are used by major
multinational food companies like Coca Cola and Beatrice foods.
Stevia has proven to be a safe, effective and inexpensive sweetener over
hundreds of years of use in many countries. Extensive scientific studies
have been conducted concerning its safety, chemistry and stability of use.</p>

<p>However, the FDA has declared stevia illegal in the United States.</p>

<p>Around 1987, the FDA began telling herb companies that they could
not sell stevia because it was an unapproved food additive. In May 1991,
the FDA prohibited the import of stevia. The FDA has rejected requests
to approve stevia on the basis of its long use and extensive study in
other countries, and on the basis of its being a natural whole food rather
than a chemical food additive.</p>

<p>Basically, stevia is illegal because it is unpatentable, and
no one can profit from putting it through the FDA's red tape. The
fact that this benefits large corporations like NutraSweet is probably
not a coincidence.</p>

<P>Intended to ensure consumer safety, the FDA has instead become a
means for the makers of more expensive chemical products to prevent
competition from less expensive natural products.</p>

<p>The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 may
prevent the FDA from considering stevia a food additive. While
its import remains banned, and it cannot be sold as a sweetener
or in another product, it may now be sold as a dietary supplement.</p>

<title>Transgenic Animals</title>
<!-- Place: Australia; USA -->
<!-- Time: October 1995; January 1996 -->

<body>

<h1>Human Organ Farms</h1>

<p>Experiments in xenotransplanation (cross-species organ transplants)
date back to the 1960's, with little success until recent advances in
genetic engineering. In the mid-1990's, scientists around the world
laid the groundwork for breeding pigs as organ farms, potentially saving
hundreds of thousands of lives per year.</p>

<p>Pigs have been chosen because they can be bred
rapidly, they can be raised free of known diseases, and they raise few
ethical objections compared to the use of primates. Genetic engineering
allows the pig cells to produce human proteins that prevent the organ
from being rejected.</p>

<p>In the United States, about 18,000 organ transplants are performed
each year, while another 40,000 qualified patients wait for donor organs,
and another 100,000 people die without qualifying. Initially, xenotransplants
will likely be used to prolong a patient's life until a human organ is
available.</p>

<p>Dr. David White, founder of one of four small U.S. companies working
on xenotransplantation, said, "The nice thing about the pig is you know
who the donor is going to be weeks or months before the transplant.
It's not like you're waiting for someone to fall off his motorcycle."</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies will be investing billions of dollars over
the next few years in xenotranplatation, and theoretically 100,000 lives
per year could be saved. But religious fanatics, animal rights kooks and
those idiots who think life owes them everything will undoubtedly try
to prevent any of this from occurring.</p>

<p>In October 1995, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australian</a> scientists
announced their progress towards
genetically engineering animals to grow organs that will not be rejected.
The scientists expect clinical trials by the late
1990s for transplanting pig organs into primates and then humans.</p>

<p>In another experiment, insulin-producing beta cells from specially
bred pigs enabled mouse and monkey transplantees to overcome diabetes.
Human tests are planned soon.</p>

<p>Overcoming diabetes is merely a foreshadowing of things to come. As
Gregory Benford wrote in the November 1995 <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite></a>, the
world may be entering "The Biological Century." Bioengineering may become
one of the driving forces of society and culture.</p>

<h1>Tissue Engineering</h1>

<p>Tissue engineering is the nascent science of growing living tissue
in laboratories for transplantation into humans. This technology will
revolutionize the field of reconstructive surgery, allowing the
successful regeneration of everything from skin for burn victims,
the liver for disease victims and ears and noses for people who have
lost or disfigured extremities.</p>

<p>In October 1995, University of Massachusetts and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology researchers announced success in growing cartilage
in the shape of a human ear on the back of a mouse. The researchers used a
polymer framework to grow human cartilage cells on the mouse, specially
bred not to reject human cells.</p>

<p>Scientists have successfully grown liver, skin, cartilage, bone, ureters,
heart valves, tendons, intestines, blood vessels and breast tissue on
polymers. Although no products are yet publicly available, in the future
reconstructive surgery will be much more complete and successful as the
result of tissue engineering. Tissue-engineered heart valves are already
in clinical trials.</p>

<title>Superbugs</title>
<!-- Place: global -->

<h1>Superbugs</h1>

<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, medicine made great strides
against diseases caused by bacteria. Antibiotics played a large role in
eliminating or at least reducing the severity of many diseases. However,
as the twentieth century closes, some bacteria are evolving strains that
are resistant to current antibiotics. While developing stronger antibiotics
will buy some time against drug-resistant "superbugs," life-threatening
bacterial diseases are bound to stage a comeback in the next decades.</p>

<p>The bacterium enterococcus lives in the nasal passages and intestines
of many people without causing harm, but in patients with weakened immune
systems can be deadly. In recent years, strains have emerged that are
resistant even to the emergency use drug vanomycin, with some patients
dying of infections for lack of an available treatment. Scientist fear
that enterococcus' resistance may be transferred to more virulent bacterium
capable of causing epidemics. In February 1996, researchers announced that
a new antibiotic, Synercid, has shown mixed effectiveness against enterococcus
in emergency use testing.</p>

<h1>The Randal Schwartz Case</h1>

<p>Computers are a case of technology outpacing the legal system. Computer
technology has made possible many things that were not before, and has
raised many legal questions. Many areas remain with little or no
legislation and little or no court precedent.</p>

<p>Randal L. Schwartz
(<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:merlyn@stonehenge.com">merlyn@stonehenge.com</a>,
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WEB]"><a
HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~merlyn/">http://www.teleport.com/~merlyn/</a>)
is a computer consultant with Stonehenge Consulting Services and the
inventor of the Perl programming language, which enjoys widespread use.
His case is also an example of misunderstandings being interpreted as
computer crime.</p>

<p>While working as a consultant with multinational microchip manufacturer
Intel Corporation, Schwartz set up two ways of checking his Intel email
via the Internet, and in an attempt to verify the security of one of Intel's
computers, he ran the "crack" password-guessing
program on an Intel password file. Intel considered the Internet access a
security breach, and the password crack to be theft of sensitive
information.</p>

<p>In March 1994, Schwartz was indicted on three felony counts of computer
crime under Oregon state law. He was convicted in July 1995, and
sentenced in September 1995 to 5 years probation, 480 hours of
community service, and 90 days jailtime (which may be dismissed for
excellent behavior). Intel is also seeking $72,000 restitution.
Schwartz has spent over $130,000 on his legal defense, most of it
his own money, with additional contributions from individuals and
organizations on the Internet.</p>

<title>Rodgers' Testimony</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1994? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>T.J. Rodgers' Congressional Testimony</h1>

<p>T.J. Rodgers, President and CEO of Cypress Semiconductor, testified
against Bill Clinton's high-technology policy before the U.S. House
House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.</p>

As reported by <cite>First!</cite>, Rodgers challenged government intervention
on behalf of science and wanted to dispel the myth that high-technology
leaders stand uniformly behind Clinton's policies.</p>

<p>Rodgers told the Subcommittee:  "The administration
would have us believe that the business leaders of Silicon Valley stand
unanimously behind its program.  The image of John Scully, CEO of Apple
Computer, sitting beside the First Lady and applauding the State of the
Union address has been beamed far and wide by White House political
operatives.</p>

<p>"I am here today in strong opposition to the administration's economic
program in general and its technology agenda in particular.  I am not
alone."</p>

<p>Rodgers' own company is the highly successful Cypress Semiconductor,
maker of the SPARC microchip series. Rodgers testified that Cypress
generated more than $1 billion in cumulative revenue, $160 million in
profits (of which $60 million was paid in taxes), 1,500 jobs, and paid
cumulative salaries of nearly $500 million (of which employees paid taxes of
nearly $150 million).</p>

<p>"If that is an `excess of the 1980s' let's have more," Rodgers said.  "As
an entrepreneur, I should not have to apologize for my success and that of
the company.  I am offended by the administration's divisive rhetoric.</p>

<p>"As we debate the virtues of raising taxes on individuals and
corporations, let's not debate abstractions.  Let's debate the realities of
who pays and the impact of raising taxes on those people and companies."</p>

<p>Rodgers also presented written comments from other technology leaders:<p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joe Zemke, chief executive officer, Amdahl Corp. -- "Whether it is
sugar subsidies or `investments' in high performance computing, the Clinton
program represents the same logic:  siphoning dollars from individuals and
corporations and allocating them through a process that is terribly
inefficient -- a process that is responsive not to market requirements, but
to bureaucratic empires and political payoffs."</p></li>

<li><p>Don Valentine, founding venture capitalist and director, Apple
Computer; director, Cisco Systems -- "Don't assume that the Pepsi-Cola kid
(John Scully) speaks for Silicon Valley.  We do not need pretenders who
speak for us.  We have visionaries who are rare, important and doers."</p></li>

<li><p>Finis Conner, founder and chief executive officer, Conner Peripherals -
- "The development of all technologies and products involves risks and
rewards.  The government should not be in the business of speculating with
taxpayers' money on which of those risks will be winners and which will be
losers."</p></li>

<li><p>Scott McNealy, chief executive officer, Sun Microsystems -- "In the
current economic climate, the proposed increase in the corporate tax rate
does not encourage job growth, business investment, or global
competitiveness.  Rather, it penalizes profits and will result in further
loss of jobs."</p></li>

</ul>

<p><cite>First!</cite> reported that Ridgers also cited Gil Amelio, chief
executive officer, National Semiconductor; Wilf Corrigan,
chief executive officer, LSI Logic; Pierre Lamond, founder, National
Semiconductor; L.J. Sevin, chairman, Cyrix; John Adler, chief executive
officer, Adaptec; and Roger Emerick, chief executive officer, Lam Research.</p>

<p>Rodgers criticized Clinton's belief that government would do a good job
picking winners in the marketplace: "Essentially, the administration is
arguing that by taking my money in the form of higher taxes and `investing'
it in subsidies, it can make better investments -- create more jobs and
wealth -- than the venture-capital firms with which I invest -- firms that
are the envy of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a> and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. That logic
defies common sense."</p>

<p>Rodgers said that what government needs to do is get out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The regional Bell operating companies would gladly hook fiber optics
from the long-haul network to the home.  But they are prevented from doing
so by regulations that make the huge capital investments
uneconomical."</p></li>

<li><p>"Cable operators are already hooked into 60 percent of American homes.
They too could make the connection with existing long-haul data
superhighways, but they are prevented by regulations that declare them a
`natural monopoly' and restrict them to television and movie
business."</p></li>

<li><p>"The long-haul superhighway could be hooked into the home through
wireless circuits.  But the frequencies required are currently being held up
by the Federal Communications Commission."</p></li>

<li><p>"The opportunities for [budget] cuts go way beyond headcount," Rodgers
said. "We could spend hours listing wasteful and unnecessary programs --
programs that made sense 30 or 40 years ago, when they were created, but
that make no sense today."</p></li>

</ul>

<title>Letters to IEEE</title>
<!-- Place: global? or USA -->
<!-- Time: magazine issue May 1993 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>IEEE Letters Opposing Government Intervention</h1>

<p>From the Letters to the Editor in the May 1993 <cite>Computer
Magazine</cite> of the IEEE:</p>

<p>... In contrast, Boeing leads the world in jetliners despite (not because
of) DoD funding of R&D for a multi-engine jet tanker. DoD funded R&D for
other aerospace firms, but somehow, that never translated into market-leading
commercial products.  Indeed, many of those firms are no longer in (the
aerospace) business.</p>

<p>So it must take something other than abundant federal
R&D funding to enable a business to capture and sustain
market leadership in high-tech products.  And it is
that "something" that federal buereaucrats cannot
identify, let alone nurture.  Would an activist
industrial policy "help" the world-leading US computer
industry?  Hardly!  Would federal subsidies and regulations increase market
share for Intel or Microsoft? You must be kidding!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>However, there is no such thing as the absence of
industrial policy.  So, if an activist policy can only
do harm, then the US should explicitly adopt a passive
industrial policy...</p>

<p>David A. Nelson, Information Engineering, Bellevue,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a></p>

<hr>

<p>... On the issue of industrial policy and the government's role,
there are some examples of successful industry-government collaboration.  The
one cited in the magazine appears to be a success.  However, one
just has to look at government funding of supersonic
transport to find real failures.  Failure would probably be much more frequent
than success.  The problem is that money is generally cheap to government;  it
is
just taxes.  There is no one to call a halt to developments that are not
promising.</p>

<p>Stig Nilsson, Cupertino, CA</p>

<hr>

<p>As a native Taiwanese, I appreciate your high regard
for our "miracle" economy.  But I'd like to point out
that even a "successful" industrial policy is not
without its drawbacks.</p>

<p>Among the three most vibrant <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/">Asian</a> economies -- <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>,
Taiwan, and South Korea -- Taiwan has, in my opinion,
the best industrial policy.  Not because its policy
was better planned, better coordinated, or better
executed, but because Taiwan generally offers the most
"hands off" policy.  The strength of Taiwan's economy
has always been its small and medium size businesses.
Those small but highly nimble, totally market-oriented
companies and factories are the true heroes of the
"Taiwan Miracle."</p>

<p>... Japan's mighty Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) ... was, after all, the agency that
told Honda to stay out of the automobile business and
Sony to stay out of electronics.  Unfortunately for
their American competitors, Honda and Sony did not
listen.  It is striking to note that the majority of
Japan's most competitive companies are the ones who
received little or no help from their government.</p>

<p>... For the past 40 years countries like Japan and
Taiwan have been trying to catch up with us.  The path
of development was clear-cut for them.  It is obviously
easier to make decisions when you know exactly where
you are heading.  On the other hand, America has been
and always will be at the technology frontier.  It is
much more difficult to forecast your direction when
there is no one ahead of you;  just ask IBM.</p>

<p>...</p>

<title>Dual-Use Investments</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1900's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Dual-Use Investments</h1>

<p>From Greg Aharonian of the Internet Patent News Service:</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk in government and industry circles about dual-use
investments by various government agencies, direct investments/subsidies by
government agencies, and in general having the government act as a venture
capitalist.  In particular, much attention is focused on the Department of
Defense, which has been involved in such activities for decades.</p>

<p>Missing from all of these discussions is any critical analysis of the
ability of our government, or any government, to outperform the marketplace
(venture capitalists, stock markets, etc) in investing in profitable and
sustainable technologies.  Unfortunately there is little comprehensive data
to analyze these activities, and few intimately familiar both with government
activities and the operations of the marketplace (and independent of both).</p>

<p>Two studies I have come across conclude that much dual-use investment has
little effect on the general US economy, and suggest that maybe it would be
better for the government to influence such activities through lower tax rates
(or specialized tax incentives), instead of taxing and then redistributing the
money.</p>

<p>The first study appeared in the journal <cite>Scientometrics</cite> in an
article titled "The Impact of Warfare on the Rate of Invention: A Time Series
Analysis of United States Patent Activity" (Vol 3, No. 6, 437-455, 1981),
with the following abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The outbreak of war is generally thought to shift the fields
in which research is conducted.  As a result, military conflict
has historically been credited with being the catalyst which has
caused decisive technological advances.  It is also generally
suggested that warfare has a systematic impact on the intensity
of inventive activity.  Most scholars have claimed that wars
increase inventiveness, although a few argue that conflict is a
hindrance to research.  This question has not received extensive
empirical examination.</p>

<p>Using United States data, we show that a basic pattern is
repeatedly observed.  Immediately after the outbreak of a war,
there is a significant decline in inventiveness, which is followed
by a marked surge.  The average net result is a virtual negation
of the two trends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second study appeared in the journal <cite>IEEE Transactions on
Engineering Management</cite>, Volume 40, Number 2, May 1993, in an article
titled "Defense R&D, Technology and Economic Performance: A Longitudinal
Analysis of the U.S.  Experience", with the following abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper examines the issue of the impact of defense expenditure
from a different perspective, i.e., in terms of the direct
relationships between defense R&D and economic performace as well
as the indirect relationships via the development of (1) technical
and scientific skills and (2) new technology.  The model was
estimated for the period 1955-1988 on a time-series set measured
as elasticities.  The effect of defense R&D is observed particularly
through technological change as measured by the number of patents
granted to U.S. organizations and individuals.  There is no
statistically significant evidence of resource diversion or
"crowding effect" on the civilian economy due to defense R&D.</p>

<p>Similarly, there does not seem to be any statistically visible
evidence of direct effect from defense R&D to the economy. 
Interestingly, the non-R&D aspect of defense spending appears to
have no statistically significant effect on the major components
of civilian economic performance, technical skills formation or
technological change.  From a policy point of view, this suggests
that technical spillovers may be limited to a specific kind of
defense spending and not to defense spending in general.  Another
interesting implication is the rivalry between R&D and non-R&D
defense spending in favor of the latter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These articles suggest that at the gross macroeconomic level, explicit
government effects on business formation through technology investment, as
measured by invention rates reflected in patent data, are marginal at best.
Not to say that the research and development funds that the government tries
to invest don't lead to significant new discoveries (I'm thinking of the many
academic discoveries done by people on NSF funding for example), or that
government purchases don't help new technologies (the microprocessor for
example), but rather that explicit efforts (such as those war related as
above) to achieve such results probably have little effect.</p>

<title>Science Funding</title>

<h1>Science Funding</h1>

<p>This book review of <cite>Science Funding</cite>, by Joseph P. Martino, 
(c) 1992 (Transaction Publishers, ISBN 1-56000-033-3, 392 pages)
was written by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/BarryFagin.html">Barry Fagin</a>
and posted on an Internet mailing list.</p>

<hr>

<p>A couple of months ago, I thought it might be interesting to look at
applying public choice theory to science funding. I thought that by bringing
the principles of public choice theory to bear, the "public goods" argument
could be satisfactorily refuted and scientists would better understand why
federal support for R&D is neither necessary nor desirable.</p>

<p>Last month, however, I learned that a research scientist has spent a
considerable amount of time over the past few years doing just this.
His name is Joseph Martino, and the results of his research have just
been published in a book titled <cite>Science Funding: Politics and
Porkbarrel</cite>. Completed with the assistance of the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason Foundation</a> and
other groups, Martino's book weaves history, economics, and science together to
show the problems associated with governmental support of research.</p>

<p>The book is extensively researched, with a large amount of data on federal
support of R&D. Martino attempts to address every argument advanced in
favor of governmental support of research, and is able to marshall
considerable evidence against it. Briefly, the classic argument in favor
of federal support of R&D was first given by Kenneth Arrow in 1962. Arrow
states that a firm will increase spending on research only so long as the
marginal return on it exceeds the marginal return from other investment
opportunities. Problems arise when the firm's return is less than the
return to society as a whole (i.e. when it can't "appropriate" all the
benefits of the research). Under these conditions, society would be better
off if the firm spent more money on research, although the firm would lose
money. Under these conditions, society will be better off if government funds
the additional research, equating marginal social cost with marginal social
benefit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the flaws in this argument are not obvious to most
scientists,
and in fact as far as I can tell they have never been refuted satisfactorily
in the scientific press. Martino notes that Arrow's argument has three
problems, any one of which is sufficient to render it invalid:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Empirical observations show that under competitive conditions
firms can actually <em>overinvest</em> in R&D, in the sense that private
and social benefit is less than social cost.</p></li>

<li><p>Even if firms do actually underinvest in R&D, there is no way for
government to determine, <em>even in theory</em>, the level of funding 
necessary to equate marginal social costs with marginal social 
benefits. The social return from foregone investments if government
funding of research is increased simply cannot be calculated. Given
what we now know about centralized planning and distributed decision
making, it is clear that the federal government cannot and never will
be able to determine the "right" amount of money to spend on research.
The answer according to scientists will always be "more".</p></li>

<li><p>Arrow's argument implicitly assumes that government is a neutral
agent, weighing costs and benefits in an attempt to achieve optimal
outcomes. But we know from public choice theory that this is simply
not so. Agents of government are human beings who, like the rest of
us, respond to incentives. The incentive structure created by
government virtually guarantees that even if the right amount of
research funding could be calculated, it would not be spent on
nonappropriable research. Instead, it would be spent on politically
useful research, rent seeking, and other non-productive activities.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The book is also enlightening in its survey of scientists attitudes,
many of whom believe steady funding to be an entitlement. Numerous
scientists who responded to a survey wanted "automatic funding if
continuous publication is present", "longer grant periods with fewer
strings on renewal", and so forth.  As a study in sociology, Martino's
book is a depressing reminder of how pervasive the entitlement mentality
has become, even among the intellectual and professional class.</p>

<p>Martino's book is available from Transaction Publishers, Rutgers --

<title>Testimony of James Wright</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ten Fundamental Gun Facts</h1>

<p>March 31, 1995 statement of Tulane University criminologist James Wright
before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Crime of
the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p><i>Dr. WRIGHT:</i> Thank you so much, and thank you for the opportunity to be
here.  My name is James Wright... and I'm a professor of sociology at Tulane
University.  I've spent the last twenty years of my academic career conducting
research on guns and violence in American society.  In the course of these two
decades, I have come to the conclusion that there are at least ten simple, but
terribly important facts about guns in America that every participant in the
gun control debate should be aware of.  I have referred to these in a recent
paper as "Ten Essential Observations on Guns in America," and my point is to
share them with the Committee today.</p>

<p> While many of the facts of the gun control issue are hotly contested, and
matters of great dispute, the ten fundamental truths that I wish to discuss are
matters about which everyone more or less agrees.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="households.html">Half of U.S. households own guns</a>
<li><a href="circulation.html">200,000,000 firearms are in the U.S. now</a>
<li><a href="sport.html">Most guns are owned for recreation</a>
<li><a href="defense.html">Many guns are owned for defense against crime</a>
<li><a href="retail.html">Bad guys don't buy guns through retail channels</a>
<li><a href="violence.html">Bad guys carry guns for surviving violent world</a>
<li><a href="law.html">Bad guys indifferent to existing gun control laws</a>
<li><a href="demand.html">Demand for guns creates its own supply</a>
<li><a href="evil.html">Guns are not inherently good or evil</a>
<li><a href="culture.html">Guns are part of the American culture</a>
</ol>
 
<p>And, thank you so much for your attention.  Dr. Bordua...</p>

<title>Militia</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Citizen Militia Movement</h1>

<p>The true purpose of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is to
preserve the concept of the citizen militia, an armed citizenry willing
and able to defend its rights against enemies foreign and domestic.</p>

<p>Citizen militia have a long history. For most of human history and
pre-history, countries had no standing armies, but instead relied on all
able-bodied males to take arms when necessary to defend the community. Rather
than being obsoleted by modern technology and industrial civilization,
militia can now easily include anyone who wishes to help, including women
and the elderly.</p>

<p>With the recent rise of gun control legislation, a grass-roots movement
has arisen to reclaim the tradition of the citizen militia. Some of the modern
militia movement is rooted in libertarianism; some in conservatism; some in
fringe groups such as survivalists and racists.</p>

<h1>Firearms and Crime</h1>

<p>One of the most common reasons for gun ownership is as a deterrent to
crime. Gun grabbers claim that guns cause crime rather than deter it.
Where do the facts stand? Read on.</p>

<p>The obsolesence of self-defense is one of the great myths of our time.
Police forces were never meant to, don't and are <a href="protect.html">unable

<title>The Politics of Firearms</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Politics of Firearms</h1>

<p>Efforts at gun control are misguided or even totalitarian in intent.
Gun control proponents often resort to <a href="grabbers.html">perpetuating
myths and lies</a> to gain support.</p>

<p>Gun owners should prefer <a href="lvr.html">Libertarians over Republicans</a>
based on principle and pragmatism.</p>

<p>Gun grabbers like to parade around a few police chiefs and other law
enforcement officials to demonstrate their support for each new round
of gun control. Survey after survey, however, has found that the vast

<h1>Firearms Humor</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</h2>

<p>I thought I saw this somewhere before, but a Libernet poster attributed
this to Todd Prior (todd@ftp.com):</p>

<p>I was bored last week and a thought occured to me.  Why is it that there is a
government bureau which oversees alcohol, tobacco, and firearms?  I was bored
enough to call up the regional office of said bureau.  I asked the man who
answered the phone "What wine goes best with an M-16?"  He did his best to be
helpful, however.  "That depends.  What are you smoking?"</p>

<hr>

<h2>Alternative Interpretation of Militia</h2>

<p>From William A. Arvola (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:arvola@sol.acs.unt.edu">arvola@sol.acs.unt.edu</a>), University of
North Texas Department of Mathematics, (817) 565-4701, Denton, TX 76203:</p>

<p>The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states:
"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,
the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."
The classical pro-firearms doctrine states that "well-regulated militia"
means "well-trained armed citizens."</p>

<p>My objection is that I resent being told by a bunch of dead guys what it
means to be a "well-behaved citizen".  I am one of the sovereign people of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> after all. 
On the other hand, I thoroughly endorse their criteria for
what it means to be a "well-behaved government".
So, I got out my "big" dictionary and looked up "well-regulated
militia".</p>

<p>"Regulate" comes from "regula" meaning "law" or "order". Hence, "regulate"
means "to bind by law" or "to put in good order".  So, "well-regulated" means
"law-abiding", "orderly" or "well-behaved".  So far so good.  But now:
"Militia" is the plural of "miles" meaning "soldier"! "Soldier" comes from
"soldare" meaning "to pay". In other words, "militia" = "soldiers" =
"paid agents"!</p>

<p>The Second Amendment now reads:  "Well-behaved soldiers being
necessary to ...".  I can hear the voices of indignation
already.  But hold your criticisms for one moment more, I ask.
The Amendment calls for good behavior by government agents
and provides a remedy for bad behavior: "As a defense against badly-behaved
paid agents of the government, these being a threat to liberty, the right
of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."</p>

<p>So if they wish to say that "militia" = "National Guard", I say fine!
And if they ask what is "bad behavior" for an agent of
the government, I point to the rest of the Bill of Rights.
Note that no burden is placed on the right or the people.
The burden is on the government, as it should be. Perhaps Mason and <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">Madison</a>
snuck in <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Jefferson's</a>
"right to revolt" after all!</p>

<title>Guns in Households</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Half of U.S. Households Own Guns</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My first essential observation is that half the households in the
country possess at least one gun.  So far as I can tell, the first
question about gun ownership in a national probability sample of
U.S. adults was asked in 1959, and similar questions have been asked
dozens of times since.  Over the last 35 years or so that we've
been asking the question, every survey has reported more or less the
same result, namely, that half of all U.S. households own one or
more guns.</p>

<p>Although many people know this to be true, I think many
of the implications of this fact are not well appreciated.  The fact
that the ownership percentage has been effectively constant for
nearly four decades, for example, while at the same time the total
number of guns in circulation has increased rather substantially,
implies that the increasing supply of guns has been absorbed largely
by the purchase of additional guns among households already owning
one or more of them.  Indeed there is fairly substantial and
independent evidence that the average number of guns owned by
persons owning <em>any</em> has increased from about three guns 15 years ago
to approximately four guns today.  I think it is also obvious that
from the viewpoint of public safety, the transition from N to N + 1
guns is considerably less ominous than the transition from no guns
to one gun.</p>

<p>If this first implication is correct, incidentally, it means that
most of the people in the gun shops today buying new firearms
already own guns -- a useful point to keep in mind when pondering
the alleged "cooling off" function to be served by waiting periods
imposed at the point of retail sale.</p>

<p> A second implication is that gun ownership is not deviant
behavior, but rather, normative behavior across vast swaths of the
social landscape.  There are areas of the country where it would be
an odd person indeed who did not own a gun.</p>

<p> Finally, when we attempt to control crime or violence by
controlling the general ownership and use of guns among the public
at large, we are attempting to control the behaviors of a very small
fraction of the population, the violent or criminally-inclined
fraction, by controlling the behaviors and activities of roughly
half the American population, and whatever else might be said about
such an approach, it is certainly not very efficient.</p>

<title>Guns in Circulation</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>200,000,000 Firearms in Circulation in the U.S.</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>The second essential observation on guns in America today is
that there are already something like 200,000,000 firearms in
circulation, give or take a few tens of millions, to be sure.
It has been said, I believe correctly, that firearms are the most
commonly owned pieces of sporting equipment in the United States,
with the exception of pairs of sneakers and running shoes.  It is
not entirely clear just how many acts of gun violence occur in the
United States in any typical year. In recent years, we've been
pushing 40,000 deaths from firearms. There are, in addition to
that, perhaps a few hundred thousand nonfatal, but injurious,
firearms accidents, conceivably 500,000 or 600,000 chargeable firearms
crimes committed every year, and God-knows-how-many instances where
guns are used to intimidate or to prey upon one's fellow human
beings.</p>

<p> Making very generous allowances all around, however, the total
number of acts of accidental and intentional gun violence, whether
fatal or not, whether injurious or not, cannot possibly be more than
a couple of million per annum at the absolute outside.  This
implies, moreover, that the 200,000,000 firearms now circulating
in the U.S. market would be sufficient to sustain gun violence at
the current rate for at least another century, this even assuming
that every gun was used once and only once for some nefarious
purpose, and that all additions to the supply were halted
permanently and at once.  Because of the immensely large number
of firearms already circulating in the U.S. market, the violence-
reductive effects even of fairly draconian gun control measures
might very well not be felt for many decades.</p>

<title>Guns for Recreation</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Most Guns Owned for Recreation</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>A third observation is that most of the 200,000,000 guns that
are out there are owned for what I would consider to be socially
innocuous sport and recreational reasons. About a third of the
guns presently in circulation are handguns, the remainder rifles
and shotguns.  When one asks gun owners why they own guns, various
sport and recreational activities dominate the responses: hunting,
target shooting, collecting, and the like.  Even when the question
is restricted just to handgun owners, about 40% will say they own
the gun for recreational applications, another 40% will say they
own it for self-protection, and the remaining 20% will cite some
job-related reason as the reason for them to own a gun.</p>

<p> Thus, in the majority, I believe gun ownership is a topic more
appropriate to the sociology of leisure than to the criminology or
epidemiology of violence.  Unfortunately, when we seek to control
violence by controlling the general ownership and use of firearms
among the public at large, it at least looks as though we think we
have intuited some direct causal connection between drive-by
shootings in the inner city and squirrel hunting or skeet shooting
in the hinterland.  Or such, in any case, is the implication that
the nation's squirrel hunters and skeet shooters often draw, and
frankly, it's no wonder they sometimes question the motives,
not to mention the sanity, of anybody who would suggest such a
preposterous thing.</p>

<title>Guns for Defense</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Many Guns Owned for Defense</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My fourth observation is that many firearms are also owned for
self-defense against crime, that some are indeed used for that
purpose, and, whether they are actually any safer or not, many
people certainly seem to feel safer when they have a gun.  Findings
have been mentioned this morning from recent work done by my
colleague Gary Kleck at Florida State University that Americans
use guns to protect themselves from crime as often as a couple of
million times a year, a finding that I know the other panelist Dr.
Bordua will discuss in more detail.  If this is true, it's very hard
to square with the common assumption of gun control advocates that
guns are not efficacious as a private defense against crime.</p>

<p> Whatever the true number of self-defensive uses proves to be,
about a quarter of all gun owners, and about 40% of handgun owners
mention defense against crime as the main reason they owned a gun,
and large percentages who give some other main reason will mention
self-defense as a secondary reason.</p>

<p> Gun owners and gun advocates insist that guns provide real
protection, as indeed the panel that preceded us testified, and
indeed as Gary Kleck's findings suggest.  Anti-gun advocates insist
that the sense of security is more illusory than real. But the
fact is practically everything people do to defend against crime
provides only the illusion of security, in that any such measure
can be defeated by a sufficiently clever and motivated criminal.</p>

<p>Most people have realized, no doubt correctly, that the police
cannot protect them from crime.  So people face the need to protect
themselves, and many choose to own a gun along with taking many
other measures for precisely this purpose.  My question is whether
a society that is manifestly incapable of protecting its citizens
from crime really has any right or moral authority to tell people
what they may or may not do to protect themselves.</p>

<h1>Bad Guys Don't Buy Guns at Wal-Mart</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My fifth observation is that the bad guys do not obtain their
guns through normal retail channels.  Research on both adult and
juvenile felons and offenders has made it obvious that the illegal
firearms market is dominated overwhelmingly by informal swaps,
trades, and purchases involving family members, friends,
acquaintances, drug dealers, street and black market sources of
various sorts.  It is a pretty rare criminal indeed who attempts
to acquire a gun through a conventional over-the-counter transaction
with a normal retail outlet.</p>

<p> Now, many efforts at gun control pertain to the initial retail
sale of weapons, for example, the prohibition against gun purchases
by people with felony records, or by people with alcohol and drug
abuse histories, or the national five-day waiting period in the
Brady Bill, or various state and local permit and registration laws.</p>

<p> Since felons rarely obtain guns through customary retail
channels, these kinds of controls imposed at the point of retail
sale must necessarily miss the vast majority of criminal firearms
transactions.</p>

<p>Having learned now well more than a decade ago,
incidentally, that the criminal acquisition of guns involves
these informal and hard-to-regulate transfers, average gun owners
often conclude, whether correctly or not, that such measures as
registration, permits, waiting periods, and so on and so forth,
must therefore be intended primarily to keep tabs on them, that
registration or permit requirements are just the first step towards
outright confiscation of all privately held firearms, for example,
or that mandated registration of new gun purchases is an unwarranted
police-state intrusion on the Constitutional rights of law-abiding
citizens.</p>

<p>It doesn't really matter whether they're correct in
this judgement or not, that they reason in this vein, I think,
is sufficient.  It is reasoning in precisely this vein that often
seems bizarre, or even psychotic, to proponents of these kinds of
measures, but it is exactly the style of reasoning, I think, that
raises the stakes in the debate over guns and that accounts for the
white-hot ferocity of that debate today.</p>

<title>Guns for Violence</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

<h1>Bad Guys Inhabit Violent World</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My sixth observation is that the bad guys inhabit a violent
world.  As such, a gun often spells a life or death difference
to them. If you ask felons, whether adult or juvenile, why they
own guns, why they carry guns, themes of self protection, self-
defense, survival, and so on, dominate their responses.  Very few
of the bad guys say they acquire or carry guns specifically for
offensive or crime-committing purposes, although that is obviously
how many of them get used.  These men live in an extraordinarily
hostile environment.  Many of them come to believe, no doubt
correctly, that their ability to survive in that environment depends
critically on being adequately armed.  "Adequately armed," in this
case, means being better armed than your most likely adversary,
namely the police.  If sheer survival is indeed the issue, then a
gun is a bargain at practically any price.</p>

<p>As James Q. Wilson has recently argued, the largest share of the
gun violence problem results from the wrong people carrying guns at
the wrong time and place.  The survival motive among the bad guys
means exactly that the wrong kinds of people will be carrying guns
pretty much all the time. The evident implication is that the bad
guys have to be disarmed on the streets if rates of gun violence are
to decline, and that, I think, implies a range of interventions
far removed from what gun control advocates have recently urged
on the American population.</p>

<h1>Bad Guys' Gun Usage Already Illegal</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My seventh observation is that everything the bad guys do with
their guns is already against the law.  That criminals will
generally be indifferent to the law would seem to follow from the
definition of the terms, but it's a lesson that we've had to learn
time and again throughout our history.  As a matter of fact, and as
has already been stated by the panel this morning, gun acquisition
by felons, whether from retail or private sources, for whatever
reason, is already_illegal. Yet obviously felons still acquire
guns.  Since practically everything the bad guys do with their guns,
or do to obtain their guns is already against the law, one is
entitled to wonder whether there is some new law that we haven't
yet thought up that we can somehow pass that will persuade them to
stop it.</p>

<title>Demand for Guns</title>

<h1>Demand for Guns Creates Own Supply</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My eighth observation, is a theoretical observation from my
colleagues in the Department of Economics.  Demand creates its own
supply.  This is sometimes called the First Law of Microeconomics,
and it clearly_holds whether the commodity in demand is legal or
illegal. So long as a demand for some product exists, then there
will be profit to be made in satisfying that demand, and therefore
the demand for that product will be satisfied.  That is only a
fancy way of saying that as long as people wish to own guns, be
they criminals or average Joes, then guns will be there for them
to own.</p>

<p> I think it relevant that, for example, Brazil, manufactures
small arms.  Brazil makes actually pretty inexpensive, but
relatively decent small arms.  I think in fundamental respects
the question whether we can disarm the American criminal population
amounts to asking whether an organized criminal enterprise that
successfully imports hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into
the U.S. market every year would not find the means to illegally
import hundreds of tons of handguns from Brazil, if there were
some reason to do so, or some profit to be made in so doing.
And, if you agree with me that this proposition is more or less
self-evidently true, then you will conclude that we will never
reduce the supply of firearms to the criminal population by
enough to make an appreciable difference.</p>

<title>Good and Evil Guns</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Guns Are Not Good or Evil</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My ninth observation is that per se guns are neither inherently
good nor inherently evil. Guns, that is, do not possess their own
teleology.  Benevolence and malevolence are things that inhere in
the motives and behavior of people, not in the technology they
possess.  All guns, are nothing more, nothing less, than a chunk of
machined metal that has a variety of purposes to which it can be
put, all involving a small projectile hurtling at high velocity
downrange, to lodge itself in a target.  We can only say that guns
are good when the target strikes us as an appropriate one, and evil
when not.  The gun itself is immaterial to this moral judgement.</p>

<p>Singling out certain types of guns for specific policy attention,
'assault weapons' these days, "Saturday Nite Special" handguns in an
earlier area... earlier era, is almost always justified on the
grounds that the type of gun in question "has no legitimate use"
or "is designed only to kill."  By definition, however, all guns
are designed to kill, which is to say, designed to hurtle a
projectile downrange to lodge in a target.  And if one grants the
proposition, which, I admit is an arguable proposition, that self-
defense against predation and plunder is a legitimate reason
to own a gun, then all guns, regardless of their type, regardless
of their characteristics, regardless of their firepower, regardless
of their quality, all guns, regardless, have some potentially
legitimate application.</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that the focus... the frequent focus,
in gun control circles on certain "bad guns," is fundamentally
misplaced -- the idea that there are good ones and bad ones and that
we want to get rid of the bad ones.  When all is said and done, it
is the behavior of people, I think, that we evidently need to
control.</p>

<title>American Gun Culture</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Guns Are Part of American Culture</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>And then, finally, my tenth observation is that guns are
important elements of our history and our culture.  Attempts to
control crime by regulating the ownership or use of firearms are
attempts to regulate the artifacts and activities of a culture that
in its own way is as unique as any of the other myriad cultures that
comprise the American ethnic mosaic.  This is what is referred to as
the American gun culture, about which many have written, and, I
believe it remains among the least understood of any of the various
subcultural strands that make up modern society.</p>

<p> The existence and characteristics of the American gun culture
also have implications that are rarely appreciated.  For one, gun
control deals with matters that people feel strongly about, that are
part of their background, and their heritage, and their upbringing
... and their worldview. Advocates for gun control are frequently
taken aback by the stridency with which their seemingly modest and
sensible proposals are attacked.  But from the gun culture's point
of view, restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms amount to
the systematic destruction of a valued way of life, and are, in that
sense, a form of cultural genocide.  Scholars, and criminologists,
and legislators, who speculate on the problem of guns and crime
and violence would, I think, profit to look at things, at least
occasionally, from the gun culture's point of view.</p>

<p>There are about 50,000,000 U.S. families who own firearms, and
hardly any of these families have ever harmed anyone with their
guns, and virtually none ever intend to.  Nearly everything these
families will ever do with their guns is both legal, and largely
innocuous.  So when we advocate restrictions on their rights to own
guns, as a means to fighting crime, we are casting aspersions on
their decency, as though we somehow hold them responsible for
the crime and violence that plague the nation.  Is it any wonder
they object often loudly and vociferously to such slander?</p>

<h1>Congressional Hearing Blasts BATF</h1>

<p>The criminal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) was
investigated by Congress in hearings before the Subcommittee on Treasury,
Post Office and General Appropriations of the Senate Appropriations Committee
in July 1979 and April 1980, and before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of
the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 1980.</p>

<p>The final report called BATF's enforcement tactics
<font size=+1>"constitutionally, legally, and practically reprehensible"</font>
and said there is "little doubt that
the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of
the United States."</p>

<p>In particular, the report found of the BATF:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It has trampled upon the Second Amendment by chilling exercise of the
right to keep and bear arms by law abiding citizens."
<li>"It has offended the Fourth Amendment by unreasonably searching and seizing
private property."
<li>"It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just
compensation and by entrapping honest citizens without regard for their right
to due process of law."
<li>"Approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary
citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge."
</ul>

<p>The BATF revoked the Federal Firearms License (FFL) of a sporting
goods store owner who refused to comply with an illegal request.</p>

<p>As reported by Neal Talbot in the March 1, 1991 <cite>Gun Week</cite>,
Kirby Ferris was contacted by the BATF to schedule an inspection of his
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Marin.html">Marin County</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> sporting
goods store. A BATF agent said the BATF
would inspect his records and check his list of customers "against the crime
computer."</p>

<p>Ferris knew that the Form 4473's that firearms purchasers fill out is
supposed to remain private except when a particular weapon has been used in
a crime or a particular purchaser is a suspect.</p>

<p>When the BATF arrived to conduct the inspection, Ferris, along with four
witnesses and a video camera, asked the BATF to sign a release holding
Ferris blameless for the BATF's violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 (improper
use of confidential information). The BATF refused to sign the release and
left.</p>

<p>The BATF warned Ferris to submit to the warrantless search. Ferris wrote
Harry Alder, the local head of the BATF, demanding that he "cease and desist"
and pointing out the federal statutes making such a search illegal.</p>

<p>Alder responded by revoking Ferris' FFL and threatening him with up
to $250,000 in fines and 5 years in prison. Ferris demanded an administrative
review (part of due process) but was refused.</p>

<p>The warrantless inspection is part of the BATF's "Operation Forward Trace,"
which a federal judge has prohibited in his <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> jurisdiction
pending a final
ruling in a court case involving the tactics.</p>

<title>BATF Wrecks Tulsa Home</title>
<!-- Place: Tulsa, Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: December 16, 1991 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>BATF Wrecks Tulsa Home</h1>

<p>On December 16, 1991, a joint task force of some <em>sixty</em> BATF
agents and local law enforcement personnel, accompanied by two television
crews, broke into the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/Tulsa.html">Tulsa</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a> home of
John Lawmaster.</p>

<p>Acting on a tip that Lawmaster had illegally converted a semi-automatic
to full automatic, the BATF worked with Lawmaster's ex-wife to lure Lawmaster
away from his home before the raid. With Lawmaster absent, BATF knocked down
his front door with a battering ram. While some agents stood guard with
weapons drawn, other agents broke open his gun safe, scattered his personal
papers, spilled boxes of ammunition onto the floor, and broke into a small,
locked box that contained precious coins.  To look through some ceiling tiles,
one agent stood on a table, breaking the table in the process.</p>

<p>Neighbors who asked what BATF was doing were threatened with arrest.
The BATF left doors, tables, and safes broken and guns and ammunition
unsecured on the floor, and a note: "Nothing found -- ATF." No charges were
filed. The affadavit supporting the search warrant was sealed by the US
Attorney's office.</p>

<p>When Lawmaster returned, utility company representatives arrived, and told
him that they had been told to shut off all his utilities.</p>

<h1>BATF Leaves Baby in Bathtub</h1>

<p>On April 1, 1992, Malisa Knudson was bathing her 21-month-old daughter Kalee
when she heard the sound of traffic coming up their remote mile-long road.  
As she came to the front door she saw several vehicles accompanying a 
Ryder moving van and an ambulance.  About 30 agents piled out of the van 
and swarmed over her property.  BATF handcuffs Malisa, and leaves the
baby alone in the bath.  For three hours the Knudson home was searched
and Malisa was interrogated about the family's religious and political views.</p>

<p>In 1992, the FBI conducted a military siege of a rural <a

<title>BATF Terrorizes Wrong Victim</title>
<!-- Place: Portland, Oregon (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 5, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>BATF Terrorizes Wrong Victim</h1>

<p>On February 5, 1993, the BATF destroyed the home of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/Portland.html">Portland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/">Oregon</a> resident
Janice Hart and terrorized her children for several hours
in a case of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>Acting on an informant's tip that Janice Hart was Janice Harrell, a wanted
person, BATF agents broke down Hart's door (later nailing it shut), shoved
dishes to the floor, ripped clothes from hangers, emptyed drawers.</p>

<p>When Hart returned home from grocery shopping, she found the agents
ransacking her house. They told her to shut up and forced her two children and
a neighborhood friend to remain in the car (Hart's parents later picked them
up).</p>

<p>BATF agents interrogated Hart in her basement for over an hour.</p>

<p>"There's about eight of them down there and they're asking me over and 
over my name, my Social Security number, by birthdate. On and on, over 
and over. And I kept answering over and over. And I'm saying, What did I 
do? I don't have anything to hide."</p>

<p>Hart looked nothing like the BATF's picture of Harrell, and did not have
the scars Harrell was known to have. When the BATF finally brought Hart to
a Portland police station, the Portland police recognized from fingerprints
that the BATF had the wrong person.</p>

<p>It took Hart and her ex-husband two days to clean the BATF's mess. Many
damaged items had to be thrown out.</p>

<!-- Should have a lie-by-lie refutation:

	House hearings: BATF testified Davidians "sprayed" machine guns,
	.50 caliber rifles and grenades. At trial, FBI admitted no spent
	.50 bullets were found.

	House hearings: BATF testified Davidians outgunned BATF's "pop guns".
	"Pop guns" included 9mm, AR-15s, MP-5 submachine guns, Blackhawk
	helicopter.

	"Ambush". BATF was the one attacking; BATF knew Davidians knew
	they were coming; BATF agents seen shooting out in the open
	during raid. BATF practiced repeatedly in mock raids at Ft. Hood
	under Special Forces training.

	House hearings (Kiri Jewell), standoff, etc.: BATF/FBI claimed
	Koresh abused children. DoJ admitted not enough evidence to
	indict Koresh; Jewell's father tried to make money by putting
	her on the talk show circuit and sell her story for a TV movie;
	counselors who interviewed surviving Davidian children found
	no evidence of abuse.

	Davidians were suicidal/committed suicide. Transcripts, trial
	testimony, survivors' testimony.

	FBI wanted peaceful surrender. Lights/noises, fake tank passes,
	destruction of property, superiors telling negotiators to justify
	aggression.

<h1>Remember Waco</h1>

<p>The federal government's military assault of a religious residence near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, was one of
the most egregious abuses of power witnessed in
the U.S. in this century.</p>

<p>On February 28, 1993, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF)
conducted a military assault of the living quarters of the Branch Davidians,
a small Christian church once associated with the Seventh-Day Adventists.
After a fifty-one-day siege, the Davidians' home burned, killing over eighty
men, women and children.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="motive/">BATF wanted to make an example of the Davidians.</a></dt>
<dd><p>BATF used some valid concerns to further their agenda of increasing
their budget and disarming American citizens.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="raid/">BATF used excessive force.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Instead of peacably serving a search warrant, the BATF lied in order to
get military support, then attacked the Davidians with overwhelming firepower,
leaving the Davidians no option but to defend themselves or be killed.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="siege/">The FBI's siege confirmed Davidians' fears.</a></dt>
<dd><p>During the long siege, the FBI cut off utilities, blared recordings of
rabbits being slaughtered, refused to allow family members to talk with the
Davidians, and otherwise confirmed the Davidian's view that the federal
government meant to kill them.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="fire/">The federal government started the fire and made sure the
	Davidians died in it.</a></dt>
<dd><p>The FBI pumped an inflammable gas into a building lit with kerosene
lanterns, then knocked down walls and blocked exits.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="coverup/">Government agencies covered up evidence of agents'
	wrongdoing.</a></dt>
<dd><p>The press were kept away from the scene; the building was immediately
demolished; key evidence disappeared; several feet of topsoil was removed
from the site.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="trial/">Surviving Davidians were found innocent of murder.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Despite dirty tricks by the prosecution, a jury found that surviving
Davidians acted in self-defense and were as such innocent of murder and
conspiracy to murder. Six Davidians are appealing convictions on lesser
charges.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="reaction/">The Waco tragedy stirred tremendous antigovernment
	sentiment.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Seeing federal agents abuse their authority with impunity, average
Americans began to fear their government. Both the House and Senate
held hearings on the Waco incident. Imprisoned Davidians appealed their
sentences.</p></dd>

<dt>Federal agencies should be required to use local police for
	actual enforcement.</dt>
<dd><p>To reduce the situations that made Waco likely, federal police
should be prohibited from carrying weapons, instead being confined to an
investigative role, and relying on local law enforcement for searches and
arrests.</p></dd>

<title>Groups Call for Investigation of Feds</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: January 10, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>ACLU, NRA, Others Call for Investigation of Feds</h1>

<p>Press Release: As Trials Of Waco Survivors Open In Texas, ACLU, NRA, Others
Ask Clinton To Address Federal Police Abuse.</p>

<p>January 10, 1994</p>

<p>WASHINGTON - The <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">American Civil
Liberties Union</a>, the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National
Rifle Association</a>, and other organizations from across the
political spectrum today called on President Clinton to appoint a
national commission to investigate serious allegations of abuse by
federal law enforcement agencies and to recommend steps that must
be taken to reduce constitutional and human rights violations by
federal law enforcement personnel.</p>

<p>Led by the ACLU, the organizations delivered a letter to President
Clinton in which they pointed out that federal law enforcement
authorities now comprise close to 10 percent of the nations total
police forces. Some 53 separate federal agencies -- from the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and from the U. S. Mint Police Force to the
Bureau of Indian Affairs have the authority to carry firearms and
make arrests, the organizations said, a figure that represents an
enormous expansion in recent years in terms of both personnel and
jurisdiction.</p>

<p> What is lacking, the ACLU and other organizations said in their
letter, is systematic oversight and review of federal police
practices. Such lapses, the organizations said, have lead to serious
allegations of abuse, including the improper use of deadly force,
use of unreliable informants without sufficient verification of their
allegations and physical abuse.</p>

<p>The call for a national commission came as the survivors of the
<a href="waco/">confrontation</a> between the Branch Davidians and the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, went on
<a href="waco/trial/">trial</a> in
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>.</p>

<p> Independent experts have already questioned the federal law
enforcement practices that led to the tragic deaths of so many men,
women, and innocent children, said Laura Murphy Lee, the
Director of the ACLUs
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a> Office.</p>

<p> We, of course, recognize that the majority of federal officers
strive, often under dangerous and demanding circumstances, to
carry out their duties in a restrained, lawful, and professional
manner, Murphy added. But at the same time, we know that the
Waco confrontation was not an isolated incident.</p>

<p> In addition to the ACLU and the NRA, the other organizations
issuing the call include the Citizens Committee for the Right to
Keep and Bear Arms; the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation; the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DPF.html">Drug Policy Foundation</a>;
the Independence Institute; the
International Association for Civilian Oversight of Law
Enforcement; National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers;
The National Legal Aid and defender Association, and the Second
Amendment Foundation.</p>

<h1>BATF Attacks Ohio Man</h1>

<p>From a <a href="nra_batf.html">January 5, 1995 NRA Alert</a>:</p>

<p>A national commission is too late to help Louie Katona from
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/Bucyrus.html">Bucyrus</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a>.</p>

<p> The Katona family is a poster family for Middle America.  Louie's
wife is a  devoted mother.  Louie himself owns a real estate agency.
He was a part-time  police officer and a full-time community
contributor.  But he is also a gun  collector.</p>

<p> Based on a trumped-up charge that he falsified certain BATF forms,
BATF entered  his home.  During the raid, his wife, Kimberly, became
understandably agitated  and upset.  An overzealous agent pushed his
wife against a wall.  Within hours,  Kimberly, then several months
pregnant, began bleeding.   She soon miscarried.</p>

<p> Did BATF apologize to this family?  No.  Instead, BATF pressed
criminal charges  against Katona.  This past April, a judge threw the
charges out of court.  The  Katona family has civil action pending
against ATF.</p>

<h1>BATF Lamplugh Incident</h1>

<h2>BATF Thugs Strike Again!</h2>

<p> The lives of Harry and Theresa Lamplugh were turned upside down on the
morning of May 25, 1994. Early that day, 15-to-20 armed
men and women burst into their rural
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>
home. Under the threat of
violence, the Lamplughs cooperated completely with the
intruders as they opened safes, locks and cabinets. In spite of
their compliance, however, Harry and Theresa were treated with
contempt. Throughout the ordeal, a fully automatic machine gun
was intermittently thrust in both their faces.</p.

<p> The Lamplughs watched in horror as the thugs literally
trashed their home. Furniture was overturned or smashed and
papers were scattered everywhere. Three pet cats were ruthlessly
killed--one literally stomped to death. The gang ransacked their
home for more than six hours. When they finally left, Harry and
Theresa stood confused and angry in the midst of their demolished
home.</p>

<p> The brutal and inhumane events that you have just read
about are not fiction. They were taken from the testimony of
Harry and Theresa Lamplugh. Only the intruders were not some
violent street gang members or foreign terrorists; they were
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) and
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>

<p> Why would two federal agencies send a small battalion
of agents to terrorize this couple in the supposed safety of
their home? What terrible crime did Harry and Theresa Lamplugh
commit that prompted this brutal six-and-a half hour ordeal?
Shockingly, there are no good answers to these questions.</p>

<p> Harry Lamplugh, however, is in the politically
incorrect business of promoting gun shows. His organization,
Borderline Gun Collectors Association, happens to be the largest
gun show promoter in the Northeast. As anyone who has ever
attended a gun show knows, there are more than firearms and
accessories on display. A gun show is also a place where people
of common interests meet to express their political views and
share opinions. Not surprisingly, criticism of the BATF runs deep
at such a forum. And it is no secret that the BATF spends
considerable time and effort infiltrating these shows.</p>

<p> Since gun show infiltration is a massive undertaking
that yields relatively small returns, the BATF has now honed in
on a primary source, Harry Lamplugh. On May 23, 1994, the
agencies obtained a search warrant authorizing both the BATF and
the IRS to "search" the Lamplugh home. Included in the list of
items to be seized were any firearms, ammunition, holsters,
cleaning kits, gun cases and firearms accessories. The Lamplughs'
attorney points out that the warrant failed to name even one
specific item. "Such warrants are vague, overbroad and therefore
unconstitutional," he said.</P>

<p> The agents also seized complete financial and business
records of the Borderline Gun Collectors Association from 1988 to
the present. This included all computer records and any other
documents related to the sale and purchase of firearms.
Obviously, the BATF was on some sort of "fishing expedition." But
the most amazing aspect of the warrant is what was <em>not</em> on it.
There was no reference to any crime by any person. The BATF
appears to hold not only the Second Amendment in disdain, but the
Fourth as well.</p>

<p> On Wednesday, May 25, 1994, the search warrant was
executed. At about eight in the morning, Harry answered a knock
on the front door and was instantly surrounded by agents. His
wife was in the bathroom at the time. He had been sitting at the
kitchen table in a pair of pajama bottoms, having his morning
coffee. "Unto this day I don't know exactly how many there were,
but they had my house secured in seconds," Harry said.</p>

<p> According to Lamplugh, there were a total of six cars
full of agents. They were not dressed in any uniform, and only
two had the identifying ATF vests on. All firearms were drawn. An
M-P5 machine gun was stuck in Harry's face. They did not announce
who they were or why they were there, and no search warrants were
displayed. "When I asked if they had a search warrant, their
first reply was 'shut the fuck up mother fucker; do you want more
trouble than you already have?', with the machine gun stuck in my
face." Harry said. "They then proceeded to tear my house apart."</p>

<p> The Lamplughs were not permitted to dress all day. "We
couldn't even go to the bathroom without an armed guard, as if we
were prisoners in our own home," says Mrs. Lamplugh. Then, like a
slap in the face, the agents stopped everything to eat lunch.
"They gave no thought to what we were going through. Some agents
went out for pizza, and they had a little party. It was like a
room full of kindergartners with no chaperon. They threw
half-emptied soda cans, pizza and pizza boxes everywhere. To some
people, maybe it sounds like we're complaining about a small
thing, but this is our home and they trashed it."</p>

<p> The agents' reckless conduct at the "pizza party"
characterized their behavior throughout the raid. "Because I have 
cancer, I usually have about 20 bottles of prescription drugs on
top of my bureau. For some unknown reason, they thought it
necessary to open the bottles and scatter the contents all over
the floor. Consequently, two of our cats got into the medication
and died horrible deaths."</p>

<p> The agents continued their aimless search. "Where's the
machine gun" one of the agents asked. Finally, an indication they
were looking for something in particular. "At first I didn't know
what he meant," Harry said. "Then I recalled that I once owned a
Vietnam commemorative Thompson, inlaid in 22 karat gold, but that
was a semi-automatic. One of the agents then responded, 'That
must be what they're talking about.'" The agents were apparently
looking for something that wasn't even there, or illegal to
possess."</p>

<p> However, they were very thorough in sifting through what
was there. But for what reason did the agents take marriage and
birth certificates, school records, insurance information,
vehicle registrations and titles? Harry points out that "they
were so thorough that for about two weeks we would have had a
hard time proving who we were. They took all of our contacts with
newspapers (Over 600), all friends and family phone numbers, and
even my medical records." There were 61 firearms and assorted
ammo seized in the raid, valued at over $15,000. The agents took
about 70,000 names and addresses of exhibitors and also gun show
contracts through the year 2000. A stack of mail was opened, read
and also confiscated.</p>

<p> Finally, at about three o'clock, the wrecking crew
finished their destruction. In one final unconscionable act,
female agent Donna Slusser deliberately stomped to death a
cherished Manx kitten, and kicked it under a tree.</p>

<p> The affidavit in support of the warrant was made by
BATF special agent Scott Endy. For reasons unknown to the
Lamplughs, the affidavits were sealed by a local federal judge.
An Assistant United States Attorney was asked by the Lamplughs'
attorney to unseal the document, but he has steadfastly refused
to do so.</p>

<p> The persecution Harry and Theresa have endured has been
extremely harsh. At no time was this peaceful couple informed of
any violation of the law, and to this day no charges have been
brought against the Lamplughs. Yet, the BATF has refused to
return any property, even medical records and other personal
documents and possessions.</p>

<p> The actions of the men and women who entered the
Lamplughs' home must not be ignored or forgotten. The Lamplughs
are victims, not suspects, in this matter, and this is but one of
the many examples of the BATF's abuse of its power through the
years. This government brutality must be stopped.</p>

<title>BATF Assault Monique Montgomery</title>
<!-- Place: St. Louis, Missouri (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 13, 1994 -->

<body>
<h1>BATF Attacks St. Louis Woman</h1>

<p>From a <a href="nra_batf.html">January 5, 1995 NRA Alert</a>:</p>

<p> At four o'clock in the morning of July 13, 1994, dressed in their
Ninja-style  outfits, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms stormed into the bedroom of Monique Montgomery, aged 21,
at her
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/StLouis.html">St. Louis</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a> home.
The BATF says it was looking for drugs  in the home of the St. Louis
woman, but it found none.   The BATF says it was  looking for illegal
guns, but it found none.  Instead -- after a investigation  that was
six weeks in the making -- it found a woman -- alone and deep asleep
-- in her bedroom.</p>

<p> According to press accounts, two agents hit that bedroom with guns
drawn,  shields up and high intensity lights glaring.  The agents
claimed that they  knocked and announced themselves ... before
breaking down the woman's door.   Hearing such a commotion and being
startled as anyone would with such a bizarre  scene at four in the
morning, Miss Montgomery did what most reasonable  Americans would
do.  She armed herself with a firearm she lawfully owned for
personal protection.</p>

<p> The agents claim to have, quote, repeatedly identified themselves and
told her  to drop her weapon, unquote.   But this is the same BATF
which set the time for  the raid at four in the morning -- to
maximize the victim's disorientation.  So  the victim had no choice
but to be disorientated and confused.  And, according  to the BATF,
the agent, quoting again, didn't have any other choice, unquote,  --
but to shoot her.</p>

<p> And shoot her he did.  Four times.</p>

<p> Long before Ms. Montgomery was released from the hospital after being
shot in  the chest and hip, the agent who shot her was back on the
job.</p>

<title>NRA Criticizes BATF</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: January 5, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>NRA Criticizes BATF</h1>

<p>Remarks by Joseph Phillips, Director of Federal Affairs, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a> Institute for
Legislative Action, at a January 5, 1995 press conference in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a></p>
    
<p>When the National Rifle Association of America and other
constitutional rights organizations first joined together to urge
that President Clinton establish a national commission to
investigate abuse of power on the part of federal law  enforcement
agencies, the date was January 1993.</p>

<p>It is now January 1995.</p>

<p>The need for a national commission on government violence is now two
years too  late for too many victims, and President Clinton is still
not listening.</p>

<p>There is often disagreement between NRA and the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a>,
another leading coalition member, on a host of issues ranging from the
Second Amendment to criminal justice reform. But on the issue of government
violence, there is agreement. Federal government power is being aimed at
honest citizens, the liberties of those citizens are being abused and the
lives of those  citizens are being threatened.</p>

<p>I will give you just two examples of why this commission is too many
years too late.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning of July 13, 1994, dressed in their
Ninja-style  outfits, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms stormed into the  bedroom of Monique Montgomery, aged 21.
The BATF says it was looking for drugs  in the home of the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/StLouis.html">St. Louis</a>
woman, but it found none. The BATF says it was  looking for illegal
guns, but it found none. Instead -- after a investigation  that was
six weeks in the making -- it found a woman -- alone and deep asleep
-- in her bedroom.</p>

<p> According to press accounts, two agents hit that bedroom with guns
drawn,  shields up and high intensity lights glaring.  The agents
claimed that they  knocked and announced themselves ... before
breaking down the woman's door.   Hearing such a commotion and being
startled as anyone would with such a bizarre  scene at four in the
morning, Miss Montgomery did what most reasonable  Americans would
do.  She armed herself with a firearm she lawfully owned for
personal protection.</p>

<p> The agents claim to have, quote, repeatedly identified themselves and
told her  to drop her weapon, unquote.   But this is the same BATF
which set the time for  the raid at four in the morning -- to
maximize the victim's disorientation.  So  the victim had no choice
but to be disorientated and confused.  And, according  to the BATF,
the agent, quoting again, didn't have any other choice, unquote,  --
but to shoot her.</p>

<p> And shoot her he did.  Four times.</p>

<p> Long before Ms. Montgomery was released from the hospital after being
shot in  the chest and hip, the agent who shot her was back on the job.</p>

<p>And now, quoting from a St. Louis <cite>Post-Dispatch</cite> editorial,
ATF officials may  have perfectly good explanations.  But in the wake of
the <a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Branch Davidian
raid</a> in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>,
... citizens have reason to ask two more questions:  Did the agents handle
this raid the right way?  Has the ATF learned any lessons in  patience?
Unquote.</p>

<p> The BATF must learn a lesson, not just in patience, but in
constitutional  rights.   Federal law enforcement -- like state and
local law enforcement --  exists to preserve and protect our
liberties as well as our lives.  The 3.5  Million members of the
National Rifle Association grow increasingly concerned  about the
cavalier attitude of many elements of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.   The signs of abuse of power are unmistakable.  It is
time for  Americans to read the signs and demand an accounting.</p>

<p> But just as a national commission is too late to help Monique
Montgomery, it is  also too late for Louie Katona from
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/Bucyrus.html">Bucyrus</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a>.</p>

<p> The Katona family is a poster family for Middle America.  Louie's
wife is a  devoted mother.  Louie himself owns a real estate agency.
He was a part-time  police officer and a full-time community
contributor.  But he is also a gun  collector.</p>

<p> Based on a trumped-up charge that he falsified certain BATF forms,
BATF entered  his home.  During the raid, his wife, Kimberly, became
understandably agitated  and upset.  An overzealous agent pushed his
wife against a wall.  Within hours,  Kimberly, then several months
pregnant, began bleeding.   She soon miscarried.</p>

<p> Did BATF apologize to this family?  No.  Instead, BATF pressed
criminal charges  against Katona.  This past April, a judge threw the
charges out of court.  The  Katona family has civil action pending
against ATF.</p>

<p> The reasons for the Constitution are many, but one primary reason is
to limit  raw government power that we have seen nearly destroy the
Katona family and  nearly kill Monique Montgomery.</p>

<p> It is time to readjust the scales of power in this country.  Those
scales must  always weigh in favor of the people's rights, not the
government's power.  For  Monique Montgomery and the Louie Katona
family, the scales of power nearly  crushed them out.  We must right
that wrong.</p>

<p> For too many Americans, a national commission on government violence
is too  many years too late.  Let us not keep Americans -- or  their
constitutional  rights -- waiting any longer.  NRA joins ACLU, the
Citizens Committee for the  Right to Keep and Bear Arms, the
Independence Institute and others in urging  President Clinton -- one
more time -- to right the scales of justice.</p>

<p> Thank you.</p>

<title>Lekan Incident</title>
<!-- Place: Brunswick, Ohio (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 31 - April 3, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Lekan Incident</h1>

<p>John Lekan was an eccentric. Eccentrics can easily get on the wrong side of
government officials.</p>

<p> Lekan, 54, lived with his wife Beverly, 49, and their son John Jr., 9, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/Brunswick.html">Brunswick</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a>. Lekan, a
veteran, was disabled; his wife suffers from Multiple Sclerosis.</p>

<p> A Medina County Human Services Department health aide apparently did not care
for Lekan's habit of carrying a loaded firearm at home for self-defense. The
health aide told Mrs. Lekan that the police would be accompanying her on her
next visit.</p>

<p> This is the first point at which government officials crossed the line of
individual rights. Being eccentric is not a crime. Carrying a firearm at home
is not a crime and in fact is protected by the Constitution, the supreme law of
the land. Neither eccentricity nor gun ownership is enough to warrant police
action.</p>

<p> At 3 p.m. Friday, March 31, 1995, two Brunswick police officers arrived at the
Lekan home. Officer Sam Puzella knocked on the door. When Lekan refused to let
them in, Puzella kicked in the door.</p>

<p>This is the second point at which government officials violated Lekan's
rights. At this point, there was no suspicion that anyone was in immediate
danger, nor was there a search or arrest warrant enabling the officers to
enter the property.</P>

<p>When the door was kicked in, Lekan's eccentricity turned violent. Lekan shot
Puzella in the chest. The police retreated. Puzella was airlifted to a
hospital. At 8:30 p.m., police attempted to rush the Lekan home. Lekan shot two
more police.</p>

<p> At this point the police began a siege of Lekan's home. The neighborhood was
evacuated; gas, electric, telephone, water service and street lights were shut
off; cameras were installed to see into the interior of the home; four SWAT
teams, 300 law enforcement personnel, 200 fire fighters and two Armored
Personnel Carriers (APC's) converged at the site.</p>

<p> Police began pumping water at a rate of 1,000 gallons per minute into
Lekan's basement to try to flood him out.</p>

<p>At 11 a.m. Saturday, April 1, APC's broke through the garage door, east wall
and backyard patio doors of the Lekan home, inserting tear gas. Reports
indicate that at this point Lekan and his son died of single gunshot wounds to
the head, ruled a murder-suicide by Medina County coroner Dr. Neil
Grabenstetter.</p>

<p>At 10:15 a.m. Sunday, April 2, police fired more tear gas through broken
windows, entered the house through a window, found Mrs. Lekan and brought her
out the house. SWAT team members entered the Lekan home, and <em>four hours
later</em> emerged with the bodies of Lekan and his son.</p>

<p>The bodies were found in the bathroom with a gas mask, two acetylene oxygen
tanks, a 10-gauge shotgun, a .27 caliber rifle and ammunition for both
weapons.</p>

<p>The above information was taken from a message posted by E Pluribus Unum

<h1>BATF Accused of Racism</h1>

<p>The BATF is in trouble again. The March 8, 1995 <cite>USA Today</cite>
reported that "a group of black agents has sued the 4,200-employee agency,
charging widespread discrimination." Donnie Carter, special agent in charge of
ATF's
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
 office, said there is "institutional racism" inside BATF.</p>

<p>"The suit charges ATF officials have routinely ignored racial abuses while
funneling blacks into low-paying, but dangerous street assignments with little
career potential. The black agents' legal documents cite numerous racial
problems, including how: White agents in <a

City</a> in 1991 plastered their
walls with a Confederate flag, a 'State of Oklahoma Nigger Hunting License',

<title>BATF Hypocrisy</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: reported April 1995 -->

<body>
<h1>BATF Hypocrisy</h1>

<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is quick to respond when private
citizens don't follow myriad federal gun regulations to the letter, keeping
track of extensive weapons collections.</p>

<p> However, when the BATF came up short 152 firearms in one inventory, they simply
erased the weapons from their computer records without investigation, as
reported by Chris Collins of Gannett News Service.</p>

<title>NRA Response to Bush</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: May 10, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>NRA Responds to Bush's Resignation</h1>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association
(NRA)</a> courageously placed a full-page advertisement in a major daily
newspaper calling to attention actions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF) and other federal agents that it said makes them "jackbooted
government thugs."</p>

<p>George Bush, former President and head of the C.I.A., sent the NRA a public
letter resigning his membership.</p>

<p>To its credit, the NRA did not back down, but replied to George with a
public letter supporting the fact that BATF agents are, indeed, jackbooted
government thugs.</p>

<p>The letter in its entirety is reproduced below.</p>

<hr>

<p>May 10, 1995</p>

<p>President George Bush<br>
P.O.Box 79798<br>
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> 77279-9798<br></p>

<p>Dear President Bush:</p>

<p>I was surprised and saddened to see your letter of May 3, 1995.  I can
understand and sympathize with the deeply emotional consequences you are
enduring as a result of losing a close friend in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> tragedy. 
We, too, have NRA members who were victims and rescuers that were scarred by
that most horrendous crime.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that you have chosen to unequivocally condemn NRA's words without
first seeking an explanation.  Surely, a private exchange between us might
persuade you to at least reserve a final opinion until all the facts are
examined.  Such a course of action, I believe, would have better served the
country than what now will become a public disagreement that can only lead to
more polarization in these troubled times.</p>

<p>Within hours of the bombing, NRA issued a statement declaring that "The
National Rifle Association of America has nothing but contempt for terrorists
or hate groups that attempt to disguise themselves as patriots."  Deploring the
monstrous act, we called for the death penalty for those found responsible,
praised
federal, state and local authorities and declared that law enforcement has "...
no stronger ally than the NRA."</p>

<p>Following the President's call on Sunday, April 23 for a "lowering of
voices,"  NRA began the week of April 24 with no intention of seeking political
advantage from such a calamity.  By nightfall, Mr. Clinton, Congressman
Schumer, anti-gun groups and members of the media had begun a full frontal
assault on so-called "hate-speech."   Our offices in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a> were
immediately flooded with press inquiries demanding that we defend numerous
statements we had made in recent months with regard to the conduct of the
BATF.</p>

<p>Each day continued to bring new participants in the NRA bashing frenzy that
today grips the national media.  NRA has been accused of contributing to an
atmosphere that encourages unstable people to commit violent acts.  Our words
have been characterized as grievous, defamatory, insensitive distortions of
truth.  In return and with respect for the heartbreaking aftermath the nation
has witnessed, we have tried to respond with a measured tone.  We have argued
calmly and responsibly that our position has merit and that a fair, unbiased
analysis is the only way to address these issues.  After exhaustive interviews
with The New York <cite>Times</cite>, The Washington <cite>Post</cite>, NBC,
CBS, ABC, <cite>Time</cite> and dozens of others, it is disheartening to see
such enthusiasm for stories on NRA rhetoric and so much reluctance to balance
those presentations with fact.  As someone who has been victimized yourself by
such media tactics, I would have expected you to allow us to offer information
that was not being provided by the press.</p>

<p>On January 10, 1994, the <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a>, the NRA and
other organizations appealed to President Clinton for the appointment of a
national commission to "... investigate serious allegations of abuse by federal
law enforcement agencies and to recommend steps that must be taken to reduce
constitutional and human rights violations by federal law enforcement
personnel."  Citing "... serious allegations of abuse, including the improper
use of deadly force...", our letter offered specific examples of black suited,
masked, massively armed mobs of screaming, swearing agents invading the homes
of innocents:</p>

<h2>Donald Carlson</h2>

<p>On August 25, 1992 at about 10:30 p.m., Donald Carlson returned to his home
in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Poway.html">Poway</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>, opened his
garage door with a remote control device,
simultaneously illuminating the garage so that Drug Enforcement Administration
agents conducting surveillance from nearby could see inside.  Just after
midnight, when Carlson was asleep, a group of DEA agents burst into his house. 
Thinking they were robbers, Carlson grabbed his pistol to defend himself.  He
also dialed 911 for help.  The agents shot Carlson three times, twice after he
was down and clearly disabled.  Carlson spent seven weeks in intensive care,
fighting for his life.  No drugs were found on the premises.</p>

<p>It was later learned that the Federal Customs Service, the DEA and the U.S.
Attorney's Office in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a>
had relied on an informant who was known to be
untrustworthy and who claimed Carlson's garage contained 2,500 kilograms of
cocaine (a large amount which would have taken up most of the garage) and four
armed guards.  The agents conducted the raid in spite of the fact they could
see the informant's information was erroneous.</p>

<p>As of this writing, none of the federal agents involved in the incident have
been sanctioned nor has Mr. Carlson been compensated for his injuries.</p>

<h2>Sina Brush</h2>

<p>Just after dawn on September 5, 1991 some sixty agents from the DEA, U.S.
Forest Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), and National
Guard, complete with painted faces and camouflage and accompanied by another
twenty or more National Guard troops with a light armored vehicle, raided the
homes of Sina Brush and two of her neighbors near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/Montainair.html">Montainair</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>. 
Brush and her daughter were still asleep.  Hearing noises outside, Ms. Brush
got up and was only halfway across the room, when the door was kicked in by the
agents.  Clad only in their underwear, Ms. Brush and her daughter were
handcuffed and forced
to kneel in the middle of the room while the agents searched the house.  No
drugs were found.  Just as in the Carlson case, the police had obtained a
warrant using information furnished by an unreliable informant and had entered
Brush's home without knocking first.</p>

<h2><a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Waco</a></h2>

<p>This most notorious case has stunned the sensibilities of millions of
Americans.  According to The Wall Street Journal, "...the BATF showed up at the
Davidian compound with two cattle trucks full of agents in battle gear and a
plan for 'dynamic entry'."  The siege that followed the initial assault
included terrifying, psychological warfare tactics and ended when a second
attack, utilizing tanks and gas, led to conflagration. "Weird cultists" 
(your words)? Some of the adults, but certainly not the children.</p>

<p>For two years now, thousands of calls and letters of outrage have been
received by government, the media and yes, the NRA.  The cries of "thugs", 
"Nazi" and "storm trooper" came first, not from  the NRA, but from the minds
and mouths of Americans describing what they had seen on television.</p>

<h2>Randy Weaver</h2>

<p>This <a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/rubyridge/">debacle</a>
at <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/RubyRidge.html">Ruby
Ridge</a> continues to fan a seething backlash in the
country.  A fourteen year old boy was shot in the back and killed.  A mother
was shot by a sniper in the head and killed while holding a baby.  A jury found
BATF guilty of entrapment and the defendant was acquitted.  How does it all add
up to justifiable behavior by, once again, black shrouded forces with armored
personnel carriers, helicopters and snipers all arrayed against a family in a
cabin?  Hundreds of good people have told me that scene reminds them of what
this country once fought against and should never stand for.</p>

<p>Mr. President, there are more names and more abuse;</p>

<h2>Janice Hart,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/Portland.html">Portland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/">Oregon</a>,
February 1993</h2>

<p>Janice Hart pulled up to her house from grocery shopping with her daughters
to find her house being ransacked by ATF agents who had kicked in the door. 
Agents searched her home, throwing dishes, pulling clothing from hangers and
emptying drawers on the floor (she photographed the damage).  Some eight ATF
agents interrogated her in the basement for an hour before reading her her
rights.  She asked to call an attorney and the agents refused.  When they
finally asked her if she was Janice Marie Harrell, she told them no, that she
was Janice Hart.  ATF
agents mocked her, accused her of selling firearms and cocaine, then arrested
her.  The Portland Police, who she commended for their professional demeanor,
took her downtown for booking and, within thirty seconds of fingerprinting her,
realized ATF had the wrong person.</p>

<h2>Louis Katona, Bucyrus, Ohio</h2>

<p>Louis Katona is a police officer in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/Bucyrus.html">Bucyrus</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a>. When shouting
and cursing BATF agents rushed into his home to seize his firearms collection,
they grabbed his pregnant wife, Kim, and shoved her into a wall.  Within days,
she suffered a miscarriage.  A federal judge threw the government's case out of
court and ordered BATF to immediately return Mr. Katona's guns or face jail
themselves.  The Katonas are presently pressing civil charges against BATF.</p>

<p>I could go on to tell you about Harry and Teresa Lamplugh, Ron and Elaine
Miller, Howard and Sandy Wittenberg and many others. All victims of forceful,
abusive and often vicious assaults on their homes and businesses by BATF agents
who turned out not to have a case.  You would hear about cancer medicines
thrown all over the floor, family pets stomped to death, terrified children
separated from their parents, tires slashed, threatening and hang-up telephone
calls and other such behavior that has nothing to do with the America I grew up
in.</p>

<p>If all the above is not bad enough, just 62 days ago, on Wednesday, March 8,
1995 <cite>USA Today</cite> reported that "...a group of black agents has sued
the 4,200-employee agency (BATF), charging widespread discrimination."   The
special agent in charge of ATF's Houston office, Donnie Carter, said, "There's
institutional racism" inside BATF.  The article continues: "The suit charges
ATF officials have routinely ignored racial abuses while funneling blacks into
low-paying, but dangerous street assignments with little career potential.  The
black agents' legal documents cite numerous racial problems, including how: 
White agents in Oklahoma City in 1991 plastered their walls with a Confederate
flag, a 'State of Oklahoma Nigger Hunting License', and a Ku Klux Klan business
card.  Black agents at the ATF office in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>
in 1991 went to the
photocopier and found a picture of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson with the
words 'jungle bunny' scrawled on it."</p>

<p>Mr. President, if you watched any of NRA's recent appearances on national
television, you know that we did not use this article to deflect criticism of
our own language.  Nor did we refer to the "60 Minutes" report that appeared on
Sunday, January 12, 1993 in which female BATF agents themselves described a
sickening pattern of sexual harassment, intimidation and retaliation in their
own ranks.  One agent reported, "I was held against the hood of my car and my
clothes ripped off by two agents."  Another said a male agent had "...
repeatedly left dildos on my desk."  She then reported that, "... he trapped me
in a room and told me he would screw me in a New York minute."</p>

<p>A male BATF agent who had come forward to support the charges of the female
agents summed it up this way:  "They violate the basic principles and tenets of
the Constitution and the laws and simple ethics of morality.  That's what
disgusts me."</p>

<p>Just last Thursday, May 4, The New York <cite>Times</cite>, in an editorial
stated that BATF, "...has had its share of problems, including inexcusable
errors leading up to the tragedy at Waco."  The editorial went on to say that
BATF, "... is badly in need of internal reform.  Waco was merely the most
spectacular in a series of lapses in which the BATF became too aggressive." 
They referred to BATF's, "...woeful record of sex and racial discrimination." 
They said, "BATF is struggling with a legacy of mismanagement and large,
visible mistakes that have undermined the public's confidence in its ability to
do its job."  And finally, the editorial declared that, "...if the agency is to
survive, it must face its demons."  Toward that end, the editorial concluded
that congressional hearings, "...can serve a useful purpose."  That is exactly
what NRA, ACLU, BATF's victims
and millions of concerned citizens have been demanding for the last two
years.</p>

<p>The same editorial reminded its readers that, "Representative John Dingell
has called its agents 'jack-booted American fascists'  and Representative
Harold Volkmer has called BATF 'one of the most Rambo-rogue law enforcement
agencies in the United States'."</p>

<p>Let me also call to your attention that the last time BATF abuses were
investigated was in hearings before the Subcommittee on Treasury, Post Office
and General Appropriations of the Senate Appropriations Committee in July 1979
and April 1980, and before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Senate
Judiciary
Committee in October 1980.  They concluded, "Based upon these hearings it is
apparent that enforcement tactics made possible by current federal firearms
laws are constitutionally, legally, and practically reprehensible.  ...These
practices, amply documented in hearings before this Subcommittee, leave little
doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the Constitution and
laws of the United States.  ...It has trampled upon the Second Amendment by
chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law abiding citizens. 
... It has offended the Fourth Amendment by unreasonably searching and seizing
private property.  ...It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private
property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens without
regard for their right to due process of law. ... The rebuttal presented to the
Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. ...Evidence was submitted
establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed
at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge...." </p>

<p>Following the lead of the Senate, it was the Reagan-Bush Administration that
cracked down on BATF and cleaned up the way they conducted themselves
throughout the ensuing decade.  Have you forgotten, President Bush, your
previous passion for justice and fairness for all law-abiding citizens?</p>

<p>The facts are there, Mr. President.  No American citizen can be proud of
this agency's record in the last four years.  Certainly, there are many fine,
professional and heroic BATF agents who have served our nation with great
distinction during this period, but their professionalism and honor are being
overwhelmed by an increasingly angry and outraged American public that will not
tolerate fear of their own government.  That's why The <cite>Wall Street
Journal</cite> in an editorial last Tuesday, May 2, 1995 said "...recent
history suggests that the people in charge of this country's system of law,
order and justice had better get their acts together pretty darn quick."  And,
in a little noted and largely ignored Time/CNN poll conducted eight days after
the bombing in Oklahoma City, fifty-two percent of those questioned agreed that
"...the federal government has become so powerful that it poses a threat to the
rights and freedoms of citizens."  That so many Americans actually fear their
own government is a storm cloud on this country's horizon of unimaginable
proportions.</p>

<p>Are NRA's words to blame? Are John Dingell's?  Is it the rhetoric of Rush
Limbaugh or Bill Clinton or David Letterman?  I don't think so.  I believe more
and more Americans see an emerging double standard that disgusts them.  Again,
I quote from The <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> editorial of May 2, 1995,
"Allowing for the dilemmas of the real world, we seem to have a double standard
today:  It says that law enforcement officials can do what they want with
unpopular defendants like religious fanatics and white supremacists.  But in
dealing with suspects who might charge racial prejudice, they have to be
careful indeed.  Even in the wake of Oklahoma City, we are about to have the
release of a Mario Van Peebles film making the Black Panthers into
entertainment, guns and all."</p>

<p>President Bush, NRA never intended for its words to offend your sense of
decency and honor or your concept of service to country. I firmly believe that
after a thorough congressional examination of BATF, you will agree that our
words have been more truth than slander.  I believe you will judge too much of
what BATF has done to be inexcusable and deserving of your personal
repudiation.  Therefore, I respectfully ask you to reconsider your resignation
as a Life Member of the National Rifle Association until all the facts are
known.  Then, if you still feel that NRA has been wrong in the way it has
confronted this issue, NRA will deserve your resignation.  Until then, I
believe we and the American people deserve your help in getting to the
truth.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Tom Washington<br>

<title>BATF Sieges Empty House</title>
<!-- Place: Parma, Ohio (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 23, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>BATF Sieges Empty House</h1>

<p>Ragnar Danneskjold (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">
<a href="mailto:ragnard@apk.net">ragnard@apk.net</a>), in a message
forwarded to Libernet, reported that the BATF mistakenly conducted a
12-hour siege of an empty house.</p>

<p>Around 6pm Friday, June 23, 1995, the BATF attempted to serve a search
warrant at a residence in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/Parma.html">Parma</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> (not far from
Cleveland). The man
who answered their knock, a 23-year-old who lived with his parents, slammed the
door in their face. Of course, what else could the BATF do but call in the
tanks.</p>

<p>The ATF (now with the Parma SWAT teams) turned off all power in the area
and made the television crews turn off their lights. Local commentators
speculated that the young man was holding his parents hostage with a large
stockpile of illegal weapons.</p>

<p>Danneskjold reported that Ted Henry of ABC affiliate WEWS Channel 5 said,
"well he must have quite a stockpile of weapons for the ATF to serve a search
warrant."</p>

<p>Over sixty officers from the BATF, Parma police and other local communities'
police sieged the house all night. Bullhorns, a hostage negotiation phone,
optics and such were all tried, to no avail.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the BATF, the man had already slipped out the back door.</p>

<p>Around 6:30am the next morning, a BATF "dynamic entry team" entered the
house. The man's parents, who it seems were not even in the house much less
being held hostage, gave the BATF the keys to the front door.</p>

<p>The BATF found neither the man nor any "large stockpile of illegal
weapons." The BATF is not commenting any further on the incident, although
they did say that they were only executing a search warrant, not an arrest
warrant. Further, the agents that had the door slammed in their face did not
have the warrant with them.</p>

<h1>ATF Gets Military Firepower</h1>

<p>Never known for its delicate style, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms in July 1995 received 22 OV-10D aircraft from the Department of
Defense.</p>

<p>Each OV-10D, capable of speeds up to 300 mph, is outfitted with two 
7.62mm M-60C machine guns, each posessing 500 rounds, and carries
one Sidewinder missle under each wing, along with Snakeye bombs, rocket
packages, cluster bombs and fire bombs.</p>

<p>The ATF says nine of the aircraft will be unarmed and used only for
surveillance, and that the others will be used for spare parts. Uh huh.</p>

<title>BATF's Summer Camp</title>
<!-- Place: Ocoee, Tennessee (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 1995; Senate hearing July 21, 1995;
	Justice Dept. report March 13, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Federal Cops Hold Racist Summer Camp</h1>

<p>In July 1995, militia members gathered evidence of an annual "police
officers' gathering" billed as the "Good O' Boys Roundup" in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/Ocoee.html">Ocoee</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>.
The event incurred national scrutiny over charges of
racism, sexual assault and drug use.</p>

<p>Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen militia exposed the event with
the help of a confidential informant, videotaping portions of the event.
A disinformation campaign tried to discredit the informers and their
videotape, but in Congressional hearings federal officials admitted
such activity did occur, and the Justice Department's March 1996 report
on the annual event found much to criticize.</p>

<p>The July 22, 1995 San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> reported that
federal investigators recovered deleted computer files concerning the
gathering written by its organizer.</p>

<h2>Senate Hearings</h2>

<p>In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 21, 1995,
DEA administrator Thomas Constantine admitted that the entrance to the
gathering was posted with a sign saying, "Nigger Checkpoint: Any niggers
in that car?  17 cents a pound."
Senators also displayed "Federal Nigger Hunting Licenses" distributed
at the gathering.
Racist T-shirts and other materials were also present. Participants conducted
a racist campfire skit showing a Ku Klux Klansman sodomizing a participant
in blackface.</p>

<p>BATF directory John Magaw testified that from 1980 until 1985, the
event was mainly a small gathering of local police officers for
outdoor recreation such as camping and rafting. From 1985 to 1990,
the event grew, and "a lot of the things that were very horrendous, in
my opinion, took place." A dozen to fifteen active or retired ATF agents
have attended each year.</p>

<p>Magaw testified that ATF agents organized the event, sending out
applications, collecting dues, reserving the area and so forth.</p>

<p>Magaw said that "why it expanded so much, is that obviously, law
enforcement, because of <a href="/revolution/body/drugs/">drugs</a>,
because of gangs, because of <a href="/revolution/firearms/">guns</a>
being moved across the country, because of all those kinds of movement, you
would work with people from another state."</p>

<h2>Justice Department Report</h2>

<p>In March 1996, the Justice Department released the report on its
investigation into its employees' participation. The investigation did
not look into local police officers' actions or those of other Treasury
Department employees such as BATF agents.</p>

<p>The report admitted that "our investigation revealed ample evidence of
shocking, racist, licentious and puerile behavior." An estimated 44
Justice Department employees, mainly FBI and DEA agents, participated
in the roundups over the years.</p>

<p>The report cleared the Justice Department employees of any
significant wrongdoing, although one agent was suspended without pay
for five days for making a racist remark. The investigation found,
conveniently enough, that local police were likely responsible for
the more offensive behavior.</p>

<title>History of the U.S. Militia</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1770's - 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>What Is the Militia</h1>

<p>Copyright (C) 1994 Constitution Society. Permission is hereby granted to
copy with attribution for noncommercial purposes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Components of the Militia</h2>

<p>When asked what the Militia was, George Mason, one of the Framers
of the U.S. Constitution, said, "Who are the Militia? They consist
now of the whole people, except for a few public officers." Yet we
also see statutes like 10 USC 311, which defines it as "all able-
bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in
section 13 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or have made
a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United
States." Some state statutes define it as "able-bodied males" of
different age ranges, such as 16 through 59.</p>

<p>These statutes also divide the Militia into various classes, such
as "organized" or "unorganized", in the case of 10 USC 311, or
"active" and "reserve", as many states do, with "active" being
considered the National or State Guards, but not the national armed
forces.</p>

<p>To understand how these definitions have arisen, one must first
understand what the Framers of the U.S. Constitution had in mind
for the new Republic they had created. They allowed for a standing
national army, but insisted that it be kept small, and although it
might be the first force to be called out, and the only force to be
sent abroad, the primary defense of the country was to be the duty
of ordinary citizens, who would be kept in a state of military
readiness while leading their normal lives, and who would be called
up to "repel invasions, suppress insurrections, or execute the
laws", for limited periods of time. At the time the Constitution
was adopted in 1789, the well-established tradition was for local
militia units to be kept in a state of readiness in each and every
community. Such units were organized and trained locally, perhaps
led by the local town or county officials, but otherwise
independent of official control when not actually called up for service.</p>

<p>When lawmakers tried to define the "militia" by statute to
consist of less than the entire body of citizens, they were
defining those citizens who would be required to be kept in a state
of readiness, as was done in the Militia Act of 1792, which
required able-bodied males age 17 through 44 to keep a "musket or
firelock". However, persons younger than 18 and older than 45
regularly responded to call-ups of the Militia and were accepted as
part of it. There were even some women who participated.</p>

<p>The Framers also insisted on a distinction between the "genuine"
Militia and a "select" militia, which they viewed as a danger, just
as much a danger as a standing army. They did not want a militia
whose members might consist of anything less than the entire
people, or at least able-bodied ones in a certain age range,
because if selected on any other basis, they might be used to
oppress other parts of the population.</p>

<p>Actually, George Mason provided the best definition. It only
needs to be broken out into various classes, representing the order
in which persons would be called out for military service.
Qualifications like "able-bodied" or "male" or "age 18-44" only
establish who would be first called to service, with the
expectation that they would be adequate for almost any situation,
but it allows for calling up other persons if needed.</p>

<p>This suggests a hierarchy of classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>National Army.
	<ul>
	<li>Full-time. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard.
	<li>Part-time. Reserves, National Guard.
	</ul>

<li><p>State and Local Select Militia. But these are not "general"
militias. They are paid and equipped by the State or by local governments.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Full-time. State and local law enforcement officers.
	<li>Part-time. State Guard.
	</ul>

<li><p>Obligatory Militia. Able-bodied male citizens of a certain
age range, who are required to be kept organized and trained, but
at their own expense. Age range is 18-44 for federal purposes, but
states may establish other age ranges.</p>

<li><p>Volunteer Militia. Citizens not part of obligatory militia
who voluntarily participate in activities of the obligatory
militia, again at their own expense.</p>

<li><p>Ready Militia. The combination of (3) and (4) above, who
would be called up after the armed forces and the regular militia,
but who are also those likely to be first on the scene in emergency
situations. It is not a "select" militia.</p>

<li><p>Reserve Militia. All other citizens, including children, the
elderly, the less-able, and women, and perhaps foreign visitors as
well, who might be called up after the ready militia, if needed.</p>
</ol>

<p>What is missing from the current picture is the ready militia.</p>

<p>Most states now lump it in with what we are here calling the
reserve militia, and in fact often call it that. The ready militia
is what the Framers meant when they used the term "militia". It is
also what the Swiss mean by the term, and it was the Swiss model
that the Framers had in mind for the United States. The ready
militia was to serve as a counterbalance to the armed forces and
regular state (select) militias.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the obligatory militia is usually defined
to exempt certain public officials, and perhaps persons with
certain occupations, whose usual duties are considered essential.</p>

<p>Choice of words can be indicative. 10 USC 311 lumps the ready and
reserve militias into what it calls the "unorganized" militia, with
the implication that it is to remain unorganized, since no
provisions for organizing and training the ready militia are given,
contrary to the intent of the Framers.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Militias are local and independent</h2>

<p>Often heard are arguments about whether militias are state or
national, but the militia, like citizenship, is fundamentally
local. We are first and foremost citizens of our local community.
The word "citizen" has the same root as the word "city". Although
people may also be concurrently citizens of larger political
entities, such as states or the nation, and although those entities
may be considered to be composed of their citizens, they are
essentially composed of localities, and it is the local community
that is the basis for the social contract, although it may be
considered to include a certain amount of surrounding territory.
Today we would usually identify the locality with the county.</p>

<p>Just as militias are essentially local, so also are they
essentially independent of established authorities, since the
militia may have to challenge or bypass those authorities if they
abuse their authority or fail to perform their lawful duties.</p>

<p>The legal basis for assemblies of militias are two natural
rights: the right to assemble and the right to keep and bear arms.
Combined, they are the right to assemble bearing arms. The Framers
considered it obvious that rights which could be exercised
separately could be exercised in combination, and would have
thought present attempts to outlaw independent assemblies of
militia units as absurd. The term "well-regulated" used in the
Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution did not mean "regulated
by some official". It meant "well-trained and disciplined". A
militia can and should be self-regulated.</p>

<p>The U.S. Constitution, in Article I Section 8, does provide for
States to organize and train their militias according to standards
established by the U.S. Congress, and to appoint the officers, but
it was not the intention of that clause to authorize states to
forbid local organization and training of militia units, but to
require that they be organized and trained. If the state fails to
do so, people have not only the right but the duty to organize and
train themselves locally, using their own arms. Just as they have
the right and duty, failing action on the state level, to conduct
elections, enforce the laws, establish courts, and so forth.</p>

<p>Of course, a militia unit that is not called up by any official,
but by its own members, does not have the authority to compel
participation through some kind of sanction, such as the imposition
of a fine. Therefore it will be composed of volunteers, who may not
represent a cross-section of the general population. In this
situation, the militia members must make a special effort to avoid
having the militia unit take on the attributes of a private
association, such as by always calling up the militia using public
notices, and allowing any responsible citizen to participate. It
must also avoid any suggestion of partisan or sectarian bias, and
limit itself to constitutional actions.</p>

<p>To do this, a militia unit should always refer to itself as the
"[state/county] militia" and not adopt a name that would suggest
some kind of private association, something that would expose its
members to legal action against it as a legal "person" or as a
"conspiracy". There can't be a conspiracy of the entire population
of an area, and a court can't serve the entire population with
process, even if not all of them are present at meetings.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Organizing strategy</h2>

<p>Militia units of 50-200 members should be organized at the local
level, by going house by house, covering entire neighborhoods,
towns, and counties.</p>

<p>This will initially be easier to do in rural areas, where people
are already more receptive to the patriotic message. In urban
areas, it may work better to start by organizing "neighborhood
associations", then educating the members gradually until it can be
converted into a self-conscious militia unit.</p>

<p>Co-ordination among local units should be done using
correspondence committees, which is the traditional method. These
committees do not attempt to act as regional,, state, or national
organizations, but only to facilitate communications among local
units, the sharing of literature, and the building of a consensus
for action.</p>

<p>Some units might try to publish newsletters or other documents,
but in most cases, it will be better to publish through established
magazines and various alternative media, and distribute extra
copies. Members may agree to subscribe to media that co-operate in
publishing supporting materials.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Dealing with official resistance</h2>

<p>For some time now the Establishment has discouraged the formation
of armed groups, including independent constitutional militias.
They don't want the "unorganized" militia to become organized.
Besides legal and illegal harassment, militia leaders must prepare
participants to deal with attempts to infiltrate militia units.
This can take three main forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Moles. Agents who pretend to be trustworthy but who are mainly
focused on obtaining information about militia members and their
activities.</p>

<li><p>Provocators. Agents who pretend to be responsible members, then,
when least expected, do something which seeks to discredit the
militia and perhaps provoke official action against it.</p>

<li><p>Dissipators. Agents who pretend commitment until they can assume
positions of influence within the group, then use it to divert them
into ineffective or unproductive activities, such as endless
debate, socializing, and divisive disputes, or to reduce morale and
resolve.</p>
</ul>

<p>The best protection against infiltration is to teach members to
be vigilant to it and to have a large number of small units and
many leaders, none of whom is critical. There should be little or
no leadership on the state or national level, other than a network
of correspondence committees that facilitate communications.</p>

<p>It is also important to try to establish good relations with
local and state officials, to the extent possible. Work with them
to help them solve the problems of the community, and encourage
them to ask the militia to assist them. Resistance from such
officials should be countered by getting better ones elected or
appointed.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Subjects for action</h2>

<p>One of the most important subjects for action by local militia
units is investigation of election fraud and other kinds of
official corruption. It will do little good to try to elect better
officials if elections are rigged, and if they are, the militia may
become the only way for citizens to secure their rights. If such
fraud is found, it will also help to build public support for
further militia action and for greater participation.</p>

<p>Another key subject is to inform citizens of their right and
duty, when serving as jurors in cases in which the government is a
party, to judge the law and not just the facts in the case. No
matter how despicable the defendant in a criminal case or how
heinous the offense, the jury must find the defendant not guilty if
the law under which he is charged is unconstitutional or
misapplied. It is unconstitutional if it violates a constitutional
right, is not based on a power delegated to government, or is so
vague that honest people may disagree on how to obey or enforce it.
It is misapplied if it is applied to acts outside its proper
jurisdiction, such as a federal criminal law applied to acts
committed on state territory, or to acts not intended to be
included by the lawmakers.</p>

<p>One of the most important subjects for action will be to
establish an alert system for warning of abuses of citizens by
organs of the government, and mobilizing to defend them. It must be
emphasized that it is not enough for citizens to defend their
rights in isolation. Only if they band together can their rights be
protected.</p>

<p>Education in constitutional law must also be a priority. Every
citizen must be trained to interpret the constitutionality of laws
and official acts, and taught that doing so is the responsibility
of each individual, that it cannot be delegated to others, such as
judges or superiors. That is the Lesson of Nuremberg. Special
attention needs to be given to educating lawyers, judges,
officials, and college and high school students. Militia members
need to make sure that every public library contains suitable books
and magazines that provide education on these subjects.</p>

<h1>History of the U.S. Militia</h1>

<p>On April 25, 1995 Mark Pitcavage (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:mpitcava@postbox.acs.ohio-state.edu">mpitcava@postbox.acs.ohio-state.edu</a>)
of the Ohio State University's History Department posted a historical overview
of the U.S. militia.</p>

<p>Pitcavage's main point was that the militia was not, as maintained by the
modern militia movement, an armed populace separate from any branch of
government, but rather a type of military draft run jointly by the federal and
state governments.</p>

<p>Pitcavage explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the framing of the Constitution, the federal and state governments
assumed <em>joint</em> control over the militia.  The President was given
authority over the militia when called into federal service.  Congress was
given the authority to frame laws allowing the president to do that. 
Furthermore, Congress could 1) organize, 2) arm, and 3) discipline the militia.
 To the states were reserved the power to appoint officers and to train the
militia.</p>

<p>What did these powers mean?  To <em>organize</em> the militia meant that
Congress first of all had the power to define what <em>constituted</em> the
militia.  It did so in its first militia law, the Uniform Militia Act of 1792,
when it declared that the militia constituted all white males aged 18-45.  In
addition, this power gave Congress the ability to set up a table of
organization for the militia, to determine what equipment would be required,
etc.  To <em>discipline</em> the militia meant that Congress could prescribe
the tactics by which the militia would train.  The 1792 law prescribed von
Steuben's system of tactics developed in the Revolutionary War.  Subsequent
laws would change this.</p>

<p>The third area was the ability to <em>arm</em> the militia.  This caused a
great deal of debate during the battles for ratification of the Constitution. 
Some people argued that this meant only that Congress had the ability to
specify what type of weapons were required.  Others argued that this gave
Congress the ability or the responsibility to procure arms for the militia ...
The Second Amendment guaranteed that even if Congress had the power to arm the
militia, nothing would prohibit the states from procuring their own arms.</p>

<p>... Under state law, every last detail regarding the militia was regulated,
from the number of and times for musters, court martial procedures, how to
notify people that there would be a muster, fines, how to appeal fines,
uniforms (if applicable), compensation (if applicable, which it usually
wasn't), and so on and so forth.  An average militia law might be 80 pages
long; some were far longer than this.</p>

<p>... the entire militia was subject to the orders of the government ... they
suppressed rebellions, maintained order in the cities, fought Indians, fought
foreigners, celebrated the Fourth of July, and so forth.  All as officially
constituted agents of the government, be it federal or state.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Pitcavage goes on to say that the militia as "armed populace" is a myth. The
law limited the militia to a portion of the populace, namely white men in a
certain age range, and states provided numerous exemptions so that "the militia
consisted of people too poor and too dumb to get out of it." Further, not all
militia were armed, as firearms were scarce in much of the South and West,
according to Pitcavage.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with the organization of the militia in the 1820's and
1830's led the states to switch from compulsory militia to volunteer militia in
the 1840's. By the 1850's, only a vestige of the militia remained.</p>

<p>With the outbreak of the Civil War, militias came back into use, gradually
evolving into the National Guard, solidified with the Dick Act of 1903, the
National Defense Act of 1916 and 1920 and 1933 amendments to the National
Defense Act.</p>

<title>The Modern Militia Movement</title>

<h1>The Modern Citizen Militia Movement</h1>

<p>August 1994, from Jon Roland, 319/264-2511:</p>

<p>SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, AUGUST 7, 1994 -- Jon Roland, a founding
member of the Texas Militia Correspondence Committee, today
reported that constitutional militias have so far been organized
in 15 states:
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mt/">Montana</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/">Oregon</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/">Indiana</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ut/">Utah</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a>, and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a>, and
inquiries for information on how to
organize militias have so far been received from every state except
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/de/">Delaware</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/hi/">Hawaii</a>.
Roland said that units have been formed in at
least 10 counties in Texas alone, with more forming each week.</p>

<p>Roland said that most such militia units are keeping a low
profile for the time being, until they become established, mainly
recruiting through word of mouth and announcements on talk
radio. He said that the Texas Militia Correspondence Committee
is not in contact with most of them yet, but has found the materials
produced by the Texas group being widely copied and circulated.</p>

<p>"The main motivating factor for this recent upsurge in
activity," said Roland, "has been the ill-conceived gun control
provisions of the current Crime Bill. People everywhere see it not
only as a major assault on their constitutional rights to keep and
bear arms, but as a more sinister preparation for depriving them
of  their other constitutional rights after they have been disarmed.
They perceive a greater threat from criminal officials than from
criminal street gangs."</p>

<p>Which is not to say that some officials have not become
involved, as well. "Several counties in Western Florida have
declared all their citizens to be members of the Militia," Roland
said, "and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/Catron.html">Catron
County</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>,
has just joined the list of
communities that actually require all their heads of households to
keep a gun suitable for militia duty. We haven't seen this much
organizing activity since the Civil War, or so much legislative
activity since the Militia Act of 1792, which required every able-
bodied male citizen of the United States to keep a firearm."</p>

<p>"It is not just gun rights that are involved in this movement,"
Roland said. "This Crime Bill is only the latest move in what people
perceive as a progressive overthrow of the Constitution by a
conspiracy of special interests that are not accountable to the
people and which operate above the law. Patriotic Americans don't
just want to hang on to such rights as they have left, but to roll
back this growth of tyranny. They have lost confidence in the
integrity of our legal institutions, including courts and elections."</p>

<p>"Much of the legislation that has been adopted and that has
become established during the past 60 years is unconstitutional,"
Roland added. "For too many legislators, the Constitution has
become just window-dressing. Lawmakers  support the provisions
they like and discard the rest, and even the provisions they support
are subject to compromise just like those of an ordinary statute."</p>

<p>"That is not to say," said Roland, "that there are not powers
that the federal government has assumed that are not appropriate
for it to exercise, but not until after the Constitution has been
amended to delegate such powers to it." Examples of such powers
might include regulation of aviation and electronic
communications, he added.</p>

<p>"The main cause of this incremental overthrow of the
Constitution has been demands from special interests, and
sometimes from the people, for solutions to problems without a
demand to keep the solutions constitutional. Legislators yield to
these pressures, leaving it to the courts to strike down the
provisions that are unconstitutional. But the courts avoid doing
that. Instead, they engage in the most amazing twists of logic to try
to go along with what the lawmakers and bureaucrats have done.
The result is that we are becoming a government of men instead
of law, with no truly guaranteed rights or limitations on powers.
And there is no shortage of corrupt or overzealous officials to step
in to abuse their new powers. The result is a creeping tyranny,
which, as it affects more and more citizens, is causing growing
frustration, disillusionment, and anger."</p>

<p>"The Framers envisioned a Militia System for this country,"
said Roland, "similar to that of Switzerland. We have allowed that
system to fall into disuse, and we are now suffering the
consequences of that. It is time to revive the constitutional militia,
as a substitute for bureaucratic action and as a check on abusive
government".</p>

<p>"The assault on Mount Carmel has been the wakeup call for
our generation," said Roland. "The whole world saw agents of the
U.S. Government, supposed to be the standard for liberty, get away
with murder. We no longer regard the feds as the good guys,
without question."</p>

<p>"The present Crime Bill just reinforces this suspicion," said
Roland. "It does almost nothing to protect the public. What is does
do is extend federal control in ways that only make sense if it is a
preparation for an overthrow of the Constitution. All that money
for policemen is only going to fund federal agents in local law
enforcement organizations that can perpetrate abuses under the
cover of those organizations and prevent those organizations from
doing anything to stop those abuses, as the Texas Rangers almost
did at Waco."</p>

<p>"We no longer have confidence in local law enforcement to
protect us," said Roland. "If there is another Waco," said Roland,
"we will look to the Militia to defend the innocent, and the
outcome may be quite different. The first American Revolution
began with an attempt by the authorities to disarm the people,"
Roland said. "It could happen again."</p>

<h1>The Victoria Militia</h1>

<p>The August 7, 1994
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a> <cite>Express-News</cite> reported on the
forming of a militia in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Victoria.html">Victoria</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> by about a dozen
residents "fed up with gun control."</p>

<p>Local authorities supported the militia's right to bear arms and defend
liberty, but cautioned them not to break the law. "A militia by its very
nature is constitutional; a vigilante group is not," said Lt. Tom Eastland,
head of the Victoria Police Department's crime prevention unit, according to
the <cite>Express-News</cite>.</p>

<title>The Texas Constitutional Militia</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Dallas, Bryan, and Montgomery County, Texas;
	New Mexico; Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: first muster April 1994; strategy session December 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> Militia</h1>
 
<p>Ambrose Evans-Pritchard reported on the Texas Constitutional Militia
for the December 4, 1994 <cite>Sunday Telegraph</cite> ("Patriot games turn
deadly"), a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> newspaper. Despite the
article's title, no death was involved.</p>

<p>The article described a strategy session of the Texas Constitutional
Militia (northern region) near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>.
The TCM held its first muster
at the Alamo in
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a> on April 19, 1994. April 19 is a significant
date to militia, being the anniversary of both the start of the American
Revolution and of the fire that ended the U.S. government's
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">siege of the
Branch Davidians</a> at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>.</p>

<p>Reported Evans-Pritchard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Texas Constitutional Militia are not an underground guerrilla
force. But they want to keep a low profile during the crucial
organizing phase. Most of them dissapprove of the now celebrated
Michigan Militia which has gone public in a spectacular way by
releasing a videotape of itself training with assault rifles in
the woods.</p>

<p>... the leaders claim that several thousand Texans are actively participa-
ting in one way or another.</p>

<p>... The last straw was the Waco assault, the gassing and incineration
of 17 children and 64 adults at the Branch Davidian commmunity last
year. Nobody has been brought to account for that abuse of power.</p>

<p>"We were sleep-walking through life. It was the massacre that woke
us all up", said John Turner, a small businessman who commands the northern
region of Texas.</p>

<p>... Training is done by a team of former Green Berets and Navy Seals. It
includes survival techniques and urban and rural guerrilla warfare.
Turner insisted that there was no plan to take offensive action.
"We're 90 per-cent real Christians . We don't want to start blowing
up bridges or sniping at Judges."</p>

<p>... The main purpose of the movement, its members claim, is deterrence.
Every time the government oversteps its authority it will have to
consider the possibility of armed opposition. And if it tries another
Waco, it will have a minor war on its hands.</p>

<p>The National Guard will not be of much help, at least in Texas. A
large number of police officers, sherriffs and reserve guardsmen are
secret members of the militia. The army cannot be counted on either.
Behind the Texas Constitutional Militia there are layers of para-military
groups that tap into the US Military Complex.</p>

<p>For example, there are three battalions of the Texas Light Infantry.
They are disgruntled former members of the Texas State Guard, a
military police auxiliary under state control. "We do airborne
parachuting, night ambush operations, and we simulate explosives" said
Gert Ording, commander of the Third Battalion in Bryan.</p>

<p>Secretly, there is much else besides. The most serious force appears
to be Big Star One, a Division sized network in northern Texas,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a> that
includes serving officers of the U.S.
military. If found out they could face a court martial.</p>

<p>It is made up of three military Brigades, according to a member of
one outfit: The Delta, Culpepper and Orange brigades. "We're primarily
training in guerrilla warfare. We learned a lot from the Viet-Cong."
Among thier senior commanders are officers from the US artillery base
at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and Shepard Air Force Base in Texas. The
clandestine division has been excercing in west Texas using mortars
and grenade launchers. " There will be no Waco in this area," said the
source.</p>

<title>Northwest Florida Militia</title>
<!-- Place: Santa Rosa County, Escambia County and Okaloosa County,
	Florida (USA) -->
<!-- Time: May 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Northwest Florida Militia</h1>

<p>In 1994, three Florida Panhandle counties established militia as a sign of
protest against gun control, and specifically the assault weapons ban.</p>

<p>As reported in the <cite>New York Times</cite> in May 1994, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/SantaRosa.html">Santa
Rosa</a> County Commission unanimously established a militia comprised of
every able-bodied man, woman and child. County commissioners will distribute
membership cards and wall plaques to people wanting to make a statement
of support for gun rights.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/Escambia.html">Escambia</a>
and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/Okaloosa.html">Okaloosa</a>
counties followed suit not long after. Escambia,
Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties are <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida's</a> westernmost
counties, making up a good portion of the "Panhandle" area.</p>

<p>Jim Barnett is a leader in the northwest Florida militia, and believes the
Second Amendment exempts militia members from gun control laws such as the
assault weapon ban. Barnett owns Gateswood Sports Inc., a guns, archery and
fishing store north of Pensacola.</p>

<title>Militia Rally in Tallahassee</title>
<!-- Place: Tallahassee, Florida (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 12, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Rally in Tally</h1>

<p>From John S. Burns Sr., 813-369-5273:</p>

<p>In January of 1994 a local talk show host, Mike Willy, in the Orlando,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> area
made an 'off the wall comment' in response to a call
concerning upcoming Anti-gun legislation in Florida.</p>

<p>"Well lets hold a demonstration in Orlando."</p>

<p>Another caller immediately replied, "Hell! Let's march on
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/Tallahassee.html">Tallahassee</a>!"</p>

<p>Three short weeks later on Abraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, 1994,
thousands of people converged on the state capitol steps for --</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Shot Heard Round The World - Part II</h2>

<p>In spite of posturing by current and would be politicians, One message
rang loud and clear, and was best summed by one sign which read --</p>

<p>"We Come Unarmed, THIS TIME!"</p>

<p>This was not a Rally about family values, or outcome based education,
of abortion, or welfare, or of taxes, although all of these subjects were
discussed.</p>

<p>This was not a gathering of any political party, or of any political
action group, though many were well represented by their members.
This was instead, The Armed Militia of The Great State of Florida,
as defined in title 10, section 311 of the Code of the United States,
Called to it's sacred duty, the defense of the Constitution of the
United States of America, against <em>all</em> enemies, Foreign and
domestic, and the defense of the rights and civil liberties guaranteed under
it.</p>

<p>Now let this message go across this great country - <em>we will march on
Washington!</em> And we formally request the assistance and accompaniment of
the Militias of our 49 sister states and the U.S. territories.</p>

<p>Gather your friends and relatives. And meet us in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington D.C.</a> to
deliver this message - We are free men, And we will <em>stay that way</em>!
<em>All</em> gun control legislation will be stopped and repealed!</p>

<title>Militiaman, License Plate and Death</title>
<!-- Place: near Frazeysburg, Ohio (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 28(?), 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>'Militiaman' Killed By Cop</h1>

<p>Michael H. Hill, 50, replaced his
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> license plate
with a home-made one
reading "Militia." Needless to say, this was not considered acceptable
behavior by the local police.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/Frazeysburg.html">Frazeysburg</a>,
Ohio Sgt. Matt May stopped Hill's car a little after 2am
because it had no state license plate. Hill came out, was asked to get back
inside. He did, and drove away. May followed Hill for a few miles, when Hill
stopped again. This time Hill came out with a .45-caliber handgun, at which
point the officer shot and killed him.</p>

<p>Although police have received a few threatening phone calls, local militia
leaders are cooperating with law enforcement to defuse the situation. Gary
Long of the Southeastern Ohio Defense Force militia said he did not know Hill.
"There is no animosity between the militia and law enforcement around here,"
he said. "We work with them."</p>

<p>This incident points up the amalgam of views that make up the modern militia
movement. For the most part, militias are a new phenomenon, attracting people
who haven't previously been very active politically or ideologically. These
new people tend to be moderate conservatives or libertarians, often
religious, and in general average people.</p>

<p>But the militia movement has also attracted remnants of previous and
contemporary movements. Hill apparently comes from the "county movement,"
which rejects all authority above the level of the county. County-movement
advocates reject license plates, drivers' licenses and such.</p>

<p>To survive as a viable movement, militias must more precisely define
themselves ideologically. Militias have done a good job of rejecting racism
and violence. Now they must offer a positive vision of what they do support.</p>

<title>Police Protection Not Enough</title>
<!-- Place: London (UK); UK; DC (USA); USA -->
<!-- Time: first English police force in London in 1827;
	1800's - 1900's -->

<body>

<h1>Police Protection Is Not Enough</h1>

<p>The following is an article by Peter Kasler. I don't know how to get in
touch with the author, and am reprinting this without permission until I
find out. It's just too good.</p>

<p>"Police Have No Duty To Protect Individuals" by Peter Kasler.
COPYRIGHT 1992 Peter Alan Kasler.</p>

<p> All our lives, especially during our younger years, we hear that
the police are there to protect us. From the very first kindergarten-class
visit of "Officer Friendly" to the very last time we saw a police
car - most of which have "To Protect and Serve" emblazoned on their doors -
we're encouraged to give ourselves over to police protection. But it hasn't
always been that way.</p>

<p> Before the mid-1800s, American and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> citizens - even in large
cities - were expected to protect themselves and each other. Indeed, they
were legally required to pursue and attempt to apprehend criminals. The
notion of a police force in those days was abhorrent in England and America,
where liberals viewed it as a form of the dreaded "standing army."</p>

<p> England's first police force, in London, was not instituted until
1827. The first such forces in America followed in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>,
Boston, and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Philadelphia.html">Philadelphia</a>
during the period between 1835 and 1845. They were established
only to augment citizen self-protection. It was never intended that they act
affirmatively, prior to or during criminal activity or violence against
individual citizens. Their duty was to protect society as a whole by
deterrence; i.e., by systematically patrolling, detecting and apprehending
criminals after the occurrence of crimes. There was no thought of police
displacing the citizens' right of self-protection. Nor could they, even if it
were intended.</p>

<p> Professor Don B. Kates, Jr., eminent civil rights lawyer and
criminologist, states:</p>

<p> Even if all 500,000 American police officers were assigned to patrol,
they could not protect 240 million citizens from upwards of 10 million
criminals who enjoy the luxury of deciding when and where to strike. But we
have nothing like 500,000 patrol officers; to determine how many police are
actually available for any one shift, we must divide the 500,000 by four
(three shifts per day, plus officers who have days off, are on sick leave,
etc.). The resulting number must be cut in half to account for officers
assigned to investigations, juvenile, records, laboratory, traffic, etc.,
rather than patrol.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p> Such facts are underscored by the practical reality of today's
society. Police and Sheriff's departments are feeling the financial
exigencies of our times, and that translates directly to a reduction of
services, i.e. even less protection. For example, one moderate day recently
(September 23, 1991) the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a> Police Department "dropped"<a href="#fn2">[2]</a> 157
calls to its 911 facility, and about 1,000 calls to its general telephone
number (415-553-0123). An SFPD dispatcher said that 150 dropped 911 calls,
and 1,000 dropped general number calls, are about average on any given
day.<a href="#fn3">[3]</a></p>

<p> It is, therefore, a fact of law and of practical necessity that
individuals are responsible for their own personal safety, and that of
their loved ones. Police protection must be recognized for what it is:
only an auxiliary general deterrent.</p>

<p> Because the police have no general duty to protect individuals,
judicial remedies are not available for their failure to protect. In other
words, if someone is injured because they expected but did not receive police
protection, they cannot recover damages by suing (except in very special
cases, explained below). Despite a long history of such failed attempts,
however, many, people persist in believing the police are obligated to
protect them, attempt to recover when no protection was forthcoming, and are
emotionally demoralized when the recovery fails. Legal annals abound with
such cases.</p>

<p> <cite>Warren v. District of Columbia</cite> is one of the leading cases of this
type. Two women were upstairs in a townhouse when they heard their roommate,
a third woman, being attacked downstairs by intruders. They phoned the police
several times and were assured that officers were on the way. After about 30
minutes, when their roommate's screams had stopped, they assumed the police
had finally arrived. When the two women went downstairs they saw that in fact
the police never came, but the intruders were still there. As the Warren
court graphically states in the opinion: "For the next fourteen hours the
women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts
upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers."</p>

<p> The three women sued the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">District of Columbia</a>
 for failing to protect
them, but D.C.'s highest court exonerated the District and its police, saying
that it is a "fundamental principle of American law that a government and its
agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police
protection, to any individual citizen."<a href="#fn4">[4]</a> There are many
similar cases with results to the same effect.<a href="#fn5">[5]</a></p>

<p> In the <cite>Warren</cite> case the injured parties sued the District of
Columbia under its own laws for failing to protect them. Most often such cases
are brought in state (or, in the case of <cite>Warren</cite>, D.C.) courts for
violation of state statutes, because federal law pertaining to these matters
is even more onerous. But when someone does sue under federal law, it is
nearly always for violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 (often inaccurately referred to
as "the civil rights act"). Section 1983 claims are brought against
government officials for allegedly violating the injured parties' federal
statutory or Constitutional rights.</p>

<p> The seminal case establishing the general rule that police have no duty under
federal law to protect citizens is <cite>DeShaney v. Winnebago County
Department of Social Services</cite>.<a href="#fn6">[6]</a>
Frequently these cases are based on an alleged "special relationship" between
the injured party and the police. In <cite>DeShaney</cite> the injured party
was a boy who was beaten and permanently injured
by his father. He claimed a special relationship existed because local
officials knew he was being abused, indeed they had "specifically proclaimed
by word and deed [their] intention to protect him against that
danger,"<a href="#fn7">[7]</a>
but failed to remove him from his father's custody.</p>

<p> The Court in <cite>DeShaney</cite> held that no duty arose because of a
"special relationship," concluding that Constitutional duties of care and protection
only exist as to certain individuals, such as incarcerated prisoners,
involuntarily committed mental patients and others restrained against their
will and therefore unable to protect themselves. "The affirmative duty to
protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament
or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which
it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf."<a href="#fn8">[8]</a></p>

<p> About a year later, the United States Court of Appeals interpreted
<cite>DeShaney</cite> in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
case of <cite>Balistreri v. Pacifica
Police Department</cite>.<a href="#fn9">[9]</a> Ms. Balistreri, beaten and
harassed by her estranged husband,
alleged a "special relationship" existed between her and the Pacifica Police
Department, to wit, they were duty-bound to protect her because there was a
restraining order against her husband. The Court of Appeals, however,
concluded that <cite>DeShaney</cite> limited the circumstances that would
give rise to a "special relationship" to instances of custody. Because no such custody
existed in <cite>Balistreri</cite>, the Pacifica Police had no duty to
protect her, so when they failed to do so and she was injured they were not liable. A citizen
injured because the police failed to protect her can only sue the State or
local government in federal court if one of their officials violated a
federal statutory or Constitutional right, and can only win such a suit if a
"special relationship" can be shown to have existed, which
<cite>DeShaney</cite> and its progeny make it very difficult to do. Moreover,
<cite>Zinermon v. Burch</cite><a href="#fn10">[10]</a> very
likely precludes Section 1983 liability for police agencies in these types of
cases if there is a potential remedy via a State tort action.</p>

<p> Many states, however, have specifically precluded such claims,
barring lawsuits against State or local officials for failure to protect, by
enacting statutes such as California's Government Code, Sections 821, 845,
and 846 which state, in part: "Neither a public entity or a public employee
[may be sued] for failure to provide adequate police protection or service,
failure to prevent the commission of crimes and failure to apprehend
criminals."</p>

<p> It is painfully clear that the police cannot be relied upon to
protect us. Thus far we've seen that they have no duty to do so. And we've
also seen that even if they did have a duty to protect us, practically-
speaking they could not fulfill it with sufficient certainty that we would
want to bet our lives on it.</p>

<p> Now it's time to take off the gloves, so to speak, and get down to
reality. So the police aren't duty-bound to protect us, and they can't be
expected to protect us even if they want to. Does that mean that they won't
protect us if they have the opportunity?</p>

<p> One of the leading cases on this point dates way back into the
1950s.<a href="#fn11">[11]</a>
A certain Ms. Riss was being harassed by a former boyfriend, in a
familiar pattern of increasingly violent threats. She went to the police for
help many times, but was always rebuffed. Desperate because she could not get
police protection, she applied for a gun permit, but was refused that as
well. On the eve of her engagement party she and her mother went to the
police one last time pleading for protection against what they were certain
was a serious and dangerous threat. And one last time the police refused.
As she was leaving the party, her former boyfriend threw acid in her face,
blinding and permanently disfiguring her.</p>

<p> Her case against the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">City of
New York</a> for failing to protect her
was, not surprisingly, unsuccessful. The lone dissenting justice of New
York's high court wrote in his opinion: "What makes the City's position
[denying any obligation to protect the woman] particularly difficult to
understand is that, in conformity to the dictates of the law [she] did not
carry any weapon for self-defense. Thus, by a rather bitter irony she was
required to rely for protection on the City of New York which now denies all
responsibility to her."<a href="#fn12">[12]</a></p>

<p> Instances of police refusing to protect someone in grave danger, who
is urgently requesting help, are becoming disturbingly more common. In 1988,
Lisa Bianco's violently abusive husband was finally in jail for beating and
kidnapping her, after having victimized her for years. Ms. Bianco was
somewhat comforted by the facts that he was supposedly serving a seven-year
sentence, and she had been promised by the authorities that she'd be notified
well in advance of his release. Nevertheless, after being in only a short
time, he was temporarily released on an eight-hour pass, and she wasn't
notified. He went directly to her house and, in front of their 6- and 10-
year old daughters, beat Lisa Bianco to death.</p>

<p> In 1989, in a suburb of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>, Maria Navarro called the L. A.
County  Sheriff's 911 emergency line asking for help. It was her birthday and
there was a party at her house, but her estranged husband, against whom she
had had a restraining order, said he was coming over to kill her. She
believed him, but got no sympathy from the 911 dispatcher, who said: "What do
you want us to do lady, send a car to sit outside your house?" Less than half
an hour after Maria hung up in frustration, one of her guests called the same
911 line and informed the dispatcher that the husband was there and had
already killed Maria and one other guest. Before the cops arrived, he had
killed another.</p>

<p> But certainly no cop would stand by and do nothing while someone was
being violently victimized. Or would they? In <cite>Freeman v.
Ferguson</cite><a href="#fn13">[13]</a> a
police chief directed his officers not to enforce a restraining order against
a woman's estranged husband because the man was a friend of the chief's. The
man subsequently killed the woman and her daughter. Perhaps such a specific
case is an anomaly, but more instances of general abuses aren't at all rare.</p>

<p> In one such typical case<a href="#fn14">[14]</a>,
a woman and her son were harassed,
threatened and assaulted by her estranged husband, all in violation of his
probation and a restraining order. Despite numerous requests for police
protection, the police did nothing because "the police department used an
administrative classification that resulted in police protection being fully
provided to persons abused by someone with whom the victim has no domestic
relationship, but less protection when the victim is either: 1) a woman
abused or assaulted by a spouse or boyfriend, or 2) a child abused by a
father or stepfather."<a href="#fn15">[15]</a></p>

<p> In a much more recent case,<a href="#fn16">[16]</a> a woman claimed she
was injured because the police refused to make an arrest following a domestic
violence call. She claimed their refusal to arrest was due to a city policy of
gender-based discrimination. In that case the U. S. District Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit held that "no constitutional violation [occurred] when
the most that can be said of the police is that they stood by and did
nothing ..."<a href="#fn17">[17]</a></p>

<p> Do the police really harbor such indifference to the plight of
certain victims? To answer that, let's leave the somewhat aloof and
dispassionate world of legal precedent and move into the more easily
understood "real world." I can state from considerable personal experience,
unequivocally, that these things do happen. As to why they occur, I can offer
only my opinion based on that experience and on additional research into the
dark and murky areas of criminal sociopathy and police abuse.</p>

<p> One client of my partner's and mine had a restraining order against
her violently abusive estranged husband. He had recently beaten her so
savagely a metal plate had to be implanted in her jaw. Over and over he
violated the court order, sometimes thirty times daily. He repeatedly
threatened to kill her and those of us helping her. But the cops refused to
arrest him for violating the order, even though they'd witnessed him doing so
more than once. They danced around all over the place trying to explain why
they wouldn't enforce the order, including inventing numerous absurd excuses
about having lost her file (a common tactic in these cases). It finally came
to light that there was a departmental order to not arrest anyone in that
county for violating a protective order because the county had recently been
sued by an irate (and wealthy) domestic violence arrestee.</p>

<p> In another of our cases, when Peggi and I served the man with
restraining orders (something we're often required to do because various law
enforcement agencies can't or won't do it), he threatened there and then to
kill our client. Due to the vigorous nature of the threat, we went
immediately to the police department to get it on file in case he attempted
to carry it out during the few days before the upcoming court appearance. We
spent hours filing the report, but two days later when our client went to the
police department for a copy to take to court, she was told there was no
record of her, her restraining order, her case, or our report.</p>

<p> She called in a panic. Without that report it would be more difficult
securing a permanent restraining order against him. I paid an immediate visit
to the chief of that department. We discussed the situation and I suggested
various options, including dragging the officer to whom Peggi and I had given
the detailed death threat report into court to explain under oath how it had
gotten lost. In mere moments, an internal affairs officer was assigned to
investigate and, while I waited, they miraculously produced the file and our
report. I was even telephoned later and offered an effusive apology by
various members of the department.</p>

<p> It is true that in the real world, law enforcement authorities very
often do perpetuate the victimization. It is also true that each of us is the
only person upon whom we can absolutely rely to avoid victimization. If our
client in the last anecdote hadn't taken responsibility for her own fate, she
might never have survived the ordeal. But she had sufficient resolve to fend
for herself. Realizing the police couldn't or wouldn't help her, she
contacted us. Then, when the police tried their bureaucratic shuffle on her,
she called me. But for her determination to be a victim no more, and to take
responsibility for her own destiny, she might have joined the countless
others victimized first by criminals, then by the very system they expect
will protect them.</p>

<p> Remember, even if the police were obligated to protect us (which they
aren't), or even if they tried to protect us (which they often don't, a fact
brought home to millions nationwide as they watched in horror the recent
events in Los Angeles), most often there wouldn't be time enough for them to
do it. It's about time that we came to grips with that, and resolved never to
abdicate responsibility for our personal safety, and that of our loved ones,
to anyone else.</p>

<h1>Firearms in the Home</h1>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David
Deming</a>:</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that most advocates of gun control simply are
ignorant of the facts regarding the relationship between violence and 
firearms. Typical of these is the letter by Ellen Scheer which appeared in
the <cite>Oklahoman</cite> last Saturday, July 2. Ms. Scheer cites the
discredited study by Kellerman et al. which concluded that "in a home with
a gun....a family member is 43 times more likely to be shot than an 
intruder."  However, Ms. Scheer does not tell us that of the 43 shootings,
37 are suicides. We may reasonably conclude that these suicides would not
have been prevented by the absence of a firearm, because it is well 
known that gun availability does not influence suicide rates. For example,
private gun ownership in Japan is virtually unknown, yet the suicide rate
in Japan is twice that of the U.S..</p>

<p>There are two other flaws in the Kellerman study cited by Ms. Scheer. The
first of these is that Kellerman did not consider instances where a gun 
was used to ward off an anticipated criminal act but not fired, or was fired
and did not result in a death. Professor Gary Kleck of Florida State
University has estimated that guns are used for self defense against
criminals more than 2 million times a year.  In more than 98% of these 
cases the gun is not fired. Professor Kleck is a self-described liberal
Democrat and <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">ACLU</a> member who has
never accepted any funding from the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
or any other gun rights organization. Kleck's research is important in that
he is regarded by his colleagues as the leading expert on the subject of
firearms and violence.</p>

<p>For example, Kleck's book <cite>Point Blank:  Guns and Violence in
America</cite> was the winner of the 1993 Hindelang award from the American
Society of Criminology for "the book published in the past two years that
makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology". The other major 
flaw in the Kellerman study is that Kellerman groups the socially
dysfunctional with normal people, yet most familial gun violence is found
almost exclusively within a pathological subset of the general population:  
alcoholics, career criminals, drug addicts, etc. Professor Kleck has
concluded that for most people "the risks of a fatal gun accident are
negligible". When all of the defensive uses of firearms are factored in and
the suicides factored out, we find that a homeowner is 200 times more likely
to use a gun to prevent a criminal assault than to cause the death of an
innocent member of the household.</p>

<p>Ms. Scheer informs us that the U.S. has a teen-age murder rate seven times
higher than any nation in Western Europe. Presumably, Ms. Scheer is implying 
that the higher incidence of gun ownership in the U.S. causes the increased
violence. However, she does not consider the most obvious alternative
hypothesis:  that an increased level of violence leads to a higher level of
gun ownership for defensive purposes.  Gun ownership is only one of many
variables that affect violence levels in different countries, societies, and
cultures. When factors such as race and culture are taken in consideration,
it is usually found that increased gun ownership is correlated with lower
violence levels. For example, the homicide rate amongst individuals of
Japanese ancestry living in America is less than half that of Japanese in
Japan.</p>

<p>I agree with Ms. Scheer that "gun violence costs too much ... to allow it to
increase any further." However, the consensus amongst serious and unbiased
researchers is that the availability of guns amongst the general population
certainly does not cause violent crime, and probably is an inhibitor of such
crime. Ignorance is not a virtue, and gun control policies conceived in
ignorance are likely to increase suffering amongst the innocent, not 
alleviate it.</p>

<body>

<h1>Firearms Used In Crime</h1>

<p><cite>USA Today</cite> published a full page graphic of the
most popular "crime guns" as reported by the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms. Only one so-called assault weapon
is on the list and it is number 9:</p>

<ol>
<li>Smith & Wesson .38 Special Revolver
<li>Raven Arms .25 caliber
<li>Davis P-380
<li>Smith & Wesson .357 Revolver
<li>Ruger .22 caliber
<li>Lorcin L-380
<li>Smith & Wesson semiautomatic handgun
<li>Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun
<li>Tech DC-9
<li>Remington 12 gauge shotgun
</ol>

<p>Any numbers from BATF are suspect, both because BATF has an agenda to push
and because states don't uniformly report crime statistics to the federal
government. Nonetheless, the info above is useful, if taken with a grain of
salt.</p>

<title>American Criminals Move to Japan</title>

<h1>An American Gangster in Japan</h1>

<p>April 1994, from Tom Wyld of <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
Public Affairs (703-267-3820):</p>

<p> CLINTON OFFICIAL CONFIRMS PRIVATE GUN OWNERSHIP IN AMERICA DETERS CRIME</p>

<p> Washington, D.C. -- Days before the U.S. Congress holds hearings on whether to ban guns, a Clinton Administration official -- former Vice
President Walter Mondale -- confirmed that private gun ownership in
America deters crime and sends criminals packing.</p>

<p> In an April 20 message from the American Embassy in Tokyo, Ambassador
Mondale reported that a twenty-member gang moved to Japan after
finding criminal activity in this country "too dangerous because of
the prevalence of guns in the homes.  After two dozen successful
burglaries in gun-free Tokyo, they managed to mail over six million
dollars worth of stolen cash and jewels" to conspirators in Colombia.</p>

<p> For research on gun ownership as a crime deterrent, consult <cite>Point
Blank</cite> (1991; NY:  Aldine de Gruyter) by Gary Kleck, Professor of
Criminology, Florida State University.</p>

<p> For a critical review of international gun laws, see <cite>The Samurai, The
Mountie and the Cowboy (Should America Adopt the Gun Controls of
Other Democracies?)</cite> (1992; NY: Prometheus Books) by David Kopel.

<p>Opponents of the right to self defense often claim that firearms are not
good defensive weapons. These cases bear witness otherwise. While other

this one consists entirely of real-world examples of self defense. Most

<title>HCI's Tactics</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Tactics Used By Gun Opponents</h1>

<p>Handgun Control Inc. is one of the leading proponents of gun control.
Their <cite>Quick Guide to Arguing with the Gun Zealots</cite> cites tactics
to use in public debate; as is to be expected, it relies on fear and
misinformation, since the facts are on the opposite side.</p>

<p>From the guide: "Strategic points to remember for public speaking:"</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"Today's criminals and gangbangers outgun our cops."</p>

<p>And where do they get their guns? Not through normal retail channels, but
through informal swaps, thievery and the black market. Criminals and
gangbangers will also outgun innocent citizens if HCI has its way.</p>

<li><p>"Our children are being threatened, murdered and cut down in the
street."</p>

<li><p>"There is no sporting purpose for a semi-automatic firearm."</p>

<p>This is patently untrue. Semi-automatics are widely used in hunting and
marksmanship.</p>

<li><p>"The 2nd Amendment does not protect the right to own military or
semi-automatic arms."</p>

<p>If the Second Amendment doesn't protect military weapons ("a well-regulated
militia ..."), then what does it protect? If it doesn't protect anything, why
is it there?</p>

<li><p>"With tens of millions of people owning guns, the potential for
lawlessness and gun massacres increases ten fold each year."</p>

<p>Non sequitur. Gun ownership by law-abiding citizens for sporting and
defensive use does not have any bearing on criminal gun use, except as a
deterrent to crimes of personal violence.</p>

<li><p>"The current crime wave can touch any community, and social strata."</p>

<p>Crimes of personal violence are most frequent in areas with the strictest
gun control. Communities and social strata with extensive gun ownership and
little gun control will be affected less by "the current crime wave."</p>

<li><p>"Handguns have no purposes other than killing people."</p>

<p>Well, they do (marksmanship and wounding people among others), but
killing a violent attacker is a legitimate use of handguns. Does HCI believe
that rape victims should simply endure their torture, or that people should
watch idly as their family members are murdered?</p>

<li><p>"Households with guns are 43 times more likely to have their guns used
against a family member than those households without guns."</p>

<p>A number based on sloppy research. 37 of those 43 killings are suicides
and most of the rest take place in violent families. The faulty study that
produced those numbers did not take into account defensive uses of firearms
that did not result in death.</p>

<li><p>"Self defense is no legitimate reason for owning a gun (see Above
Point)."</p>

<p>Of course the above point is misinformation, so this one falls down too.
Researcher Gary Kleck produced conclusive evidence that firearms are used
successfully and frequently in defense against crime. Further, defense against
individual crime is not the only defensive purpose of firearms; defense
and deterrent against tyranny is a vastly more important use.</p>

<li><p>"The vast majority of crime guns are bought legally."</p>

<p>That depends of course on how much gun control there is. In cities like
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>
<em>no</em> crime guns are bought legally, yet criminal gun use is
still rampant. Most "crime guns" are bought and sold informally, as opposed
to normal retail channels, whether the sale is legal or not.</p>

<li><p>"Most Gun dealers sell thousands of guns illegally to gangs and criminals
every day."</p>

<p>Huh? No evidence, just a bold claim.</p>

</ul>

<p>The guide describes "other pressing points:"</p>

<ul>

<li><p>"Military Assault weapons. The confusion by the general public between
semi-automatic weapons can work in our favor. Constantly dropping the words
- submachine gun, fully automatic, machine gun, military weapon, high tech
killing machine are good debater's tricks to instill a sense of dread over
these weapons. Ultimately people will learn to dread these weapons just like
chemical warfare weapons and toxic waste dumps."</p>

<p>Here they promote misleading the public! There is no substantive difference
between an "assault" semi-automatic weapon and any other semi-automatic
weapon. Fully automatic weapons, while heavily restricted, are legal in the
U.S. Legal full auto weapons owners are never involved in crime, period.</p>

<li><p>"Semi Automatic Weapons. Remember that there is no place for any kind of
semi auto weapon in a safe society regardless of how it looks, since many so
called sport rifles can be easily converted to a military configuration.
Thus all semi automatic weapons are capable of being called 'assault weapons'.
Never let up on this fact."</p>

<p>Here they admit the previous point, that sport rifles and "assault" rifles
are essentially similar. Why a small-caliber semi-automatic rifle is so much
more deadly than a shotgun, I haven't a clue.</p>

<li><p>"Endangerment of Children. It is difficult for the Gun groups to counter
arguments which call attention to the endangerment of children.  Making the
opposition look callous creates an image of brutality and indifference to
the audience. Keep this point in the fore front of any public argument."</p>

<p>Rely on emotion not facts, they say. Because the facts are against them.
A child whose parents have firearms and know how to use them is a child safer
against personal violence.</p>

<li><p>"Enough is enough. Americans are sick and tired of the violence that is
infecting our society.  Press forth this point and other points of a
related nature.  It is time for action, to take back our streets from crime.
If we don't take action now, this crime wave will engulf America.  Again be
sure to press the point that the Gun Lobby opposes action to counter this crime
wave."</p>

<p>Again I will press the point that firearms are frequently and successfully
used in defense against crime, and that criminals generally ignore gun control
laws. Let's take back our streets by defending them.</p>

<li><p>"Assault Weapons - the Choice of criminals. Assault weapons are the
weapons of choice for gangs, mentally deficient individuals, and criminals
across the board.  The Gun Lobby argues that anyone at any time should have
the right to buy and own these weapons of mass destruction."</p>

<p>Out-and-out lie. The BATF's own statistics show that of the ten guns most
used in crime, only #9 is an "assault" weapon. Shotguns and revolvers are
more common. Call any local police department for confirmation.</p>

<li><p>"Too Many Guns in the U.S. There are over 200 million guns in America
today.  One for every man, woman and child in the United States.  Push the
fact that each one of these killing machines poses a grave threat to our
population."</p>

<p>Aside from their numbers being a little off, this argument sweeps aside
all legitimate uses of guns, sporting and defensive. Over half of all U.S.
households own at least one gun. If guns are "killing machines" then why
isn't the population being decimated by half? The vast majority of those
200 million guns will never be used in crime, while a significant portion
of them will be used in defense against crime.</p>

<li><p>"Assault Ammunition = Military Firepower = Death.  The ammunition for
military arms are more powerful and more devastating than normal ammunition.
This type of ammo if not banned, should have the delivery systems (aka assault
weapons) banned at least."</p>

<p>Death = bad when it is murder, Death = good when it is defense. If you are
being attacked by a large assailant, you should be able to take him down in
one shot, whether you are small, a woman, elderly or whatever.</p>

<title>Libertarians, Republicans and Guns</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: message July 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h2>Libertarians vs. Republicans on the Gun Issue</h2>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/LNeilSmith.html">L. Neil
Smith</a>:</p>

<p>Years ago I noted a tendency among the "girls" my wife works with at
the office to urge her to cut her long silky hair because it would be
"cute" and "so much more practical".  I became suspicious that the "girls"
didn't have my wife's best interests at heart -- in fact, if they thought
they could get away with it, they'd probably advise her to wear mud on her
face because it would be "cute" and "so much more practical".</p>

<p>You'll appreciate my feelings, then, when I saw your reply to a reader
of <cite>The Blue Press</cite> who wrote you about the Libertarian Party:  "All
successful political movements start at the bottom.  If you want a
Libertarian senator, representative or president, first nominate them as a
Republican or Democrat. Indeed, a vote for any third party is a pure
squandering of votes. The place to install candidates is in the primary
elections.  This November, we can't afford the luxury of voting for
principles alone."</p>

<p>Those who see the Bill of Rights as the Ten Commandments
of American political conduct must become the government through
traditional channels, no matter how much time or effort it takes -- and 
then arrest the criminals who sponsored and voted for the Brady Bill
and the Feinstein Amendment, along with those responsible for the 1968 Gun
Control Act, and any dinosaurs still living who illegally crammed the 1934
National Firearms Act down the nation's throat.</p>

<p>The question Mike, is which party is likeliest to aim for that
objective -- or better yet, you tell me who "squandered" their votes,
those who've voted in the past for consistently pro-gun Libertarians,
or those who voted for ...  </p>

<p>Republicans of the US Senate Judiciary Committee, and later the whole
Senate, who approved the appointment of Janet Reno despite her often-stated
desire to confiscate every privately-owned weapon in America?</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Jack Kemp, the Great White Hope of Republican conservatism,
who on "Face the Nation" advocated banning semiautomatic weapons?</p>

<p>John Chaffee, Republican Senator of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ri/">Rhode Island</a>
who introduced a bill
last year to confiscate every handgun in the United States?</p>

<p>Republicans of the House and Senate like Kay Bailey Hutchison, without
whose help the Brady Bill would never have passed?</p>

<p>Pete Wilson, Republican governor of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> (and no
worse than his
predecessor, George Dukmejian) who let that state's Roberti-Roos "assault
weapon" law pass when he could have vetoed it?  </p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nj/">New Jersey</a>
governor Christine Todd Whitman and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>
mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who have done nothing to relieve their constituents of the burden
of illegitimate gun laws?  </p>

<p>Republicans of the New Jersey Senate who refuse to repeal that state's
illegal ban on semiautomatics?  </p>

<p>Thirty-eight Republican members of the House, and "conservatives" in
the Senate like Hank Brown, who voted for the Feinstein Amendment?  </p>

<p>Richard Nixon, who stated shortly before his death that the Brady Bill
doesn't go far enough because, "Guns are an abomination"?  </p>

<p>Late Republican Chairman Lee Atwater who gloated that Republicans can
afford to ignore gun people, who'll vote Republican no matter what, because
where else are they gonna go?  </p>

<p>Again I ask, Mike, who "squandered" their vote?  Top to bottom,
leftmost to rightmost, the Republican Party has been trying since at
least 1988 to "broaden its appeal" by "moving to the center" -- a process
which consists of dumping traditional constituencies which its leadership
in their "wisdom" see as "marginal" in terms of social acceptability or
political correctness.  And foremost among such "marginal constituencies"
are gun owners.  </p>

<p>Great men don't "move to the center", Mike, great men move the
center.  Given the history of the last 20 months, given the pattern of
the last several votes in Congress, given the disdain with which George
Bush held up that tiny stainless revolver in his first Presidential
campaign, or the treachery with which he outlawed importation of semiautos
I don't believe we'd be better off today if he'd been reelected.  If you
do, I'm disappointed in your powers of observation.  It's now much more
than perfectly clear that the most likely way any gun-owner can "squander"
his vote is by casting it for a Republican.  The course you suggested to
your Libertarian reader is like telling German Jews of the 1930s that if
they want their own Chancellor, they should nominate a National Socialist.</p>

<p>The Republican Party is rotten through and through.  William Bennett
started all the fuss over semiautos, proposing to ban those weapons most
clearly meant for Constitutional protection.  William F. Buckley is said to
have endorsed the Brady Bill, and so is Barry Goldwater.  George F. Will
demanded repeal of the Second Amendment months before Michael Gartner.
And some blame all recent gun legislation on Nixon, since Edwin O. Welles
and William Colby of the Nixon-era CIA founded the national anti-gun
lobbies.  Nor should it ever be forgotten that Waco was planned and
rehearsed during the Bush administration.  And even Rush Limbaugh,
although he often pays lip-service to the Second Amendment, is friends
with Kemp, an outright toady to Bennett, and was a towering mountain of
Jello all through the Waco siege.</p>

<p>At this point, in the absence of a suitable Libertarian candidate,
it's better to elect the slimiest liberal Democrat than risk getting
daggered in the back -- again -- by a treacherous Republican.  We
Libertarians, Mike, aren't the ones responsible for that miserable state
of affairs.  We aren't the ones who made the Republican Party unworthy of
respect by any decent individual.  We aren't the ones who chose to violate
the oath of office and betray our country by voting for one blatantly
unconstitutional proposal after another.  We aren't the ones who made
it necessary to choose between the Republican Party and the Second
Amendment.  So don't take it out on us.</p>

<p>Fact is, if people like you (and the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>, whose principal
distinguishing characteristic the last 60 years has been a palpitatingly
spineless compulsion to surrender in the face of enemies like Sarah Brady,
Diane Feinstein, Janet Reno, and Hillary -- or even Chelsea -- Clinton)
had listened 20 years ago and endorsed our candidates then, we'd be the
majority party by now, and none of us would be in the present mess.  </p>

<p>Until you face that fact and accept your responsibility for it, you
will be wading in the cesspool of shirked responsibility and unaccountable
power that your side so often accuses liberals of having created.  You
will have taken up residence in the cloud-castles your side accuses
Libertarians of building.  So let's do this one more time, Mike, to make
sure we've got it straight ... </p>

<p>Libertarians oppose all proposed and pending victim-disarmament laws
-- commonly but improperly known as "gun control" -- and, given the
political power, will:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>repeal, nullify, or otherwise dispose of every one of the more
than 20,000 victim-disarmament laws already on the books (not one of which
is Constitutional or consistent with the concepts of individual or human
rights) and abolish all agencies, at every level of government, responsible
for enforcing them;</p>

<li><p>promote unregulated "Vermont Carry" of concealed weapons by
civilians nationwide, and decriminalize the act of self-defense, so that
it no longer costs an individual's life savings to defend himself from the
government, once he's successfully defended himself from freelance
criminals;</p>

<li><p>pardon and provide restitution to anyone ever inconvenienced in
the slightest by victim-disarmament laws;</p>

<li><p>arrest, prosecute, convict, fine, and imprison any any senator, 
congressman, state legislator, county commissioner, or city councilman who
ever introduced, sponsored, or voted for victim disarmament legislation,
along with every sheriff, chief of police, mayor, governor, and president
who ever enforced it, and throw them all in jail where they belong; and </p>

<li><p>where such a violation of individual or Constitutional rights has
resulted in a fatality, impose the maximum penalty on all such officials.</p>

</ol>

<p>Can Republicans be counted on to offer the least of these things? 
In a broader sense, will Republicans work toward a Constitutional
separation of medicine and state that will forever prevent nationalized
healthcare?  Will Republicans promise to eradicate every last trace of
socialism from America?  Will Republicans extend America's borders for
the first time in a century by offering statehood to any <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> province
that ratifies the Bill of Rights?  Will Republicans get us back to the Moon
and beyond, this time to stay?  My party, the Libertarian Party will, Mike
-- I'll personally see that it does.  </p>

<p> For your part, it's time that you -- and the entire nation --
discovered that the words "conservative" and "Republican" are fully
separable.</p>

<p> The "girls" at the office don't have my wife's best interests at
heart, so I always urge her to ignore their "advice".  For the same reason,
I think we Libertarians will forgo yours -- which over the decades has
brought us straight to the brink of disaster -- and follow our own course,
wherever it takes us and the rest of the country.  Wherever that may be,
it has to be better than where the Republican Party has led us.  </p>

<hr>

<p>August 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/LNeilSmith.html">L. Neil
Smith</a>:</p>

<p>The autumn of 1994 is almost upon us, and with it an election which may
prove pivotal in the history of the United States.  It will certainly be the
most surreal the country's ever experienced.  Ever since the abortive process
that gave us Bill Clinton as President, Democrats have been emboldened to show
us their true color -- red -- while Republicans can now be clearly seen draped
in that hue which characterizes their political record best, pusillanimous
yellow.</p>

<p>Most people are unaware that there are different sets of rules for mixing
and producing new colors, a special set for pigments and another special set
for light. Under the strange rules by which such colors are mixed politically,
the only result we can expect from mixing red and yellow is black -- the color
of fascism.</p>

<p>While Democrats have been busy fortifying America as a last bastion of
central planning, the command economy, and Five Year Plans, Republicans have
been ... well, perhaps what <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas Jefferson</a> should
have said is that all
that's necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to have another
drink. That's exactly what I've seen Republicans doing every time in the last
two years that I've turned on C-Span for a strictly Republican event, weaving
and sprawling red-facedly with highball glasses slopping in their hands,
congratulating themselves that they aren't quite as politically corrupt or
personally disgusting as all the President's men and women -- and in whatever
sober moments they experienced in between, blowing their noses on the Bill of
Rights.</p>

<p>A full recital of their dribbling honks and wheezes, from the approval of
murderous Janet Reno to the vote on the Feinstein Amendment can be had almost
anywhere you look.  Democrats are bent on stripping America's 70 million gun
owners of their last defense against mankind's two greatest natural enemies,
government and freelance criminals.  And Republicans ... well, they're having
another drink.</p>

<p>And yet ...</p>

<p>That number, 70 million gun owners, ought to have some meaning.  Half that
number, 35 million, is almost as many votes as George Bush got in 1992.  One
tenth of that number, 7 million, would have tipped the balance with plenty of
room to spare.  Republicans would realize this if they would stop listening to
pollsters (who by inclination and education are predominantly Democratic in
their outlook anyway) and recover from their alcoholic stupor long enough to
remember that even if a majority of people favor some kind of gun ban, the
Bill of Rights was written specifically to protect us all from the passing
popular sentiment that is all that either major party's ideology consists of
today.</p>

<p>But they never have and they never will.  And what that means is that
those of us -- who care about the Bill of Rights and understand that it is the
one and only thing remaining in America which keeps this country civilized at
all -- have a long, hard pull ahead of us, creating an entirely new political
movement which will use whatever power it obtains to enforce the highest law
of the land, and to put those who break it -- because they're evil or simply
because they're drunk -- in a concrete condo where they can't hurt anybody any
more.</p>

<p>By voting to destroy the Bill of Rights as they have consistently since
Clinton was elected, Republicans have helped us make the case for that new
political movement.  They've helped by demonstrating -- clearly enough that
anyone but a habitual drunk can see it -- the intellectual, moral, and
historical bankruptcy of their own sodden, whimpering, hung-over approach to
politics.</p>

<p>Like a habitual drunk, they'll come crawling back over the next few weeks,
promising tearfully that they'll never do it again, that they're reformed
characters, that they've taken the pledge -- all the time they're peering
dimly over your shoulder, trying to remember where they left that bottle the
last time they were home.</p>

<p>Don't believe them.</p>

<p>Never believe any politician -- especially a Republican -- about the
position he promises to take from now on with regard to the individual right
to own and carry weapons, unless he first allows himself to be photographed at
a shooting range, for public circulation now and until the sun burns out,
firing a semiautomatic "assault" rifle and a high-capacity semiautomatic
pistol.</p>

<p>And for safety's sake, you'd better make him take a breathalyser test,
first.</p>

<title>Sheriff Refuses to Enforce Brady</title>
<!-- Place: Graham County, Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Arizona Sheriff Ignores Brady Bill</h1>

<p>I've lost the author of this February 1994 report:</p>

<p>The Sheriff of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Graham.html">Graham County</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>, Richard Mack
says he will not enforce the Brady Bill.</p>

<p>Richard Mack has been the Sheriff of Graham County, Arizona for
approximately 6 years. He is married, 41 years old (The youngest Sheriff in
Az) and has five children. He has been involved in law enforcement all his
adult live, and is college educated and articulate.</p>

<p>The Sheriff was quoted as saying it was "unconstitutional" since it
violated the 2nd Amendment and was a violation of law since the Federal
Government is not permitted to force local county sheriff to enforce its
edicts.</p>

<p>Other County Sheriffs in Arizona are reported to be considering rejecting the
unconstitutional law.  In fact there may be as many as 100 county Sheriffs,
according to Alan Gotlieb of a national gun owners rights group,
across the nation who are refusing to enforce this illegal law. </p>

<p>Another Sheriff from
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mt/">Montana</a>
a Sheriff Prince has gone public with the same
statement. Sheriff Mack has appeared on several radio talk shows in the
Central <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> area including
the popular "Carl Wigglesworth Show", on WOAI
1200 am out of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>.</p>

<p>Sheriff Mack was heard 19 Feb 94 at 11pm CST 1300 am "Texas Over Night" KLRD,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
(1300 am in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>
Area) and Tom Valentine's "Radio Free America"
5.81 shortwave. The national media won't be able to keep a lid on this
forever, especially since Sheriff Mack said he is "willing to die to preserve
the U.S. Constitution." Support is pouring in from across the nation for
Sheriff Mack. The <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle
Association</a> and other 2nd Amendment
organizations have offered to commit attorneys to defend Sheriff Mack's
decision "all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary."</p>

<p>Sheriff Mack can be reached at 602 428 3141 or fax 602 428 2487.
Mail: Sheriff Richard Mack, 523 Tenth Avenue, SAFFORD, AR 85546.</p>

<title>Law Enforcement Lobby Opposes Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: California (USA) -->

<body>
<h1>Law Enforcement Lobby Opposed to Gun Control</h1>

<p>The Law Enforcement Lobby, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> based
pro-gun police organization, wants to hear from other members of the law
enforcement community who share the view that armed citizens are
an asset to public safety.  The organization's agenda includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Non-Discretionary Concealed Carry Permits for Civilians:
LEL supports the general issuance of CCW's to civilians for the
purposes of self-defense against violent crime.  LEL recognizes that
law abiding citizens have a right to self-protection especially during
that brief interval between when a threat emerges and when law
enforcement arrives on the scene.  Whether that threat emerges at a
traffic light, in an office building, at a restaurant, or a school groun
LEL recognizes that the window of opportunity to prevent great
tragedy and loss of life is too narrow for conventional law
enforcement to be of any use.  LEL knows that during this "brief
interval", civilians have no one but themselves to rely upon.  We
believe that it is essential that law enforcement respect the rights of
law abiding citizens to possess the means to protect themselves.</p.

<li><p>Better Firearms Training as the Path to Accident Prevention:
The Law Enforcement Lobby recognizes that ignorance about the safe
handling of firearms is a major health hazard in society.  Just like
any tool, a gun is only safe in the hands of someone with the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes for proper operation of that tool.
That's why LEL supports skills oriented firearms training for all
citizens, especially for children and their parents.  We believe that
this type of training will save lives, particularly young lives.  LEL
supports the incorporation of skills oriented firearms training into
the school curriculum with special emphasis on the involvement of
parents in both the teaching AND learning process.</p>

<li><p>Opposition to Semi-Automatic Assault Weapon Bans:
The Law Enforcement Lobby takes the position that semi-automatic
assault weapon bans are worthless as tools of crime prevention.
LEL opposes such laws on the following grounds:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><p>Community Alienation Test:
	Bans serve to alienate law abiding citizens from the police.  This
	hurts our relationship with up to thirty percent (30%) of the
	communities we serve.  This means that, rather than reducing crime,
	these laws create rifts between law enforcement and the community
	resulting in greater sanctuary for criminals.  An angry citizenry
	means that public cooperation will not be forthcoming when we need
	it most.  LEL recognizes that the community, especially its law abiding
	owners, is an ally in the fight against crime; not the enemy.</p>

	<li><p>Criminal Preference Test:
	The arguments against semi-automatic weapons are based on images
	not facts.  In fact, there are compelling technical arguments why
	these guns are less than ideal for use in criminal activities.  They are
	excessively bulky, produce too loud a report, and require too much
	precision for use in covert engagements.  These guns have however
	come to possess romantic appeal thanks mainly to the way the media
	has promoted their image.</p>

	<li><p>Legitimate Use Test:
	LEL recognizes that there are many purposes for semi-automatic
	weapons including sporting, self-defense and patriotic uses.  LEL
	further recognizes the legitimacy of all three of these uses.  Finally,
	LEL recognizes that law enforcement officers are among the people
	who own and use these weapons for all three purposes.</p>

	<li><p>First Amendment Interference Test:
	LEL supports the view that those who promote firearms bans based
	on arbitrary criteria are not interested in crime prevention at all but
	rather in punishing law abiding people for having differing political
	beliefs from themselves.  LEL takes the position that this is both an
	affront to all citizens First Amendment Rights to political self-
	expression and creates unnecessary hazards for law enforcement
	professionals.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>

<title>1989 American Law Enforcement Survey</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: August 1989 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>American Law Enforcement Survey</h1>

<p>August 1989, from <cite>Gun Week</cite>:</p>

<p>In a study conducted by the National Association of the Chiefs of
Police (NACP) through its American Law Enforcement Survey for 1989,
in which 16,259 chiefs of police, sheriffs and law-enforcement command
personnel were polled with a list of 30 questions, it was determined
the overwhelming majority of officers support the right of private
arms ownership, and agreed that gun bans had little effect on crime.
The Citizens' Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) compiled
the following responses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you believe that law-abiding citizens should have the right to purchase
any type of firearm for sport or self-defense under state laws that now exist?
<li>68.71% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Do you believe that the banning of firearms (handguns, shotguns, or
rifles) will reduce the ability of criminals to obtain such weapons?
<li>90.18% answered NO.
<p>
<li>Do you believe that the banning of private ownership of firearms will
result in fewer crimes from firearms?
<li>87.62% answered NO.
<p>
<li>Would you agree that most criminals obtain their weapons illegally?
<li>89.94% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Do you believe that a waiting period to purchase a handgun or any type
of firearm will have any effect on criminals getting firearms?
<li>70.91% answered NO.
<p>
<li>A "military type" of long gun (Rifle, shotgun, etc.) is now being
described as one being able to hold more than five rounds of ammunition.
It must be fired by pulling the trigger each time. The legal description
would cover many semi-automatic weapons. Do you believe that banning such
weapons would reduce the likelihood of criminals obtaining such weapons?
<li>86.73% answered NO.
<p>
<li>Some states have longer waiting periods than others. Would you agree that
it should be a state mandated law rather than a federal regulation as to
firearms purchase requirements?
<li>62.64% answered STATE.
<p>
<li>Do you favor the training and issuance of semi-automatic firearms
(sidearms) that carry 16-17 rounds over the present police  revolver?
<li>85% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Historically, the militia is "all men between the ages of 16 and 45". Under
the present armed forces defense of the United States, the National Guard
must be able to mobilize in three days to back up our regular armed forces
worldwide. Therefore, the only defense would be the "state militia" in time
of war. Would you agree, that for the sake of the defense of the United
States, citizens should be allowed to have their own rifles, shotguns and
handguns for emergencies, natural or man made?
<li>85.69% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Do you feel that the system of criminal justice has broken down to the
point where it is the inability to deal with criminals caught by police
(prosecution and imprisonment) that is the major cause of crime in America?
<li>86.46% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Do you think the courts are soft on criminals in general?
<li>95.60% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Do you believe the media coverage of police-involved shootings encourages
the riots or disturbances that have often followed publication or televised?
<li>90.12% answered YES.
<p>
<li>Do you think that the media that depicts violence, especially on TV,
while at the same time encouraging the banning of firearms ownership for
law-abiding citizens for sport or self-defense, is hypocritical?
<li>89.95% answered YES.
</ul>

Bellvue, WA 98005. It includes the other questions.</p>

<title>Survey by Police Benevolent Association of Georgia</title>
<!-- Place: Georgia -->
<!-- Time: August 1989 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1><a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> Police
Survey Reveals Gun Rights Support</h1>

<p>November 1989, from <cite>Gun Week</cite>:</p>

<p>An educational project, sponsered jointly by the police Benevolent
Association of Georgia, (PBA/GA), and the Georgia Sport Shooting
Association (GSSA), has revealed the following responses to the
issues of gun control, gun ownership, the Second Amendment, semi-automatic
firearms and crime.</p>

<p>The tabulations are in response to a survey mailed out to more than
3,000 sworn law enforcement members, with the results tabulated by a
professional polling organization based in Tallahasse, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>, during July
and August, 1989.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you believe gun control laws do not stop crimes involving guns because
such laws are directed toward the law abiding citizen, rather than those who
operate outside the law?
<li>92.5% replied YES
<p>
<li>Do you believe gun onwership is a symbol of independence, self-reliance,
and responsibility in America?
<li>88% replied YES
<p>
<li>Do you believe legal gun owners pride themselves on education, training
and responsibility in America?
<li>83.5% replied YES
<p>
<li>Do you believe laws made to limit gun ownership by law abiding
citizens will result in criminals still obtaining guns, while citizens will
be unable to do so lawfully?
<li>92.3% replied YES
<p>
<li>Do you believe laws having the effect of limiting gun ownership by law
abiding citizens will make it more difficult for criminals to get guns?
<li>89.4% replied NO
<p>
<li>Do you believe the best way to reduce the number of crimes committed with
a firearm is to enforce existing laws more strictly?
<li>92.9% replied YES
<p>
<li>Do you believe the best way to reduce the number of crimes committed with
a firearm is to pass stricter gun control laws?
<li>76.5% replied NO
<p>
<li>Article VII, Amendment II of the U.S. Constitution provides that "A well
regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right
of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Do you believe
this means that all law abiding citizens in America have a constitutional
right to gun ownership?
<li>91% replied YES
<p>
<li>"Assault Weapons" now being considered for severe restrictions, or even
bans, are semi-automatic firearms, and are not "machine guns". Do you believe
they should be regulated any more stringently than handguns or shotguns?
<li>68.5% replied NO
<p>
<li>Do you believe "assault rifles" serve no useful purpose and should be
banned from ownership by private citizens?
<li>73.9% replied NO
<p>
<li>Do you believe crime rates are lower in states with few gun control laws
because criminals do not want to risk confronting an armed citizen?
<li>78.6% replied YES
<p>
<li>Do you believe armed citizens will not stop crimes from being committed?
<li>55.7% replied NO

<title>Southern States Police Survey</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Southern States Police Survey Shows Gun Rights Support</h1>

<p>In 1993 the UPI reported the results of a survey on gun control by the
Southern States Police Benevolent Association.</p>

<p>As UPI reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95.8 percent of the 10,614 members of the ten-state law enforcement
organization surveyed rejected a ban on all firearms, 96.4 percent strongly
supported firearm ownership for self-protection and 90.1 percent agreed
that the U.S. Constitution guarantees law-abiding citizens the right to
own a firearm.</p>

<p>Only 34.7 percent said stricter gun control laws were an effective
way of controlling violent crime.</p>

<p>The survey showed little support for a Brady Bill-type waiting period
for the purchase of handguns -- 86.5 percent said it would only affect
law-abiding citizens and not deter criminals from obtaining handguns.</p>

<p>An instant point-of-purchase criminal background check prior to the
purchase of handguns drew 63.8 percent support, while only 23.1 percent
supported a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun.</p>

<h1>Pre-20th-century Europeans on Self-Defense</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Trenchard and Moyle on Deterrence</h2>

<p>If those in government are heedless of reason, the people must patiently
submit to Bondage, or stand upon their own Defence; which if they are enabled
to do, they shall never be put upon it, but their Swords may grow rusty in
their hands; for that Nation is surest to live in Peace, that is most capable
of making War; and a Man that hath a Sword by his side, shall have least
occasion to make use of it.</p>

<p> - J. Trenchard & W. Moyle, <cite>An Argument Showing, That a Standing
Army is Inconsistent With a Free Government, and Absolutely Destructive
to the Constitution of the English Monarch</cite> (London, 1697).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Barlow on Arms</h2>

<p>The danger (where there is any) from armed citizens, is only to the
government, not to the society; as long as they have nothing to revenge
in the government (which they cannot have while it is in their own hands)
there are many advantages in their being accustomed to the use of arms
and no possible disadvantage.</p>

<p> - J. Barlow, <cite>Advice to the Privileged Orders in the Several States
of Europe: Resulting From the Necessity and Propriety of a General Revolution
in the Principle of Government</cite> (London, 1792, 1795 and reprint 1956).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Francis Place on Self-Defense</h2>

<p>Dogs could not be used in the streets in the manner many Jews were treated.
One circumstance among others put an end to the ill-usage of the Jews.
About the year 1787 Daniel Mendoza, a Jew, became a celebrated boxer and
set up a school to teach the art of boxing as a science. The art soon
spread among young Jews and they became generally expert at it. The
consequence was in a very few years seen and felt too. It was no longer
safe to insult a Jew unless he was an old man and alone. But even if the
Jews were unable to defend themselves, the few who would now be disposed to
insult them merely because they are Jews, would be in danger of chastisement
from the passers-by and of punishment from the police.</p>

Present</cite> (1970).</p>

<h1>Founding Fathers on Self-Defense</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Paine on Arms</h2>

<p>Arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and
preserve order in the world as well as property.</p>

<p>- <a href="/revolution/by_name/P/ThomasPaine.html">Thomas Paine</a>,
<cite>Writings of Thomas Paine</cite>, M. Conway, ed., 1894.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Washington on Firearms</h2>

<p>Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the
American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence. From the
hour the Pilgrims landed, to the present day, events, occurrences and
tendencies prove that to ensure peace, security and happiness, the rifle
and pistol are equally indispensable. The very atmosphere of firearms
everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor
with all that's good.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/GeorgeWashington.html">George
Washington</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Washington on Arms and Peace</h2>

<p>To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving
peace. A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/GeorgeWashington.html">George
Washington</a>, First Annual Address, January 8, 1790.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on Armed Rebellion</h2>

<p>God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The
people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong
will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they
misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy,
the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ... And what country can
preserve its liberties, if it's rulers are not warned from time to time,
that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The
remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What
signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is
its natural manure.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, 13 Nov 1787</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on Use of Arms</h2>

<p>No man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason</p>
for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort,
to protect themselves against tyranny in government.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, June 1776</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on Gun Sports</h2>

<p>A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be the constant companion of
your walk.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, Foley, ed., <cite>Encyclopedia of Thomas Jefferson</cite>,
p. 318.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on the Militia</h2>

<p>For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized
and armed militia is their best security.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, Eighth Annual Message, November 8, 1808</p>

<hr>

<h2>Madison on the Militia</h2>

<p>The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. A
well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to
arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">James Madison</a>,
in the <cite>Federalist Papers</cite> No. 46 at 243-44</p>

<p>... large and permanent military establishments which are forbidden
by the principles of free government, and against the necessity of
which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">James
Madison</a>, Fourth Annual Message, November 4, 1812</p>

<p>An efficient militia is authorized and contemplated by the Constitution
and required by the spirit and safety of free government.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">James
Madison</a>, Eighth Annual Message, December 3, 1816</p>

<hr>

<h2>Tench Coxe on the Second Amendment</h2>

<p>Whereas civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them,
may attempt to tyrannize, and as military forces, which must be occasionally
raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of
their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their
right to keep and bear their private arms.</p>

<p> - Tench Coxe in <cite>Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to
the Federal Constitution</cite></p>

<hr>

<h2>Tench Coxe on the Militia</h2>

<p>Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other
terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American
...  the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the
federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain,
in the hands of the people.</p>

<p> -Tench Coxe, 20 Feb 1788</p>

<hr>

<h2>Richard Henry Lee on Arms</h2>

<p>To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people
always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use
them.</p>

<p> - Richard Henry Lee, <cite>Letters from the Federal Farmer to the
Republic</cite>, (1787 - 1788)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hamilton on Arms</h2>

<p>The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be
properly armed.</p>

<p> - Alexander Hamilton, <cite>The Federalist Papers</cite> at 184-188</p>

<h1>Americans on Self-Defense</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Noah Webster on Gun Control</h2>

<p>Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are
in almost every kingdom of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. The supreme power in America
cannot
enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of people are
armed, and constitute a force superior to any body of regular troops that
can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States</p>

<p> - Noah Webster, <cite>An Examination into the Leading Principals of the
Federal Constitution</cite></p>

<hr>

<h2>Hubert Humphrey on Arms</h2>

<p>Certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government,
no matter how popular and respected, is the right of citizens to keep and
bear arms. ...  The right of citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee
against arbitrary government, one more safegaurd against the tyranny which
now appears remote in America but which historically has proven to be
possible.</p>

<p> - Senator Hubert H. Humphrey (1960)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Malcom X on Armed Self-Defense</h2>

<p>It is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant
victim of brutal attacks. It is legal and lawful to own a shotgun or a
rifle. We believe in obeying the law.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/X/MalcolmX.html">Malcolm X</a>, March 12,
	1964</p>

<hr>

<h2>Oliver Stone on Guns</h2>

<p>I like automatic weapons. I fought for my right to use them in Vietnam.</p>

<title>Testimony of James Wright</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ten Fundamental Gun Facts</h1>

<p>March 31, 1995 statement of Tulane University criminologist James Wright
before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Crime of
the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p><i>Dr. WRIGHT:</i> Thank you so much, and thank you for the opportunity to be
here.  My name is James Wright... and I'm a professor of sociology at Tulane
University.  I've spent the last twenty years of my academic career conducting
research on guns and violence in American society.  In the course of these two
decades, I have come to the conclusion that there are at least ten simple, but
terribly important facts about guns in America that every participant in the
gun control debate should be aware of.  I have referred to these in a recent
paper as "Ten Essential Observations on Guns in America," and my point is to
share them with the Committee today.</p>

<p> While many of the facts of the gun control issue are hotly contested, and
matters of great dispute, the ten fundamental truths that I wish to discuss are
matters about which everyone more or less agrees.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="households.html">Half of U.S. households own guns</a>
<li><a href="circulation.html">200,000,000 firearms are in the U.S. now</a>
<li><a href="sport.html">Most guns are owned for recreation</a>
<li><a href="defense.html">Many guns are owned for defense against crime</a>
<li><a href="retail.html">Bad guys don't buy guns through retail channels</a>
<li><a href="violence.html">Bad guys carry guns for surviving violent world</a>
<li><a href="law.html">Bad guys indifferent to existing gun control laws</a>
<li><a href="demand.html">Demand for guns creates its own supply</a>
<li><a href="evil.html">Guns are not inherently good or evil</a>
<li><a href="culture.html">Guns are part of the American culture</a>
</ol>
 
<p>And, thank you so much for your attention.  Dr. Bordua...</p>

<title>Ruby Ridge Setup</title>

<h1>The Ruby Ridge Set-up</h1>

<p>One of the FBI's favorite activities is spying on radical political
organizations. They don't care for being hindered by such things as the Bill
of Rights; the FBI has been censured by Congress several times for illegal
investigations.</p>

<p>In the late 1980's, the FBI and BATF wanted to infiltrate white
supremacist groups. In 1989, Kenneth Fadeley was a BATF informant posing as a
gun dealer to spy on groups such as the Aryan Nations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a>.</p>

<p>The BATF targeted white separatist Randy Weaver to be one of their moles.
Fadeley claims that Weaver approached him with the offer to sell sawed-off
shotguns in October 1989. Weaver claims he was entrapped, and in fact he
was acquitted of weapons charges when tried in court.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="/revolution/by_name/B/JamesBovard.html">James
Bovard</a> in the January 10, 1995 <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>,
the BATF set up a sting in order to
blackmail Weaver into doing their bidding: "an undercover agent of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approached Mr. Weaver and pressured
the mountain man to sell him sawed-off shotguns. Mr. Weaver at first refused,
but the agent was persistent and Mr. Weaver eventually sold him two
shotguns -- thereby violating federal firearms law."</p>

<p>Weaver refused to cooperate with federal agents. To justify a
<a href="siege.html">militaristic retaliation</a>, BATF agents lied to the
U.S. attorney's office.
BATF agents claimed that Weaver had a criminal record and that he was a suspect
in several bank robberies. Both charges were fabrications, even according
to BATF Director John Magaw, who admitted the accusations were "inexcusable"
in testimony before Congress.</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney's office indicted Weaver on weapons charges in May
1990. Weaver was arraigned in January 1991. After missing his February 1991
court date, Weaver was indicted in March 1991
on charges of refusing to appear in court.</p>

<title>Siege of Ruby Ridge</title>

<h1>FBI Siege of Ruby Ridge</h1>

<p>When federal agents <a href="setup.html">set up</a> Randy Weaver on
minor weapons violations, Weaver refused to show up in court for the charge,
instead holing up with his wife and four children in his mountain cabin
on <A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/RubyRidge.html">Ruby
Ridge</a>, forty miles south of the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> border.</p>

<p>A Justice Department attorney got an arrest warrant for Weaver, despite
knowing that a court official notified Weaver of an incorrect court date.
(Weaver wasn't going to show up anyway.)</p>

<p>For the charge of refusing to appear in court for a minor weapons
violation, the government conducted a military siege of Ruby Ridge worthy
of a small war. As reported by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/JamesBovard.html">James Bovard</a> in the
January 10, 1995 <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>, after Weaver's February
1991 missed court appearance,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal agents then launched an elaborate 18-month surveillance of
Mr. Weaver's cabin and land.</p>

<p>David Niven, a defense lawyer involved in the subsequent court case, noted
later: "The U.S. marshals called in military aerial reconnaissance and had
photos studied by the Defense Mapping Agency. ... They had psychological
profiles performed and installed $130,000 worth of solar-powered long-range
spy cameras. They intercepted the Weavers' mail. They even knew the menstrual
cycle of Weaver's teenage daughter, and planned an arrest scenario around
it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On August 21, 1992, the siege began in earnest. Six U.S. marshals,
armed and camouflaged, went onto Weaver's property to conduct undercover
surveillance. When Weaver's dogs started barking, they shot one of them.</p>

<p>Weaver's 25-year-old friend Kevin Harris and 14-year-old son Sammy and
saw the dog die. Sammy Weaver fired his gun towards the agents as his dad
yelled for him to come back to the cabin. "I'm coming, Dad," were Sammy
Weaver's last words before he was shot in the back and killed by
a U.S. marshal.</p>

<p>Kevin Harris, witnessing the agents' killing of the dog and child, fired
at the agents in self-defense, killing one of them.</p>

<p>After the initial shootout, the Weavers and Harris retreated into their
cabin, and a small army surrounded the area. Says Bovard: "the commander of
the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team was called in, and ordered federal agents to
shoot any armed adult outside the Weaver cabin, regardless of whether that
person was doing anything to threaten or menace federal agents. (Thanks to
the surveillance, federal officials knew that the Weavers always carried
guns when outside their cabin.)"</p>

<p>Against a handful of rural Idahoans with shotguns, the U.S. arrayed
<em>four hundred</em> federal agents with automatic weapons, sniper rifles
and night vision scopes.</p>

<p>On August 22, 1992, Randy Weaver went to see his son's body in the shack
where it lay. He was shot and wounded from behind by FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi.
As Weaver struggled back to his house, Horiuchi assassinated his wife Vicki
as she stood in the doorway, holding their 10-month-old baby.</p>

<p>Although the feds later claimed Vicki Weaver's killing was an accident,
the <cite>New York Times</cite> reported in 1993 that an internal FBI report
justified the killing by saying she put herself in danger. Horiuchi testified
in court that he was an accurate shot at 200 yards.</p>

<p>Everything about the federal government's actions in this case is
sickening, but possibly the worst was their taunting of the Weaver family
after Vicki Weaver's murder: "Good morning, Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for
breakfast. What did you have?" That was one of the FBI's tactics revealed in
court records, reported by Jerry Seper in the <cite>Washington Times</cite>
in September 1993.</p>

<p>After the initial shootout, the only shots fired were by federal agents.
Eleven days after the shootout Randy Weaver surrendered.</p>

<title>The Ruby Ridge Trial</title>
<!-- Place: Ruby Ridge, Idaho (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Trial of Randy Weaver</h1>

<p>In July 1993, a jury acquitted Randy Weaver of weapons and murder charges
resulting from his <a href="setup.html">set-up</a> and the subsequent
<a href="siege.html">siege</a> of his mountain cabin home by federal
agents. Weaver's friend, Kevin Harris, was also found innocent.</p>

<p>Harris, witnessing the agents' killing of Randy Weaver's dog and son during
the siege, fired at the agents in self-defense. Harris killed one of the
agents. At the trial, the prosecution claimed Harris fired first; the defense
produced evidence that the agent had fired seven shots before he was shot
himself.</p>

<p>The federal government argued that sniper FBI Lon Horiuchi accidentally
killed Weaver's wife Vicki. At the trial, however, Horiuchi testified that
he was an accurate shot at 200 yards.</p>

<p>Everything about the federal government's actions in this case is
sickening, but possibly the worst was their taunting of the Weaver family
after Vicki Weaver's murder: "Good morning, Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for
breakfast. What did you have?" That was one of the FBI's tactics revealed in
court records, reported by Jerry Seper in the Washington <cite>Times</cite>
in September 1993.</p>

<p>A jury found Weaver innocent of all serious charges, convicting him only on
the original weapons charge. The jury also found Harris innocent, ruling his
shooting of the marshal to be self-defense.</p>

</head>

<body>

<h1>Aftermath of Ruby Ridge</h1>

<p>The FBI and BATF received harsh criticism after the <a
href="setup.html">set-up</a> and <a href="siege.html">military siege</a>
of a rural <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a> family. In the
siege, federal agents killed Randy Weaver's dog, son and wife.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Justice Department Report</h2>

<p>The <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wbardwel/public/nfalist/ruby.ridge1">Justice
Department's own 542-page report</a> on the incident recommended criminal
prosecution. The report found that FBI agents violated agency guidelines
and overstepped Constitutional Fourth Amendment protections.</p>

<p>The Justice Department began investigating the matter in July 1993 after
Weaver was <a href="trial.html">acquitted</a> of weapons and murder charges.
The final report said the FBI's Rules of Engagement for the Ruby Ridge
incident "contravened the Consititution of the United States" and "encouraged
the use of deadly force."</p>

<hr>

<h2>FBI Disciplinary Actions</h2>

<p>Deval Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a>, Director of
the FBI, took no serious action.</p>

<p>Larry Potts was the senior official in charge of the operation. Not only
was he not prosecuted, Freeh promoted him to acting deputy FBI director.
After two months, controversy over Potts' role in Ruby Ridge prompted Freeh
to remove him from the position.</p>

<p>A total of twelve agents were disciplined. None have yet been prosecuted.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Civil Suit</h2>

<p>On August 15, 1995, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to pay $3.1
million to the family of Randy Weaver. Weaver will receive $100,000,
while each of Vicki Weaver's surviving three children will receive $1
million.</p>

<p>The Weavers had sought $200 million in civil suits filed against the
federal government.</p>

<title>Senate criticizes FBI</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: hearings September 6 - 14, 1995;
	report December 21, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Senate criticizes federal law enforcement</h1>

<h2>Hearings</h2>

<p>From September 6 to September 14, 1995, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
held hearings relating to the <a href="index.html">Ruby Ridge siege</a>.</p>

<p>Questioned about his extreme racial views, Weaver admitted he was a
white separatist: "I'm not a
hateful racist as most people understand it. I believe that if there is
separation of races, scripturally speaking, that's what I believe is right."</p>

<p>As reported in the <cite>News and Observer</cite>:
<blockquote>
<p>"On Aug. 21, 1992, federal marshals shot my son Samuel in the back and
killed him. He was running home to me. His last words were, 'I'm coming
dad,'" Weaver said.</p>

<p>On the killing of his wife, Weaver said, "She was not wanted for any crime.
There were no warrants for her arrest. At the time she was gunned down, she was
helpless. She was standing in the doorway of her home."</p>

<p>His voice broke as he described his wife slumping to the floor, their
10-month-old daughter still in her arms. Weeping in the audience was his oldest
daughter, Sara, who also was to testify.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I would make
different choices," Weaver said. "I would come down from the mountain for the
court appearance."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lon Horiuchi, the FBI sniper who killed Weaver's wife, refused to
answer the Senate panel's questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights.
Horiuchi's lawyer recommended that Horiuchi not testify because an Idaho
prosecutor is considering criminal charges against Horiuchi.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Report</h2>

<p>On December 21, the U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on terrorism
released its <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><A
href="http://www.nra.org/pub/general/96-02-02_senate_report_on_ruby_ridge/">report
on the Ruby Ridge standoff</a> between Randy Weaver's
family and the FBI. The panel concluded that FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi's
shot that killed Vicki Weaver was illegal and violated her civil rights.</p>

<p>The panel criticized FBI Director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis J. Freeh's</a>
"questionable judgement" in promoting Larry Potts after reprimanding him
for his role in the incident. Potts and four other top FBI officials
have been suspended while a federal criminal probe investigates the
destruction of documents related to the incident.</p>

<p>The focal point of the Senate's criticism is the FBI's "Hostage Rescue
Team," which originally only operated in foreign countries, is overtly
militaristic and aggressive, and is used in situations where there are
no hostages to be rescued.</p>

<p>The panel also criticized the U.S. Marshals service and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) for their roles, saying,
"While Randy Weaver made mistakes, so did every federal law enforcement
agency involved in the Ruby Ridge incident."</p>

<title>BATF's Motives at Waco</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>BATF Wanted to Make Example of Davidians</h1>

<p>The BATF wants to disarm American citizens. BATF particularly dislikes
Americans having access to the most powerful weapons, or large collections
of weapons. Even worse to the BATF is when Americans with unorthodox
religious or political views have large collections of the most powerful
weapons.</p>

<p>The problem, from the BATF's point of view, is that such a situation is
perfectly legal. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects
unorthodox religious and political views, and federal law imposes no limits
on the number of weapons that an individual can own.</p>

<p>The solution, from the BATF's point of view, is to use minor infractions
of the extensive federal firearms laws to justify draconian response.</p>

<p>In the case of the Branch Davidians, the BATF suspected legal, semiautomatic
rifles had been converted into unregistered, automatic rifles.</p>

<h2>Legitimate Concerns, Illegitimate Response</h2>

<p>The BATF had enough information to warrant legitimate concern about
illegal activities at Mt. Carmel. The most serious allegations were about
sexual abuse of 11 and 12 year old girls.</p>

<p>The BATF was still wrong in conducting a military attack of the
Davidians' residence.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sexual abuse is not in the realm of the BATF, rather it is the realm
of state law. The information should have been passed to the proper authorities
for further investigation.</p>
<li><p>Allegations are just that. In the U.S., people accused of a crime are
considered innocent until proven guilty. Many of the allegations came from
dubious sources, such as "cult busters" intent on destroying the Davidians'
religion.</p>
<li><p>Investigating allegations does not justify a military assault.</p>
</ol>

<p>Other than the above charges, the allegations used to secure a search
warrant involved technical violations of gun control laws, and deprecating
innuendo about unorthodox (but peaceful) beliefs and habits.</p>

<h2>BATF Had Personal Grudge Against Koresh</h2>

<p>The affidavit used by the BATF to gain a search warrant made note of
the fact that David Koresh opposed gun control, believed U.S. gun control
laws were wrong, and possessed a Gun Owners' Association video portraying
the BATF as violating gun owners' rights by threats and lies.</p>

<title>Siege of the Branch Davidians</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 28 - April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Siege</h1>

<p>After the U.S. government
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attacked the
Branch Davidians</a> in Waco, Texas in February 1993, the FBI conducted
a fifty-one day siege of the religious group. The FBI clearly intended
nothing but a violent end, conducting the siege with bright lights
and loud noises played throughout the night, driving tanks up to
the compound, destroying cars parked outside, and so forth. More tanks
were sent to Waco than were sent to Somalia during the U.S. troops'
presence there.</p>

	confrontational approach</a></li>
<li><a href="tapes.html">Transcript of negotitation tapes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Reported by Andrew Clark (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:clarka@netcom.com">clarka@netcom.com</a>):</p>

<p> The FBI deliberately precipitated a violent showdown by antagonising the
occupants of the commune via loudspeaker, refusing the assistance of family
members to plead with those inside, refusing to accept the assistance of
attorneys to persuade the occupants to surrender, and forcing the Branch
Davidians to act.</p>

<p> Sending in a combat engineering vehicle with a gas attachment is a good
start ... but such activity could easily start a fire. When LAPD was
experimenting with armored vehicle assaults into crack houses, they had
to figure out where the gas lines were and how to avoid them. Someone should
have assumed that Koresh would burn himself out, a reasonable conjecture
based on his "prophecies." Or, maybe the tank driver would fuck up and
hit a line?  It's called contingency planning.</p>

<p> Where the hell was the fire gear?  Over on misc.emerg-services, it
was reported that the FBI had to call 911 to get the Waco FD out
there. If the FBI knows it's going in, the fire apparatus should
have been set up and ready to go with plenty of reserve water (set
up storage tanks in advance and keep running refills if needed.) 
With all the aircraft the FBI seemed to have buzzing around, it
should have been easy to have a firefighting aircraft ready to 
drop water and/or fire retardant on the house.  If the Davidians
try to shoot at it with their (possibly mythical) .50 cal MGs,
then have your friendly neighborhood snipers put large holes in
their heads.  With all of the military shit the FBI had around,
they should have had lots and lots of snipers.</p>

<p> The timing in particular is difficult to understand. The argument that they
were concerned for the children is not credible, especially because the
FBI shut off the water. That was a dumb move; anything that weakens the
cultist's bodies also weakens their minds as well. Hungry, tired and
frightened people are remarkably easy to goad. </p>

<p> The FBI spokesman in Waco said tht they believed 'all of the adults have gas
masks.'  Shortly later he said that they hoped that the suffering of the
children (here I paraphrase) would motivate the BDs to release the children
due to their 'maternal insticts.' Any effect this might have had was surely
outweighed by the psychological effects of wearing a gas mask 
for any length of time.  This merely strengthened the siege mentality. </p>

<p> This is an admission that the attack was intended to deliberately inflict
suffering on the children, hoping to force the adults to act. Why would
anyone expect such a strategy to work on people who themselves were abusing
the children in question? Frankly, because FBI and BATF couldn't keep their
lies straight.</p>

<title>The Waco Fire</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Waco Fire</h1>

<p>On April 19, 1993, the U.S. government's
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attack on the
Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas came to an end with the deaths of
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/victims.html">86 men,
women and children</a>.</p>

<p>The official version, represented by investigator Paul Gray's report,
is that the Davidians committed suicide by setting the fire which
destroyed their home. This denies the volume of evidence otherwise:
tapes of negotiations showed the <a href="suicide.html">Davidians were
not suicidal</a>; FBI tanks killed women and children by collapsing
ceilings before the fire started; and the FBI itself may have started
the fire.</p>

<p>The feds had cut off electricity to Mt. Carmel and the Davidians were using
kerosene lamps, most hung on walls, for light. Then tanks start ramming
the building, collapsing walls. Then a fire starts. Much evidence exists
to show that the U.S. government intentionally started the fire,
trapped the occupants inside the burning building, and rigged the report
to mask their actions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="cs_gas.html">Inflammable gas pumped into building</a></li>
<li><a href="coverup.html">Investigators covered up cause of fire</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Surviving Davidians' testimony, FBI agents' and Texas Rangers' testimony,
video evidence (including infrared video) and Mt. Carmel's design and
contents provide evidence of what happened on April 19.</p>

<p>According to the Justice Department report, fire started in three
separate locations in Mt. Carmel. Television footage shows that those
fires each started within two or three minutes of tanks ramming those
areas.</p>

<p>Why did the fire start? Tanks crushed through walls that held kerosene
lanterns into rooms containing butane heaters and propane tanks. At the same
time, the FBI pumped in highly inflammable CS gas (banned for use in war by
international treaty) into the building.</p>

<p>Why did the fire spread? The building contained inflammable liquids and
gases (kerosene, butane, propane and CS). Mt. Carmel was designed with many
long, narrow passageways, causing a "flue" effect spreading the fire. The FBI
dismissed fire fighters, who had been on standby during the entire siege, not
long before the fire. Winds that day were up to 30 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Why couldn't the Davidians escape? Government tanks demolished possible
exits, crushing people trapped in some rooms. The attack would have forced most
of them further into the building, making escape more difficult.</p>

<p>Why did the independent report not show this? Because it was a lie. The head
investigator, appointed by the feds, withheld some evidence and ignored others.
The feds prevented truly independent investigation by keeping press away from
the scene, bulldozing the site, then excavating the top several inches of
topsoil from the area. Even so, what evidence is available (video and
testimony) points to what can only be described as evil: the murder of innocent
Americans by their government.</p>

<title>Waco: The Coverup</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 - June 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Waco Cover-Up</h1>

<p>April 1993: Claiming safety hazards from "millions of rounds of ammunition"
stored at the Davidian complex, reporters are kept 3 miles away from the scene.
However, on the day of the fire, ATF agents could be seen strolling
on the grounds near the fire, apparently unafraid of the "millions of rounds"
going off.</p>

<p> August 16, 1993: The Treasury Department places a proposed regulation in
the Federal Register (58FR43312) to allow the department to investigate the
Waco massacre without making the results of the investigation public as
required under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p> January 1994: During jury selection for the Davidians' trial, every attempt
is made to limit public access to the proceedings. As reported in
the January 11, 1994
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
 <cite>Morning News</cite>, p. 10A:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a> resident, Francis Sommer, was arrested on a criminal
trespass charge after repeatedly demanding to be allowed into the courtroom
during jury selection.</p>

<p>An Associated Press reporter, Kelley Shannon, was escorted from the
courthouse without explanation, and a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
 <cite>Chronicle</cite> reporter was briefly denied entrance.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> AP bureau
chief John Lumpkin, in a letter to U.S. District 
Judge Harry Hudspeth, who presides over the Western District of Texas, said:
"Ms. Shannon did not deserve the treatment she received this morning.  From 
the beginning of this case, federal authorities have operated in such a manner
to inhibit the free flow of information."</p>

<p>Judge Smith barred all public spectators and allowed only a pool of
five reporters into the courtroom Monday, telling security officers that more
spectators might intimidate potential jurors, said an official with the U.S.
Marshals service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> June 1994: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Committee and the Texas
Water Commission authorize a contractor to excavate 6" to 18" of topsoil from
the already burnt-over and bulldozed Mt. Carmel building site and surrounding 7
acres. The government claims the former grounds of the  Branch Davidian
community is contaminated with lead and human waste and is therefore a health
hazard.</p>

<title>Reaction to Waco</title>

<body>

<h1>Reactions to Waco</h1>

<p>The federal government's 
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attack on the
Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas in 1993 stirred a
wave of antigovernment sentiment. Of course, the government's own reaction
has generally been continued persecution.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="tribune-herald.html">March 1993: Waco newspaper flooded with
	antigovernment commentary</a></li>
<li><a href="irs.html">December 1993: IRS harasses surviving Davidians</a></li>
<li><a href="lptx.html">March 1993 - February 1995: Libertarian Party of
	Texas protests government actions</a></li>
<li><a href="/revolution/legal/corrupt/foster.html">July 1993:

</ul>

<p>The Waco massacre spurred growth in the <a

<p>Several terrorist acts may have been linked to Waco:</p>

<title>The Committee for Waco Justice</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: December 1993 - ongoing April 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Committee for Waco Justice</h1>

<p>June 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol
Moore</a>:</p>

<p>"The <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CWJ.html">Committee for Waco Justice</a>
is working for an complete and thorough investigation of BATF and FBI crimes
against the Branch Davidian religious group near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> and for
prosecution of responsible agents and officials.  We call for
freedom for the nine Branch Davidian prisoners sentenced to
243 years in prison for defending themselves against the
brutal BATF assault."</p>

<p>The CWJ has been active since at least December 1993, when Carol Moore
posted the following:</p>

<p>Our report on the massacre will demand:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>PROSECUTION OF ATF/FBI AGENTS:</p>

<p>At the end of the individual sections on ATF/FBI we will be
recommending prosecution of specific agents and officials under
the following two laws.</p>

<p>TITLE 18 SECTION 241-(18USC 241)-CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF
CITIZENS: If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten,
or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of
any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws
of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the
same; or if two or more persons go in disguise on the highway or
the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his
free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured- 
they shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more
than 10 years, or both: and if death results they shall be
subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>

<p>TITLE 18 SECTION 242-(18USC242)-DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW:  
Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance,
regulation, or custom, willfully subject any inhabitant of any
state, territory or district to the deprivation of any rights,
privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the
Constitution or laws of the United States, or to different
punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such inhabitant
being an alien, or by reasons of his color, or race, than are
prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be fined not
more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both;
and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any
term of years or for life.  </p>

<li><p>Abolish BATF</p>

<p>Or at least put it under the same restrictions FBI has on
accumulating information on Americans.  According to <cite>Washington
Times</cite> article 11/2/93 "ATF chief vows to keep an eye on religious
cults," John Magaw, acting director of BATF said, "We're trying
to monitor them early in the game ... find out their history, their
background, makeup."  Looks like all BATF has learned from Waco
is to spy better and use bigger guns!</p>

<li><p>Restrict FBI and Other Federal Agent Powers</p>

<p>Federal agents' ability to serve warrants should be restricted or eliminated.
Restrict local/state/federal "multi-taskforces" or joint actions against
individuals or groups making them all defacto "co-conspirators" and giving no
possibility of independent investigation of wrongdoing. (Especially, local and
state law enforcement should not be deputized as federal marshals, as Texas
Rangers are who deal with Waco, in any situation where there is possibility of
wrongdoing by federal officers against citizens of state.)  </p>

<li><p>Congress Should Make A Clear and Constitutional Policy on "Armed
Groups"</p>

<p> Appendix G of the Treasury Dept. report on Waco is "A Brief
History of Federal Firearms Enforcement" and traces that history
from Shay's Rebellion (1786) through the civil war, prohibition,
and up to the present where they list several rightwing, tax
resisting, gun holding survivalists they've attacked and burned
out.  Waco was not the first.    </p>

<p> What is particularly of interest here is the statement: "The
raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compound resulted from
its enforcement of contemporary federal firearms laws.  In a
larger sense, however, the raid fit within an historic, well-
established and well-defended government interest in prohibiting
and breaking up all organized groups that sought to arm or
fortify themselves ... From its earliest formation, the federal
government has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled or
rebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, however
small the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition. 
The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,
ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against the
government itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federal
agents who tried to disband the groups frequently became the
targets."  (Appendix G, Page 7)</p>

<p> Finally, we know their true motivation for all this! So one thing that must
be demanded of Congress is an exact definition of "armed groups" -- how many
and what kinds of guns held by how many individuals in what kind of "group" is
considered an armed group which must be broken up?    </p>

<title>Davidian David Thibodeaux</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>David Thibodeaux</h1>

<p>David Thibodeaux is one of the Branch Davidians who escaped the fire. I'm not
sure if his name is spelled correctly; posters on the net spelled it
Thibedeaux and Thibodeau.<p>

<hr>

<p>Paul Watson (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:pwatson@utdallas.edu">pwatson@utdallas.edu</a>) reported on a
meeting of the Citizens for Legal Reform in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>:</p>

<p> ... The next speaker was David Thibedeaux who escaped the day of the 
fire. David said 22 people were assassinated by snipers as they ran out 
the back of the building. He said they got one of the cases the CS gas 
was in and it has a warning label "not to be used in closed areas/may 
cause death/for open area riot control only." He also said CS is not a gas 
but a powder that is inflammable in a closed area. David said the Texas 
Health and Human Services had came out to investigate all of the child 
abuse charges and had medically inspected all of the children and found 
no evidence of sex or child abuse and in fact they said they were the 
most polite, happy and well mannered kids they had ever had the pleasure 
of working with.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've lost the author and date of the following report:</p>

<p> We were fortunate to have as guest speaker at our weekly meeting
last week, David Thibedeaux, one of the nine sole survivors of the
Mount Carmel incident and the only one not to be indicted so far.</p>

<p> He is a young man - early 30's probably and spoke very passionately
about the his 3 years living amongst his friends and family at Mt. Carmel </p>

<p>... Some of his key points:</p>

<p> At the time of the fire many tried to escape as quickly as possible through
various exits. The nine that survived happened to exit on side of the building
that was being covered by video camera -- he claims the government killed all
others except those on camera.</p.

<p> 25 people exited safely through the back exit. These same people were also
reported being killed by bullet wounds to the head ...</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/G/MatthewGaylor.html">Matthew Gaylor</a>
posted the following to Libernet on June 18, 1995:</p>

<p>David Thibodeau, a theological scholar, was researching the Branch
Davidians when the initial assault by the BATF occurred in 1993. Trapped
in the crossfire, Thibodeau escaped the Davidian siege shortly before the
firestorm, and was a material witness in the ensuing trial. Thibodeau was
and is not a Branch Davidian, and is the only survivor not charged or
imprisoned as a result of the incident.</p>

<title>Waco Survivors Sue U.S.</title>
<!-- Place: Houston, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 28, 1995 -->
</head>

<h1>Waco Survivors Sue U.S.</h1>

<p>By Mike Drago, Associated Press Writer</p>

<p> HOUSTON (AP) - Branch Davidians and their survivors sued the government
for $63.5 million Monday [February 28, 1995], claiming it meant for church 
members to die in the federal raid on their compound and the fire that 
destroyed it. "This is a fundamentally different approach than any of the
other lawsuits," said lawyer James Brannon, who filed the lawsuit in federal
court.</p>

<p> "The others claim that the government made mistakes," he said.  "This  is
the only one that takes a position that they calculatedly destroyed  the
compound and everything in it. " Nearly a dozen civil lawsuits have been filed
by federal agents and by Davidians.  None have gone to trial yet. </p>

<h1>Books on Waco</h1>

<p>Many books have been published on the <a href="index.html">government
attack on the Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas in 1993.</p>

<dl>
<dt><cite>The Ashes of Waco: An Investigation</cite>, by D.J. Reavis.
<dd>An journalist's investigation into the Waco affair. The book's
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://rampages.onramp.net/~djreavis/">Web site</a> includes
an excellent overview with excerpts, Congressional testimony,
pictures and sound clips.</dd>
<p>
<dt><cite>The Davidian Massacre</cite>, by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>.</dt>
<dd>Written by a libertarian supporter of the Davidians, this book
systematically analyzes evidence that agents of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
committed real crimes against the Branch Davidians, including firing
first, firing from helicopters, sabotaging negotiations, lying to
the Attorney General and starting the fire that ended the siege.</dd>

<!-- To be checked:
	FBI jammed TV/radio signals during siege (CNN 4/20/93 11:40am EDT,

	FBI bugged Mt.Carmel during siege (DMN 4/21/93)
	Davidians on 3/14/93 flashed "SOS SOS SOS FBI BROKE NEGOTIATIONS"

	FBI said they planned to knock down Davidians' ham radio station
		(Atlanta Journal, 3/5/93)
	###
	Should really add more links to Reavis' Ashes of Waco pages.
-->

<!-- Should have a lie-by-lie refutation:

	House hearings: BATF testified Davidians "sprayed" machine guns,
	.50 caliber rifles and grenades. At trial, FBI admitted no spent
	.50 bullets were found.

	House hearings: BATF testified Davidians outgunned BATF's "pop guns".
	"Pop guns" included 9mm, AR-15s, MP-5 submachine guns, Blackhawk
	helicopter.

	"Ambush". BATF was the one attacking; BATF knew Davidians knew
	they were coming; BATF agents seen shooting out in the open
	during raid. BATF practiced repeatedly in mock raids at Ft. Hood
	under Special Forces training.

	House hearings (Kiri Jewell), standoff, etc.: BATF/FBI claimed
	Koresh abused children. DoJ admitted not enough evidence to
	indict Koresh; Jewell's father tried to make money by putting
	her on the talk show circuit and sell her story for a TV movie;
	counselors who interviewed surviving Davidian children found
	no evidence of abuse.

	Davidians were suicidal/committed suicide. Transcripts, trial
	testimony, survivors' testimony.

	FBI wanted peaceful surrender. Lights/noises, fake tank passes,
	destruction of property, superiors telling negotiators to justify
	aggression.

<h1>Remember Waco</h1>

<p>The federal government's military assault of a religious residence near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, was one of
the most egregious abuses of power witnessed in
the U.S. in this century.</p>

<p>On February 28, 1993, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF)
conducted a military assault of the living quarters of the Branch Davidians,
a small Christian church once associated with the Seventh-Day Adventists.
After a fifty-one-day siege, the Davidians' home burned, killing over eighty
men, women and children.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="motive/">BATF wanted to make an example of the Davidians.</a></dt>
<dd><p>BATF used some valid concerns to further their agenda of increasing
their budget and disarming American citizens.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="raid/">BATF used excessive force.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Instead of peacably serving a search warrant, the BATF lied in order to
get military support, then attacked the Davidians with overwhelming firepower,
leaving the Davidians no option but to defend themselves or be killed.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="siege/">The FBI's siege confirmed Davidians' fears.</a></dt>
<dd><p>During the long siege, the FBI cut off utilities, blared recordings of
rabbits being slaughtered, refused to allow family members to talk with the
Davidians, and otherwise confirmed the Davidian's view that the federal
government meant to kill them.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="fire/">The federal government started the fire and made sure the
	Davidians died in it.</a></dt>
<dd><p>The FBI pumped an inflammable gas into a building lit with kerosene
lanterns, then knocked down walls and blocked exits.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="coverup/">Government agencies covered up evidence of agents'
	wrongdoing.</a></dt>
<dd><p>The press were kept away from the scene; the building was immediately
demolished; key evidence disappeared; several feet of topsoil was removed
from the site.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="trial/">Surviving Davidians were found innocent of murder.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Despite dirty tricks by the prosecution, a jury found that surviving
Davidians acted in self-defense and were as such innocent of murder and
conspiracy to murder. Six Davidians are appealing convictions on lesser
charges.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="reaction/">The Waco tragedy stirred tremendous antigovernment
	sentiment.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Seeing federal agents abuse their authority with impunity, average
Americans began to fear their government. Both the House and Senate
held hearings on the Waco incident. Imprisoned Davidians appealed their
sentences.</p></dd>

<dt>Federal agencies should be required to use local police for
	actual enforcement.</dt>
<dd><p>To reduce the situations that made Waco likely, federal police
should be prohibited from carrying weapons, instead being confined to an
investigative role, and relying on local law enforcement for searches and
arrests.</p></dd>

<title>Racist Origins of U.S. Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1800's and 1900's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Racist Origins of U.S. Gun Control</h1>

<p>From a review by Jim Powell of Clayton Cramer's <cite>For the Defense of
Themselves and the State: The Original Intent and Judicial Interpretation
of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</cite>:</p>

<p>... [Cramer] discovered how judges weasled out of upholding the Second
Amendment.  He provides many examples where judges simply ignored it as well as
their own state constitution which protected gun rights, without offering a
reason why.  An <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> Supreme Court
judge dismissed the Second Amendment as
"that right, whatever it may be," refusing to elaborate.  Other examples show
how judges supported their decisions with factual errors about the origin of
the Second Amendment. Then there are examples of judges who cited misleading
precedents -- legal reasoning supposedly contained wasn't there, or one point
cited was contradicted by other points in a decision.</p>

<p>In documenting the racist history of gun control laws, Cramer makes clear that
a major purpose is to keep people down.  For example, he tells how, during the
1830s, 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/">Virginia</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> enacted
laws disarming free
blacks.  Cramer notes how the Supreme Court, in the notorious Dred Scott case
(1857), denounced the idea that free blacks should be able to keep and bear
arms.</p>

<p>Cramer talks at length about the gun control laws which Southern states enacted
after the Civil War to keep blacks down.  For example, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a>: "No negro who
is not in the military service shall be allowed to carry fire-arms, or any kind
of weapons, within the parish, without the special written permission of his
employers, approved and endorsed by the nearest and most convenient chief of
patrol."  And
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ms/">Mississippi</a>:
"No freedman, free Negro, or mulatto not in the
military service of the United States government, and not licensed so to do by
the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry firearms of any
kind..."</p>

<p>States used various tactics to restrict gun rights.  Judges limited the kinds
of weapons individuals could own, ruled it was illegal to carry concealed
weapons -- or illegal to carry weapons openly.</p>

<p>Judges used a variety of weasel words to uphold these laws.  A
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>
judge
declared such laws were legit because their aim was to "promote the public
peace."  He claimed that when a lot of people carried pistols, the result was
"dangerous wounds, as well as frequent homicides."</p>

<p>In 1872, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> judge was
surprisingly frank in admitting that gun control
promoters don't give a hoot for liberty: "It is useless to talk about personal
liberty being infringed by laws such as that under consideration. The world has
seen too much licentiousness cloaked under the name of natural or personal
liberty..."  The judge trashed the state's constitution which spoke clearly:
"Every person shall have the right to keep and bear arms."</p>

<title>Nazi Origin of U.S. Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: Germany and USA -->
<!-- Time: Nazi Weapons Law 1938, U.S. Gun Control Act 1968 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Origin of U.S. Gun Control Laws</h1>

<p>Excerpts from an article in the May 1993 <cite>Guns and Ammo</cite>
by <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JPFO.html">Jews for the Preservation of
Firearms Ownership</a>. Posted to the Internet with
permission by Craig Peterson.</p>

<p>Members of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO)
consider gun control to be an aggressive cancer.  JPFO has a cure, a
way to destroy gun control.  JPFO has hard evidence that shows that
the Nazi Weapons Law (March 18, 1938) is the source of the U.S. Gun
Control Act of 1968 (GCA'68).  Adolph Hitler signed the Nazi Weapons
Law.  The Gestapo (Nazi National Secret Police) enforced it.  In <cite>Gun
Control: Gateway to Tyranny</cite> we present the official German text of
the Nazi Weapons Law and a side-by-side translation into English.
Even more deadly: a side-by-side, section-by-section comparison of
the GCA'68 with the Nazi Weapons Law.  If you have this in your hands,
no one can tell you that you're imagining things.</p>

<p>GCA'68 marked a new approach to gun control. It replaced
the Federal Firearms Act (June 30, 1938), which was based on the
federal power to regulate interstate commerce.  The 1938 law required
firearms dealers to get a federal license (which then cost $1).  Only
dealers could ship firearms across state lines.  Ordinary people could
receive shipments from dealers.</p>

<p>In GCA'68 the government required that in almost all cases only
dealers could send and receive firearms across state lines.  This
ended "mail order" sales of firearms by law-abiding persons who are
not licensed dealers.</p>

<p>GCA'68 hits you even harder.  Congress gave federal bureaucrats
in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>,
the power to decide what kinds of firearms you can own.</p>

<p>The framers of GCA'68 borrowed an idea--that certain firearms are
"hunting weapons"--from the Nazi Weapons Law (Section 21 and Section
32 of the Regulations, page 61 and page 73, respectively, of Gun
Control.- Gateway to Tyranny).  The equivalent U.S. term, "sporting
purpose," was used to classify firearms.  But it was not defined
anywhere in GCA'68.  Thus, bureaucrats were empowered to ban whole
classes of firearms.  They have, in fact, done so.</p>

<p>The Nazi Weapons Law of 1938 replaced a Law on Firearms and
Ammunition of April 13, 1928.  The 1928 law was enacted by a
center-right, freely elected German government that wanted to curb
"gang activity," violent street fights between Nazi party and
Communist party thugs.  All firearms owners and their firearms had to
be registered.  Sound familiar?  Gun control did not save democracy in
Germany.  It helped to make sure that the toughest criminals, the
Nazis, prevailed.</p>

<p>The Nazis inherited lists of firearm owners and their firearms
when they lawfully took power in March 1933.  The Nazis used these
inherited registration lists to seize privately held firearms from
persons who were not "reliable." Knowing exactly who owned which
firearms, the Nazis had only to revoke the annual ownership permits or
decline to renew them.</p>

<p>In 1938, five years after taking power, the Nazis enhanced the
1928 law.  The Nazi Weapons Law introduced handgun control.  Firearms
ownership was restricted to Nazi party members and other "reliable"
people.</p>

<p>The 1938 Nazi law barred Jews from businesses involving firearms.
On November 10, 1938--one day after the Nazi party terror squads (the
SS) savaged thousands of Jews, synagogues and Jewish businesses
through-out Germany--new regulations under the Weapons Law
specifically barred Jews from owning any weapons, even clubs or knives.</p>

<p>Exhibit No. 62 (see reproduction) [added to the end of this
document] is fascinating.  This letter--dated July 12, 1968--is to
Subcommittee Chairman Dodd from Lewis C. Coffin, Law Librarian at the
Library of Congress.  Coffin wrote:</p>

<p>"...We are enclosing herewith a translation of the Law on Weapons
of March 18, 1938, prepared by Dr. William Solyom-Fekete of [the
European Law Division -ed.] as well as the Xerox of the original
German text which you supplied" (Subcommittee Hearings, p. 489).</p>

<p>This letter makes it public knowledge that at the end of June
1968 -- 4 months before GCA'68 was enacted -- Senator Thomas J. Dodd, now
deceased, personally owned a copy of the original German text of the
Nazi Weapons Law.</p>

<p>We are not the first to have seen this hearing record.  But we
appear to be the first to have recognized its importance.  This
hearing record suggests strongly that the late Senator Thomas J. Dodd
(D-CT) himself implanted the Nazi Weapons Law into American law, or,
at very least, helped others to do so.</p>

<p>To order a copy of <cite>Gun Control: Gateway to Tyranny</cite>, send a
check for $19.95, plus $2.95 shipping and handling ($22.90 total), to:
JPFO, Inc., Dept.  GA, 2872 S. Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207,
(414) 769-0760.

<title>U.S. Assault Weapons Ban</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: May 5, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>U.S. House Passes Assault Weapons Ban</h1>

<p>May 1994, from Release 1.11 of the Online Report to the Firearms Coalition,
Box 6537, Silver Spring, MD 20916 (Copyright 1994 by Neal Knox Associates,
P.O. Box 6537, Rockville, MD  20916. Reproduction and distribution of this
bulletin by any means is encouraged so long as this statement is retained.):</p>

<p>House-Passed Gun/Magazine Ban</p>

<p>Following is the Judiciary Committee version of <a href="hr4296.html">H.R.
4296</a> which passed the House 216-214 May 5, 1994.</p>

<p>It has numerous subtle but significant changes from the
Feinstein amendment included in the Senate-passed crime bill. 
Either of the versions, or a combination of the two, will be folded
into the House-Senate conference committee compromise.</p>

<p>The conference committee will probably reach an agreement
within two weeks, then each house will have to approve their
compromise.</p>

<p>Both bills prohibit possession of over-10-shot magazines and
"feeding devices," or the parts from which one can be made, which
were manufactured after the effective date (with exceptions for
police and military, or retired law enforcement officers given a
magazine -- or gun -- by his agency).  New over-10 magazines would
have to be serial numbered and clearly marked as made after the
effective date.  "High capacity feeding devices" would be
classified as firearms.</p>

<p>There is no criteria as to how a person would prove that a 15-
shot Beretta or Ruger pistol magazine, or a 20-round AR-15
magazine, were legally possessed prior to the effective date.</p>

<p>The Senate-passed version requires owners of affected guns to
record ownership by registering that gun with a dealer within 90
days.  Such registered guns could subsequently be transferred by
obtaining a Form 4473 from the buyer, then permanently keeping it. 
The 4473 used for registration would have to be kept with the gun.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with the Senate-required provisions would be
punishable by 6 months in jail, $1,000 fine and permanent
prohibition from possessing any firearm.  An unregistered gun would
be contraband.</p>

<p>The House-passed version does not include the requirement that
presently possessed guns be registered.  It does require that the
seller of a grandfathered gun obtain a Form 4473 from the buyer. 
In the subcommittee Chairman Charles Schumer changed that to allow
BATF to designate any form, raising concerns that they might
require the same form used for the transfer of a machine gun.  </p>

<p>In the full committee Schumer offered an amendment striking
the prohibition on ownership for someone who failed to keep proper
paperwork, and stated he would insist on that change being put into
the final conference committee bill.</p>

<p>Also in full committee he assured Rep. Glickman that
"unmodified sporting handguns" like the Glock, Ruger P-89 and
Beretta 92F wouldn't be affected by the bill.  After the meeting I
told Glickman that Schumer hadn't told him the truth, since those
guns could not be manufactured and sold for the over-10-shot
magazines for which they were designed.</p>

<p>On the floor, to win the vote of someone, Schumer made a vague
promise to remove all the record-keeping requirements on
grandfathered guns.  Chairman Jack Brooks told the House that such
a commitment couldn't be kept because similar requirements were in
both bills.</p>

<p>The 19 named models include the Intratec TEC-22, TEC-9, TEC-
DC9; AK-47S from several makers; Uzi and Galil; Beretta AR-70; SWD
M10, M11, M11/9 and M12; Colt AR-15; FN/FAL, FN/FLR, FNC; and Steyr
AUG.  Also banned are lookalikes "of any caliber."</p>

<p>According to ABC, President Clinton got
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nc/">North Carolina</a>
Congressman Steve Neal to sign on by promising that only those 19
guns would be banned.  If so, he lied, for BATF has written Sen.
Larry Craig that the generic definitions apply to 45 "currently
advertised" models, and Gun Week has listed 184 guns that would be
affected.</p>

<p>Affected guns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Semi-auto pistols which have a detachable magazine and two
or more features such as a barrel shroud, threaded muzzle, or
magazine other than in the grip, or which weigh over 50 ounces
unloaded;</p>

<li><p>Semi-auto rifles with a detachable magazine and two or more
features such as a folding or telescoping stock, protruding pistol
grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, grenade launcher attachment,
or threaded barrel muzzle;</p>

<li><p>Semi-auto shotguns with a fixed magazine over five rounds,
an ability to accept a detachable magazine or drum, with a pistol
grip extending below the action, or with a folding or telescoping
stock.</p>
</ul>

<p>Adopted 216-214, May 5, 1994.</p>

<p>The gavel did not fall to close the vote until about five
minutes after the usual end of voting.  During that delay, a
contingent of Democrats convinced Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) to change
his vote from opposition to support for the bill, swinging the
count from 213 for, 214 against, to 214-213.  </p>

<title>NRA Challenges Assault Weapon Ban</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 6, 1995 -->

<body>

<h1>NRA Challenges Assault Weapon Ban</h1>

<p>NRA Media Advisory, February 6, 1995. For further information, call: NRA
Public Affairs 703-267-3820.</p>

<hr>

<h2>NRA Takes Clinton Gun Ban To Court</h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>
 -- On Tuesday, February 7th, the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
of America will file suit in U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan in Bay City, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>. Target of
the suit: the 1994 Clinton gun ban.</p>

<p>Joined by her attorneys, Mrs. Tanya K. Metaksa, NRA's chief
lobbyist, will discuss the suit at a press conference in Lansing at
3 p.m.  Also accompanying Mrs. Metaska will be Tom Washington, NRA
President and executive director of Michigan United Conservation
Clubs (M.U.C.C.), a co-plaintiff in the suit.</p>

<p>"We challenged the Clinton gun ban in the voting booth November
8th, and we won," said Mrs. Metaksa. "We are challenging the ban in
the 104th Congress, and we are gaining ground. It is time to take
our case to the courts."</p>

<p> Press Conference Details:</p>

<p> Where:  Lansing Center, Room 104, 333 East Michigan Avenue,
Lansing, Michigan 48933.</p>

<p> Date/Time:      Tuesday, February 7 at 3:00 p.m.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fact Sheet</h2>

<p> In Public Law 103-322, Congress outlawed "Semiautomatic Assault
Weapons."  What are they?  That is the question raised by this suit.</p>

<p> The Clinton gun ban defines them in two ways:</p>

<p> The first definition is any of the firearms :"known as" the
"avtomat Kalashnikov," the "Colt AR-15," etc. -- together with
"copies or duplicates" of any of these.</p>

<p> The second definition includes any rifle with two or more features
from a list of five -- pistol grip, folding stock, etc.</p>

<p> In court, NRA will prove that the statute is constitutionally void
in many respects. The most obvious are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Void for Vagueness: "KNOWN AS"</p>

<p> The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that a law is "void for
vagueness" when a person of ordinary intelligence cannot determine
what is allowed or forbidden. The first definition of the forbidden
firearms are guns "known as" certain names. Yet, six of the seven
names given are, in fact, the names of fully automatic firearms
(i.e., machine guns). For example, Colt has not made a
semiautomatic rifle named "AR-15" since the mid-1980s.</p>

<p> Thus, the statute has to, literally, aimed at guns "known as" the
AR-15, etc. -- not guns which are so named.</p>

<li><p>Void for Vagueness: "COPIES OR DUPLICATES"</p>

<p> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (which encompasses
Michigan) recently struck down a city ban on certain semiautomatic
firearms as void for vagueness.  <cite>Springfield Armory v. City of
Columbus</cite>, 29 F. 2D 250 (6th Cir. 1994).  That city banned named
guns and "models by the same manufacturer with the same action
design that have slight modifications or enhancements." The Sixth
Circuit pointed out that guns varied widely in design, function and
power; it was impossible to determine how much of a difference it
took to make something not of "the same action design.'  The
Clinton gun ban is even more ambiguous.</p>

<li><p>Equal Protection of the Law</p>

<p> The Clinton gun ban also violates the equality components of the
"due process" clause of the Fifth Amendment. Congress banned the
"Colt AR-15" without banning nine other companies' manufacture of
nearly identical rifles. It added a list of over a hundred guns --
by manufacturers' names -- which were exempt from the ban -- even
though many have identical function (caliber, rate of fire, etc.)
to banned items. The Ruger Mini-14 fires the same cartridges as the
AR-15, but is exempted.</p>

<p> Due process implies some equality of treatment and that
inequalities have some "rational basis." There is none in the
Clinton gun ban.</p>
</ul>

<title>Repeal of U.S. Assault Weapons Ban</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: April 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Repeal of Assault Weapons Ban</h1>

<p>After the Republicans regained control of the U.S. House and Senate in
November 1994, they made repeal of the Clinton Weapons Ban a top priority.</p>

<p>Republican-controlled committees held weeks of hearings at which people
testified to the value of guns including assault weapons in self-protection.</p>

<p>In April 1995, several U.S. House Republicans and Democrats introduced H.R.
1488, calling for repeal of the ban, guarantee of individuals owning any
firearm in their home for self-defense, increasing penalties for "criminal
misuse" of firearms, and directing U.S. attorneys to increase prosecution of
criminals using firearms.</p>

<p>The repeal of the ban is obviously a step in the right direction. The others
bring up more questions than answers. What types of firearms are guaranteed to
be legal? What determines use for self-defense? Does "criminal misuse" of
firearms include violations of minor BATF regulations which shouldn't exist in
the first place?</p>

<title>Antimilitia Law</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: introduced May 2, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Antimilitia Law Proposed</h1>

<p>On May 2, 1995, H.R. 1544 was introduced to ban militia-style
organizations.</p>

<p>The proposed Domestic Insurgency Act of 1995 prohibits the formation of
private paramilitary organizations. According to the text of the bill,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) whoever knowingly participates in a paramilitary organization shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</p>

<p>(b) as used in this section, the term paramilitary organization "means two
or
more individuals acting together, organized in a military or paramilitary
structure, who knowingly - </p>

<ol>
<li>possess firearms, explosives, incendiary devices, or other weapons or
techniques capable of causing injury or death to individuals, or
<li>provide or participate in training in the use of any such weapons or
techniques, with the intention that such weapons or techniques be used
unlawfully to oppose the authority of the United States or of any State or
for any other unlawful purpose.
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the "or" between the two definitions of paramilitary organization. The
first definition is broad enough to include steak knives, so essentially this
bill would prohibit anyone from organizing "in a military or paramilitary
structure," which is not defined.</p>

<title>UN Working Paper on Global Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: Global -->
<!-- Time: working paper approved May 9, 1994; meetings Spring 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>U.N. Proposes International Gun Control</h1>

<p>On May 9, 1994, the United Nations Disarmament Commission adopted a
working paper calling for international controls on the gun trade, according
to the Associated Press. The working paper was adopted by consensus vote;
the commission has representatives from each U.N. member country, including
the U.S.</p>

<p>The working paper has no authority, but could serve as a basis for debate in
the U.N. General Assembly. The anti-gun campaign is led by Colombia, although
other countries such as
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/India/">India</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> joined in eagerly.</p>

<p>The smugglers who bring drugs into the U.S. often bring back guns into
Colombia. You'd think that the Colombians would get a clue from drug
prohibition that gun prohibition won't work. In fact, guns are completely
banned in Colombia, which is awash in firearms.</p>

<p>Colombian officials feel that the proper response to the failure of gun
prohibition in their country is more gun prohibition elsewhere.</p>

<p>The working paper adopted by the Disarmament Commission places the
subject on the commission's agenda for spring 1995. A final report may be
issued in 1996.</p>

<p>The working paper calls for "harmonization" of gun controls, saying,
"the arms permitted for civilian use ... should be subject to controls at all
points in the chain, from production and-or acquisition up to the time they
are sold to an individual. From then on they should remain subject to
monitoring and control."</p>

<title>Firearms Laws in Bowerbank</title>
<!-- Place: Bowerbank, Maine (USA) -->
<!-- Time: reported June 22, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Bowerbank, Maine Requires Gun Ownership</h1>

<p>As reported in the June 22, 1994 <cite>Central Maine Morning
Sentinel</cite>, the town of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/me/Bowerbank.html">Bowerbank</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/me/">Maine</a> passed an
ordinance requiring heads of households to own arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>The <cite>Sentinel</cite> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Actually, its written to make a statement," said the leading proponent of the
ordinance, William Quigley, a taxidermist and retired police chief in Nashua,
N.H. "It's just an attention getter".</p>

<p>... Residents signed petitions to force the vote at Saturday's town meeting.
The vote was 26-11. Bowerbank has 72 registered voters, said Town Clerk Joyce
Doolittle.</p>

<p>... The ordinance does not apply to seasonal residents, many who occupy
cottages along the shores of Sebec Lake at the Central Maine town's edge.
The ordinance has no enforcement provision, and specifically allows exceptions
or those who are opposed to weapons on principle, said Quigley. It also excuses
hose with physical or mental disabilites, felons and "paupers", said Quigley.
Another provision frees the town of any responsibility for shooting accidents
and from having to buy guns or ammo for residents.</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Firearms Laws in Kennesaw</title>
<!-- Place: Kennesaw, Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1982 (reported November 1994) -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Kennesaw Requires Gun Ownership</h1>

<p>Reprinted without permission from <cite>The Georgia Libertarian</cite>,
a monthly publication of the Libertarian Party of Georgia (1874 Piedmont
Road Suite 590-E,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Atlanta.html">Atlanta</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">GA</a> 30324,
404/888-9468, 1-800-257-2493, Fax:404/874-8339):</p>

<p>In mid-November, the [Atlanta, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia's</a>] Fulton County
government began
requiring all gun dealers to stick a government-issued warning label on
their firearms.  The labels attribute all sorts of dire dangers and
consequences to the purchase and ownership of guns.</p>

<p>If gun-owning is so dangerous and such a cause of social ills, then surely
the most dangerous place in America - if not the entire planet - must be
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Kennesaw.html">Kennesaw</a>,
Georgia [a suburb of Atlanta], where since 1982 a law has
required every household to have a firearm and ammunition. (Conscientious
objectors are excluded.)</p>

<p>Right?  <em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p>There has not been a single reported crime of domestic violence in
Kennesaw since the law was passed.  There have been no injuries to
children involving guns since the law was passed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, violence has actually <em>dropped</em> since 1982.  Burglaries
per thousand inhabitants fell from 11 to less than 3.  There hasn't been a
single murder since 1986.  All this despite the fact that the population
in Kennesaw <em>doubled</em> in that time.</p>

<p>Could it be - gasp! - that gun ownership might have positive, not
negative effects?  That the whole premise behind gun banning is totally
wrong?  That other factors besides guns might be the real cause of Fulton
County's crime problems?</p>

<p>Nah, just ask the Fulton County Commission.</p>

<title>CCW in Louisiana</title>
<!-- Place: Louisiana (USA) -->
<!-- Date: May 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>CCW in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a></h1>

<p>May 18, 1995, from the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>:</p>

<p>Good news from Baton Rouge!  The State House approved H.B.  2442,
NRA-supported right-to-carry legislation, on an overwhelming 75-28 vote!
The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration. Another right to carry
bill, S.B. 1256, has already passed the Senate and awaits consideration by
the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee. We'll keep you posted
as these bills progress.</p>

<p>Also, a Senate committee killed S.B. 1256, a bill opposed by NRA that would
have established mandatory storage procedures for firearms stored at home.</p>

<p>House Bill 2080, legislation that would exempt <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/NewOrleans.html">New Orleans</a>
from the statewide firearms pre-emption statute, will be heard in
the House Committee on Administration of Criminal Justice on
Tuesday, May 23 at 9:00 a.m.  This bill would allow New Orleans to
enact restrictive "gun control" ordinances in conflict with state
law, creating confusion and hardship for law-abiding gun owners.</p>

<hr>

<p>June 2, 1995, from another NRA alert:</p>

<p>The House Administration on Criminal Justice Committee
approved SB 886, NRA-backed right to carry reform legislation.
This bill now moves to the House floor for consideration.</p>

<title>NYC CCW</title>
<!-- Place: New York City, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: account from 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>NYC's Concealed-Carry Weapons (CCW) Permits</h1>

<p>1994, from Peter Venetoklis (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:petev@gdstech.grumman.com">petev@gdstech.grumman.com</a>):</p>

<p>I figured the Libernet might be interested in what it takes to get a
pistol permit in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">city of
New York</a>.  In order for me, average
citizen who does not have a business that moves lots of cash, to get a
gun, I have to apply for a "target" permit, meaning I can carry my
gun, unloaded and locked in a secure box with the ammo elsewhere, to
and from the pistol range.  I must belong to a pistol range in order
for them to consider my application.</p>

<p>The City requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$170 Postal Money Order for application fee
<li>$50 Postal Money Order for fingerprints
<li>Notarized certification that I belong to a gun range/club
<li>Proof of Residence, e.g. Phone Bill
<li>Proof of Birthdate, e.g. Birth Certificate or Passport
<li>Two Head-and-Shoulders Photographs
<li>Signed and Notarized application, including history of residences, etc.
<li>A questionnaire describing what I want the gun for:
	<ul>
	<li>Personal Protection? (Correct answer:  No)
	<li>Keep gun loaded at home? (Correct answer: No)
	<li>Carry gun to shooting range?  (Yes)
	<li>How often do I want to shoot?  (2x/week)
	<li>How many guns do I want?  (3)
	<li>Do I want to keep guns locked up in house or business?  (house)
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>I used a "service" provided by Edelman's, a large gun retailer, to get
the paperwork done right, photos, notarized statements, etc.  They
also provide me with one year membership at three ranges.  Their fee
for all this stuff:  $295 plus tax.</p>

<p>I had to take a day off work and go to Police Headquarters in
Manhattan to personally hand in my application and get fingerprinted.
When I got there I had to answer a questionnaire about previous
arrests and summonses.  When I asked about parking tickets, the clerk
made me write a letter that I had paid all traffic and parking
tickets, and get it notarized.  Fortunately, she pointed me to a
notary nearby.  She then took three separate sets of fingerprints,
plus a thumbprint on the application.</p>

<p>Adding up all the expenses so far, I get about $546 plus gas, time off
work, aggravation, etc.  Sometime in the next few months I will get
called in for an interview where I will stress that my interest lies
strictly in target shooting, and I wouldn't use the gun for home
defense.  6 to 8 months from now, I will get my permit.  Renewal is
$125 every two years, plus about $100 per year for the pistol range
membership.  </p>

<p>I'm also guessing that after I get the license, they'll make me wait 5
more days to satisfy Brady.</p>

<p>I'm lucky I can (a) afford all these fees, and (b) take time off work
to do this.  I can't shake the impression that this stuff is the
equivalent of a poll tax intended to keep the poor from voting.</p>

<h1>Concealed-Carry Weapons (CCW) Permits</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania's</a>
Constitution states, "The right of the citizens to bear arms
in defence of themselves and the State shall not be questioned," (Article 1,
Paragraph 21). Permits to carry concealed firearms are available to someone who
goes down to the County courthouse with $12.50 and two passport sized photos of
himself, fills out a form, gets fingerprinted, and supplies two character
references. (In January 1997, someone emailed me to say that fingerprints
are not required.)</p>

<title>Drive-Bys in Phoenix</title>
<!-- Place: Phoenix, Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1994 or earlier -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drive-Bys in Phoenix</h1>

<p>From the Firearms Politics list (I've lost the author and date):</p>

<p>Last time I was in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>,
[<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>,] I did some
checking on the local real-estate
market, and I came across an astonishing ad in the local market-paper. It
offered a three-bedroom house in the Phoenix area for -- are you ready for this
-- all of $10,000. No money down. $100 per month total payments. Christ on a
Harley-Davidson!</p>

<p>I called up the real-estate office making this offer, and asked about that
house. Were the walls, roof and foundation structurally sound? Yes. Were the
plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code? Yes. Did the
air-conditioning system work?  Yes, again.  Okay, so what was wrong with the
house?  Well, it needed lots of plastering, painting, yard work, and some
patching of the roof -- and yes, low-interest repair loans were available. 
Okay, sez I. If that's all that's wrong with it, just why are you selling a
3-bedroom house for all of $10,000? Well, squirms the agent, it's in kind of a
bad neighborhood. How bad? sez I, remembering some of the neighborhoods
I've seen in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>
and Oakland.  Worst in the city, the agent sighs,
and then he told me this amazing story.</p>

<p>Every few years, it seems, the big vice-gangs in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a> notice
that there's no gang presence in Phoenix -- which is just a quick
5-hour drive from LA -- and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary
there. Well, a couple years ago, the colonizing force came to this
neighborhood -- it being poor and Spanish, they figured they could move
right in and take over -- bought this house and started operations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, the neighbors not only didn't like this -- they
didn't care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night,
pimps soliciting their kids, dope-deals on the corners in broad
daylight, and so on -- they weren't afraid to do something about it.
The neighbors called the cops (for some reason, the Phoenix police are
remarkably honest, capable, polite and prompt), and the cops promptly
came and swept up all the whores, pimps and pushers off the street and
away to jail.</p>

<p>The remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the
fashion they usually use in LA; they got the complainant's name and
address off the court records, and did a drive-by shooting at his
house.  Well, this wasn't Los Angeles. The moment the neighbors heard
the first gunshots fired, they all ran out their front doors with their
own guns -- rifles, shotguns, pistols, everything -- and shot back.</p>

<p>The car didn't make it to the end of the block. It coasted to a
stop, riddled with more holes than the famous Bonnie and Clyde getaway
car (which I've seen; it's on display in a casino in a casino in Las
Vegas).  The gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured, so the car
caught fire. The neighbors waited a good 15 minutes -- making sure
nobody got out of that car -- before they called the fire department to
come put out the fire and tow the wreck away. By that time, the asphalt
under the car had melted and caught fire too, which subsequently left a
large and nasty pot-hole in the street. The city is slow about
repairing small streets, so the hole stayed there providing a traffic
hazard for several months. All this was two years ago, the agent
concluded, and there's been no trouble since, but the house and the
neighborhood still have a bad reputation -- and that's why the house
was so cheap.</p>

<p>Hearing this story, I nearly laughed my ass off. I told the agent
that if I had the money at the moment, I'd by-god buy the house; this
was nothing compared to bad neighborhoods I'd seen here in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>, where
drive-by shootings go unchecked by the well-armed
cops, let alone by the unarmed neighbors. If that's the absolute worst
you'll find in Phoenix, then that's the city for me.</p>

<p>That's the difference that an armed civilian population makes. Think about
it.</p>

<title>Waco Could Have Been Peaceful</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Waco Could Have Been Peaceful</h1>

<p>The BATF could have served a search warrant or arrest warrant on the
Branch Davidians without incident.</p>

<p>Many years earlier, an argument between Davidian leaders resulted in
guns being fired. Koresh and the Davidians cooperated with local police in
resolving the matter.</p>

<p>Had the BATF wanted to arrest Koresh, they could have easily done so
when Koresh took his daily jog, or went into town for errands. But the BATF
had no crimes with which to charge Koresh; they used a search warrant as the
pretext for their military raid.</p>

<p>David Koresh offered to have the BATF inspect his weapons to ensure
their legality. The BATF ignored his request, instead plotting a military
assault.</p>

<p>Koresh knew the BATF was planning to raid the Davidians, and said as much
to the BATF's undercover informant. Despite this knowledge, the BATF went
ahead with their military assault.</p>

<title>Gunfire at the Waco Raid</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 28, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Gunfire at the Waco Raid</h1>

<p>When BATF agents
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attacked the
Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas, on February 28, 1993, they
served a search warrant for unregistered firearms with a full-scale
military attack.</p>

<h2>Firing From Helicopters</h2>

<p>The BATF used three helicopters in their raid: two small observation
craft containing National Guard pilots and one BATF agent, and a
Blackhawk with a National Guard pilot and eight BATF agents. As
the helicopters were all military craft, firing from them would
be illegal under the Posse Comitatus law.</p>

<p>Among the documents given to Congress for its reports was a
handwritten note by a Treasury Department review official who had
interviewed BATF agents. The note read: "HCs [helicopters] as a diversion. 
Simultaneous gunfire. Worked in Seattle. Three to four hundred
meters from boundary. Hover. Practiced at Hood."</p>

<p>One of the BATF agents in the helicopters said during the
House hearings that the agents in the Blackhawk had their weapons
loaded, and had been told they could fire in self-defense.</p>

<p>While the helicopter pilots denied circling Mt. Carmel,
a television camera crew testified that they witnessed the helicopters
do so. Television video of the raid apparently show bullets hitting
the roof of the building from above.</p>

<p>The Davidians called 911 during the raid to request a ceasefire.
The callers say that the helicopters are firing on them. During
later negotiations, firing from the helicopters is one of the
points of which the Davidians complain most. Surviving Davidians
claim that there were over a hundred bullet holes in the roof.</p>

<h1>FBI Pressured Agent to Justify Violence</h1>

<p>"FBI agent at Waco says bureau pressured him on Koresh reports" in the
May 2, 1995 New York <cite>Times</cite> reports that the FBI agent in charge
of analyzing David Koresh and recommending a course of action was pressured by
superiors to justify a violent attack on the Davidians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peter Smerick, the FBI's lead criminal analyst and profiler of Koresh, has
broken his silence to charge that bureau officials pressured him into changing
his advice on how to resolve the situation without bloodshed.</p>

<p>Smerick, now retired from the bureau and working as a consultant in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a> area, said
he had counseled a cautious, non-confrontational approach
to Koresh in four memos written from Waco for senior FBI officials between
March 3 and March 8, 1993.</p>
   
<p>But he was pressured from above, Smerick says, as he was writing a fifth
memo March 9. As a result, that memo contained subtle changes in tone and
emphasis that amounted to an endorsement of a more aggressive approach against
the Davidians.</p>

<p>...</p>
   
<p>At the time of Waco, Smerick was a senior agent from the bureau's Behavioral
Science Center in Quantico, Va. He was in Waco from March 2 to March 17, the
standoff's crucial early period when the FBI's strategy was still evolving.</p>

<p>Smerick wrote psychological profiles of Koresh ... While pressure tactics
might work in typical hostage situations, Smerick advised, such a strategy when
dealing with a charismatic zealot like Koresh, "if carried to excess, could
eventually be counter-productive and could result in loss of life."</p>

<p>The warning was clear: Confront Koresh at your peril. But FBI officials not
only rejected this advice, they sought to get Smerick to change it.</p>

<p>Senior FBI officials had complained the first four memos counseling caution
"were tying their hands," Smerick said ... At that point, Smerick said, he
realized his viewpoint was being sanitized. "You don't have to be hit with a
two by four to get message they want their own input on memos coming up," he
said.</p>
   
<p>As a result, he adopted a get-tough approach in his March 9 memo and
downplayed caution. Since talks had met with limited success, the memo said,
"other measures" should be employed, such as turning utilities on and off,
moving agents and equipment outside the Davidians' house around suddenly and
cutting off negotiations.</p>
   
<p>Smerick said he left Waco in disgust after writing the fifth memo rather
than see his work compromised.</p>
   
<p>The following month the memo emerged as a key ingredient in the factors Reno
weighed in deciding to back the FBI's gas-insertion plan.</p>

<title>Waco Tapes</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 16 and 18, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Transcript of Waco Negotiations</h1>

<p>In July 1995, the Justice Department released tapes of negotiations
between David Koresh and the FBI during the 1993 Waco standoff.</p>

<p>Mark Swett (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="mailto:mswett@ime.net">mswett@ime.net</a>)
transcribed some of the last tape.</p>

<p>The tape has two segments. In the first, recorded in the early morning
hours of Friday, April 16, 1993, Koresh and Davidian Steve Schneider
discuss surrender terms with the FBI negotiator. In the second, recorded
on the afternoon of Sunday, April 18, 1993, Koresh is clearly upset over
what he considers provocative actions by the FBI.</p>

<hr>

<h2>April 16, 1993</h2>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  ... I say that when I get through writing these, and they're
given to my attorney, and my attorney hands them over -  What's the two
theologians names?</p>

<p><b>Steve Schneider</b>:  Ah -  Philip Arnold and Jim Tabor.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Philip Arnold and Jim Tabor who has shown that they have a
sincere interest in these things - you see?  Then I can spend all my time in
jail, and people can go ahead and ask me all the stupid questions they want
- cause they're not gonna ask me about the seals.  They're gonna say, "Ah, do
you molest young ladies?"  "Ah, have you eaten babies?"  "Do you sacrifice
people?"  "Ah, do you make automatic weapons?"  "Ah, do you have
[unintelligible]" That's what they're gonna be interested in -
sensationalism.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  That's why you need to get it done before you leave there then.

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That's why I'm gonna complete it, because you see, you know
as well as I do that people in this world they want something dramatic and
sensational.  They don't want to have to sit -  No one's gonna sit there -
and let me sit there in front of a camera and read Psalms 40 to them - to
prove the first seal.  Dick, it's a real world, and that's why I'm sympathetic
with your position.  I realize you're frustrated, and I agree with you.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I'm not frustrated.  I went home and I'm back.  I'm no longer
frustrated.  I never was frustrated.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Did you take a shower for me?</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, yeah.  I took a couple of them for you.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Thank you.  I appreciate it.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Now listen.  Let's get back to the point in hand.  This ah
- you know - the writing of the seals.  OK. You've got to do that in there,
and it's gonna take you x  amount of time.  But -  just tell me this David
- are you saying that when you finish that manuscript -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Then I'm not bound any longer [unintelligible] -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  No. But see, that doesn't answer the question.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Then I'll be out - yes - definitely.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I know you'll be out, but that could - excuse me I've got a
cold.  That could mean a lot of things David.  That could mean -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I'll be in custody in the jailhouse.  You can come down
there and feed me bananas if you want.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I know - I know that some point in time that's true.  But I'm
getting from you - I'm asking you, "When that is finished, are you than
telling me that you are coming out the next day, or two hours after you send
that out or what?"</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Oh, I'll probably - when I - when I bring it out - see -
my attorney is gonna get the  - get to the copy.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Right.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  OK?  And as soon as he hands it over to the scholars - the
theologians - right?</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b> That's when - he's gonna come back, and that's when I'm going
to go out with him, because he said point blank that - you know - one of the
guarantees of me arriving down there is that he is gonna go with me.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  So you go on paper here and said that David Koresh told me
that as soon as he finishes this manuscript - the seven seals - of which
you've finished the first chapter dealing with the first seal -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  The first seal - right.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  That you're gonna make that available -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I'll be splitting out of this place.  I'm so sick of
MRE's -  Dick - that ah -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I just want to make sure that I have this right - that
you're coming out.  As soon as that's finished -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That's what - it was said by the attorney's -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I know - I know.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That's what I'm saying -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  OK.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  It's clarified.  Lock, stock, and barrel it.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I mean - I've heard you say that you're coming out after, but
that is not specific.  You know - that's a game that we all can play.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  It's - look, I know.  Dick -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  But I'm asking you for your word.  You say that you're coming
out as soon as that's done, and you give up the manuscript to DeGuerin who
is gonna make copies available for Arnold and the other - the other fella - </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Right.</p>


<p><b>FBI:</b>  The other Biblical scholar, and then you are coming out with
that manuscript.</p>


<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I'm outta here.  And he's he's gonna come, and the way the
procession is to be -  I'm to go out first with him, and then I think, "You're
last, right Steve?"</p>

<p><b>Steve Schneider:</b>  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  With his attorney, and the other people - the other people
in between.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  OK.  Then -  you know what?  I'm keeping you from getting back
to work.  So I'm - you know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna let you go so that
you can get back to work, because David, frankly I'm eagerly awaiting this
manuscript.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Well, I'll tell you what. It's gonna blow your socks off.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b> Well - I'm - I'm perfectly willing to - to read it, and I'm
looking forward to it as a member -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You'll either hate me or love me then.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I want to read it - and then - I'll - you know - make a
decision then, and we'll see how it goes.  And in the meantime,  ah - you know
- let's get that thing written.</p>

<hr>

<h2>April 16, 1993 - Part II</h2>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Now are you telling me David - I want to get this clear in my
own mind.  Are you telling me here and now that as soon as you reduce the
seven seals to a written form that you're coming out of there.  I don't mean
two days later -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I have no reason - I have no reason to -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I know what you're saying, but answer my question if you would
please - definitely.  I mean - I want to get an answer to this, "Are you
coming out as soon as your done -"</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I'm coming out.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Or are you coming out afterwards at some point in time.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  After I get the thing - see Dick, you don't seem to
understand.  We are going to fulfill our commitment to God.  Now, if you would
allow me to show you what has been pre-written by the prophets you would know
what I am doing.  </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I'm asking you -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You see -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  A simple question though. I -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  And I'm giving you the simple answer.  Yes. Yes. Yes.  I
never intended to die in here.</p>

<hr>

<h2>April 18, 1993</h2>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  This is Henry.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Ah -  Henry, this is Dave.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Hi Dave.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Look.  The ah - the generals out here - right?  You have a
hard time controlling them, right?</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I don't control them.  No.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  OK.  Well look.  We have done everything we can to be able
to communicate in a nice, passionate way.  We've ah - you know - I've told you
what our work with God is.  And ah - we've been kind.  We've not been your
everyday kind of cult.  We've not been your everyday kind of terrorist which
I'm sure you - you're familiar with having to deal with.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  And a lot of the things that the FBI, or these generals are
doing is just kinda way beyond the scope of reason.  And they're not only
destroying private property,  they're also removing evidences.  And this
doesn't seem like that ah - these are - these are moves that should be made
by a government who says to a people that we're going to be able to take this
up in a court of law.  I mean - they're not ever - they're not going to be
able to replace a lot of things here.  Like that 68 SS El Camino that belonged
to Paul Fatta?</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  They'll never be able to replace that.  They don't have any
more of those.  And ah - the 68 Camaro and other things out here in the
front.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  They can't replace that.  They just can't replace it.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  And - ah - they keep - they keep doing these kind of things
it's just proving to us that they're not - they're not showing good faith in
their part, and I just - I just suggest they shouldn't do it.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I understand what you're saying, and I will impart that ah -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  In all courtesy's please - please impart that, because -
because it's coming to the point to where ah - you know - God in heaven has
somewhat to do also.  And it's just really coming to the point of really,
"What - What do you men really want?"</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I think what - you know - just - this is - I'm just imparting
to you what my perception is.  And my perception is that - that - what they
want is they want you and everybody to come out.  You know - I -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I don't think so.  I think what they're showing is that they
don't want that.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I think that - that is exactly what they want.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  No.  They're not gonna - they're not gonna - they're not
gonna get that.  They're not gonna get that by what they're doing right now.
They're gonna get exactly the opposite - exactly the opposite.  They're gonna
get wrath on certain people.  They're gonna get anger from certain guys.  Now
I can't control everybody here.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I think you can.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  No.  I can't.  You gotta understand John -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Henry.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Henry - I'm sorry.  In 1985, I presented a truth.  And
everybody that's here - I had to debate and I had to talk to, and I had show
from the scriptures.  I had to prove my point for many hours, days, months,
and sometimes years with certain people here.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  They went to scholars.  They went to theologians.  I have a
very unique group here.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Yes.  You do.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Not ignorant people - not stupid people.  Now there are
some people - that in the beginning - that went out like Kevin and Brad. 
Individuals that were - you know - people that were out there -  bar rollers
and stuff like that.  Rough and tough guys.  Now they're not - they're not
the theologians of the world, but they're guys that need a lot of patience,
and - you know - with a little bit of refinement and a little bit of proof
to them - they can - they can be good people.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Um, hm.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  But ah - but I would really and in all honesty and in good
faith tell these generals to ah - to - to back up.  They don't need to tear
up anymore of this property.  You tell us out of one side of the mouth, we're
going to be able to come back here and all this.  And ah - you know - we're
gonna take this up in court,  and on the other hand you're showing us there's
not gonna be nothing to come back to.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I think the problem with this thing David is that this thing
has lasted way too long.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Oh, it - it - it has.  It should have never gotten started
this way -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  You're right.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  And that was not our fault.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Ok.  But -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Now you don't wish to speak to the issues of the beginning
of this -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  No. I don't.  And - and what the issues were - you know at
that time is something else.  The problem is not what the issues were at
that time - the problem is this has lasted way too long.  You know -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b> I'm gonna finish my book or I'm not gonna finish my book.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I hope that you do.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Well, let me tell you this.   These men who everyday we try
to show them good faith. They've walked out in front of us, they've driven
their tanks up to us, they've bust in the side of the building a little bit
one time.  You said that was a mistake - it was not in your control - that
wasn't in the commander's wishes.  You know -  all of this has been shown
that if these guys want to fight - Now I don't want to fight.   I -  I want
- I'm a life too, and there's a lot of people in here that are lives.  There's
children in here.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  That's right.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  And we're also Americans.  And  I think - I think that
America has a patronage - a very clear patronage of individual citizens who
- who - who - who have a breaking point.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, that's true.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Now if the government is gotten this stronger - it can come
on to something that we have worked for hard.  We worked when we got on this
property.  A lot of hard hours.  This place was a dump.  We fixed it up. We
built this little house here.  It's not extravagant.  You know - there's a lot
of people here with a high commission and a lot of love and concern, not just
for our own lives, but for everybody's life.  And if this is the way our
government is showing the world that its tactics are to get someone to - to
- to - to - to do as they wish when realistically, our - our  rights have been
infringed upon right and left.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  But there's a way to resolve that David.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Yes.  Yes. </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And the way to resolve it is for you to come out and lead your
people out.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Your way - your way is that you're gonna keep - you're
gonna keep destroying our property.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  This - this probably would not have had to happen -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  It never did have to happen.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  That's right.  And -  and then - you know - if you would have
come out on - on the day that you indicated that you promised that you were
gonna come out none of this would have taken place.  </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Look. You denounce the fact that I have a God that
communicates with me.  That's - that's the first mistake that we - that
we make.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Nobody - nobody - nobody is saying anything about your
religious beliefs, your thoughts. your ideas -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Listen.  But you are -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Or anything like that.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You're  - you're saying -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  The same things that you can do there you could do out - out 
here.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That's what you say.  I - I think that you are lying.  As
a matter of fact, I know that when  the first month or so that I'm out, I'm
gonna be bombarded all of the time with nothing but people wanting to know
Koresh - asking this - asking that.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And if you were working on the seven seals - I mean - nobody
would bother you.  I mean - why would you - why would that have to happen?</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I have my responsibility also you know.  Come on, look at
the reality of things. </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And the reality of things is that there are priorities.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  OK.  But you put your priorities  -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And you're priority and everybody's priority should be in the
safety of the children -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  All right.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And the safety of the women, and the safety of everybody</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You're fixing - you are fixing to ruin - your commanders
are fixing to ruin the safety of my and my children.  My life - the lives of
my wives - the lives of my friends - my family.  You're fixing to step across
the ribbon.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I think that - that was something that you brought on. It has
nothing to do with the commanders, David.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  All right.  I brought on - if this - if this is the corner
of the box that you place me into -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I think that you're placing yourself in that David.  I don't
think anybody is forcing it -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  No.  No. You're the one who moving forward.  You're the
one who - who has violated - your generals have violated our constitutional
rights.  You have made us guilty before proving so. </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You actively brought a band of - of - of  people who didn't
announce themselves.  They came - I was at the front door.  I was willing to
talk to them.  They shot at me first.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  See, now you're talking about  - you're talking about the
ATF.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  About something that you don't want to prove as a matter
of a fact.  You're telling me -  now you've - now you telling me that I am
under arrest.  I have to come out and I -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  When somebody's under arrest that doesn't mean that it - that
you've already been proven guilty.  It just means that you've been charged.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  No.  I'm being punished. We've already been punished. 
We've been placed in jail.  We're being punished as guilty.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, that is something that you chose for everybody
inside.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That is not correct.  </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Sure it is because -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That is something that you chose as a confinement.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Because if you had walked out on that day as you promised, by
now who knows where we would have been   You know - you probably would be out
on bail for God sakes.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  John - all I can say is - is that if you want to - to - to 
place this in the history books as one of the saddest days in the world -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, I think that the - the - the rules for your safety still
apply.  There's no reason - you know - to think that - that - that they
shouldn't apply.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  OK.  I understand your rules.  I'm just simply asking you
in all good faith, and all good manner to - you tell the general it's enough
to tear up our property.  </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I will tell them exactly what you said.  But you need to
understand that - um - I'm talking up.  It's not - you know - talking down. 
So - you know -  what I suggest and what I will suggest is exactly what you
said. I've suggested that and I've suggested other things.  I have no - no
problem in - ah - you know - </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You tell em we love em.  We love em and - you know -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And you're willing to send out thirty people.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Look.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>   Fifty?</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Whoever wants to go out can go out.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  No.  No.  No.  No.   Don't tell me - don't tell me that.  Tell
me that you're sending somebody out.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I'm not going to -  you don't - see - you don't understand
about these people yet.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And you don't understand about the people here yet either.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  OK.  Well if that's the way we want to play then we come
to a point where -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  I'm not wanting to play anything -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  But it - you are playing.  </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  No.  I'm not.  I'm telling you.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Everyone in the tanks - everyone in the tanks out there is
playing.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  No.  Nobody is.  People just want to see some progress.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Look some progress is being made.  You don't realize what
kind of progress is being made. There are people  all over this world who are
going to benefit from this book of the seven seals.  You don't seem to
understand.  </p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And what you don't seem to understand is  - is that the people
here want to see that kind of progress, but other kind of progress.  There's
no reason why you couldn't be doing the same very thing that you are doing
now within the place out here.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That's not true.  What you're saying is not based on
truth.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Why not?  Why not?  What do you mean it's not  -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Because it's just not.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b> Your attorney is gonna be your attorney whether you're in there
or out here.  Anything that you want your - all you - all you'd have to
do is - is furnish it to him. </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  An attorney -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Why would he not comply with your wishes?</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  That's - the legal system is not the majority of the
attorney.  The legal system is a completely sophisticated - lots of  - lots
of Indian chief - ah -system.  It's not just where you got one guy who is
hired to speak in your behalf in a court case in front of a jury.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Yes.  But - but what I'm saying -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  There's more to it than just - I was in jail in 1988.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And  - and how did it come out?</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  It came out wonderful, because -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, there you go.  There you go. </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Well the thing of it is - is that you don't understand the
amount of cost it takes to get that legal representation too.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  And this was something - this was something that the
Sheriff's department got us in.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well, that was - that was then.  You have an attorney now. 
You know - the same work that you're doing there you can be doing out here.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  It's a different more high profile case type situation.  I
just - I just suggest that it - it would be a very bad thing for you to - to
keep destroying all this evidence out here.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Well - you - know - I really don't have any control over
that.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  I mean what are they doing?  Are they - are you covering
up the ATF?  That's exactly what it appears you're doing.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  David, what we're trying to do is were trying -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  It's wrong!  You're doing wrong before God - before man. 
You are doing wrong!  You adding to your wrong.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  David, you're the one that's doing wrong. </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  You seem to have -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  No.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  No concern about -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You know we can't stay in here forever.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  Anybody within the place except yourself.  </p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You know that we can't stay in here forever.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  You know -  if you could send - OK.  Well send fifty people
out.  Send fifty people out right now.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  Does fifty of you want to go out?</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  You don't have to ask.  All you have to do is say, "Look, I
want fifty volunteers," and they'll come out.  If you send fifty people out.</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  They're saying because of these things they want to stay
the more.</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  And I guess that you have no control over anybody.  You
know -</p>

<p><b>Koresh:</b>  You've got to understand, what I have control -</p>

<p><b>FBI:</b>  This is your responsibility.  This is your responsibility
because you're the leader.  Their safety is in your hands.  These people
look -</p>

<h1>Davidians Not Suicidal</h1>

<p>The FBI's claim that the Branch Davidians were a suicidal cult bent on
destroying themselves was just another one of the FBI's lies.</p>

<p>As reported in the San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite>, David Koresh
"was in high spirits about surrendering" just three days before the final
FBI assault, which culminated in a murderous fire.</p>

<p>The Justice Department finally made available in July 1995 over 15,000
pages of the FBI's transcripts of conversations between Koresh and
negotiators.  When asked whether he would surrender after completing
his manuscript on the Seven Seals, Koresh said, "I'm giving you the simple
answer. Yes, yes, yes. I never intended to die in here."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Koresh, the FBI did intend for him to die in there. The
Davidians had killed four BATF agents. Further, the Davidians' living
quarters probably held evidence of illegal activity by federal agents, such
as firing from helicopters and firing without provocation. From the BATF/FBI
viewpoint, the Davidians had to die and the evidence had to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The July 22, 1995 <cite>Examiner</cite> reported that transcripts showed
Koresh believed the FBI wanted a violent end. Koresh was also concerned about
what the FBI had done with cars removed from the Davidians' property. The
FBI's characterization of Koresh as a suicidal maniac does not fit well with
their transcripts of Koresh's conversations.</p>

<title>CS Gas Used Against Davidians</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FBI/BATF Use Lethal CS Gas Against Davidians</h1>

<p>The "tear gas" used by the FBI in the final assault against the Branch
Davidians in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, was actually
CS gas, an inflammable nerve gas
banned for use in combat by international law.</p>

<p>Death certificates for Branch Davidians who died in the April 19, 1993
fire indicate lethal levels of cyanide in the Davidian's blood, but none
in their digestive systems, suggesting inhalation. The CS powder used to
make CS gas is very high in cyanide content, according to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>On the day of the fire, from about 6 a.m. until noon, the FBI fired 
more than four hundred 40mm artillery shells containing CS 
powder through the walls and all windows of the Mr. Carmel Center.  
During this time, it also pumped CS powder from military tanks into 
the building.</p>

<p>The technical data also states CS powder will ignite at 327 F and once 
ignited will burn at temperatures as high as 4,200 F, causing it to 
function as a high-temperature fire accelerant.</p>

<p>Fire trucks were deliberately kept away until the building -- for at
least 26 minutes -- after the fire broke out.</p>

<title>The Waco Fire Coverup</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Waco Fire Coverup</h1>

<p>On April 19, 1993, the U.S. government's
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attack on the
Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas ended with a lethal fire.</p>

<p>The Justice Department's line (Justice Department report, p. 329.) is that
the Texas Rangers assembled a team of independent fire investigators headed by
Paul Gray, who issued the report blaming the Davidians for the fire.</p>

<p>Refuting this lie at the surviving Davidians' trial, Capt. David Byrnes,
head of the Texas Rangers investigation, testified that the U.S. Attorneys
office, not Texas Rangers, appointed Paul Gray head of fire investigation team.
(Trial transcript, pgs. 5811, 5816, 5834.)</p>

<p>Paul Gray, far from being independent, served as a member of BATF's National
Arson Response Team, identified himself as a special agent of ATF, and taught
classes for BATF agents. His wife was a secretary in BATF's
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
 office, and
they were friends with one of the BATF agents killed in the initial Mt. Carmel
raid.</p>

<p>The investigative team certainly did not show much independence. They did
not interview survivors of the fire. Gray actually withheld evidence from the
team, particularly infrared evidence of fire beginning in the Mt. Carmel
gymnasium, FBI logs reporting fire in the gymnasium immediately after a tank
crushed it, and manufacturers' warnings that the CS gas used by the FBI is
inflammable. (Trial transcript, pgs. 5836-37, 5847, 5859-62, 5869.)</p>

<h1>Prosecutors Display Davidian's Guns During Trial</h1>

<p>Excerpts from the January 14, 1994
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>
<cite>American-Statesman</cite>, pp.  B1 & B5:</p>

<p> PROSECUTORS DISPLAY GUNS FROM CULT<br>
Defense wins acknowledgment that none was illegal</p>

<p> Under cross-examination, defense attorneys drew acknowledgments from several
of the Rangers that none of the guns presented as evidence was illegal to
possess and that most of the grenades were empty shells.</p>

<p> "These are rifles you can buy at a pawn shop or gun show, are they not?"
defense attorney Mike DeGuerin asked Turner.  "You didn't intend to leave some
sort of impression with the jury that there is anything illegal about (the
guns)?"</p>

<p> Defense attorneys also repeatedly steered the Rangers toward other evidence
uncovered in and around the compound, including tricycles, rings, a library
card, diplomas, Bibles and other religious literature.</p>

<p> DeGuerin also quizzed Coffman on whether tear gas used to try and force cult
members from seeped into the bunker.  Some bodies were covered in wet
blankets, bedrolls and towels in an apparent effort for protection.</p>

<p> "All I smelled was rotten bodies," he said.  "It was a horrible smell."</p>

<title>ATF Planned Waco Assault</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Date: January 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Davidian Trial Reveals ATF Planned Lethal Military Assault</h1>

<p>July 1994, from Egon Richard Tausch (court observer):</p>

<p> The surviving Branch Davidians had to overcome crippling handicaps in their
murder and conspiracy trial, one year after the bloody attack, siege, and final
assault on their communal home.</p>

<p> At the last, they prevailed. The result was anything but
foreordained. The trial, however, seemed to be over before it
started. In a virtually unprecedented move, U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith decided to choose an initial jury panel of 84, which
he personally selected out of an original "jury wheel" of 300,
basing his selections entirely on answers supplied by the
potential jurors to a lengthy questionnaire concerning their 
attitudes toward gun control, religion, government, and federal
agencies.</p>

<p> Judge Smith overruled separate trials for several defendants,
increasing the chance of conflicting, and therefore ineffectual,
defenses.</p>

<p> Almost half of the subpoenas for witnesses requested by the
defense were refused by the court, some on the flimsiest grounds
or no grounds at all.</p>

<p> Finally, throughout the evidentiary portion of the trial, the
court refused to permit any direct or indirect hint of the issue
of self-defense on the Davidians' part -- neither in cross-
examination of prosecution witnesses, nor in testimony or other
evidence put on by the defense.</p>

<p> The judge regularly sustained prosecution objections whenever
defense questions could be interpreted as leading toward
governmental misconduct.</p>

<p> This broad prohibition ruled out issues about the sufficiency  of
the notorious affidavit "supporting" the ATF warrants; the
legality of the warrants themselves; the requirements for service
and execution of a warrant; the use of the words "assault" or 
"attack" in reference to ATF actions; discussion of the Davidians 
killed by the ATF agents; or any use of the Treasury or FBI reports.</p>

<p> It also made putting any of the defendants themselves on the
witness stand a futile and dangerous exercise. The only questions
they could have been asked, after giving up their right to
silence, hostile ones.</p>

<p> That appeared to leave only two possible defenses: The four dead
ATF agents were actually not killed by anyone but died of natural
causes, or the Davidians weren't there at the time.</p>

<p> For that matter, the latter defense wouldn't have been much 
good, either; the second-most serious charge was "conspiracy to
commit murder," which charge didn't require the defendants'
presence at Mt. Carmel. Nor did the lesser charges. In fact, four
of the eleven defendants were elsewhere, during the bloody battle
in which six Davidians and four ATF agents died.</p>

<p> All of these matters were decided, as legal issues routinely are,
outside the hearing of the jury.</p>

<p> The defense did win a few. Prosecution witnesses avoided using
the prejudicial words "cult" and "compound" -- the latter a
military-sounding term never used by the inhabitants of Mt.
Carmel -- for almost half of the trial.</p>

<p> As for, the "sniper tower," or "watch tower," at Mt. Carmel,
which the ATF and FBI had repeatedly labeled and pointed out to
America's television viewers, the court instructed that it be
identified as the only thing it had ever been used for: a huge
water-storage tank on which the 100-200 inhabitants relied for 
drinking and sanitation.</p>

<p> And the defense did have one major legal break which no court or
ruling could seem to get around: The presumption of innocence.
Therefore the Government had the burden of putting on at least
some evidence. This disadvantage proved to be the prosecution's undoing.</p>

<p> Emotional or inattentive jurors certainly observed an impressive
government case: weapons parts found in the ashes of the burned
Davidian center; clean-cut, articulate agents describing their
"attempt to execute a warrant" and grieving over fallen comrades;
one ATF medic's courage; a horrific account of a grievously
wounded agent who lay conscious but unattended for two hours.
Kathy Schroeder's chilling description of David Koresh's on-
again-off-again ideas for a mass suicide after the battle.
The early testimony by Texas Rangers about the weapons and
weapons-parts found in the ashes of Mt. Carmel apparently had a
strong effect on the out-of-state media. The prosecutors
obligingly posted pre-printed lists all over the press room, to
horrified comments by Eastern reporters who weren't sure of the
difference between a bolt-action .22 rifle and a fully-automatic
AK-47, but were sure they were all utterly evil and must be
illegal, and what more would jurors need to know for guilty
verdicts on all counts?  </p>

<p> The U. S. Attorneys, however, had to take a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> jury into
account, and soon gave up trying for shock value in the
courtroom, especially since the Ranger witnesses were visibly
uncomfortable testifying as involuntary federal "deputies."
Of course, due to the pre-trial rules, the Rangers were no more
free to be questioned about ATF actions than they had been free
to investigate them independently at the time. They were
deputized by the feds, probably illegally, at the very beginning
of their investigation during the siege of Mt. Carmel.
Unfortunately for the prosecution, their case could not be
presented without multitudes of still and videotaped scenes of
the February 28, 1993, ATF approach and massive assault on Mt.  Carmel.</p>

<p> For no readily discernable reason, the lengthy last part of the
prosecution's case concerned the final, fiery attack by the FBI
on April 19. This was irrelevant to the murder charges and could
not only have the most tenuous connection with the conspiracy or
other charges. It could have swayed jury sympathy in either direction.</p>

<p> Despite many attempts, the prosecution failed to establish
conclusively which side started the fire -- Davidians or FBI
tanks smashing through kerosene lamps, candles, and large
quantities of fuel during a windstorm. </p>

<p> The jury listened to edited parts of a tape-recording from hidden
microphones inside Mt. Carmel during the final attack and fire of
April 19. These consisted of sounds of static during which one
could faintly hear a voice or saying "fire." A government expert
testified that through electronic enhancement, he reconstructed
some clearly incriminating comments, even if the jury couldn't
hear them. There was no mention of when, how, by whom, or under
what authority the Davidians' home had been so extensively bugged
before the raid.</p>

<p> The prosecution failed also to establish which side fired its
weapons first during the ATF raid on February 28. Indeed, it
seemed to be afraid of the issue. All of Mt. Carmel's windows
were shut at the moment of the ATF's arrival, and none of the
people glimpsed inside or outside was visibly armed.</p>

<p> The position that the ATF was "attempting to serve a warrant" 
fell apart when, during cross-examination, agent after agent
denied that he had a warrant, or knew of anyone who had one, or
ever  announced one, or heard anyone else announce one, or ever
had any orders to do anything but shoot at  windows, walls, and
people, scale ladders and smash into rooms, throw concussion
grenades, or other warlike activities.</p>

<p> The prosecution did not choose to call the ATF leaders, on the
stand, and the defense was prohibited from doing so.</p>

<p> Only Roland Ballesteros, the first agent to testify, claimed he
shouted out that the raiders were ATF and that they had a war-
rant. He stated he made this announcement before any shooting
started, while he ran, weapon pointed, toward David Koresh, who
was standing unarmed at the front doors with two other unarmed
Davidians behind him. "He responded, 'What's going on?'"  </p>

<p> Ballesteros then added that Koresh closed the doors with a
"smirk" and fired at him through them. Since this was at the time
of Koresh's wounding, Ballesteros was asked how he know it was
Koresh firing out, not agents firing in. The Agent replied that
he could see the "wood or plywood" chips flying away from the
bullet-holes.</p>

<p> In cross examination, the defense attorney mildly pointed out
that the doors were made entirely of thin metal. The agent
reluctantly admitted this. (The bullet-scarred door in question
had mysteriously disappeared after the initial investigation.)
Almost as an afterthought, the defense elicited agent
Ballesteros' admission that in the several previous official
statements he had made since that bloody day he had confessed to
lying in a shallow ditch at the time. Never before had he
mentioned shouting anything or seeing anything, other than a dog
killed at the edge of the ditch, in the first shots he heard,
which came from the ATF "dog team." The prosecutors promptly got
Ballesteros off the stand and replaced him with more credible agents.)</p>

<p> Most telling was the ATF agents' descriptions, under cross-
examination, of their intensive training for the raid, coached by
Green Berets at Fort Hood. They admitted that they staged "about
15 or 20" practice raids on a mock Mt. Carmel, and that in each
raid the orders and outcome were the same: a military assault
from several directions at once, constant firing, scaling of
ladders, smashing of windows with crowbars, throwing concussion
grenades in them, then "securing" the rooms by killing or
capturing the inhabitants.</p>

<p> None of the practice-sessions involved the required policy of
"Knock and Announce."  </p>

<p> Neither then nor in the raid itself did any agent witness ever
learn who was to have or announce warrants, or approach the front
doors, or who or how many Davidians were to be arrested, or what
items were to be searched for. These details did not seem of much
interest to them, and they were unprepared for such questions.  
As one team-leader, Agent Kenny King, testified, his team's
orders were to scale his ladder and smash into the building, and
his orders had never called for any announcement of identity or
purpose, or allowed any discretion or change, whatever happened
elsewhere -- "even if the Davidians had all greeted the agents
outside, with their hands up and a big sign reading, 'Welcome ATF'."</p>

<p> In order to implicate three defendants in having said they shot
agents, the prosecutors put on the videotaped deposition of
Davidian  Marjorie Thomas, who had been given immunity from
prosecution. She nevertheless repeatedly told U.S. Attorney Ray
Jahn that there was no conspiracy to kill agents. At Jahn's
question as to what would have happened had the agents just come
to the door and walked in, she said, "We wouldn't do anything."
This seems to have been a case of the prosecutor's asking his own
witness a few too many questions.</p>

<p> When Kathy Schroeder took the stand, as the government's long
anticipated "star witness," her obvious continued affection for
the defendants, and her statement that "our conspiracy was only
to defend ourselves when attacked" did little to help the
prosecution's case.</p>

<p> After the prosecution rested and the jury was sent out, the
defense again requested that it be permitted to try to establish
self-defense.</p>

<p> The defendant's motion was again denied.</p>

<p> This left defense counsel with few witnesses and little evidence
of their own. The defense first put on part of a tape of the 911
phone call made by Davidian Wayne Martin during the first few
minutes of the ATF attack. He frantically reported that ATF
agents were shooting at men, women, and children, and pleaded,
"Call it off!" Several other desperate 911 calls were placed from
Mt. Carmel, but Judge Smith ruled that "90 per cent" of the taped
pleas were "irrelevant" and inadmissible.</p>

<p> Retired Colonel and Vietnam veteran Jack Zimmerman, now a lawyer,
had been at Mt. Carmel for a time during the siege, to represent
some of the Davidians, and had entered and examined the building
on two occasions. He testified as to bullet-holes in the highest
part of the roof, coming into the building. He added that they
could not have been fired from the water tower or from anywhere
but the sky, contrary to the testimony of helicopter pilots who
had, during the government's case, denied any firing at all (but
could not satisfactorily explain why the helicopters were each
carrying "eight or ten" ATF agents each throughout their mission
over Mt. Carmel). </p>

<p> Col. Zimmerman also explained to the jury that it was not
"tear gas" which was used in the FBI attack, but CS gas, a mucous,
tissue and lung agent with far more serious an lasting effects,
and outlawed for use in combat.  </p>

<p> The prosecution attempted to portray Col. Zimmerman as an ardent
admirer of the Davidians' religious beliefs, which he denied. 
After repeated forays, the prosecutor demanded to know what his
religion was. Zimmerman answered that he was Jewish, and that his
spoken defense of the Davidians' faith was at the invitation of
his synagogue.</p>

<p> Col. Zimmerman's testimony might have caused the jurors to
notice, if they hadn't before, the wide diversity among the
defendants. Anglo-Saxon males, blacks, Mexican-Americans, an
Italian American, <a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a>
subjects, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australian</a> citizens, a woman,
elderly people and young people. Mt. Carmel was apparently a
multiculturalist's dream, with all races, nationalities, and ages
living in harmony. Of course, they were religious and owned guns,
which made them a PC nightmare, instead.</p>

<p> Although the press had listened quietly and almost reverentially
to the prosecution's witnesses, the defense witnesses were
drowned out by boos, hoots, and derisive laughter. The large room
took on the appearance of an ill-natured high school pep-rally,
with applause reserved for the judge whenever he sustained a
prosecutor's objection.  </p>

<p> There were, to be sure, a few reporters whose sympathies were
with the defense. Rod Norberg, representing an obscure
constitutionalist publication, was quietly ordered out of the
courtroom, handcuffed in the hall, and taken to jail on a traffic
warrant for a ticket which was on appeal, the only instance of
such a warrant provoking a manhunt in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>. A local lady
from the Libertarian Party was removed from the courtroom and
ordered never to return due to alleged "sleepiness." Apparently
strict coat-and-tie rules among spectators did not keep out all
the riff-raff.</p>

<p> Then the defense attorneys rested after only a day and a half of
presenting their case. Both sides closed.  </p>

<p> The major surprise was that in his 60-page charge to the jury
Judge Smith finally permitted the defendants to argue self-
defense, now that it was too late to present witnesses or
evidence, or to cross-examine or re-call prosecution witnesses. 
The consensus of the rumor mill was that the judge was, at the
tail-end of the trial, persuaded of the defendants' innocence.
U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston spent his two hours in what could
most charitably be described as avoiding mention of any evidence
whatsoever.  He alternated between calling the defendants and all
Davidians "cowards" and "snivelling cowards," even when
describing deeds that, if done by people of whom he approved,
would have been recognized at once as heroic.</p>

<p> Johnston's greatest fury was reserved for the defense attorneys,
some of whom were court-appointed, none of whom had been paid,
and some of whom were supporting defendants and their families by
supplying their clothing and upkeep -- including housing them in
their own homes -- as "hyenas."  </p>

<p> Perhaps this last epithet was his worst mistake, because the
defense attorneys, each in turn, came forward with some of the
angriest (yet well-reasoned and spoken) closing arguments on
record. Most referred to the U.S. attorney's "hyenas" remark,
responding in a variations of "We have to consider the source."
Rocket Rosen patiently recounted each witness and piece of
evidence, on each charge, concluding that none proved the
charges, and most proved self-defense from a government agency
dangerously out of control. "A conspiracy to defend oneself from
unlawful attack is not a criminal conspiracy."  </p>

<p> Mike DeGuerin gave a rousing patriotic speech centered on the
idea that this trial was about "respect," and whether the federal
government still had any for individual rights, the American
people, or the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p> Dan Cogdell gave the most memorable closing arguments, with his
Amarillo English and down-home phrases. Were the Davidians
"cowards"?  Looking down the barrel of a hostile tank "would
scare the gorilla snot" out of anyone. He reminded the jury that
the Davidians were attacked in their home and their church, not a
"compound." </p>

<p> He also contrasted the methods of the federal ATF and the Texas
Rangers with the famed remark by one of the latter when he
arrived alone to quell a massive disturbance: "One riot, one Ranger".  </p>

<p> As his finale, Cogdell listed each of the euphemisms used by the
prosecution. They were not ATF concussion grenades, but
"diversionary devices", not tank-tracks but "ground
disturbances;" not ATF snipers, but "forward observers;" not
tanks but "armored mobile units;" not an attack, but a "dynamic
entry;" not the bloodiest assault on American civilians in
history, but the "execution of a warrant."</p>

<p> The prosecution's final two-hour close would have been an
anticlimax but for a disastrous mistake by U.S. Attorney Ray
Jahn, when, trying again to lessen the importance to the jury of
the concussion grenades, he implied that the defense witness who
had her arm blown off by one was faking the seriousness of the
injury, adding that she could still hold the microphone in the
courtroom. From that point the jury refused to look in his direction.  </p>

<p> After only 18 hours of deliberations (including the several hours
necessary to study the judge's charge to the jury), following a
six-week trial, the jury came back with "not guilty" verdicts for
all 11 defendants on the murder and conspiracy to murder charges,
convictions of five defendants for voluntary manslaughter, a few
convictions for using firearms in the commission of a violent
crime (which convictions were dismissed by the judge because
those defendants had not been found guilty of any violent crimes)
and seven weapons possession convictions.</p>

<p> One juror stated to the San Antonio <cite>Express-News</cite>,
"When we heard all that testimony, there was no way we could find them
guilty of murder." He added that "We felt provocation was pretty evident. 
When the firestorm started, everybody was trying to cover their
behinds...I thought two agents in plain clothes should have gone
in there and knocked on the door (to issue warrants)".</p>

<p> Long after the verdict, the national media were still
referring to the government's "bungled attempt to serve a
warrant." If anything at all was proven during this trial, and
proven beyond a reasonable or unreasonable doubt, it is that
there was no attempt to serve a warrant. There was a thoroughly
planned and rehearsed military assault and campaign against a
group of civilians, some of whom were suspected of secretly
possessing illegal weapons parts, which campaign was efficient
enough to rack up a kill-ratio which would be envied by any army
in history.</p>

<p> Did the government's trial fail because of incompetent
prosecutors, brilliant defense attorneys, legal technicalities,
strange Texas jurors, insufficient investigation, bad luck?  Or
because of lack of merit in the charges?  Probably the latter.  </p>

<p> But a major problem evident to the jurors and spectators
throughout the prosecutors' case was the shocking arrogance of
the federal government and its contempt for the American people. 
This contempt was clear to many citizens during the events a year
ago and the blatant lying at the time and since; it was clear in
the surprise the government felt at civilian self-defense or
resistance of any sort; it was clear in the prosecutors' choices
of defendants and charges; it was clear in the conduct of the
trial; it was clear in the prosecutors' belief that the jury
would swallow anything and was incapable of coherent, logical
thought. And it is clearer, after the trial, in the vindictive
actions and remarks of outraged federal officials.</p>

<p> The site of Mt. Carmel near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>
is quickly becoming a major
tourist attraction.
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a> engineer
Ilias Abdonlline told the
Express-News reporter in Waco that he had come directly from
Moscow just to see the site. "Everyone in the world was amazed
when this thing happened, but especially when it happened in
America," he said. "We have a terrible history with Stalin in
Russia, and I have a memory with that. When I saw this on
television, I was shocked. How could it happen in the U.S.? The
U.S. is a democracy."</p>

<p> Was the jury verdict at the Davidian trial a victory for freedom
from a centralized and oppressive police power, for freedom of
religion and the right to keep and bear arms, for the
Constitution of the United States?</p>

<p> One would think so from the spontaneous San Antonio victory
celebrations and parties, attended not just by Constitutionalists
and Davidian supporters but by throngs of locals. The minority
who had not seemed convinced of the wrongfulness of the Waco
Massacre before, now claimed to have been champions of freedom
all along. Bumper-stickers of the Texas flag with SECEDE! written
on them were circulated in at least one party.</p>

<p> For those who suffered through a terrifying attack, an oppressive
siege, a raging fire, and the sight of their children, spouses,
and friends dying, followed by a year in jail, then to find
themselves tried in court facing life-imprisonment, and now
facing imprisonment for lesser offenses, perhaps the victory is
not so satisfying.</p>

<p> Similarly for those now-acquitted foreign defendants whom the
spite of disappointed prosecutors is chasing through the
labyrinths of the INS in the hope of preventing voluntary return
to their homelands and forcing deportation instead.  </p>

<p> Also those citizens who are currently being hunted down for
attempting to inform the jury of their rights and obligations.
For those of us who know that there will be no indictment or
prosecution of the ATF leaders and Janet Reno, who together
violated the Constitution they were sworn to uphold, and cost
almost a hundred people their lives, there is little cause to
hope, "Never again!"</p>

<title>Jury's View of Davidian Trial</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Date: January 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Davidian Trial: (In)Justice in America</h1>

<p>By Gary Hunt, who held David Koresh's power of attorney during the
BATF-Davidian standoff in 1993.</p>

<p> I spoke with Sarah Bain the other day. She was foreman of the jury for the
Branch Davidian Trial. She was also the author of a letter which was sent to
Judge Walter Smith, who presided over the trial, in which she asked the Court
to understand what led to the verdicts which were handed down.</p>

<p> In the letter, while discussing the Count Three (using or carrying a firearm)
she describes the thoughts of the jury, "At the time the jury questioned among
ourselves how sentencing could be carried out fairly, since there surely must
be a more serious penalty for 'using' as opposed to 'carrying' a firearm, and
since we were not charged to identify which defendants, if any, should be found
guilty of actually 'using' the firearms."</p>

<p> She points out that this charge carries "a penalty of from five to thirty
years in prison." This is followed by the exclamation, "I am incredulous!"</P>

<p> It is clear by the letter that, "the crimes that the 'carrying/using' took
place was that of aiding and abetting a voluntary manslaughter and not
conspiracy to murder or aiding and abetting murder (all defendants were found
not guilty of these charges)."</p>

<p> She later discusses the charges against <a href="craddock.html">Graeme
Craddock</a>, and says, "we felt we had no choice but to find him guilty in
Count Three. We even discussed whether or not this was not a type of double
jeopardy -- not of being tried twice for the same crime but of being punished
twice for the same crime."</p>

<p> <a href="riddle.html">Ruth Riddle</a> "retrieved a 'long gun' from under her
bed and had passed it downstairs. It is unfathomable that, for this act, she is
facing even five years, much less thirty years, in prison." Sarah clarifies
this issue when she states, "If we had interpreted 'carrying' literally, she
would be totally free since there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that
she even walked to the window of her room while in possession of a firearm!"</p>

<p> Regarding other defendants, she says "on Count Two: the five individuals
found guilty: <a href="branch.html">Brad Eugene Branch</a>, <a
href="whitecliff.html">Kevin A. Whitecliff</a>, <a href="castillo.html">Jaime
Castillo</a>, <a href="fagan.html">Livingston Fagan</a>, and <a
href="avraam.html">Renos Avraam</a>, were not found guilty of voluntary
manslaughter, but of aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter ... the jury
never believed these individuals themselves committed the crime of voluntary
manslaughter. Further, we did believe, and the charge to the jury gave credence
to the belief, that aiding and abetting was a 'lesser charge'."</p>

<p> This is not consistent with what the Court relayed through the press.</p>

<p> Regarding the bringing back of the "carrying" charge, she states, "We
certainly had no knowledge that the penalty for a guilty verdict would be
tied to a conspiracy charge as alleged in Count One."  </p>

<p> The Sentence on this charge was 30 years for the five named above.</p>

<p> Obviously, the Court perceived the guilt differently than the jury, or the
Court has it's own agenda.</p>

<p> Sarah concluded her letter with 'It is now in the Court's hands to assure
that our intentions are not belied." Based on our conversation, Sarah now
feels that the judge ignored her letter, ignored the intent of the jury, and
ignored the determination of the jury.</p>

<p> Sarah, when asked if she believed that Judge Smith intended to give the
Davidians as close to life terms as he could, said this was probably true.</p>

<p> She made clear that what has come of the Trial is not what the jury
intended. The charge to the jury was 68 pages. As indicated by the portions
of the letter above, there was misunderstanding. Moreover, Sarah is fully
aware that it was difficult to understand the charge as well as the verdict
sheets.</p.

<p> Sarah was grateful that the manslaughter option was there. She felt that
some of the jurors would have had to find some guilt and perhaps gone with
the conspiracy to murder charge. The manslaughter charge stated that if the
agents were killed "after adequate provocation" the charge should be
manslaughter. There was no doubt in the jurors' minds that "adequate
provocation" existed. Sarah felt this left some burden on the government.</p>

<p> She was appalled that those who were even remotely associated with the death
of the agents got ten years for that relationship. "Those who carried
weapons got thirty years," she said. "This does not equate in my book."</p>

<p> Sarah indicated the jurors were looking forward to hearing a religious
expert who was on the defense witness list. The expert would have given more
background about the church. Jury members were disappointed when that
testimony was not allowed.</p>

<p> The jury also looked forward to Dick DeGuerin's testimony, which would have
corroborated Jack Zimmerman's testimony. Sarah felt that more evidence,
which was not allowed, may have helped the jury to understand more of what
occurred on both February 28 and April 19, 1993.</p>

<p> When asked if she felt that the jury felt that the Davidians were within
their right to defend themselves, Sarah replied that she felt this would be
the feeling of the jury. They felt the manslaughter charge was the lowest
charge they could go because lives were lost. When asked whether there was
an option for "justifiable homicide", Sarah said there was no option that
might have allowed a lesser charge. Based on the instruction, they felt a
guilty verdict was necessary and that the manslaughter charge was the best
they could do.</p>

<p> The arrest warrant cover page, for David Koresh's arrest, was presented.
But there was no affidavit in support thereof. We are still wondering if
there was a "legitimate" reason for the events of February 28, 1993.</p>

<p> There can be little doubt that (in)justice in America is a tool of
government which is used to "get back" at those who, in this case, defend
their very lives. A law enforcement officer who kills a citizen (whether the
citizen is armed or not) is given time off, with pay, pending an
investigation. When and if the case goes before a coroner's inquest, nearly
every case is "justifiable homicide." Why is that option available to
police, but not available to the American People"?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="avraam.html">Renos Avraam</a>: 40 years
<li><a href="branch.html">Brad Branch</a>: 40 years
<li><a href="castillo.html">Jaime Castillo</a>: 40 years
<li><a href="craddock.html">Graeme Craddock</a>: 20 years
<li><a href="fagan.html">Livingston Fagan</a>: 40 years
<li><a href="fatta.html">Paul Fatta</a>: 15 years
<li><a href="riddle.html">Ruth Riddle</a>: 5 years.
</ul>

<p> And the sentence for America?  Despotism.</p>

<h1>Committee for Waco Justice Files Complaints</h1>

<p>July 28, 1994<br>
Contact: <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a></p>

<p>Washington, D.C.-- Members of the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/CWJ.html">Committee for Waco Justice</a>
have filed formal complaints regarding prosecutorial and judicial
misconduct in the trial of 11 Branch Davidians.  Considering the
gross misconduct documented in our complaints, we are demanding a
new, fair trial with honest prosecutors and an unprejudiced
judge.</p>

<p> The Committee's complaint with the Office of Professional
Responsibility, which investigates all such complaints, has been
made against federal prosecutors Ray Jahn, LeRoy Jahn, William
Johnston and John Finizy.  The complaint alleges prosecutors
repeatedly violated the Brady rule, which requires prosecutors to
give defense attorneys adequate opportunity to inspect all
evidence, and unduly and illegally influenced witnesses.</p>

<p> The Committee's complaint with the Clerk of the U.S. Court
has been made against Judge Walter J. Smith of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> who
presided over the trial.  The complaint alleges that Judge Smith
exercised extreme judicial prejudice throughout the trial,
improperly restricted public access to the whole jury wheel,
refused to allow the defense to introduce evidence or witnesses
that would prove the defendant's innocence, wrote prejudicial
jury instructions, lied to defense attorneys and jurors, unfairly
limited defendants' allocution, and unilaterally found the
defendants guilty of crimes of which they had not been found
guilty by the jury.</p>

<p> In numerous media interviews outspoken jury foreman Sarah
Bain has asserted that she and other jurors are incensed that
Judge Smith gave Davidians long sentences for conspiracy to
murder federal agents and using and carrying machineguns during
commission of that crime when jurors found them innocent of
conspiracy and never were asked to rule on whether nine of eleven
defendants possessed illegal weapons.</p>

<p> Nevertheless, Judge Smith agreed to prosecutors' demands and
sentenced Davidians Renos Avraam, Brad Branch, Jaime Castillo,
Livingston Fagan and Kevin Whitecliff to 40 year sentences,
Graeme Craddock to 20 years, Paul Fatta to 15 years and Ruth
Riddle to 5 years.  Most Davidian defendants are appealing their
sentences and demanding new trials.</p>

<p> Re:   Complaint About Judicial Misconduct by Judge Walter J. Smith
      in the Trial of the Branch Davidians</p>

<p> The below listed members of the Committee for Waco Justice
hereby file a formal complaint with the Clerk of the U.S.
District Court regarding judicial misconduct by U.S. District
Judge Walter J. Smith in the 1994 trial of eleven Branch Davidians.</p>

<p> There is little doubt Judge Smith's extremely prejudiced
actions were motivated by vindictiveness towards the Davidians
whom he blamed for the deaths of federal agents.  However, Smith
also may have been influenced by the fact that during the first
half of the Davidian trial he was under investigation by the
Justice Department for allegedly lying under oath.  And the
Justice Department desperately needed convictions to excuse BATF
and FBI assaults which caused the deaths of four federal agents
and over 81 Branch Davidians, mostly women and children.</p>

<p> Below are listed specific instances of misconduct which we
have garnered from news reports and court documents and from
interviews with court observers, Branch Davidian defendants and
attorneys, and trial jurors.  (Any inadvertent errors should not
discredit any or all other allegations.)  Our listing is not all
inclusive.  Other individuals doubtless will file their own
complaints detailing even more instances of misconduct.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Judge Smith improperly and possibly illegally restricted
public access to the whole jury wheel for the Western District of
Texas before the Davidian trial.  His only proper authority would
be to restrict public access to the much smaller "panel" of
jurors chosen for a specific trial.  Smith later admitted he did
so because he was concerned the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/FIJA.html">Fully Informed Jury Association</a>
would exercise their legal right to send the several thousand
members of the jury wheel information about a jury's right to
vote their conscience.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith refused to allow Livingston Fagan's case to be
separated from that of the other defendants although two other
defendants, Brad Branch and Kevin Whitecliff, could have
testified that he was not the man identified by two federal
agents as having fired at them.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith unfairly limited defense attorneys' right to
cross examine prosecution witnesses and upheld an unusually large
number of prosecutors' objections, thereby restricting their
ability to present an effective defense.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith unfairly squelched an important line of defense-
-that BATF agents were firing from helicopters--by forbidding
defense attorneys to question prosecution witnesses about it and
by refusing to allow them to call witnesses who might have
provided evidence of such shooting. </p>

<li><p>Judge Smith upheld prosecutors' objection to the defense
calling David Koresh's gun dealer Henry McMahon to the stand. 
Smith only allowed jurors to hear a brief statement "stipulated"
by prosecutors stating that BATF agents had refused Koresh's
July, 1992 invitation to inspect his guns and that Koresh had
supplied McMahon and BATF with records of weapons purchased.  If
McMahon had taken the stand defense attorneys surely would have
elicited testimony from him about how BATF had taken him into
"protective custody" and threatened him with prosecution during
the 51 day siege to keep him from telling the FBI and the press
about Koresh's legitimate business dealings and his full
cooperation with BATF investigators.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith instructed jurors that they could find
defendants guilty of aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter,
which he defined as, "when a human being is killed unlawfully in
the sudden heat of passion caused by adequate provocation."   Of
course, any reasonable person might act from passion when
provoked by 76 men shooting weapons and throwing "flash-bang"
grenades!  Nevertheless, Smith did not instruct the jury on any
grounds by which defendants might be found innocent, such as
self-defense.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith lied to both defense attorneys and jurors when
he told them that he was setting aside the jury's guilty verdict
for using or carrying a firearm in relation to conspiracy to
murder federal agents.  The jury had misunderstood Smith's
instructions to find the Davidians guilty of this only if they
also found them guilty of conspiracy to murder.  (Jurors thought
they merely were finding them guilty of using a weapon in
relation to aiding and abetting manslaughter.)  Because of
Smith's promise, defense attorneys did not demand he send the
decision back to the jurors, who would have had to vote them
innocent of the charge.  Smith also told jurors he was setting
aside the verdicts.  Two weeks later Smith reinstated the guilty
verdicts, maintaining he had made no final decision to set them
aside!</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith strictly limited in advance the amount of time
each defendant would be allowed to speak in "allocution" before
sentence was handed down, something which higher courts have
forbidden.  Also, Smith would not allow defendant Renos Avraam to
call one of the BATF agents who was inside a helicopter which
Davidians claimed fired at them, although defendants have the
right to call such "exculpatory" witnesses before sentencing.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith unilaterally found the Davidians guilty of using
and carrying machine guns--even though this had not been part of
the original charges and the jurors had never been asked to
decide whether defendants were guilty of such charges.  Smith
imposed the maximum sentence--30 years instead of 5--on five
defendants based on his personal determination of their guilt.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith ruled at sentencing that Davidians "engaged in a
conspiracy to cause the death of federal agents" even though the
jury had found them innocent of this crime.  Jury foreman Sarah
Bain wrote Judge Smith and exclaimed: "We certainly had no
knowledge that the penalty for a guilty verdict would be tied to
a conspiracy charge as alleged in Count One!"  Nevertheless,
Smith used this as an excuse to impose the maximum sentence.</p>

<li><p>Judge Smith asserted Renos Avraam had "confessed" to
shooting an agent and used this as an excuse for giving him a 30
year sentence.  However, Smith misquoted a (very unreliable)
witness who merely claimed Avraam had stated he was "a good shot."</p>

</ul>

<p> Members of the Committee for Waco Justice request that you
investigate this complaint and any and all other related
complaints against Judge Walter J. Smith.  The type of
prejudiced, vindictive and dishonest misconduct in which he
engaged only discredits the whole judicial system.</p>

<p> Re:   Complaint About Prosecutorial Misconduct in the Trial
of the Branch Davidians</p>

<p> The below listed members of the Committee for Waco Justice
hereby file a formal complaint with the Justice Department's
Office of Professional Responsibility regarding prosecutorial
misconduct.  Our complaint concerns the actions of federal
prosecutors Ray Jahn, LeRoy Jahn, William Johnston and John
Finizy in the 1994 trial of eleven Branch Davidians.  According
to OPR's guidelines, any member of the public may file such a
complaint and you will investigate and report back to them.</p>

<p> There is evidence these prosecutors repeatedly violated the
Brady rule which requires prosecutors to give defense attorneys
adequate opportunity to inspect all evidence, for and against the
defendants, well before it is presented in court.  This practice
became so flagrant that defense attorney Dan Cogdell filed a
motion for a mistrial.  There is also evidence prosecutors unduly
and illegally influenced witnesses so that they would produce
incomplete or false evidence damaging to the Davidians.</p>

<p> Federal prosecutors may have been motivated to engage in
misconduct by desires to vindicate their own, BATF, FBI and
Justice Department decisions and actions which lead to the deaths
of four federal agents and 81 or more Branch Davidians. 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bill Johnston and John Finizy were prime
motivators of the original BATF investigation and February 28,
1993 raid.  Ray Jahn and his wife and assistant LeRoy were
special counsels to former FBI Director William Sessions who
promoted the fatal April 19, 1993 gas and tank assaults on the
Davidians' home.</p>

<p> Below are listed specific instances of misconduct which we
have garnered from news reports and court documents and from
interviews with court observers, Branch Davidian defendants and
attorneys, and trial jurors.  (Any inadvertent errors should not
discredit any and all other allegations.)  Our listing is not all
inclusive.  Other individuals doubtless will file their own
complaints detailing even more instances of misconduct.  We
expect you will add all new complaints to the ongoing
investigation.</p>

<p> Prosecutors Withheld Evidence Regarding Defendant Fagan</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prosecutors did not tell Livingston Fagan's attorney in
advance that two witnesses, BATF agents Evers and Orchowski,
would claim Fagan shot them.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors withheld evidence that cast doubt on Evers'
testimony--a copy of the photo lineup Texas Rangers had shown the
agent in March of 1993.  Next to the photo of Fagan, Evers had
written, "unsure if identified from shooting or TV."  Even the
pro-prosecution Judge Smith criticized the prosecution for this
incident.</p>
</ul>

<p> Prosecutors Withheld Evidence Regarding Illegal BATF Shooting
February 28, 1993</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prosecutors were untroubled by the fact that they could not
produce one of the two steel double front doors which might have
proved that BATF shot a first barrage of bullets at the unarmed
David Koresh, critically wounding the unarmed Perry Jones.  FBI
agent R.J. Craig's testimony, as well as FBI photographs,
indicated the doors had been pulled away from the building before
the fire.  Texas Ranger testimony, the Treasury Department
report, as well as news and amateur video, indicate FBI and BATF
agents had access to the scene before and after Texas Rangers
took it over.</p>

<li><p>Prosecution witness Dr. Nizam Peerwani claimed that Perry
Jones only had a gun shot wound to the mouth and ignored the
nearly fatal BATF-inflicted bullet wounds to the stomach Davidian
survivors have described.  Even prosecution witness Kathryn
Schroeder testified Perry Jones was wounded by BATF gunshots. 
Jones' surviving family members will soon have their own autopsy
done.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors did not tell the defense that BATF agents Roland
Ballesteros and Robert Champion had changed their testimony about
whether anyone had yelled search warrant, seen David Koresh in
the door or shot dogs in the first minutes of the raid.  After
being interviewed by Treasury Department agents and prosecutors,
they gave testimony much more damaging to the Davidians and
protective of BATF than that which they gave the Texas Rangers in
March, 1993.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors supported BATF's claim that the reason it did
not have video of the first minutes of the raid was that BATF
equipment both in the undercover house across the street and in
the helicopters had failed.  However, BATF officials initially
claimed they had video evidence the Davidians fired first.  Many
believe this video footage does exist and actually contains
evidence that BATF agents fired first and that agents fired at
Davidians from helicopters.  Survivors, including prosecution
witness Marjorie Thomas, make such allegations.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors lied to the court when they stated they showed
all available KWTX television video tape of the February 28th
raid.  They definitely did not show the widely broadcast footage
of a BATF agent breaking the windows of the chapel and throwing
two dangerous "flash-bang" grenades inside.  They also may have
edited out other footage damaging to the prosecutors' case.</p>
</ul>

<p> Prosecutors Withheld Evidence Regarding How April 19, 1993 Fire
Started</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prosecutors supported the FBI's claim its surveillance
devices were destroyed by tanks right before the final tank
attacks which Davidians assert started the fires.  If they exist,
such tapes might provide evidence that the tanks, and not the
Davidians, started the fires.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors did not reveal to the defense that the FBI in
Waco and in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>
had a live audio feed of everything
caught on surveillance tapes inside Mount Carmel Center. 
Attorney General Janet Reno, other Justice Department and FBI
officials, and agents in Waco could hear everything caught by the
"bugs" as it happened.  If this had been known, the defense would
have had a strong case to call any such individuals to the stand
to testify about the exact time surveillance tapes actually
stopped recording.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors withheld the fact that when they showed jurors
infrared and video shots of the April 19th fire, they did not
include almost 5 crucial minutes between noon and 12:07, footage
which might have proven that the final tank attacks started the
fire.  This footage should be released to defense attorneys and
the public immediately.</p>

<li><p>Prosecution witness Dr. Peerwani withheld from the jury what
Davidian death certificates cited--that some bodies had ethanol
in their blood, possible evidence that the FBI used this highly
flammable substance as a dispersant for CS gas.  Nor did he
reveal that several dozen bodies had lethal doses of cyanide, a
known byproduct of burning CS gas.</p>
</ul>

<p> Prosecutors Withheld Evidence Regarding "Star Witness" Kathryn Schroeder</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Davidian Kathryn Schroeder, who plea bargained for a lower
sentence in exchange for her testimony against other defendants,
admitted in court that prosecutors told her they had a witness
who could testify she had shot a gun on February 28th.  Once she
cooperated with them, prosecutors denied they had such evidence
any longer.  Defense attorneys demanded prosecutors turn over any
evidence that similarly "exonerated" their clients.  Prosecutors
did not do so.  It is possible either that prosecutors lied to
Schroeder to compel her cooperation or that they did in fact
withhold evidence that might exonerate other defendants.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors disclosed only on the morning of Schroeder's
testimony that Texas Rangers had a transcript of Schroeder's
original March, 1993 statement to them.  The statement was quite
different from both her later grand jury testimony and the
testimony prosecutors had revealed to defense attorneys she would
present at trial.  With this evidence finally in hand, defense
attorneys could confront Schroeder and make her admit she had
lied to Texas Rangers.</p>
</ul>

<p> Prosecutors Intimidated or Unduly Influenced Witnesses</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The above suggests that prosecutors may have lied to and
intimidated Kathryn Schroeder in order to convince her to lie on
the stand in exchange for a greatly reduced sentence.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors obviously coached former Davidian Victorine
Hollingsworth.  At trial she testified with confidence that she
had seen various individuals carrying guns during or after the
February raid.  However, when one attorney read aloud her
statement to Texas Rangers taken shortly after she left Mount
Carmel in March, the transcript showed that Hollingsworth was
very confused and unsure of who was carrying guns or what those
guns looked like.</p>

<li><p>Soon after the February 28th raid, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Bill Johnston monitored BATF undercover agent Robert Rodriguez'
statement to Texas Rangers.  This is suspicious considering that
Rodriguez testified at trial he became so worried about BATF
officials' lies about him, he hired his own attorney.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors may have influenced witness Bradley Rogans, a 23
year old serving three eight-year sentences on drug-related
charges.  Rogans testified he befriended defendant Renos Avraam
during almost a week at a Texas prison and that Avraam had told
him he had carried an automatic weapon and boasted he was "a good
shot."  Later it was revealed that Rogans had spent only one day
at that facility and was released to freedom the next day!  </p>

<li><p>Prosecution witness audio expert Paul Ginsberg, who earns
more than $100,000 a year doing work for the FBI, admitted that
after speaking with prosecutors he changed the contents of his
transcripts.  For example, he changed one statement he originally
transcribed as: "So we only light 'em as soon as they tell me
it's the last chance, right?" to, "So we only light `em as they
come in."  It is obvious these changes had little to do with
audio clarity and everything to do with creating content damaging
to the Davidians.  A juror told us jurors did not find his
transcriptions credible.</p>

<li><p>Prosecutors would allow defense attorneys' weapons expert to
inspect allegedly illegal machineguns only by looking at them
through their plastic wrappings.  This adds to suspicions that
prosecutors and weapons experts falsely claimed that legal
weapons were actually illegal ones--or that some legal weapons
had been converted to illegal ones in FBI laboratories.</p>
</ul>

<p> The Committee for Waco Justice would like a thorough
investigation of whether one or more prosecutors named above were
involved in withholding evidence or unduly or illegally
influencing witnesses.  We would like to see appropriate
disciplinary or legal measures taken against culpable
prosecutors.  We would also like to see any evidence withheld by
BATF or the FBI found and disclosed to Branch Davidian defense
attorneys.</p>

<p> As you know, after Attorney General Janet Reno decided not
to merge your office with that of the Inspector General, some
lawmakers expressed dismay.  According to the Washington <cite>Post</cite>,
Senator John Glenn asked, "What is going on over there they don't
want us to look at?"  We hope that your office will not confirm
Senator Glenn's suspicions and will do a thorough investigation
of our and all other relevant complaints. We expect that you will
contact the Committee for Waco Justice about the results of your
investigation.</p>

<title>Davidian Livingstone Fagan</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 16-17, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Livingstone Fagan</h1>

<p>Livingstone Fagan is one of the surviving Branch Davidians. In June 1994,
during the trial of him and his fellow Davidians, he gave the following
testimony.</p>

<p> The testimony was posted to LiberNet February 18, 1995, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith sentenced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ...  These statements,
taken from the trial transcript, have been edited somewhat for clarity and
brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p>Judge, I noticed in your initial address regarding the
Sentencing Guidelines you gave some examples as to why the
Court has to sentence the way it has to sentence, and also
why the Court has to sentence at all.  In those examples,
you used people who had acknowledged their guilt.  Also, in
the arguments presented here by the defense counsel and the
prosecution with respect to sentencing, they may have left
the impression that we are in some way implying that we were
guilty.  I would like to point out that there is no doubt in
our minds that we are innocent.  I think that all the
Defendants share that position.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we would like it to be reflected
on the record that the charge to which we are actually
brought here today, for which the jury returned the verdict
of guilty, that of [aiding and abetting] voluntary
manslaughter, was not, in fact, included on the original
indictment. Furthermore, it was added after the defense had
rested its case, and, for most of us, it was without
consultation.  And we certainly do not accept it.</p>

<p> Let me also state for myself personally, never, at any
point, have I sought to distance myself from David Koresh,
his teachings, or from the actions of the residents of Mount
Carmel during February 28th through April 19th.  There is no
doubt in my mind that the actions that we were forced to
take were justified, given the circumstances that we were
placed in by the actions of the agents of the Government.</p>

<p> You pointed out that the reasons why you were forced to
sentence us the way you intend to do is because of the
people, through Congress.  You also indicated that through
the jury's decision, representing the people, again, you are
forced to sentence us.  So, effectively, the reason we are
being sentenced today is because of the people.</p>

<p> The people.  It's funny, this reminds me of a 
situation, coming from a religious commune, that goes 
back to 2,000 years ago regarding Christ.  You made 
mention of the fact many people had contacted you on the
phone regarding this whole affair, requesting leniency,
which is not something that I request.  I fully support the
actions that were taken at Mount Carmel.  It's unfortunate
regarding the consequences.  But regarding what you said
about those who contacted you, it reminds me of that woman
that came to Pilate and said something to the effect, "Have
nothing to do with this just man," but nevertheless, he went
ahead and did what he did.</p>

<p> There were other symbols that we notice in this whole
trial, right from the beginning, that affirm for us the fact
that we were pursuing realities pertaining to the spirit,
that this Court does not recognize, as they did not
recognize 2,000 years ago.  Right from the beginning, the
spiritual aspect of this was totally and absolutely
rejected.  But it was the core of why we were at Mount
Carmel, and why we acted the way that we acted.  The fact
that this was rejected gave me the impression that, right
from the beginning, we were never going to receive justice. 
And right now, we do not feel that justice has been done
today because a crucial element facilitating that was
denied.  And you expect us, given what we've gone through,
to support what is going on today, to acknowledge somehow
that we were responsible, that we were guilty.  We remain
convinced that everything that we have done, everything that
we've suffered, we've suffered for truth and justice.  It
pains my heart when I hear statements like "paying
restitution."  For what?</p>

<p> My attorney says to me something to the effect that,
"Livingstone, all of this will be taken up in appeal.  You
don't really have to worry about this."  Two thousand years
ago when Christ was on the cross, we know that he was
innocent.  But he didn't have an appeal, did he?  The system
killed him.  Is that appeal going to bring back [my wife]
Evette, David, the children and all of the rest?  No, it's
not.  Appeal doesn't mean nothing to me.  It doesn't mean
nothing to us, nothing short of the lives of the people that
were lost is of any benefit.  But we are comforted in the
thought that we entered into this whole situation on the
basis of a faith that has been proven true in as much as
that we endured the circumstances we did.  We don't
particularly care what you want to do.  You're going to do
it anyway.</p>

<p> But we also serve a God who sits on a throne, like you,
a judge.  He's got a book in his hand, sealed with Seven
Seals.  Men don't know his judgement.  Consequently, Mount
Carmel happened the way that it did.  As you have judged,
so, too, you will be judged.  This is only an opportunity,
from our perspective, for you, not for ourselves.</p>

<p> I really don't think that there is much to be gained by
pursuing words.  Through the 51-day negotiation period,
David tried to pursue words in an effort to prevent this,
the events that happened, but it made no difference.  My
purpose here was to make clear to the public that we in no
way want to leave any impression in the mind of anyone that
we are anything but innocent.  And we do not accept this
notion, this facade that is being presented in this court,
that somehow we have agreed with this judgement, with this
sentencing, with anything that has taken place.  We have
not, and we want to make this clear.  We are innocent. 
Absolutely, without any doubts whatsoever. We know we are innocent.</p>

<hr>

<p>(Livingstone Fagan, 35, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> social worker,
masters in theology and father of two, left Mount Carmel
during the siege.  He was sentenced to 40 years and is non-
cooperating by refusing to appeal.)</p>

<title>Davidian Jaime Castillo</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 16-17, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Jaime Castillo</h1>

<p>Jaime Castillo is one of the surviving Branch Davidians. Below is
a transcript of Castillo's testimony at the Branch Davidian trial.</p>

<p> The transcript was posted February 18, 1995, from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said,
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith senteced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ... These
statements, taken from the trial transcript in the order in
which they were made, have been edited somewhat for clarity
and brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p>As <a href="fagan.html">Livingstone</a> said, we still stand on our
innocence. Or I do, in my actions pertaining to February 28th.  Judge,
you made a statement that the government is not on trial
here.  There's no doubt in my mind that the government
should be on trial for its actions.</p>

<p> When justice and judgement is given to people to uphold
the law, in relation to Congress, legislation and so forth,
you've got to understand that we're all human beings and we
all make mistakes.  And if we make these mistakes, we have
to acknowledge our mistakes.  Going back to Genesis, the
time of Cain, passing the buck--I think that's what happened
here.  People that were responsible didn't want to pay up
for their actions.  Most of the people I've talked to see
the injustice that's been done by those responsible for
letting the agents pursue that avenue.</p>

<p> You know, every time I wake up in the morning, I'm in a
jail cell, and it's kind of hard to forget what you're going
through and your experience in relation to what occurred at
Mount Carmel.  It's a scar that's left with me.  And every
day I wake up and I have to realize that I'm still alive. 
I've gone through an experience I try to share with people
and bring them to an understanding of what happened and what
Mount Carmel was about.  And some people are spiritually
oriented and they want to know, "Hey, what happened out there?"</p>

<p> I try to present to people's minds a truth that I've
learned the last six years in my experience with David and
the others.  And the David Koresh that's been portrayed to
the world, that's not the David Koresh I understand and
know.  That's not my friend.  But David Koresh I know,
that's my experience and I think I'll keep it to myself.</p>

<p> I tell people, "It's like this.  There's two spirits in
the world.  There's a spirit of God and of Satan. And those
who are part of that spirit of Christ have that
understanding of truth, and they live their lives according
to that truth, as best they can, whether Muslim, Jew,
whatever."  I try to put in people's minds there's a truth,
and related to that truth, we've told the truth.  As soon as
I came out, I told the truth.  I told the Texas Rangers what
happened.  And we came to trial to ascertain that truth.</p>

<p> In the light of everything that's happened, there's a
God.  We're hoping in something, we're hoping in the truth. 
We're hoping in God's word.  Not following David Koresh. 
We're following the truth.  If we're so deceived, then show
me where I'm wrong.  I want to know.</p>

<p> I just hope that out of this whole situation, I hope
it's pricked the conscience of people to realize and to
understand, to waken people up to the realities taking place
in this world.  And, hopefully, when God finally decides to
do something, maybe they'll have a better understanding. 
Maybe they'll fear God for once in their lives.</p>

<title>Davidian Renos Avraam</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas -->
<!-- Time: June 16-17, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Renos Avraam</h1>

<p>Renos Avraam was one of the Branch Davidians who survived. Following
is the transcript of Avraam's testimony before sentencing.</p>

<p> The transcript was posted February 18, 1995, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said,
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith sentenced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ... These
statements, taken from the trial transcript in the order in
which they were made, have been edited somewhat for clarity and brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p> I've got quite a few issues.  The [aiding and abetting]
voluntary manslaughter charge that was given to the Court to
give to the jury on my behalf actually was added by my
attorney without actually asking me for my permission.  And
that might violate some of my rights under the Constitution,
since I should be told prior to any charge against myself
the actual nature of the charge or the indictment.</p>

<p> The second thing.  We heard testimony saying that UH-1
helicopters were only used as diversion, but weren't
actually used to fire on Mount Carmel in any way.  I have
evidence [to the contrary]. . .Now would it be okay if I
called David Aguilera (BATF lead investigator who was in a
helicopter) to the stand?  (Judge Smith says no.) I've got
evidence that perjured testimony was used in this trial. 
Are you saying that you're going to still make a judgement,
knowing that there is evidence showing there was perjury? 
(The judge says this is not the time to raise that issue.)</p>

<p> My next thing is the want of jurisdiction in this
court.  Has this Court got jurisdiction over me?  I have
witnesses and evidence and testimony, and, therefore, proof
that I am innocent, and that alleged agents perjured
themselves and the prosecutor used perjured testimony with
specific intent.  (Avraam challenges whether the judge is a
Constitutional Article III judge and the judge asserts he
is.  Judge Smith claims that government witnesses "had no
reason to either lie or be mistaken" when they testified
under oath.)</p>

<p> Well, they did have a reason since the Posse Comitatus
Act does not allow military aircraft to be used in
[combatting] civilian crime.  What I'm saying is that there
was good reason for them to lie.  And the Comitatus Act may
have been violated by President Clinton by using tanks, the
tanks should never have been used to enter the building. 
(Judge says none of that will affect the sentencing in his case.)</p>

<p> I don't think anything I can say is going to have any
benefit.  I don't think anything here is going to change
your mind.  I believe you have your mind already made up.</p>

<p> (Avraam tries to read letter into record in which jury
forewoman Sarah Bain tells the judge about errors made by
the jury in deciding on their verdicts but he says a juror
cannot impeach their verdict.  Avraam disagrees.  He also
attacks the credibility of Texas Rangers who kept adding
things during trial that were not in their original
reports.)</p>

<p> I'd like to say that for those who died at Mount
Carmel, I don't believe they died in vain.  I do believe the
Government was responsible.  I don't care what the
Government says, how much they try to whitewash it.  I have
evidence that the CS gas was flammable.  Colin Powell gave a
report saying CS gas was harmful and flammable, even self-
combustible.  I don't believe it was right for them to use
tanks to go straight into the building where women and
children are.</p>

<p> I'm from England.  This trial has not convinced me of
being guilty.  It has not convinced me at all.  I don't
think it's convinced the jury, because they're certainly
unsure.  I don't think that you could sentence someone on
something that is not clear, not definitive, not facts.</p>

<p> For those who died at Mount Carmel, I won't forget
them.  David Koresh told [undercover ATF agent Robert]
Rodriguez that "we know you're coming," and still they come
with helicopters blazing.  Davy Aguilera, he was firing one
of them.  He ain't going to deny it.  Helicopters blazing. 
They know that we know they're coming.  The leadership put
the agents at risk.  If I was the wife of the agents, I
would be suing the ATF leadership for being so stupid.</p>

<p> David Koresh did come to the door and did try to stop
them.  But the plan was, go in through windows, flash-bangs
and everything, kill some dogs.  The plan went ahead even
though they knew the element of surprise had been lost. 
That's why Davy Aguilera started firing from the helicopter. 
The criminal charges should be brought against those that
did that, because that is a violation of the Comitatus Act. 
I don't think military equipment should be used against
civilians and that is in the Constitution.</p>

<p> Well, it's a sad situation because so many people died
for something that was so simple as someone's supposedly
converting semiautomatic to full automatic and every gun was
legally purchased.  You can have automatic weapons, all you
need is a license.  Of course, the Government wants
scapegoats out of all of this and we are the scapegoats.</p>

<p> We're all going to stand before God.  And I hope, Judge
Smith, that you have a squeaky clean record, because as a
judge you're sentencing other people.  I hope you can stand
before God.  I hope you have done everything that you think
is right.  We're all going to stand before God--if you
believe there is a God.  I'm sure you do.  I'm going to
stand before God and I will be happy to tell him, to affirm
my convictions.  I've searched the Bible, I've searched
truth.  I believe that David Koresh did teach the Seven Seals.</p>

<p> The stories that are going around are all blown out of
proportion.  That was the FBI and the ATF feeding the media,
the media's done such a good job of slandering the
Davidians.  That's why there's such a travesty of justice. 
And the agents came together, to speak to each other about
what they'd done.  I can't see how you can accept their
testimony, their perjured testimony.</p>

<p> Well, I leave it in God's hands.  God sits on the
throne, and I pray for the agents, I pray for the Davidians. 
I leave it in God's hands.</p>

<h1>Kevin Whitecliff</h1>

<p>The transcript was posted February 18, 1995, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said,
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith sentenced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ... These
statements, taken from the trial transcript in the order in
which they were made, have been edited somewhat for clarity and brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you, your honor, for giving me the time to give
you an understanding of my feelings.  I'm from Honolulu,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/hi/">Hawaii</a>.
We call that "paradise."  And you know, to live in
paradise, born and raised, and to pack your bags at an
instant and leave, there's got to be reasons for that and
justifications in anybody's mind, to just pack up, whether
they're running from the law or whether they believe in a
faith.  I had the opportunity, through friends that I knew
all my life, one of them being Steve Schneider, to get a few
Bible studies and to get that understanding of: what were we
supposed to do for today?  I had always had questions like
that.  Being born and raised in America, where I've always
heard God first, and then country.  I have a curiosity for
my God and to know what is asked of me today.  What should I
do to gain eternal life?  What can I do for my family's
salvation or my salvation?</p>

<p> I met somebody that I thought was pretty inspired.  And
he had a message and I couldn't refute it.  So I followed him to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>
to learn more.  And my life revolved around
religion.  From an Adventist school, I've always been taught
2000 year old questions.  If Jesus came up to you and said,
"I'll make you fishers of men, will you follow me?"  That's
always been in my mind.  I wondered if I had the faith to do
something like that.</p>

<p> I believe that the message that I heard, the Seven
Seals, was an inspirational message.  So I was there in Waco
learning more of it.  I wasn't convinced.  No one's ever
convinced.  Studying the Bible is ongoing learning, it's
daily learning.  And that's why I was there.</p>

<p> I had come on April 3rd, 1992.  I was asked to come and
improve some property there.  We built a gym, we built a
swimming pool for our kids.  These guys are some of the
greatest individuals in the world.  I lived with them for a
couple of years and I've lived in all kinds of circumstances.</p>

<p> I've been a law enforcement officer, too, in Hawaii.  I
don't think we did anything wrong, except what we believe
in.  There's women and children in there.  I think law
enforcement should have really considered that there are
kids, babies--babies on that land, mothers giving suck to
those babies on that land.  And the way they went ahead and
bombarded the place, with 90 people armed to the hilt.  I
mean, being a former law enforcement agent myself, I can't
fathom that type of reaction, especially as far as being
your first choice of operation.  I don't have a disrespect
for people like the disrespect that was shown for us that day.</p>

<p> I thought I was going to die that day.  I thought I was
going to get blown away.  And I couldn't believe this was
our country doing this to its citizens.  I couldn't believe
it.  In fact, I didn't see [who it was] until after the
retreat.  When I read what was on the backs of their
clothes, I couldn't believe it, Judge.  I could not believe
that was a law enforcement agency that did that.  I thought
we got attacked by some kind of renegades or some kind of an
anti-Christian group.</p>

<p> I was scared. I was so scared that I thought for two or
three weeks I was going to die, until there was
negotiations.  Then I came out, in good faith and to see if
there was justice in this country.  And that's what I'm
doing right now.  I'm hoping, one last breath, because I'm
not an articulate person.  I just hope that you do extend as
much mercy as you can on all of us as a group, on all of us. 
I can't see the justification for 30 years.  No way.</p>

<p> Put in that situation where you've got women and
children crying and screaming, "Oh, my God, please help us,
save us, do something!  They're shooting at us!"  It's a
reaction, because when bullets fly, they fly faster than the
mind can perceive.  And when you're hit, you go down.  But
until you are hit, you have a God-given instinct, and that
God-given instinct is for self-preservation.  You do
anything, you pick up anything you can, if you life is
threatened, to defend yourself.  And you do your best to
live another day or live another hour or another minute.</p>

<p> Every time I reflect on that day and what had happened,
I don't think we were given any time at all to make any kind
of decision that this Court would accept.  No.  It was
either live or die.  That was my experience.  We have to go
right back to self-preservation, it's God-given.  You've got
people attacking you.  You've got women and children being
fired at.  It's a masculine thing, a protective thing.</p>

<p> I was raised in a family where we protected each other. 
I have a wife.  I have children that haven't seen me in over
two years now and they're asking me, "Dad, when are you coming home?"</p>

<p> And I just hope that the courts and the Judge will
understand that we're there for our faith. We're there for
our beliefs.  We didn't ask anybody to provoke anything. 
There was no prior contempt in any way at all from us.  We
are law-abiding citizens.  We all are law abiding citizens. 
And we'd probably still be there today, minding our own
business, if the 28th of February 1993 never came.  I think
we're a plus to our community, and I think our neighbors
could honestly tell you that we've done a lot of work for
them for nothing.  Unfortunately, that never came up
publicly.  I do not know why, but God will be the judge one day.</p>

<p> I personally have never been arrested in my whole life. 
I have never owned a weapon in my whole life or had a
registration for a gun.  I've never participated in a gun
show.  And I'll say 98 percent of the people there didn't either.</p>

<p> Count Three, I understand it's automatic weapons versus
regular firearms.  I have not been able to, even analyzing
what happened in the trial and what I have before me, to
[understand your] conclusion for us to have automatic
weapons.  I've never owned an automatic weapon.  I've never
fired an automatic weapon. I do not know what an automatic
weapon would consist of.  I want you to know [Mount Carmel]
is big.  There are places I've never been in that facility. 
There were certain places that were off limits.</p>

<p> What we did was not planned.  It was a reaction.  If
you approach somebody by knocking up on their door and
saying, "Hey, we've got some discrepancies, we've got some
problems.  We know you're a good old boy.  We've dealt with
you in the past."</p>

<p> We know the local county sheriffs.  "Why don't you come
on out and cooperate with us?"</p>

<p> There was none of that at all.  There was cattle trucks
to conceal 90 individuals that had firearms.  There were
three, four helicopters buzzing around, shooting people. 
What the ATF did was unjustifiable.  They owe us an apology
for what they've done, the type of tactics they've done, not
considering at all the Constitution and the right for God-
fearing people to assemble, as well as live together.  I
think they broke and violated everybody's constitutional
rights to be there, just to be there in beliefs or searching
for the truth.  It takes time, it takes input, to search.</p>

<p> And I know you have decisions today, Judge, to make,
and I know you're getting, probably, tired of me.  I [see]
your lack of eye contact, but I understand.  I just want to
get this over with and go home.  My daughter wants to know
when I'm coming home.  My wife wants to know when I'm coming
home.  My mom wants to know when I'm coming home.  I just
want this to be over and behind me, and I think the other
guys do, too.</p>

<p> As far as what the Government reported to the press,
what the majority of the population thought and believed
that we were, it was just a burden.  I'm under duress.  I've
spent 15 months in jail.  I'm not the same individual I was. 
Believe me, I'm not.  I'm run down.  I'm pressured out. 
It's taken its toll on me.  It has.  And I hope your
decision today will consider that. Consider the fact that
I've never been in trouble in my life.  Consider that I've
always had a job.  Consider that I've paid my taxes and done
the best job I can.</p>

<p> I hope you consider these people here.  They have
families, too.  They have lives, too.  Regardless, I know
what you have to do, you have to do.  Consider that I have a
family, too, and a life I'd like to go ahead and pursue if
it's at all possible with you.  And I know my daughter, my
son, would like to see me again before I'm 73.  I'd like to
have that chance to start over again.  I think we all would
like to have that chance.</p>

<p> You're never going to change our beliefs.  Our beliefs
are our beliefs, and they will stay with us, like
<a href="fagan.html">Livingstone</a> said.  But the Government has a chance now
to make a lot of wrong a little it more right, at least even it
up a little bit on our behalf.  And I think the people of
this country are watching real closely to see what kind of
decisions you'll make today.  And I hope that you'll do the
right thing and analyze the past of each of us and where
we've been and what we've done.  And I think you'll come to
the conclusion in your heart that we're not common
criminals, we don't fit the same M.O.  If there is any more
time to be spent [in prison], at least give us that
opportunity, each one of us, give us that opportunity to
have a future again.</p>

<h1>Brad Branch</h1>

<hr>

<p>Your honor, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm basically a shy
person, so if I faint.  I'm going to stand up here with all
humility.  And the truth of the matter is, these people that
I'm here with, it's a basic truth, a Seven Seal truth.  We
stand in judgement before God.  The question is simple.  Who
is worthy?  I don't know what to tell this Court as far as
what ya'll want to hear.  And if I made no sense, it's because
I can't make any sense of the Court.</p>

<p> As far as the matters of the Court and the question of
sentencing, I just want to say that we were not advised on the
[aiding and abetting voluntary] manslaughter charge.  Our
lawyers did a very good job and I commend them.  I've lost all
thought.</p>

<title>Davidian Paul Fatta</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->

<h1>Paul Fatta</h1>

<p>Paul Fatta is one of the Branch Davidians who survived the fire. Below is a
transcript of his testimony before he and other Davidians were sentenced.</p>

<p>The transcript was posted February 18, 1995, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said,
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith sentenced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ... These
statements, taken from the trial transcript in the order in
which they were made, have been edited somewhat for clarity and brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p>Your Honor, I just ask that you give me a few moments to
say some things and try to look at things from my point of
view.  It seems like for these past 14 months, we've just
looked at things from the Government's point of view, and, you
know, they're people just like me. I'm going to read this
statement:</p>

<p> Why did so many of my friends and family have to suffer
and die at Mount Carmel?  Who wants to take responsibility? 
The ATF doesn't.  The FBI won't.  How about Janet Reno? 
William Sessions?  [Stephen] Higgins?  Lloyd Bentsen?  And, of
course, Bill Clinton.  I heard all these people judging my
friends on national television.  Why didn't any of these
people have the courage to show up in court?  Where are the
managers and supervisors of these agencies?  Why wouldn't they
testify in court?  Many of them have resigned, retired, have
been fired or relocated.  These are the very people that
mocked and ridiculed my friends publicly.</p>

<p> They told us we would be treated fairly and humanely.
They arrested our grandmothers and grandfathers, strip-
searched them and put them in jail, charged them with murder. 
Then paraded them in front of the television cameras in chains.</p>

<p> On April 19th we had to watch as the FBI gassed and
demolished our home.  This was fair and humane treatment?  Who
wants to take responsibility?</p>

<p> Why did the Government plan a military assault on such a
small group of people?  The majority of people living at Mount
Carmel were women, children and elderly.  What our Government
did to my friends would never be done to a foreign country. 
First, we would send ambassadors of peace and negotiators. 
The Branch Davidians were never given a chance. The
Government's attitude is, let's launch a full out military
assault and negotiate later.</p>

<p> A little respect and common sense can go a long way.  Did
ATF investigators bother to contact our families and do a
background investigation? Did they make an effort to find out
what our faith in God was?  If the Government felt we were
misguided, misled or deceived, why didn't they send some
representative to show us our error?  We are reasonable
people, we would have sat down and listened to what they had
to say.  I know for a fact, if the U.S. Attorneys and the ATF
would have treated us with respect, this tragedy would never
have happened.  We had a right to exercise our religion and be left alone.</p>

<p> What kind of spirit or mind would send 90 agents and
helicopters to someones' home, knowing they were provoking a
confrontation?  The people responsible for the planning and
execution of this military assault on our church are supposed
to be intelligent, professional people.  They are public
servants.  Their job is to serve and protect, not kill, main
and destroy property.</p>

<p> The prosecution wants the public to believe they are
fighting for the four agents that died.  I find that hard to
believe.  The truth is, they're trying to cover up their own
incompetent decision-making.  These men, along with others,
were more concerned about putting on a show than the lives on
my friends and federal agents.  The truth is, the Branch
Davidians were for peace, but the Government was for war. 
Here are some facts from the trial to back that statement.</p>

<p> Number one.  I witnessed David Koresh leave Mount Carmel
at least a dozen times in the last two months before the raid. 
David Koresh invited ATF Agent David Aguilera to inspect all
the weapons at Mount Carmel, but he refused.  David Koresh and
the other residents of Mount Carmel treated undercover ATF
agent Robert Rodriguez with respect.  He was invited into our
home and we shared our faith with him.  He was never
threatened or provoked, not even the morning of the raid. 
Robert Rodriguez pleaded with the raid supervisors to call off
the raid.  Why didn't they listen? Why would they purposely
want to provoke a confrontation?  Was "show time" and a budget
hearing in March more important than the lives of men, woman
and children?</p>

<p> David Koresh went to the front door unarmed.  He told the
attacking agents, "Let's talk.  There are women and children
living here."  Instead he was met with gunfire, and him and
his father-in-law were both wounded.</p>

<p> Wayne Martin called 911 to arrange a cease-fire.  How
many lives could have been saved if this message was quickly
passed to all the agents?  At every point, an honest effort
was made to avoid a confrontation.  Why wouldn't anybody listen?</p>

<p> I came to Mount Carmel to study the Bible and to be
supportive with the talents God has given me.  I believe there
was more truth from the Bible and Mount Carmel than any other
place on the face of this earth.  That is my personal
experience.  Theologians, scholars and religious leaders could
not unlock the mysteries of the Book of Revelation or the
prophecies.  I believe David Koresh was given the
responsibility to reveal the Seven Seals and make it plain to
all those who had an ear to hear.  I base my faith on God's
word and go by the weight of evidence.  Ultimately, God is my
judge.  I'll have to stand the judgement alone.  I won't be
judged according to man's laws.  I will be judged according to
God's word.</p>

<p> Many people find it strange we believe we will see our
friends that died again.  They are in error because they don't
know the Scriptures nor the power of God.  There's coming a
day when those people responsible for the deaths of my friends
are going to bow down at the feet of those children and be
ashamed for their actions.</p>

<p> I guess the last thing I could say is, I don't have any
personal grudges against law enforcement people.  I have
sheriffs, police officers, even ATF agents in my family.  But
there's something wrong with the way we were treated.  And the
way I look at it is if the U.S. Attorneys and the ATF planners
had had family living at Mount Carmel, like brothers, sisters,
aunts, uncles, I think they would have handled things
differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>(Paul Fatta, 36, a businessman born in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/hi/">Hawaii</a>, was not at
Mount Carmel on February 28, 1993.  He was sentenced to 15
years and is appealing.)</p>

<title>Davidian Graeme Craddock</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Graeme Craddock</h1>

<p>Graeme Craddock is one of the Branch Davidians who survived the fire. Below is
a transcript of his testimony before he and other Davidians were sentenced.</p>

<p> The transcript was posted February 18, 1995, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said,
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith sentenced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ... These
statements, taken from the trial transcript in the order in
which they were made, have been edited somewhat for clarity and brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p>Most people that know me know that I very rarely say
much, even in the best of circumstances.  As I hope you can
appreciate, this is not the best of circumstances.</p>

<p> When I came out of Mount Carmel after the fire, I told
the truth to whatever authorities that asked me, whether they
were Texas Rangers or the Grand Jury.  Or perhaps I should
say, I told the truth under the best of circumstances that I
could, realizing that I had been through a traumatic
experience.  And having gone through that, when you're in a
tough situation, you mind tends to narrow what you can
remember.  Nevertheless, I told the truth.</p>

<p> You probably are aware that much of the evidence that was
presented against me has come from the testimony of my own
mouth, that is, the Grand Jury statement.  Others who came out
of Mount Carmel have never been indicted or convicted of a
crime.  I think possibly the reason for that is because they
have chosen their constitutional right to remain silent and
perhaps that's the only difference between what I have done
and what they have done.  I have chosen to tell the truth,
whether it's hurt me, and obviously it has.  I've put myself
in a situation where you can have your choice as to whether to
show me mercy or not.  I wanted the truth to come out, the
real truth, whether it hurt us or not.  If there is a God and
if there is a judgement to come after this, then all truth
about what happened at Mount Carmel is going to be revealed.</p>

<p> When the firing broke out I just lie on the floor.  We
all heard shots being fired.  I'd describe it like hailstones
on a tin roof.  It was very terrifying for all of us.</p>

<p> Because of my own testimony I believe I'm here today
under threat of 40 years imprisonment.  Because I did speak
out, I did cooperate as best I could, I feel I am due some
respect from this court.  I think it's wrong to be convicted
because you cooperated.</p>

<p> From all the people's perception of what David Koresh
taught, people perceive him to teach a violent doctrine.  I
hate guns.  I hate firearms.  That's just my nature.  I'm a
quiet person.  I never wished harm on anyone.  I certainly
didn't fire on anyone in those 51 days.  I never attempted to
harm a hair on anyone's head, in action or in intent.</p>

<p> I have been convicted of possession of a grenade.  I'm
from another country.  I've never been instructed to the
letter of the law.  Certainly on the 28th of February, 1993 I
had no wish or desire for any one of those agents to be injured.</p>

<p> I spent 51 days during that siege, during which I did my
best to make life as livable as possible inside for those that
were in there.  I took on the responsibility of trying to
maintain a communication system, a telephone line to the
outside which, under those circumstances, was very difficult.</p>

<p> So far as that grenade which I have been convicted of, I
never had any desire to possess a grenade.  The first time we
saw those grenades was on the first day of the raid, after the
initial raid had taken place.  I saw a box of maybe a half a
dozen or a dozen grenades.</p>

<p> My interest in staying the 51 days was for those people,
the women, the children, my friends.  I believe these were
innocent people.  These are people I loved very much and I
tried to help them.</p>

<p> I never had any intention or desire to possess a grenade. 
After being through 51 days of this absolute terror, it
drained practically every morsel of inner strength from you. 
I didn't have any sleep.  You had no will any more to care
about anything.  And when someone says, "Do you know how to
use one of these?" I answered, instinctively and honestly, "Yes."</p>

<p> I didn't care about it.  It could have been a feather
duster.  I didn't have any intention to cause any harm to
anyone with it.  When you are in a situation like that, you
don't want to get into an argument, a discussion.  You just
put the thing in a pocket and walk away.  I wanted to get rid
of the thing, but where are you going to put it?  There's
tanks coming through the wall.  What if one of them rolls over
it and sets the thing off?  I didn't even know how dangerous
the thing was.  I didn't even know if it would go off.  I
can't throw it outside, it would be just as dangerous out
there.  The safest, the only time to get rid of it, was in the
cinder block cell.</p>

<p> That's the testimony I want to put to you today.  If you
want to condemn me for that, then the message [you're telling]
the average person is, "Don't cooperate with authorities. 
Even if you do, they're going to come down on you like a ton
of bricks."</p>

<title>Davidian Ruth Riddle</title>
<!-- Place: San Antonio, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 16-17, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Ruth Riddle</h1>

<p>Ruth Riddle is a Branch Davidian who survived the fire. Below is a transcript
of her testimony before she and other Davidians were sentenced.</p>

<p> The transcript was posted February 18, 1995, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a>, who said,
"Below are statements eight Branch Davidians made June 16 and 17, 1994 just
before federal Judge Walter J. Smith sentenced them to a total of 240 years on
aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter and/or weapons charges ... These
statements, taken from the trial transcript in the order in
which they were made, have been edited somewhat for clarity and brevity."</p>

<hr>

<p>I'd just like to say that this whole experience has been
quite a tragedy, from my point of view and I'm sure from the
agents' and their surviving families point of view.  I feel at
it's all been based on a misunderstanding.</p>

<p> We were a people living together as a family.  We loved
one another and we cared about one another, just as I'm sure
the ATF family cares about each one in their family. And we
were living there trying to study the word of God, to learn
what was right for our day.  And the things that happened last
year need not have happened.</p>

<p> I was very saddened and moved by the things the families
of the ATF who were killed said in the [sentencing] report. 
And I was also moved by the injured ATF agents who came and
testified during the trial.  But there was injury and sadness
on both sides.  We also saw Marjorie Thomas, who was very
badly burned in the fire.</p>

<p> I'd just like to say that all these things need not have
happened, and its been a terrible tragedy and it was not my
intent, personally, that anyone be harmed in anyway.  The last
14 months have been hard on me, as I'm sure they've been on my
brothers.  And I'd like to thank the support of all our
friends and family.  And I'd like to thank the lawyers who
have spoken for us, and also the jury, who took a lot of time
to consider things for us.</p>

<p> I'd just like to say that I feel its all been based on a
misunderstanding.  And I would ask that you take all things
into consideration and grant as much leniency as possible
within the law, because I know that's your duty.  And I hope
you do the right thing.  And may God save this Court and may
God save the United States of America.</p>

<title>Davidians Appeal</title>
<!-- Place: New Orleans, Louisiana (USA) -->
<!-- Time: January 4, 1996; August 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Davidians Present Appeals</h1>

<p>Eleven Branch Davidians were tried on various charges related to their
1993 <a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">standoff</a> with
the U.S. federal government. They were <a href="index.html">tried and
sentenced</a>  in 1994. Six convicted Davidians are appealing.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1996, six Davidian attorneys gave one and a half hours
of oral arguments before a panel of three circuit court judges in
the New Orleans Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Davidians were
not allowed to be present at the appeals.</p>

<p>The Davidians' attorneys argued several main points. They argued
that the trial judge erred in not allowing self-defense as a defense
to manslaughter, when self-defense was allowed for other charges (and
used by the jury to find the defendants innocent). The "carrying a weapon
during commission of violent crime" charge should be set aside
because the defendants were found innocent of the violent crime.
The trial court used sentencing guidelines for use of illegal weapons
when only one defendant was convicted of such. Insufficient evidence
exists to convict the defendants of the specific crimes of which they
are accused.</p>

<p>In August 1996, the appeals court decided the cases. The court
affirmed the Davidians' convictions, but allowed for some reduction
in their sentences. The court ruled that Paul Fatta's conviction can be
overturned if an unrelated case currently pending decides that 
the federal government cannot ban or regulate automatic weapons. The
court also ruled that the 25-year additional sentences imposed for
using an illegal weapon are invalid, and sent the case back to the
original judge to determine whether the Davidians knew the weapons
they were carrying were illegal.</p>

<title>Waco Newspaper Reaction</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: report March 18, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Waco Newspaper Flooded With Antigovernment Commentary</h1>

<p>Rowland Nethaway, senior editor of the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>
<cite>Tribune-Herald</cite>,
in the March 18, 1993 Fort Worth <cite>Star-Telegram</cite>:</p>

<p>"My biggest surprise concerning this glut of commentary flooding into
the newspaper continues to be the volume of vehement anti-government
sentiment, which is overwhelming expressions of support for the federal
agents.  I wrote about this phenomenon in earlier columns only to be
rewarded with more anti-government calls and letters.  Most of these
people say they also would shoot armed federal agents who dared set foot
on their property.  Many feel so threatened that they are ready to start
an armed revolution against the federal government.  Strong stuff.
Bullets, not ballots.</p>

<p>"These people are not just from this area, or even from <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>.  They're
everywhere.  Those who bother me the most sound educated, articulate and
reasonable.  I expected reaction from redneck mouth-breathers.  I got
it. But it's the mass of well-spoken ones who give me the willies.
They've given up on the federal government.  It's no longer their
government."</p>

<p>The day the above was published, the <cite>Tribune-Herald</cite> recovered
the vehicles they'd left at Mount Carmel after the shootout. One was
unmarked; the other, clearly marked as newspaper property, had been run over
by a tank.</p>

<h1>IRS Harrasses Waco Survivors</h1>

<p>Hotel owner Mark Domangue wanted to help survivors of the government's
brutal assault at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>,
so he allowed several surviving Branch Davidians
to stay at his hotel, in exchange for helping him with odd jobs.</p>

<p>The IRS <em>seized</em> the Brittney Hotel, claiming that Domangue should
have collected federal withholding and unemployment taxes from people, like the
Davidians, who paid for their rooms by working odd jobs.</p>

<h2><a name=apr93>March - April 1993</a></h2>

<p>April 1993, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JayManifold.html">Jay
Manifold</a> of the Libertarian Party of Texas:</p>

<p> We have obtained (almost) uniformly sympathetic coverage of our
protests to date. Our first, held in downtown
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
 on Thursday
4 March, was covered by 5 TV stations and more radio stations
than I could keep track of. Our protests in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>
on 7, 13, and 20 March and 3 April resulted in interviews with, among others,
Argentinian, <a href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australian</a>,
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a>, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">French</a>, Italian and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japanese</a> media.</p>

<p> I have personally conducted over a dozen radio interviews,
including two in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>, and have appeared on a 2-hour radio
talk show in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>.</p>

<p> The most recent protest was covered by at least one Dallas TV
station (the ABC network affiliate).  It featured excellent
footage of a well-groomed Libertarian, accompanied by wife and
baby, elucidating our position in a clear and simple manner.  An
astonishingly friendly article appeared in yesterday's (4 April)
Dallas <cite>Morning News</cite>.</p>

<p> As a result of all of the above, the Texas LP added 5 new county
parties in the first two weeks after the raid!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name=jan94>January 1994</a></h2>

<p>January 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JayManifold.html">Jay
Manifold</a>:</p>

<p> Approximately 50 persons gathered at the Marriott Courtyard in downtown San
Antonio last Sunday evening.  For lack of anybody better, I led a sort of
organizing meeting in a conference room which the hotel was kind enough to
provide for free.  In my room, Francis Sommer (see below), Daniel Villarreal,
and myself talked late into the night.  The next morning a majority of those
present at the meeting gathered near the southeast entrance of the Federal
Courthouse in Hemisfair Park.  There were contingents from
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>,
Dallas, Fort Worth, and
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>,
as well as the locals; the Fort Worth group wore LP
T-shirts.  One <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/FIJA.html">FIJA</a> guy came
from <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>.  Don Henson
and his wife drove in
from El Paso.  Don and I stood on a traffic island in the middle of the street,
holding up a Gadsden flag (DON'T TREAD ON ME, rattlesnake, etc.). Signs
included:</p>

<pre>
                REMEMBER THE ALAMO
                 REMEMBER GOLIAD
                  REMEMBER WACO

                QUESTION AUTHORITY

                WHO ATTACKED WHOM?

           IS YOUR CHURCH ATF-APPROVED?
</pre>

<p> We conducted numerous interviews with an overwhelmingly sympathetic crowd of
reporters.  The print reporters, in particular, are furious with the ATF.  
<a href="/revolution/by_name/D/LarryDodge.html">Larry Dodge</a> got 3-4
minutes of air time on the 6 PM news on the ABC affiliate
in Dallas on Monday evening.  <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol Moore</a> informs me that
the protest was shown
on at least 2 TV stations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, DC</a>
that evening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name=feb95>February 1995</a></h2>

<p>From the March 1, 1995 Dallas <cite>Morning News</cite>:</p>

<p>On the second anniversary of the deadly federal government raid on the
Branch Davidian compound of David Koresh, a small group of protesters gathered
at the Capitol to call for an independent investigation of the siege.   Terry
Parker, a Libertarian Party member who helped organize the protest, said
Tuesday that the government needs to answer for its actions Feb.  28, 1993,
near Waco. "The reason this horrible incidnet can't be let go is you have
federal agents who came into <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>,
committed deadly acts and yet there has
been no credible investigation of criminal culpability on the part of the
government," Mr Parker said.   "The government has only examined itself, and
that's just not enough to satisfy justice. "  About 25 protesters gathered at
the Capitol carrying signs reading, "Remember the Waco Atrocity" and
"Remember the Children Who Died. " Mr.  Parker released an open letter to Gov. 
George W.  Bush in whech he asked the governor to launch a state investigation
into the federal government's actions two years ago. </p>

<h1>ATF rehires agents fired over Waco</h1>

<p>The Treasury Department's report on Waco blamed agents Phillip Chojnacki
and Chuck Sarabyn for the disaster. The two agents were placed on temporary
leave in September 1993 and were fired on October 28, 1993.</p>

<p>The two agents appealed on October 31, and under a settlement with the
BATF, received full back pay and benefits, had the incident removed from their
personnel files and returned to work in new roles January 9, 1994.</p>

<h1>Slain ATF Agents Honored</h1>

<p>In 1994, the Texas Department of Transportation erected a marker at the
intersection of FM2491 and Double E Ranch Road, near the site of
the FBI and BATF's brutal murder of the Branch Davidians, according to the
Associated Press. <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> state Rep. Keith
Oakley (D-Terrell) proposed the
resolution authorizing the marker.</p.

<p>The marker honors slain U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
Conway LeBleu, Todd McKeehan, Robert Williams and Steven Willis.</p>

<p>The marker reads in part, "We are left with more questions than answers,
but no one can question the integrity and courage of the brave men and women
who were caught in the midst of this violent and unpredictable crisis."</p>

<p>Unpredictable? The BATF trained under Green Berets in repeated mock attacks.
Violent? The BATF went in with guns blazing, despite Koresh's peaceful
relationship with local law enforcement. Where is the integrity in violating
citizens' right to keep and bear arms and right to be secure in their persons
and property? Where is the courage in using machine guns, helicopters and
armored personnel carriers to attack a religious congregation?</p>

<h1>Waco Factors Into 1994 Elections</h1>

<p>The U.S. government's
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attack on the
Branch Davidians</a> in Waco, Texas in 1993 triggered a wave of
antigovernment sentiment. This became a factor in the 1994 elections,
in which Republicans won majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate.</p>

<p>Democrat Jack Brooks, who had chaired the House hearings on Waco,
was soundly defeated by Republican Steve Stockman. One of Stockman's
commercials asks, "What did Jack Brooks have to say about what happened
to the Davidian families?", then quotes Brooks saying,
"Horrible people.  Despicable people.  Burning to death was too good for 
them.  They'd like a slower method."  The commercial shows FBI tanks 
plowing burning walls into Mt. Carmel's ruins.</p>

<h1>Waco Survivors Plant Trees at Disaster Site</h1>

<p>March 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol
Moore</a>:</p>

<p>A half-dozen Davidian survivors, a half-dozen supporters and about 30 people

<title>CWJ Protests BATF</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, D.C. (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 28, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Committee for Waco Justice Protests BATF</h1>

<p>March 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol
Moore</a>:</p>

<p>Early morning, February 28, 1995, members of the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/CWJ.html">Committee for Waco Justice</a>
leafleted employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms at their
national headquarters in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, DC</a>. 
The leaflet urged employees to report
any crimes against the Davidians to prosecutors and prove they are not part of
the Gestapo-police state mentality.</p>

<p>22 protesters rallied outside that evening to protest
BATF's fatal 1993 raid on the Branch Davidians.  Typically paranoid
BATF insisted that everyone entering the building that day
present picture I.D.  Employees of other businesses sharing
BATF's building noted that many BATF employees evidently took
a "mental health" day because the building was relatively empty.</p>

<p>Committee members also leafleted Congress on both
February 28 and March 1, passing out over 300 peices of
literature including 30 copies of the Committee's "61
Questions for Congress about Waco" to Congressional
representatives who passed by.</p>

<p>The Committee also place a $360 3"x4" advertisement in
the Washington <cite>Times</cite> reading "NO MORE HELICOPTER ATTACKS ON
AMERICANS  (with a sketch of shooting at the Mount Carmel from
a helicopter) Congress Must Investigate BATF/FBI Crimes in
Waco.  Free the Branch Davidian Prisoners!"  (Thanks to those
who contributed for the ad.  Your copy will soon be in the
mail.)</p>

<title>Cops Steal Protest Signs</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Cops Steal Waco Protest Signs</h1>

<p> April 17, 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/IanGoddard.html">Ian
Goddard</a>:</p>

<p> At an ongoing Waco protest across from the White House in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>,
Park Police ran off with the signs and personal belongings of members of the
Committee for Waco Justice and Washington Area Libertarian Alliance. The
police claimed the property was "abandoned" despite the fact that its owner
claimed and demanded its return even as the police were running away
with it.</p>

<p> As a demonstrator placed a load of signs, a backpack and a bag of
supplies at the protest site and went off to get another load, the Park
Police waited for just the right moment to swept in and run off with the
goods. When the demonstrator was a good fifty yards away the police swept
in and ran off with the property. The major display props were not
stolen.</p>

<p>A demonstrator, Ian Goddard, said, "I just arrived on the scene -- the
sight of the theft -- when I saw two Park Police hastily grab a load of our
signs and literally run off with them. I ran as fast as I could to catch up
with them. I yelled 'Stop! That's my art work.' The cop said, 'go away.' I
informed them that this was our property. They said it was abandoned
property. I said it is mine and I claim it. They said that because I was
not within 3 feet of it at the time they collected it, it is forfeit. This
regulation does apply to Lafayette Park, but not the Ellipse. Of course I
could not show them the regulations because they were in the back pack they
locked in the cruiser."</p>

<p>Mr. Goddard went on to say, "As the officers thew the stolen goods into
their cruiser I said to them, 'I thought you guys were supposed to
<em>protect property.</em>' The cop, looking stunned that a citizen would stand
his ground, said, 'I do protect property, I protect my cruiser.' The main cop
actually said I was harassing him! He then demanded to see my papers. We
also got his name and number."</p>

<p>The Park Police said that the property could be claimed at the Haynes Point
station. Six hours later we went there and they said they have never seen it
but that "abandoned property is destroyed." It remains to be seen if this
holds true, but it doesn't look good.</p>

<p>Government theft and destruction of protest signs is necessarily a
violation of free speech. The event at the Ellipse offers us an ugly and
even embarrassing glimpse of a government so desperate to destroy the truth
it fears, that it will resort to shameless petty larceny.</p>

<h1>Imprisoned Davidian Tells of Abuse</h1>

<p>Carol Valentine (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:valentine@intr.net">valentine@intr.net</a>) posted to Libernet
excerpts from a May 1995 letter sent by Davidian prisoner Livingstone
Fagan:</p>

<p>"The abuse we have received at the hands of officials of government and
others since February 1993 continues.  But in recent times, never more so than
following events in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a>. You are
probably aware that since the above
event both myself and Renos have been re-located.  I had come on the compound,
having been in in solitary for 135 days (a total of 240+ days since being at El
Reno) on April 19th, in lieu of our memorial of events in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>. 
Two days later
while in the compound library communing with Renos, we were both set upon,
cuffed and placed in solitary.  Subsequently notified of an investigation (the
reasons or conclusion we were never notified of) we were held in solitary for
several days. Finally and without notice we were moved.</p>

<p>"I understand that Renos is now housed in a facility in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Atlanta.html">Atlanta</a>.
 I arrived here in Oxford,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wi/">Wisconsin</a> on May 8. 
It is located in a rural setting.  From my
observations a significant distance from the main cities.  The officers appear
more personable.  This is in contrast to El Reno.  An even greater contrast to
Terre Haute, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/">Indiana</a>, where I stayed
for a few days during the transit process.
it was there I was to experience the must physical abuse of my entire
experience in the prison system.</p>

<p>"When I arrived and without provocation I made it clear I was unprepared to
voluntarily subject myself to the B.O.P.'s policy of disrespecting its inmates
by having them bear and spread their buttock cheeks and the rest. I was
subsequently set upon by several officers who took the opportunity for sport.
Stripping me of my clothing, I was hoisted in the air by one officer whilst the
others in jest went through the process.  When I did not cower, their jest
turned to rage.  Refusing to put on oversized clothing (a part of their jest),
I was to tightly cuffed I could not move my hands without painfully pulling on
my skin.  I coundn't even sign my name on the forms presented before me.  I was
then hurriedly taken to lockdown where I remained until my departure.</p>

<p>"On my departure I was again to be subject to the process only this time a
lot worse.  Several officers were similarly involved.  My feet were kicked from
under me whilst being slammed to the floor and my clothing virtually ripped
from me.  Again I would not cower, remaining unmoved in my demeanor throughout
the ordeal.  Their jest again turned to threatenings and profanity.  Having
dressed I was chained and again thrown to the floor.   Manipulating the chains
so that I was forced in a crouching position, but lying on my back, one officer
was on my chest mouthing in my face words to the effect, 'I'm going to treat
you like a bitch' -- the extent of his perception of femininity.  Remaining
unmoved I was allowed on my feet, then forcibly dragged hands and feet chained
to the bus. It make walking very difficult.</p>

<p>"What I found most intriguing is, of the 2 years I have been in the prison
system I have been knocked on my back twice.  On both occasions it was done by
officers.  The inmates I have found to be much more civil."</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol
Moore</a> reported the contents of a September 1996 letter from Fagan.
In June 1996 Fagan was transferred to Leavenworth where he was put
in solitary confinement (kept in a 4x8 cell 24 hours a day with one
other prisoner). Fagan wrote:</p>

<p>"My salvation remains precarious at best. I still retain the scars and
bruises from threats and physical assaults sustained since my arrival 
June 20th '96.  All of which I received at the hands of prison officers.
Last Thursday was the worst yet. After continuously slamming my head against
a concrete, then metal structure, followed by my body against a concrete floor
(the stated purpose being to get me to fear him), this 300 lb officer then
verbalized his intent to kill me for my not cowering to his will.</p>

<p>"Ordinarily the above would be considered attempted murder. In here it
seems to be the norm."</p>

<h1>Congressional Hearings on Waco</h1>

<p>In 1994, Republicans gained control of both houses of Congress,
due partly to a wave of antigovernment sentiment stirred up by the 1993
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">U.S. government
attack on the Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas. In 1995, both
houses of Congress held hearings into the incident. In true Congressional
style, the hearings were primarily a grand display of partisan political
advantage, petty showmanship and all-around incompetence.</p>

<p>The U.S. House held its hearings in July 1995, announcing its
report a year later. The Senate held its hearings on the last
day of October and the first day of November, 1995.</p>

<h2>House Hearings</h2>

<p>On the first day of the hearings, Democrats played up the emotional
testimony of Kiri Jewell, who recounted a horrifying story of being
raped by David Koresh at age ten, and of being instructed as to the best
means of suicide. Rep. Karen Thurman (D-Florida) ordered the now
fourteen-year old to read her graphic testimony on nationwide television.</p>

<p>In another camera-ready display, Rep. Charles "Asshole" Schumer (D-New
York) brandished an AK-47 rifle.</p>

<p>The hearings were sidetracked by Democrat claims that the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association's</a>
involvement in a Waco investigation "tainted" the
hearings. Of course, the Democrats had no problem with "cult busters"
rambling on at the hearings.</p>

<hr>

<h2>July 25, 1995</h2>

<p>Capt. David Byrnes, the Texas Rangers' top investigator for the Waco
incident, accused the FBI of destroying crucial evidence and failing to
communicate with other agencies.</p>

<p>Byrnes testified that bullet holes in cars parked outside the Davidians'
complex could have provided evidence about bullet trajectories, and thus
about who shot whom when. But the FBI destroyed the cars.</p>

<hr>

<h2>July 26, 1995</h2>

<p>BATF negotiator Jim Cavanaugh testified, painting the BATF as outgunned
underdogs ambushed by cannon-wielding Branch Davidians.</p>

<p>"I had a radio mike in one ear with an agent pleading for his life and I had
a guy on the phone who thought he was God," Cavanaugh said. Cavanaugh claimed
Davidians fired first. "Their guns sounded like cannons and our guns sounded
like pop guns ...  We couldn't call 911. We had to get out of this
ourselves."</p>

<p>Poor BATF. Now let's see: the BATF trains with Green Berets on a dozen
<em>attacks</em> on a mock Mount Carmel, brings along the press, and storms
out of cattle cars blasting away, but the <em>Davidians</em> were the ones
doing the ambushing. I see.</p>

<p>As to who fired first, the front door of the Davidian complex and the
cars parked outside the complex would have provided evidence (bullet holes
and trajectories). But for some reason the door disappeared and the cars
were destroyed. Hmmm.</p>

<p>As to calling 911, that's exactly what Davidians did.</p>

<p>BATF and FBI agents all testified at the hearings that they did not
believe David Koresh would ever leave Mt. Carmel willingly and would have
to be forced out.</p>

<p>When Koresh "lined up with all the children and the women in the hallway, and
they all came by to kiss his ring, he couldn't leave this place, where he was
God, with unlimited sexual favors ... and walk out to a cold jail cell,"
said Cavanaugh.</p>

<p>FBI analyst Peter Smerik, however, did admit that he was pressured to
change his recommendations from continued negotiation to another attack.
Although Smerik earlier said that pressure came from his superiors, at the
hearings he changed his tune.</p>

<p>"It was not any pressure from the FBI; it was
pressure from myself to become more of a team player," Smerik testified.
"I had received information from FBI headquarters that FBI officials were not
happy with the tone of my memos from the standpoint that they felt it was
tying their hands."</p>

<p>Experts gave testimony about the CS gas used against the Davidians
in the final raid. CS gas is a highly painful (and inflammable) substance
banned for use in war by international treaty.</p>

<p>Chemistry professor George Uhlig testified that two to four times as much
CS gas as was needed to incapacitate Mt. Carmel's inhabitants was pumped into
the complex. EPA toxicologist William Marcus testified that the children
inside would have been most affected by the gas. Other experts testified that
the CS gas probably would not have been lethal.</p>

<p>No experts testified as to the inflammability of CS gas.</p>

<hr>

<h2>July 27, 1995</h2>

<p>Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI officials defended their decision
to attack the Branch Davidian compound with CS gas and tanks.</p>

<p>Former FBI deputy directory Larry Potts said "there were extensive
internal discussions that went on for a period of several weeks" before
the decision was made.</p>

<p>Reno and the FBI said they decided to use CS gas because negotiations
were failing and they feared a mass suicide. Transcripts of negotiations,
however, give evidence against the suicide theory, and while success
wasn't clear, negotiations were not clearly failing either.</p>

<hr>

<h2>July 28, 1995</h2>

<p>Branch Davidian survivor Clive Doyle testified as to his escape from the
April 19, 1993 fire that killed 81 Davidians, including Doyle's 18-year-old
daughter Shari.</p>

<p>"I saw a huge fireball ... and I pretty well wrote everybody off at that
point," Doyle said. "I figured that no one was going to get out of there
after that. ... I personally did not see where or how the fires started. ...
We were sincerely expecting to come out. We had our bags packed."</p>

<p>Doyle claimed that BATF agents shot first, and fired from helicopters.
The FBI and BATF maintain otherwise.</p>

<p>Other testimony contradicted Doyle. Texas Rangers' summary of Doyle's
statements after the fire quote him as saying that it started with Coleman
lantern fuel inside the compound. Paul Gray, the "independent investigator"
(BATF agent) put in charge of investigating the fire testified that Doyle had
lighter fluid on his jacket sleeves.</p>

<p>Former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell and former FBI Director
William Sessions testified that President Clinton was kept informed about
the siege but that he did not interfere and that decisions were left to
Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI.</p>

<p>Hubbell, who resigned from the number three Justice Department post in
March 1994, was sentenced in June 1995 to twenty-one months in prison for
defrauding law clients. Sessions was fired in July 1993 after being mired
in a controversy over ethical misconduct.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Fort Worth <cite>Star-Telegram</cite>,
Tarrant County Medical Examiner Dr. Nizam Peerwani said he was disappointed
he was not called to testify. Peerwani said that forty of the Davidians died
from smoke inhalation, twenty from gunshot wounds (including some shot in the
back), a child was stabbed to death, and the remaining Davidians died when
the buildings on fire collapsed.</p>

<p>"A lot of these deaths were not consistent with a mass suicide," Peerwani
said.</p>

<h2>Senate Hearings: October 31, 1995 and November 1, 1995</h2>

<p>The U.S. Senate hearings were much more low-key than the House's,
with only three or four of the Judiciary Committee's 18 members in
attendance most of the time.</p>

<p>One of the main points re-iterated at the Senate hearings was
that the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team continually acted in opposition
to the FBI negotiators. Every time the negotiators would extract a
concession from the Davidians, the Hostage Rescue Team would do
something to anger the Davidians into retracting. At one point,
negotiators had twenty Davidians prepared to exit the next day;
the Hostage Rescue Team began blaring loud music throughout the night,
causing the Davidians to decide not to come out.</p>

<hr>

<h2>House Report: July 11, 1996</h2>

<p>In July 1996, the committee announced that it would soon be releasing
its report on the matter.</p>

<p>Rep. Bill Zeliff said, "There was a lot of rationalization of the deed that
had taken place ...  much of that rationalization just didn't add up;
it didn't stack up." Zeliff accused ATF agents of lying to get the
original search warrant: "ATF agents responsible for preparing the affidavits
knew or should have know that many of the statements they were making were
false."</p>

<p>Rep. McCollum suggested the FBI might be responsible for at least some of
the deaths, saying, "CS insertion into the enclosed bunker, at a time
when women and children were assembled inside an enclosed space, could
have been a proximate cause of or directly resulted in some or all of
the deaths attributed to asphyxiation in the autopsy reports."</p>

<p>The report said the President should have accepted the Attorney General's
resignation at the time of the incident, and further recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>Congress consider moving the ATF from the Treasury Department
to the Justice Department.
<li>Prosecutors press criminal charges against agents who knowingly lied to
obtain warrants.
</ul>

(House report 749) is available free from House Documents, 3rd & D Street SW,

<h1>ATF Agent Suicides Over Waco Role</h1>

<p>In July 1996, ATF Special Agent Nathaniel Medrano committed suicide
with a gun in the ATF's Los Angeles office. Merdrano wanted to sue the
Treasury Department for defamation of his character by placing
unfair blame on him for the mistakes made in the Waco assault, but
was informed the goverment cannot be sued for defamation of an agent.</p>

<p>Medrano posed as a UPS trainee about a month before the raid, and
was criticized by the Treasury investigation report for being so obvious
that David Koresh complained to the local Sheriff's office about
surveillance.</p>

<title>Wisconsin Repeals Gun Laws</title>
<!-- Place: Wisconsin (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 16, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Wisconsin repeals gun control</h1>

<p>On November 16, 1995,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wi/">Wisconsin</a> Governor
Tommy Thompson signed a law
repealing local gun control ordinances across the state, and allowing firearms
to be carried openly in public.</p>

<p>The law repeals all but two local gun control regulations. Localities
with waiting periods for handgun purchases can keep that regulation until
November 30, 1998.</p>

<p>State Attorney General and chief wanker Jim Doyle immediately called a press
conference denouncing citizens' inherent and inalienable right of self-defense
"extremely dangerous."</p>

<p>Thompson responded, "You don't see people roaming the streets, openly
waving their guns and creating mayhem ... You don't need to legislate common
sense. You can trust people." The few Wisconsin localities with laws
prohibiting open carry have never convicted anyone of doing so, he said.</p>

<p>Concealed carry will remain illegal.</p>

<title>Rayna Ross</title>
<!-- Place: Fairfax, Virginia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 29, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Rayna Ross Stalking Case</h1>

<p>February 1994, downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406), a service of the 
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
Institute for Legislative Action, Washington, DC 20036:</p>

<p>NRA DEFENDS WOMAN MARINE AGAINST OUTRAGEOUS GOVERNMENT ASSAULT ON HER
RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE by Tom Wyld.</p>

<p>
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/Fairfax.html">Fairfax</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/">Virginia</a> -- Within
days of purchasing a handgun for
self-protection, Marine Lance Corporal Rayna Ross had to use it to
defend herself. Now, within days of a federal waiting period taking
effect that could cost the lives of other crime victims like Ross,
the U.S. Marine Corps will hold a hearing to determine if her lawful
act was a criminal act.</p>

<p> "The government has hounded this woman long enough," said Michael
Patrick Murray, retired Marine Corps Colonel, counsel with the
National Rifle Association of America, and individual counsel for the
Marine Lance Corporal.  "In her suburban Virginia home, Rayna Ross 
faced deadly attack June 29, 1993, from a stalker who had attacked 
her repeatedly.  The commonwealth attorney investigated and found 
a clear-cut case of justifiable homicide.  Months after the unfortunate
incident, while Ross was on leave in  her Arkadelphia,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a>,
hometown awaiting discharge last year, the Marine Corps recalled 
her to Quantico.  For weeks, she was either stalked, attacked, or 
in hiding.  Now she faces a murder charge -- a preposterous insult 
to a victim of violent crime  --  to a mother repeatedly victimized."</p>

<p> Ross faces an Article 32 hearing (analogous to a Grand Jury) in
Quantico, Virginia, Thursday, February 17. She is presently charged
with First Degree Murder.  Such hearings are customarily open to the public.</p>

<p> "The right of self-defense is under attack," said Mrs. Tanya Metaksa
of Springfield, Virginia, newly appointed chief lobbyist of NRA's
Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA).  "The federal waiting 
period was sold as worthwhile if it saved just one innocent life. 
In Lance Corporal Ross's case, it would have cost at least one
innocent life. Self-defense is threatened by such schemes. And
self-defense is degraded and human lives cheapened when the
government targets crime victims, not crime perpetrators.  </p>

<p> "In fact and in law, the right to defend yourself against deadly
attack is fundamental. But if you think that right's a given, you're
being taken."</p>

<p> After several weeks of a nightmare of harassment and armed assaults
by Anthony Goree, another Marine, LCPL Ross purchased a semiautomatic
pistol for self-protection on June 26th, 1993.  For the sake of her
child, she had decided to stop running, stop hiding in the homes of
friends and neighbors, and return to her Woodbridge, Virginia,
apartment. It happened her first night home.  At 3 A.M. June 29th,
Goree broke into her apartment by literally dismantling a door and
went after Ross with a knife.  "She defended her life and that of
her infant daughter -- a clear-cut case of justifiable homicide,"
Murray said. </p>

<p> "After being stalked, harassed, beaten, attacked and held against her
will, LCPL Ross did the right thing," commented appointed counsel
Evan Roberts, Captain, U.S.M.C. "She pressed charges.  Her assailant
was arrested and confined to the brig June 15 after his armed
assault of Ross in her battalion office.  On June 21st, based on the
recommendations of a reviewing officer, Goree was released from the
brig and placed on base restriction.  Almost immediately, he absented
himself from the base.  Despite orders to avoid all contact with
Ross, he continued to stalk and harass her.  Declared an absentee,
Goree pursued her.  Despite the best efforts of the Marine Corps and
the Prince William County police, he was not found -- until his final
attack on LCPL Ross June 29th."</p>

<p> Ross's case is backed by the NRA Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund.  </p>

<p>Out of jail only seven weeks, a convicted burglar returned to his

pounded on the door of Curtis Schnepp's <a

Schnepp, who was taking a nap.  Schnepp got his .357 and found the man
crawling through the door.  When the man advanced after being ordered to
stop, Schnepp fired, mortally wounding him.  Schnepp's actions were later
affirmed by the county prosecutor.</p>

<p>The sound of a hunting rifle being loaded was all it took to send
a hungry intruder scurrying from a

<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>, home.
Despite a well-lit house, somebody jimmied locks, slipped through the
garage, and made his way into Benny Pruden's kitchen, while the
homeowner worked on a computer upstairs. Pruden heard the refrigerator
open, but never had the chance to actually see his unwelcome guest as
the criminal or criminals instantly fled at the sound of him loading
his .308. A purse and briefcase taken from the home were found in a
neighboring yard.</p>

stalking down the hall through the darkness when Robert Brown heard

Frightened but ready, Brown shot one of the thugs dead and was forced
to wound another after the criminal attempted to attack the homeowner
with a screwdriver. The wounded suspect and his unharmed accomplice
then escaped the house. The injured crook was later arrested.</p>

<title>Ex-boyfriend Killed</title>
<!-- Place: Lebanon, Pennsylvania (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Ex-boyfriend Killed</h1>

<p>When Barbara Weaver ended her relationship with John Boyer III,
Boyer publicly threatened to kill her and himself. Weaver obtained
a protection-from-abuse order (restraining order) against Boyer,
barring him from her vicinity.</p>

<p>Weaver sought refuge in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Lebanon.html">Lebanon</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a> home
of Brian Scott Mase. On May 21, 1995, Boyer showed up at the Mase home, and
Weaver called the police, who made him leave (but according to
the order were supposed to arrest him).</p>

<p>Boyer later returned to the Mase home. Mase retrieved his father's
M-1A carbine rifle and told him to leave. Instead, Boyer entered and
grabbed a wooden object, which Mase thought was a baseball bat, and
Weaver thought was a skateboard.</p>

<p>Mase fired one shot, hitting Boyer in the stomach and killing him.</p>

<p>Police arrested Mase for homicide, and a judge denied him bail. Mase
will spend at least six months in jail awaiting trial. His grandparents
have sold their home to help pay for his legal defense.</p>

<p>Mase's father decided to go to the Internet for help.
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.leba.net/~rickmase/">Richard Mase</a>
has put on the World Wide Web news stories and other information about
the case.</p>

<p>District Attorney Bradford Charles, not too happy about the Internet
site, asked the judge to bar Brian Mase and his attorney from talking
to Richard Mase. The judge ruled against Charles, allowing Mase to
continue his Internet presence.</p>

<p>Tax-deductible contributions for Brian Mase's defense can be sent to the
Gun Owners Foundation, 8001 Forbes Place, Suite 102, Springfield Va. 22151.
Write "Brian Mase" in the memo field of the check. Checks can also be sent
direct to Brian's dad, although they will not be tax deductible, at Brian
Mase Defense Fund, 254 S. 12th St., rear, Lebanon, Penn. 17042.</p>

owner Harold Lambert's gun from beside the cash register and pointed it at his

bravado turned sour, however, when Lambert's wife, Marilyn, pulled her
own .25 auto and aimed it at the gun-wielding robber. Backing out of
the store, the bandit joined his accomplice standing guard outside,
and fled, firing shots through the window. Pursued by Lambert and two
other business owners on foot, the delinquents jumped in a car but
were apprehended by police just three blocks away.</p>

<h1>Man Arrested for Self-Defense</h1>

<p>On May 15, 1995, Aaron Davis and his girlfriend were accosted by
four drunks in a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Vacaville.html">Vacaville</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> park. Davis
and his girlfriend evaded
the drunks, but two of them found them in the park, assaulted Davis,
and threatened to rape his girlfriend.</p>

<p>Davis defended himself with a Swiss Army knife, sending both attackers
to the hospital, where one of them died.</p>

<p>After investigating the matter, the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Solano.html">Solano County</a>
District Attorney's
office declined to press charges, stating that Davis had acted in self-defense
after exhausting other means of protecting himself.</p>

<p>Davis and his family immediately became the target of death threats by
friends of the attackers. Vacaville police moved Davis to a safe house
outside town.</p>

<p>Davis was fired from his job at a Vacaville grocery store after a thug
threatened to kill Davis in the store. The store manager did not want any
such retaliation to occur at the store.</p>

<p>Davis spent the two months after the knifing in and out of various safe
houses to protect his life.</p>

<p>On July 19, 1995, Davis and his girlfriend were followed home by about
five people in a car. When Davis arrived home and left his car, "Sonny"
Shairer got out of the other car and threatened Davis' life.</p>

<p>Davis pulled out a Glock .40 handgun and killed Shairer with a single
shot. The remaining thugs fled in their car.</p>

<p>The Vacaville police, instead of treating Davis as a hero, arrested
Davis and seized <em>all</em> his firearms stored in a gun safe <em>in
his house</em>. Before they would release Davis, the police forced Davis'
father to give up all <em>his</em> firearms!</p>

<p>Making a tragic situation worse, the Vacaville police have disarmed
a family who are under constant threat by local thugs.</p>

shopkeeper Dalton Waterman, 70, was shot
during a robbery attempt two years ago and swore next time he would
shoot back -- he did. When a man stormed into his store and pointed a
pistol at Waterman, demanding cash, the senior citizen reactively
ducked behind the counter, drew his .38, and cut loose with a shot in
the intruder's direction. Waterman missed his target, but it was
enough to send the crook bolting from the store.</p>

<p>It took <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a> Life Member

arrest of one of California's most-wanted fugitives Suspected of more
than 15 home invasions and numerous robberies in which elderly
residents suffered severe beatings, the thug dove through an open
bedroom window and attacked Tiller and his wife in his typical
fashion. Untypical was the ensuing struggle where Tiller shot the
fugitive four times before the man fled the home. The criminal later
turned up in a hospital where police arrested him in connection to the
string of savage attacks.</p>

resident George Kelly found a man with a butcher knife
waiting in his shower. The intruder, convicted burglar and child molester
Joe Lewis, lunged at Kelly, slashing him with the knife.</p>

<p>Kelly managed to retrieve his 9mm handgun and shoot Lewis in the chest.
Lewis appeared unaffected, and Kelly ran out his back door, hoping to
attract Lewis out of the house and away from his pregnant wife and their
seven-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>Lewis remained in the house, threatening Kelly's wife. Kelly ran back in,
tackled Lewis, then gathered his family upstairs. Police found the intruder
barricaded in the family's nursery. Lewis later died at a hospital, and
Kelly's slash wound required sixteen stiches to close.</p>

holding an 18-year-old kid at bay with a handgun."</p>

<h1>Woman Shoots Mugger</h1>

<p>When a mugger in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/Detroit.html">Detroit</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> tugged at
Sheila Cole's purse, it
ripped open, spilling its contents including a .38 caliber revolver. Cole
grabbed the handgun and shot the criminal twice. Onlookers then beat and
kicked the man until police arrived.</p>

<p>Police charged the mugger with robbery, and seized Cole's revolver as
evidence. Cole immediately bought a new one.</p>

<p>"All those years I've had the gun, I never, ever thought I'd shoot
somebody," Cole said, but, "I'd do it again. You bet I would. I'm glad I
stopped him. He'll not do that again to someone else."</p>

<p>Michigan has Concealed Weapons permits, which waive the Brady Act's
waiting period. If the waiting period applied, Cole would have been
defenseless after her revolver was seized. If the weapon permit had not
been available, she would have been mugged or worse.</p>

<title>Carjacker Killed</title>
<!-- Place: Coral Springs, Florida (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 24, 1995 -->

<body>

<h1>Carjacker Killed By Victim</h1>

<p>July 24, 1995 Coral Springs Police Department press releases:</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/CoralSprings.html">Coral
Springs</a> [, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>]
Police are investigating a carjacking that resulted in the
death of one of the subjects. At approximately 7:20am, an owner of a Lexus
stopped at a car wash in the 9200 block of Wiles Road. He was approached by
a subject armed with a handgun (revolver) and was ordered at gunpoint out
of the vehicle and into the trunk.</p>

<p>The subject stopped the Lexus approximately two blocks away, fearing the
victim had a cellular phone in the trunk. (He had noticed that no phone was
visible in the passenger compartment and thought the victim may have taken
it with him when he climbed into the trunk.) When the subject opened the
trunk, the victim exited the trunk - now armed with two handguns that were
stored in the trunk (a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol). The victim
ordered the subject to ground (he told him to lie down on the ground). (The
victim also shouted to nearby pedestrians to call 911 and alert police.)</p>

<p>However the subject made a move to his pocket and in fear for his safety,
the victim shot the subject (in the lower abdomen). A second subject,
driving a blue station wagon, attempted to run down the Lexus owner (who
shot at the driver, taking out the window of the station wagon but missing
the second suspect). Officer Willie Jackson was able to provide an
accurate description of the station wagon. Officer Karl Milenkovic located
the subject in the 2000 block of University Drive and arrested him without
incident.</p>

<p>The first subject died at North Broward Medical Center.</p>

<p>Coral Springs Police have identified the suspects involved in today's
carjacking. The deceased was identified as Carl Lee Reese, DOB 10/12/73.

the reason libertarians have had such limited success politically
is that most libertarians would rather do <em>anything</em>

<title>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: contemporary -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</h1>

<p>Sometime around 1991, Libertarian activist
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> began
a series of tips, tactics, strategies, and case studies that became
known as "Tom's Tips" and proved invaluable to activists across
the country trying to learn how to grow their parties and run
campaigns. This web page has grown from that effort and now includes
articles from many people.</p>

<p>The premier resource for Libertarian activists is the outstanding
newsletter <cite>Libertarian Volunteer</cite>, edited by LP Communications
Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>.
It is simply the best newsletter in the libertarian movement. It is
written for LP volunteers, activists, officers, and candidates. If you are
one of those, send your request to Bill Winter to get on that mailing
list.</p>

<h1>Cato Institute</h1>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato Institute</a> "think
tank" is perhaps the most influential libertarian organization in politics
today. Cato's policy recommendations have become especially well-heard in the
new Republican Congress.</p>

<p>Cato traces its origins to millionaire <a
href="/revolution/by_name/K/CharlesKoch.html">Charles Koch</a>, of Koch
Industries, the wealthiest privately-held company in the U.S. Koch spent
millions to found Cato and recruited then-Libertarian Party Chair <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/EdCrane.html">Ed Crane</a> to head the new
organization.</p>

<title>Not a Penny More</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: July 1993 - ??? -->
</head>

<h1>Not a Penny More</h1>

<p>Not a Penny More was a national campaign in 1993 to collect pledges to
reduce the federal deficit, payable only if the federal government managed
to pass a budget that spent even one cent less than the previous year's.
Needless to say, the money was never collected.</p>

<p>Not a Penny More is particularly notable because it was one of the first
nationwide political issue campaigns to be organized over the Internet.
Providing immense power to the individual, the Internet is becoming a force to
be reckoned with in national politics. The De-Foley-Ate Congress campaign to
un-elect Thomas Foley is another example of the Internet's growing
influence.</p>

<p>On February 28, 1993, Libertarian Party member <a
href="/revolution/by_name/K/EricKlien.html">Eric Klien</a> of Las Vegas,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a> promised
to give $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury if President Clinton
reduced Federal spending one penny. Mr. Klien even offered to allow for
inflation and population growth.</p>

<p>Klien's challenge led
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> area resident <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/ThomasRush.html">Thomas Rush</a> to start Not
a Penny More in order to collect one hundred million dollars in such pledges to
reduce the national debt.</p>

<p>Not a Penny More coordinators collected signatures on pledge letters
addressed to President Clinton that said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the Federal debt is the most serious problem facing this
country today, and that the only way to control the growth of the debt is to
stop the growth of government spending in actual dollars. We have all seen that
cuts in projected spending increases do not reduce the deficit.</p>

<p>How serious are you about deficit reduction and cutting spending, Mr.
President? I'm so serious that I hereby pledge $________ to be applied to the
Federal debt, payable in the event that you sign a budget that spends Not A
Penny More than the initial 1993 authorized Federal expenditures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of Rush's purpose was to expose Congressional doublespeak on the
subject of budget cuts. In a July 1993 news release, Rush said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite its talk of spending cuts, the Federal government is planning on
spending at least $350 more for each taxpayer in 1994 than the 1993 budget
authorized. That adds up to a whopping $67 billion in new spending, according
to President Clinton's budget proposal.</p>

<p>"When Americans look at their new, higher tax bills next year, they will
have a right to ask where the money is going. Contrary to what Washington wants
us to believe, any new tax revenue is being swallowed up by this torrent of new
spending. Worse yet, only a fraction of the 'cuts' President Clinton proposes
are new proposals to cut the size of programs," commented Thomas Rush, Not A
Penny More's National Coordinator. "$60 billion in savings are hoped for from
lower interest rates, not making government smaller. $44 billion is being
'double counted': it was already in the 1990 budget agreement. Then there is
$15 billion in higher user fees that the President calls spending cuts.</p>

<p>... In just four weeks, volunteers have signed up as state coordinators in
nearly 20 states, and collected Not A Penny More pledges worth about $200,000
of debt-reduction from a hundred-plus pledgers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a Penny More received favorable press coverage in several states. From
the  July 21, 1993 Madison, Wisconsin <cite>Capital Times</cite>:

<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Rush wants to save America.</p>

<p>In almost a David vs. Goliath effort, the 35 year old computer company
systems analyst has started a group to raise $100 million in pledges to reduce
the federal debt.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wi/">Wisconsin</a>
coordinator <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/RobertHess.html">Robert
Hess</a>, an unmarried University of
Wisconsin-Madison graduate student in biophysics, said he got involved because
"I just wanted to do my part."</p>

<p>"I do plan to have children and don't want the nation to be in debt. My
children are $16,000 in debt without even being born," the 24-year-old
said.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>New Zealand Libertarians form Party</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/NewZealand/">New Zealand</a>
libertarians, including a former finance minister, have formed
ACT New Zealand, a libertarian-oriented political party.</p>

<p>New Zealand long was a bastion of the welfare state. Then, Sir Roger
Douglas, a Labour Party finance minister, began a series of libertarian
economic reforms in 1984 helping New Zealand become the fastest-growing
economy in the industrialized world.</p>

<p>One of the discouraging things about libertarianism is how many people
continue to oppose it in the face of overwhelming success. But I suppose it's
only to be expected from people who continue to support welfarism in the face
of overwhelming failure.</p>

<p>Douglas is widely respected outside New Zealand, but has high unfavorable
ratings inside the country. The press opposed his wide-ranging reforms, which
included privatizing the post office.</p>

<p>The new party's philosophy is spelled out in Douglas' new book,
<cite>Unfinished Business</cite>. ACT New Zealand wants to eliminate
government in health, education and pensions, and abolish the income tax.</p>

<p>Like many libertarian organizations, ACT New Zealand attracts not only
people dissatisfied with the major parties (Labour and National), but also
people who have never been involved in politics before.</p>

<title>Third Parties</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1832 - 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Minor Parties in the United States</h1>

<p>Many people look down on third parties for not having any effect, and tell
third-party voters not to "waste your vote."</p>

<p>U.S. history shows third parties have had, and continue to have, significant
effects on the political system, even when they don't win elections.</p>

<h2>History of Third Parties</h2>

<p>Not that minor parties had an auspicious beginning. According to Richard
Brookhiser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first presidential candidate of a third party in American history was
William Wirt, a former United States Attorney General and biographer of Patrick
Henry, who received the nomination of the Anti-Masonic Party for the election of
1832. A diffident man, Wirt informed his supporters that he saw nothing wrong
with Masonry, and that if his views disturbed them, he would willingly step
aside. But the Anti-Masons ignored the demurral, and Wirt and his running-mate,
Amos Elimaker, swept the state of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/vt/">Vermont</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minor parties focusing on single issues often have succeeded in their goal,
even when they do not win elections. Abolition of slavery, homesteading, income
taxes and Prohibition were all issues raised by minor parties.</p>

<p>Third parties have had success, however. The Republican Party was a minor
party when it won the Presidency in 1860.</p>

<h2>Myths of Third Parties</h2>

<p>November 1993, from Bob Waldrop (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:72204.3421@compuserve.com">72204.3421@compuserve.com</a>):</p>

<p>In the article "Presidential Power" by political scientist Theodore
Lowi, published in <cite>Political Science Quarterly</cite>, Volume 100,
Number 2, Summer 1985 (transcribed without permission), the
author considers several popular myths about the two party system
and minor parties in America.  Myths 4 and 5, on the "Wasted
Vote" issue, seemed particularly interesting:</p>

<p>Myth 4: A vote for a third-party candidate is a wasted vote.</p>

<p>Myth 5: A vote for a third party candidate is a mischievous vote, more
powerful than a vote for one of the major party candidates, because
it helps elect the worst of the two major candidates.</p>

<p>These two myths are taken together because they give
contradictory arguments against supporting a third party and
thereby prove that myths need not be consistent to be effective. </p>

<p>Take number 5 first.  It operates on the very questionable
assumption that one of the major candidates is clearly better
than the other.  But what are voters to do if they have concluded
that both major candidates are worse?  Recognizing that
absurdity, many voters become nonvoters.  Since non-voting is
stigmatized, nonvoters are usually quiet, thus depriving their
nonvote of the influence it should have.  Nonvoting, when done
loudly, is an important form of participation.  But by the same
logic, so is a vote for a candidate for a third party, which is
the short answer to myth 4.  A vote for a third party candidate
is never wasted.  If the vote is for a dissident party, it is a
protest vote that can instill considerable anxiety in the
leadership of the major parties.  If the vote is for a
programmatic third party, a more substantive message is sent; and
history shows that these messages are almost always received by
the leaders of the major parties.</p>

<p>There is still another type of third party, and a vote for it would be the
most effective of all -- if a party of that sort were made available.  This is
an
electorally based third party; a third party just like the two
major parties, just as pragmatic, just as concerned with winning
elections.  Creating such a party on a national scale has not
been tried seriously since the Progressives tried it in 1912. 
The very presence of such a third party would make a fundamental
difference to the political system.</p>

<title>Famous Libertarians</title>

<h1>Famous Libertarians</h1>

<p>You know you've hit it big time when you've got actors and musicians
advocating your cause.</p>

<p>Famous libertarians include:</p>
<dl>
<p>
<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/B/DaveBarry.html">Dave Barry.</a></dt>
<dd>The syndicated humorist supports the Libertarian Party and advocates
libertarian ideas frequently in his weekly humor column and his popular
books.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Penn Gillette.</dt>
<dd>Half of the magician duo Penn and Teller, Gillette is a Libertarian
Party supporter.</dd>

<p>
<dt>John Laroquette.</dt>
<dd>The popular actor who became famous with "Night Court" is
registered to vote as a Libertarian. On an irrelevant personal note,
he attended the same high school I did in New Orleans (though many
years earlier, and only briefly before being kicked out!).</dd>

<p>
<dt>Michael Moriarty.</dt>
<dd>The award-winning actor and pianist-composer advocates libertarian
goals. He condemns the federal government as an emerging police state, citing
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Waco</a> and
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/rubyridge/">Ruby Ridge</a>
as examples, and he supports drug legalization. Moriarty is an Emmy, Tony
and Golden Globe award winning actor, as well as a classical and jazz
pianist with three CDs released.</dd>

<p>
<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/S/HowardStern.html">Howard Stern</a>.</dt>
<dd>The nationally carried "shock jock" radio personality won the
Libertarian Party nomination for governor of New York (before he dropped out
of the race). Stern is a strong advocate of free speech and personal
freedom.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Mojo Nixon.</dt>
<dd>The rockabilly musician is a Libertarian Party supporter.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Ted Nugent.</dt>
<dd>The rock star (most famous for "Cat Scratch Fever") and avid sportsman
supports gun rights and endorsed a Libertarian Party candidate for U.S.
Senator in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>.</dd>

<p>
<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/O/PJORourke.html">P. J. O'Rourke.</a></dt>
<dd>Although the humorist calls himself a "Republican Party Reptile,"
it is hard to imagine a Republican advocating drugs and fast cars. O'Rourke
has written for <cite>National Lampoon</cite>, <cite>Car and
Driver</cite> and <cite>Rolling Stone</cite> magazines and is the
author of numerous books.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Kurt Russell.</dt>
<dd>The star of <cite>Escape from New York</cite>, <cite>Escape from
L.A.</cite>, <cite>Big Trouble in Little China</cite> and many more is
registered to vote as a Libertarian.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Barry Williams ("Dr. Demento").</dt>
<dd>The radio show host and collector of unusual recordings is a
Libertarian Party supporter.</dd>

<p>
<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/P/VirginiaPostrel.html">Virginia Postrel.</a></dt>
<dd>Editor of <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite></a>
	magazine, the sixth largest political magazine in the U.S. Now
	that's she's appeared on Comedy Central's "Politically Incorrect"
	she gets a "famous" rating. :-)</dd>

<p>
<dt><a href="/revolution/science/nobel.html">Nobel Prize
	winners</a></dt>
<dd>Quite a few recipients of the Nobel Prize have been
libertarians, including economist <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/MiltonFriedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Science fiction writers.</dt>
<dd>Many science fiction authors are libertarian, including Robert Heinlein,
L. Neil Smith, J. Neil Schulman, Victor Koman and many others.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Kinda Sorta Maybes</h2>

<p>In addition to self-described libertarians, there are many famous
personalities who have expressed sympathy with libertarian ideas or
expressed those ideas themselves.</p>

<dl>
<p>
<dt>John Carpenter.</dt>
<dd>A television station called the <cite>Escape from L.A.</cite> director
a libertarian.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Hugh Downs.</dt>
<dd>Downs' commentary in the "Perspective" nationwide radio program has
included opposition to the drug war and Internet censorship, as well
as a call to have Harry Browne in the 1996 presidential debates.
"Some Americans who have read his book <cite>Why Government
Doesn't Work</cite> are wondering why they ever voted for those other
two parties," said Downs, after commenting favorably on the LP's longevity,
electoral successes and general beliefs.</dd>

<p>
<dt>David Letterman and Sandra Bernhardt.</dt>
<dd>Close call on this one. In 1988 on Late Night with David Letterman,
Letterman asked Berhnardt who she was voting for for president. Bernhardt
replied, "That Libertarian guy," and Dave said, "Yeah me too." Letterman
has generally been one to mock rather than support government agencies.</dd>

<p>
<dt>Mary Matalin.</dt>
<dd>The well-known Republican political commentator once said of Libertarian
presidential candidate Harry Browne, "I support Browne in the debates, he
has lots of good ideas, I don't agree with them all, and I'm not going to
vote for him ... or wait ... maybe I will vote for him!"</dd>

<title>Libertarian Challenge</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: January 10, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Party Issues "Challenge to the Republicans"</h1>

<p>NEWS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY, 1528 Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Washington DC
20003. For immediate release: January 10, 1995. For additional information:
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>, Director of
Communications.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party has challenged the Republican Party to live up 
to its 1994 campaign promises, and "drastically reduce the size of the federal
government."</p>

<p>In a strongly worded "Challenge to the Republicans" - hand-delivered 
to the offices of Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader 
Richard Armey, and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole - Libertarian Party 
National Chair <a href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve
Dasbach</a> urged the GOP to immediately abolish 21 federal 
programs, agencies, and policies.</p>

<p>"The ball is in the court of the Republican Party now. The next six 
months will determine if Republicans can be trusted to start eliminating or 
defunding many of the federal government programs and agencies that have no 
place in a free society," said Dasbach.</p>

<p>On the Libertarian Party's 21-item "hit list" were Amtrak, the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Civilian Marksman Program, Steamtown 
USA, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Selective Service, the Economic 
Development Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission, Fossil Energy
Research, the Davis Bacon Act, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the 
National Service Program.</p>

<p>Also included were FCC controls on 900 lines and cable TV, subsidized 
grazing fees, the space station, the DC Domestic Partners regulation, shipping
quotas and subsidies, the Overseas Marketing Board, the semi-automatic weapons
ban, several "War On Drugs" civil liberties violations, and unnecessary NATO
and UN military spending.</p>

<p>"This is not just some idle wish list," stressed Dasbach. "Legislation
has previously been introduced in the House or Senate to abolish most of the 
items on the Libertarian list. In the past, these efforts have been defeated. 
Often, many Republican members of Congress failed to support attempts to 
abolish these wasteful and useless government programs. Now is the time to
act!"</p>

<p>If fully implemented, the "Challenge to the Republicans" would produce
immediate savings to the taxpayers of at least $4.5 billion, and could 
ultimately reduce the federal budget by hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>"The eyes of the Libertarian Party - and the eyes of all American 
voters - will be on the Republicans. How successful will they be? Will they 
carry out the mandate given to them by the American voter last November? Will 
they drastically reduce the size of the federal government? As America's third
largest political party, we will be closely evaluating the job they do," vowed
Dasbach.</p>

<title>LP '94 Membership Plans</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Membership Strategy for 1994</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a>,
responding to a post by Kevin Brooke:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found Joe's latest posting of membership statistics to be revealing.
First off, it shows that we are a long way off from Steve Dasbach's goal
of doubling membership by next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kevin is right that we have a long way to go before we succeed in
doubling our membership/contributor base. However, when the
Executive Committee set that goal in October, we also developed
an action plan and budgeted the funds necessary to achieve it. In
December, that budget was approved by the entire LNC.</p>

<p>Our goal, as set by the Executive Committee, is to double our
contributor base (members and subscribers) prior to the 1996
convention. (My personal goal is to double it by the delegate
allocation deadline in 1995).</p>

<p>To achieve this kind of dramatic growth in our base of support,
we have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the percentage of Libertarian Party contributors who
fail to renew each year;
<li>Increase the percentage of inquiries (either to LPHQ or the
800-number) who decide to join (or subscribe);
<li>Generate more inquiries;
<li>Aggressively work to return lapsed contributors to active status;
<li>Use direct mail to prospect for new members, and;
<li>Test and revise materials continuously to improve their effectiveness.
</ol>

<p>Our plan was to focus first on the failure of current
contributors to renew. The best data we have suggests that 40% of
contributors fail to renew each year. That means if we start the
year with 10,000 contributors, we must bring in 4000 new people
just to break even. It's hard to grow when you're losing people
that rapidly.</p>

<p>In the past, our membership growth activities have focused on
bringing in new members. That's like keeping a bleeding patient
alive by continuously transfusing new blood. We felt that it made
more sense to try to stop the bleeding first.</p>

<p>The best data we have indicates that the principal reason that
people fail to renew is the sense they have that we are not
making enough progress. We decided to tackle that issue in two
ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop and implement activities (such as Project Healthy
Choice) that would generate tangible successes, and;
<li>Communicate our successes regularly to the membership through
LP News and our direct mail fundraising program.
</ol>

<p>Project Healthy Choice (PHC) got off the ground in November of
1993. Our vision of "small steps, big payoff" and commitment to
regularly communicate our successes to our contributors was
detailed in the December direct mail letter. The first PHC
successes were covered in the January issue of LP News and the
January direct mail letter detailed more success on a variety of
topics.</p>

<p>I believe we are already beginning to see the results in our
contributor statistics:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Date</th>	<th>Members</th><th>Subscribers</th>
	<th>Total contributors</th></tr>
<tr><td>2/28/93</td>	<td>11627</td>	<td>2609</td>	<td>14236</td></tr>
<tr><td>12/31/93</td>	<td>9565</td>	<td>1885</td>	<td>11450</td></tr>
<tr><td>1/31/94</td>	<td>9552</td>	<td>1898</td>	<td>11450</td></tr>
<tr><td>2/28/94</td>	<td>9473</td>	<td>1942</td>	<td>11415</td></tr>
<tr><td>3/31/94</td>	<td>9539</td>	<td>2009</td>	<td>11518</td></tr>
</table>

<p>From February to December 1993, we experienced an average net
loss of 279 contributors each month. From December 1993 to March
of 1994, our number of contributors has grown slightly. Since
there has been no significant increase in inquiries processed by
LPHQ during this time, it appears that we are experiencing a
significant increase in renewal rates.</p>

<p>National Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/PerryWillis.html">Perry
Willis</a> has also revised our entire cycle
of renewal letters and we are now able to track the percentage of
people who renew as a result of each letter.</p>

<p>The next release of our database program (scheduled for June '94)
will allow split-list testing of renewal letters, so we can
further improve their effectiveness.</p>

<p>The next step in our plan to is to increase the percentage of
inquiries to LPHQ and the 800 number who join the LP. Currently,
less than 10% of inquiries join the LP (the percentage varies
depending on the source of the inquiry). Based on his experience
in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill
Winter</a> believes that we should be able to
achieve a rate approaching 20% by improving the quality of the
materials we send to inquiries and by changing the way in which
we respond.</p>

<p>Until recently, 800-number inquiries were sent a slick brochure
with a cover letter signed by ex-National Director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/NickDunbar.html">Nick Dunbar</a>.
The letter did not make a membership pitch but instead indicated
that more information would be forthcoming. That information pack
and a copy of <cite>Liberty Today</cite> was supposed to be sent within a few
weeks. There have been many instances in the past where people
did not receive the information pack at all, or else it was sent
months after the initial inquiry. </p>

<p>The staffing and procedures at LPHQ have been improved to prevent
problems with information pack mailings. Bill Winter has revised
the content and improved the quality of the information pack and
a new first response letter has been written that asks the person
to join right away. Bill has also drafted a one page flyer (10
Answers to Commonly Asked Questions about the LP) that addresses
the most common reasons that people give for not joining. As soon
as it is approved by the Advertising and Publications Review
Committee (APRC), it will be added to the first response mailing.</p>

<p>Sometime this summer, we expect to replace the two part mailing
process with a single information pack mailing direct from the
800 number company. That means that inquiries will receive
everything they need to evaluate the LP and make a decision about
joining within days of their call. To do this, our current
materials have to be re-designed to fit the maximum size (6" by
9") and weight requirements of the 800-number company.</p>

<p>Now that we have increased our renewal rate, we will be turning
our attention to lapsed members. We hope that by communicating
our successes to them, we can get many to renew their commitment
to the LP just as our current members are doing.</p>

<p>Once we have confirmation that we have increased the rate at
which inquiries are joining the LP, we will be stepping up our
efforts to generate more inquiries. And, of course, we can
anticipate more inquiries as a result of 1994 campaigns.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we are preparing to mail (over the next few
months) membership prospecting letters to two mailing lists that
have generated hundreds of new members in the past. A test
mailing of 5000 has been already been printed and stuffed - it
should be in the mail by the end of next week. If successful, we
will mail the same letter to the rest of the list. The same
process will be followed for the other list.</p>

<p>Mailing successfully to untried lists requires the ability to do
split-list testing, which is scheduled for our next software
upgrade (June '94). By then, the first two mailings should be
completed.</p>

<p>The following phases of our membership growth plan will be
developed based on the data collected during these first few
months. We will expand what works, change what doesn't, and
document everything for the future.</p>

<p>Doubling our contributor base by the next convention is a
challenging goal, but I am convinced that, like achieving
universal ballot access in 1992, it can be done. The challenge
now is to do it.</p>

<title>A-Z Spending Cuts</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: alert May 16, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Republicans Ask Libertarian Help for Spending Cuts</h1>

<p>Informational Alert for Libertarians<br>
from the National Libertarian Party Headquarters<br>
May 16, 1994<br></p>

<p>Friends:</p>

<p>You may have seen the press release issued recently by the National LP
office about the "A-Z Spending Cut Plan." In it, National Chair <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a>
urged Libertarians to lobby for the bill, which could potentially slash
billions of dollars from the federal budget.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the bill, and some background information, in case
you would like to help lobby. More information will be in the next issue of
<cite>LP News</cite>, and the <cite>Liberty Pledge News</cite>.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a><br>
Director of Communications<br>
Libertarian Party<br></p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>THE SITUATION:
        The "A-Z Spending Cut Plan" - sponsored by Rep. Bill Zeliff (R-NH) and
Rep. Rob Andrews (D-NJ) - is being stonewalled in Congress by Speaker of the 
House Tom Foley.</p>

<p>Last August, a majority of House members - 160 Republicans and 74 
Democrats - signed a letter to Foley endorsing a special session to cut 
spending. However, Foley refused to act. Now Zeliff and Andrews are trying to 
gather the signatures of 218 House members on a discharge petition, which 
would bypass the leadership and force the bill onto the floor of the House.
</p>

<li><p>HOW THE LP GOT INVOLVED:
        The LP got involved with the bill when Chip Griffin, legislative 
assistant to Rep. Zeliff, called the National headquarters on May 11th to ask 
for assistance.</p>

<li><p>WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT: National Director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/W/PerryWillis.html">Perry Willis</a> said.
"As far as I know, the National 
LP has never been asked for help by a U.S. Congressman before. This is an 
excellent opportunity for us to become a more serious player in Washington 
politics."</p>

<li><p>THE DETAILS:
        The "A-Z Spending Cut Plan" consists of two parts:
<ul>
        <li>House Resolution 406, allocating 56 hours to debate proposals to 
reduce government spending. There would be an on-the-record "yes or no" vote 
on each specific spending cut. No tax increases could be considered.
        <li>House Bill 3266, which provides for automatic reductions in 
Congressional spending limits by the amount of the cuts.
</ul></p>

<li><p>WHAT YOU CAN DO:
        Call or write your Congressperson as soon as possible. Ask them if 
they have signed the discharge petition for the "A-Z Spending Cut Plan." If 
not, urge them to do so immediately.</p>

<p>        Here's how to contact your U.S. Representative in Washington DC:
        Write: The Hon. ______, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington DC 
20515.
        Call: The telephone switchboard for all members of Congress is (202) 
224-3121.</p>

<h1>News Election Service</h1>

<p>From Bob Waldrop (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><A

Bob.Waldrop@f418.n104.z1.fidonet.org</a>):</p>

<p>The January 1993 issue of <cite>Campaigns and Elections</cite> has a second
article of great interest to Libertarians.  "And with all precincts reporting,
the winner is ... but who's counting, anyway?" discusses the NES vote total
election scam.  Some gems from the article:</p>

<p>"The vote percentages reported by television networks on election night were
often inaccurate -- and not just because they were unofficial estimates.  In
most cases, vote totals of the top two candidates. . . added up to 100
percent, even if a third-party candidate polled more than 1% of the vote."</p>

<p>"'The results we report are 100% of what we count,' said Bob Flaherty,
executived director of the News Election Service. . . The problem, however,
lies in what they don't count. . . NES only reported totals for 'candidates
who have a meaningful impact on the race', said Flaherty."</p>

<p>"When the number of votes cast for a third candidate was not deemed
'meaningful', NES simply made the votes. . . total 100%.  That means that in
any given race in which a third party candidate received even 1% of the vote,
the returns dictated by the NES and quoted by its five major news services
were inaccurate."</p>

<p>The article then discusses the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a> Senate
race, where Libertarian
John Perry received 5% of the vote.</p>

<p>"Results for that race provided by AP two days after the election still
reported 51% for Specter and 49% for Yeakel."</p>

<p>The article discussed Jim Hudson in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>.</p>

<p>"NES did consider Hudson to be a newsworthy candidate, and all the networks
made mention of him on election night."</p>

<p>"Many publications including <cite>Campaigns and Elections</cite> use
figures from AP instead of going through the tedious process of calling the
boards of election in every state ... So, the results in the Pennsylvania
Senate race, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> 8th CD and
other incorrectly reported three way races in
1992 will go down in history -- wrong."</p>

<title>Major Parties' Response</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: analysis January 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Major Party Response to Minor Party Threats</h1>

<p>From Bob Waldrop <Bob.Waldrop@f418.n104.z1.fidonet.org>:</p>

<p>The January 1993 issue of <cite>Campaigns and Elections</cite> has an
article entitled "When Two's a Race and Three's a Crowd:  Winning When There's
One Candidate Too Many." The article is by two professional consultants working
for
Fairbank, Maullin and Associates, an opinion research and public policy
analysis company in Santa Monica, Ca.</p>

<p>Some "gems" from the article include:</p>

<p>"The year of the woman?  To be sure, but 1992 was also the year of the third
party.  H Ross Perot and his 19 million votes for president is only the most
visible symbol of the growth of the third party. . . In fact. . . third party
candidates had a bigger impact on the 92 election than ever before."</p>

<p>"... third party candidates are developing momentum at all political levels
..."</p>

<p>"This all means that Democratic and Republican campaign professionals can no
longer afford to ignore third party opposition in congressional and
legislative races ..."</p>

<p>"We learned to pay close attention to the approval ratings of third-party
candidates ... This was especialyl true when the third party candidate was a
woman and the two mainstream candidates were men ..."</p>

<p>The article cites the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> 50th
congressional district race, and the
impact of Libertarian candidate Barbara Hutchinson.</p>

<p>"Two weeks before election day, in a move almost without precedent for a
third party congressional candidate, Hutchinson went on television with four
spots, including a harsh negative attack on Filner. But Filner beat her to the
punch by establishing her negatives with voters first ... Hutchinson was
contained at 11 percent ..."</p>

<p>The article notes the following advice for professional consultants:</p>

<p>"Advance warning through voter opinion research is essential to identify the
potential appeal of and danger from third party candidates ... Voter opinion
research should also test positive and negative themes for third party
candidates along with the major contenders in push questions ... <em>if voter
opinion research confirms a third party threat, conduct thorought opposition
reasearch. Forewarned is forearmed</a> ... Mainstream party candidates should
plan for a narrow victory, even if your candidate is heavily favored.  Every
vote counts in a three-way -- or four-way -- race."</p>

<title>Ballot Access</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ballot Access</h1>

<p>Many people assume third parties aren't successful because people don't
support them. What they don't realize is that the Republicans and Democrats
have engineered legislative obstacles for third party and independent
candidates trying to get on the ballot.</p>

<p>Third party candidates are required to spend so much of their resources on
ballot access, that little funds and time is left over for campaigning. Of
course, that's the whole point of restrictive ballot access laws.</p>

<p>As Libertarian Party Chair <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a> pointed
out, "a new party formed
in the United States for the 1994 election needed to collect 3,501,629 valid
petition signatures to run a full slate of state and federal candidates. By
contrast, a new political party in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> needs only
100,000 signatures to
get on the ballot for all offices; and only 10,000 signatures are required
in South Africa."</p>

<li><a href="conv96.html">Libertarian convention date affects ballot status</a>

<title>Debating</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Debating</h2>
<p>Last updated 9/14/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some tips from a professional  political debater:</p>

<p>It's crucial to remember that "people want to know how much you care, 
before they care how much you know."  You need to establish common 
ground (show that you both value the same ends) before you can explain 
why you think your means are just and work best.</p>

<p>Over the last 10 years of campaigning, giving interviews, and being a 
talk radio host, I've developed a 4-part formula for responding to most 
questions, criticisms, and concerns in a way that builds bridges (as 
opposed to burning them.)</p>

<ol>
<li>State your credentials.</li>
<li>Share his goals.</li>
<li>Show how government has screwed things up and who benefits from 
these unjust policies.</li>
<li>Show the libertarian solution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example.</p>

<p><b>HIM:</b>  You libertarians don't care about the poor.</p>

<p><b>YOU:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>As the grandson of poor immigrants,
<li>I care about poor folks and want to see them prosper the way our 
family did.
<li>The problem is that many government policies trap people in 
poverty.  For example, why should it be illegal for a single mother to 
start her own hair-braiding business in her apartment?  Why should 
government keep the poor down just so established businesses won't have 
to face her competition?
<li>So a good first step would be to legalize self-employment.  Our 
immigrant grandparents were able to pull themselves out of poverty in 
an age of very few regulations on start-up businesses.  Of course, 
there's a lot of other changes we need to make too.
</ol>

<p>Here are some tips specifically for debating online...

<p>Don't use all-caps.  It makes you look rabid and kooky.  It makes it 
look like you don't have confidence in the power of your ideas and you 
have to make up for it with SCREAMING. Ever seen ultra-right-wing 
propaganda? It's full of random all-caps.</p>

<p>Don't use extreme punctuation, either.  As with all-caps, it makes you 
look like you've lost self-control !!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you use standard 
punctuation, good grammar & spelling, and are polite and restrained, 
you are much more likely to win respect (and perhaps reconsideration) 
from your "opponent" and you will impress other readers.  Especially on 
the gun issue, where opponents already assume that you're a rabid nut.</p>

<p>Make sure your grammar is perfect.  You should make it a point to check 
all your email before you send it.  Nothing screams "I'm uneducated and 
don't care" more than mis-spellings and sloppy grammar.</p>

<p>Consider saving "boilerplate" arguments you've made on email so that 
you can recycle them easily without having to re-type.  For example, I 
have an email folder called "debate ammo" where I keep messages 
arranged by topic, e.g., "gun control." And in that message, I store 
sound-bite answers from past messages (mine and others') that I want to 
recycle. For example:</p>

<p>Q. Guns are dangerous and should be outlawed.</p>
<p>A. This is a dangerous line of thinking. If we start outlawing 
"dangerous" objects, where will it end? We have already heard calls for 
violent video games to be restricted and for pornography and certain 
ads to be outlawed. So-called liberals are often leading the charge. 
I'm not a fan of these products, but the erosion of your rights means 
the erosion of my rights. I can well imagine that things I hold near 
and dear will be next.</p>

<p>That way, whenever someone uses that argument with me (and you know it 
comes up a lot) you already have a snappy answer that is exactly what 
you want.  Then you can cut and paste it in, edit as needed, and it 
saves lots of time.</p>

<title>Calls To Action</title>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Calls to action</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/25/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some ideas that might get more people (like me) to act on your 
email "calls to action."</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your subject line give an indication of the urgency. Indicate 
the deadline up front. Otherwise, people like me will either assume 
that it's too late or that they can put it off.</p></li>

<li><p>The very first sentences of your post should tell lamebrains like 
me <em>exactly</em> what you want us to do. Most people only read the first 
few sentences of any post, so you better put your important stuff 
there. Keep it short and simple.  Put the background info at the bottom 
of the post.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Consider using this formula in your "call to action" posts:</p>

<pre>
From: Patricia Freeman
Subject: DUE 7/26: call Congress re: gun law                 <---- 
indicates deadline, topic, and action required

Call or fax your U.S. Congressman's office before 2pm EST on Tuesday 
7/26.   Ask your Congressman to vote against the semi-auto and 
10-round-magazine bans in the House Crime Bill.  Also ask him to send 
you a letter explaining his vote and how he is working to defend our 
right of self-defense. (That way your opinion will be registered in 
their form-letter database.)

If you don't know the name or phone number of your Congressman, call 
202-224-3121 (the Congressional switchboard) and they'll be able to put 
you through. Or, you can call his local office (check the phone book or 
call directory assistance.) By the way, you can get a directory of all 
your national, state, and local politicians for free from your local 
League of Women Voters.  Everyone should get a copy of this free booklet!

Anyway, here's the background info:  This vote will be taken on the 
House Floor at 3:00pm EST on Tuesday 7/26.  At issue is...

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>FAQs and Related Resources</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/27/96 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some FAQs and other resources to help you answer questions and
assist with your research.  If you have a libertarian web site of your
own, you may want to include these links.  If you find other links that
should be here, please email
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">me</a>.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the web still lacks a comprehensive libertarian
FAQ, one that has short but compelling answers to tough questions on all
aspects of libertarian theory and policy proposals, complete with
footnotes.  That this doesn't already exist is a crying shame, given the
many libertarian thinktanks, books, and the excellent scholarship that
is going on worldwide. Ideally, such a site might even allow people to
submit questions and/or answers that could then be incorporated into the
FAQ. If you have the talent and the dedication to develop and maintain
such a site, the world needs you at least as much as a good five-cent
cigar.</p>

<p>The following links are a good start for such a compilation, and I
congratulate and thank the folks who developed them ...</p>

<title>Gift Ideas</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Gift ideas</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/2/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some gift ideas for people who are not necessarily 
libertarian.  I have broken them down by age group.  Most of them are 
books with some kind of libertarian themes.  Many of these books can be 
found in either your local book store or can be ordered from 
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire Books</a>,
1-800-326-0996.  You ought to be familiar with the 
book before you decide to give it, of course.  Make sure it's appropriate.</p>

<h3>Young Children (5 - 9)</h3>

<ul>
<li>"The Little Red Hen" (traditional story)</li>
<li>"The Three Little Pigs"</li>
<li>"The Ant and the Grasshopper"</li>
<li>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</li>
<li>"Robin Hood" (be sure it specifies that he's returning the <em>tax</em>
money to the poor)</li>
<li><cite>Little House on the Prairie</cite> (Laura Ingalls Wilder
series of books)</li>
<li><cite>Yankee Doodle: A Revolutionary Tail</cite> by Gary Chalk $14.95</li>
<li><cite>The Butter Battle Book</cite> by Dr. Seuss</li>
<li><cite>Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose</cite> by Dr. Seuss</li>
<li>big piggy bank (Statue of Liberty?) with some bright shiny hard cold 
cash in it!</li>
<li><p><cite>Songs from Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood</cite> (on tape, for use
in the car and at home).</p>
<p>I've always been a big fan of Mr. Rogers, and my 2-year old son loves
Mr. Rogers, as I did until the age of 6 or so.  As a parent, I
appreciate the topics covered in his songs.  They foster genuine
self-esteem: the joy of doing things for yourself, the joy of trying
hard and doing your best, the importance of not hiding your true
feelings, dealing with childhood fears, etc. Comedians like to make fun
of Mr. Rogers, but his show is not smarmy or cloying, it is just gentle
and calm. It deals with real issues of concern and interest to young
children.</p>
<p>As a libertarian, I appreciate that Mr. Rogers, unlike other childrens'
shows, actually <em>celebrates</em> capitalism and individual
achievement by showing lots of film clips about how things are
manufactured, and profiles people with special talents (Yo Yo Ma, Itzhak
Perlman, athletes, astronauts, etc.)  One of his puppet characters is a
genial factory owner who manufactures rocking chairs and is proud of his
product, and one of his live characters (Mr. McFeeley) runs a <em>private</em>
delivery service.  How much more libertarian can you get? &lt;G&gt; Seriously,
I've read "Mr. Rogers Talks With Parents" (a great book gift for
parents, by the way) and thinks that it is very important for children
to understand that people make and do interesting things in their lives.</p>

Broadcasting...</p></li>

<h3>Kids (10 - 14)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stock. Framed stock certificates from a "cool" company.  Find out what 
product -- music, toys, candy, TV show, computers -- the kid loves and 
let her become an owner of the company that brings it to her: Warner 
Brothers, M&M Mars, Disney, Mattel, etc.  (It'd be nice if you also 
gave a sample of their beloved product as well as the most recent 
annual stockholder report!)  In the accompanying card (which you'll 
tuck into the most recent stockholder report), you include a clipping 
from the newspaper showing how the stock traded that day so she can 
then track it herself.  You inscribe the card with something to the 
effect that she now owns the company!  Finally,  if you have an 
annoyingly leftist sister-in-law, buy her kids stock in General 
Electric, McDonell-Douglas, or some other defense contractor and 
include a cool poster of a warplane in action. &lt;g&gt;</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Letter-writing campaigns</h2>
<p>Last updated 3/4/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some ideas that might get more people (like me) to act on your 
letter-writing "calls to action."</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your subject line give an indication of the urgency. Indicate 
the deadline up front. Otherwise, people like me will either assume 
that it's too late or that they can put it off.</p></li>

<li><p>The very first sentences of your post should tell lamebrains like 
me <em>exactly</em> what you want us to do. Most people only read the first 
few sentences of any post, so you better put your important stuff 
there. Keep it short and simple.  Put the background info at the bottom 
of the post.</p>
</ol>

<p>Consider using this formula in your "call to action" posts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Tom "Watchdog" Isenberg<br>
Subject: DUE 7/26: write letters re: gun law<br>
(indicates deadline, topic, and action required)</p>

<p>Please take a moment to fire off a letter to local editors regarding 
jury nullification and how it would have prevented the jury's tragic, 
reluctant conviction of a local woman on marijuana charges.</p>

<p>Please do this asap. The issue will no longer be timely after 7/26/94.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the background info:  Most of you have read the horrible 
story about... [etc.]</p>

<p>TIPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must give your full name, address, and daytime phone number for 
verification.</li>
<li>Be clear and concise. No more than 250 words.</li>
<li>Identify yourself as a Libertarian, if you wish. E.g., "As a 
Libertarian, I think that..."</li>
</ul>

<p>TALKING POINTS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Juries have the right to acquit defendants for whatever reason they 
want (e.g., the law is unjust) regardless of what the judge instructs. 
This is a well-established legal principle.</li>
<li>People who want more info should call the Libertarian Party at 
1-800-353-1776.</li>
<li>Jury nullification is a common law right with a long history in this
country.</li>
<li>Jury nullification helped lead to repeal of Prohibition and fugitive 
slave laws.</li>
<li>Jury nullification is the ultimate check and balance against our
government.</li>
</ul>

<p>ADDRESSES:</p>
<p>[Here's where you'd list the mail, fax, and email addresses of the 
papers you want people to write.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want people to take action, you must tell them exactly what to 
do and how to do it.  Make it easy for them!</p>

<h2>Letters to the Editor</h2>
<p>Last updated 1/23/96 by

<h3>Top Ten Keys to Successful Letters-to-the-Editor</h3>

<p>by Vernon Imrich</p>

<ol>
<li><p>KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE!  - This is by far the most important thing. You 
have to know what kinds of thing that particular publication thinks is 
important.  This means that you have to read that paper's editorials -- 
a lot.  (If you don't read left-wing or other opponent papers, I 
suggest you start. Fighting idealogical battles requires lots of enemy 
intelligence, besides, you get soft and coddled reading only the stuff 
you agree with all the time.)</p>

<p>Examples:  My "profiles" of local papers</p>

<p>The Boston Globe - leftwing, but a major paper, likes to think it is 
not "censorsing" opposing views, wants "real" feedback limited space 
(see below).</p>

<p>The Tech - MIT's blandest of the bland paper.  They are just happy to 
know someone reads them.  Spit on a piece of paper and they'll print 
it.  good place to start.</p>

<p>The Thistle - MIT's left wing admittedly biased rag.  Have to think 
like a liberal, and pick your issues (see below).</p>

<li><p>REACT TO THEIR PUBLICATION - Papers want to see that they are 
generating debate, that people are excited about them, and most of all, 
that you are reading them.  Quote their text, and <em>always</em> cite their 
articles or editorials as starting points.</p>

<li><p>BE DIRECT - Papers want clarity.  If you disagree, everyone had 
better know you disagree in the first sentence.  No hemming and hawing, 
whining, or complaing.  Tell them: you disagree, here's why, end of story.</p>

<li><p>NO LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY - For most "real world" publications 
this means no more than a paragraph or two.  Do this exercise:  try 
typing out a few paragraphs from an editorial or column and see how 
much shorter the thing seems on your page than in the newspaper.  Next 
do the following.  <em>Read</em> the thing you just typed.  How fast did you 
lose interest?  Chances are if they were long winded and you disagreed 
you stopped before it finished.  People are busy, the press knows this. 
 Remember, these are the people who gave us "sound bites." In general I 
write it out, and then just strip, strip, strip it down to the barest
minimum.</P>

<p>For college publications these rules are different.  MIT's paper 
frequently publishes "essay length" letters and often hosts debates in 
a near USENET fashion with letters answering letters.  This is <em>not</em> the 
case elsewhere.</p>

<li><p>PICK A NARROW TARGET - because of 3 and 4, you simply cannot hope to 
cover everything in any kind of a cogent or supported  fashion.  
Therefore, pick a <em>small</em> piece of the issue, target it well and hit 
hard.  People reading their morning paper with a donut probably can't 
digest a treatise on the fallacies of gun control anway.</p>

<li><p>DO NOT SAY ONE SINGLE THING YOU CANNOT ABSOLUTELY BACK UP!  - this 
is  the easiest way to get killed in letter writing.  You can write a 
Bible full of gospel truth, but if one fact is off, one tiny digression 
is not supported quite well enough, respondents will dismiss the 99% 
and take on the 1% you flubbed up.  I would not use any fact for which 
I could not personally cite the reference (and that reference better be 
something credible to non-libertarians).  And if you <em>do</em> have them ready 
you can really slam dunk any doubters.</p>

<p>Example: I asserted that only 40% of the budget goes to defense and 
debt (roughly 20% for each).  Someone wrote back claiming it was thirty 
for each, meaning 60% of the budget went to defense and debt "that 
mostly paid for military build up anyway."  I hit him with the latest 
budget figures from UPI (18% military, 14% debt) and never heard back ;)</p>

<p>For papers like the Globe (that don't generally print responses to 
other letters) this is still important.  Their editors know what facts 
are true and what aren't.  They see one thing wrong and bye-bye.</p>

<li><p>DO NOT PREJUDICE YOURSELF - Statements like "as a libertarian" 
should come at the end unless they are in direct response to something 
(e.g. in this case, an article about libertarians).  You want people to 
read what you have to say first and then find out who
you are.  That way, they will read the argument and say "so that's what 
libertarians think" rather than saying "uh oh, another one of those 
libertarian nuts is ranting again" and then read the peice through 
colored lenses.  How would you read a letter that began "As a liberal..."?</p>

<li><p>BE REASONABLE - you can be animated, and assertive without sounding 
like a raving nut.  Think about what you are saying.  Write out the 
file and then leave it for a while.  Come back to it later, or let 
others read it too.  Control those emotions.  Use them, but
control them.  (Note: the leave-and-come-back is a good way to check 
for lots of errors.  Many times, your mind thinks a certain way and 
leaves out important things.  After lunch you will notice things that 
don't make as much sense as they first did.)</p>

<li><p>ADVANCED TOPIC: BE COLORFUL OR DIFFERENT - Can be very difficult to 
do given the space restrictions and need for being direct, but can be 
very useful.  Papers generally use only a "sampling" of opinion.  This 
means they notice letters with catchy lines or good wit.  Use vibrant 
verbs and adjectives.  If a plan is bad, don't say "bad" say 
"preposterous." Other good words are "outraged," "a nightmare," or 
"immense," instead of "angry," "a mistake," and "big."  Be careful, 
this can be dangerous.  The lines between clever and stupid, or 
colorful and insane are very thin, always err on the side of rational 
boring and reasonable.</p>

<li><p>ADVANCED TOPIC: GETTING ON ENEMY TURF - One of the most delightful 
and challenging aspects of letter writing is seeing if you can get past 
the mental firewalls of various publications.  To do this you need a 
good understanding of what motivates their reasoning.  When this is 
grasped you can use that motivation, twist it a little and have them 
caught in an idealogical web.  At the very least they will print the 
letter, assuming it a reasonable objection from a devoted follower.</p>

<p>Example:  To get my letter in the Thistle (MIT's "commie rag") on the 
issue of free speech (note, by knowing my audience, I knew this was one 
of the only issues I could use), I cited the "thirty years of fighting" 
for free speech on campus and how I was proud of my Berkeley days (I 
was there as an undergrad).  From there I stated how sad I was that 
these "bastions of speech supporters" were now the very ones arguing 
for speech codes. Hypocrisy or not, people are not going to toss out 
sentiment or history.  Also, if you know modern liberal thought, they 
<em>love</em> appeals to history as justification.</p>

<p>Example: One of the letters to the Boston Globe (attached below) that 
was printed was on gun control.  Now the Globe is one of the  most 
overtly biased gun-grabbing outfits there is.  But they do have a 
deference for the Supreme Court (most of its rulings have helped 
liberal causes in recent years) and due process.  Also I noticed an 
editorial appeal to Madison once on a constitutional issue.  Thus, my 
letter didn't actually ask for a change of heart on guns, but appealed 
to due process to try to force the hardest path on to gun control 
advocates (constitutional amendment).  And of course, a tidy little 
Madison quote finished it off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>

<p>In "A Starting Point on Guns" (Globe Dec. 4) Mr. Ryan makes the 
faulty assertion that assault weapons belong only in "the military; the 
locked cabinets of SWAT teams; or puerile fantasy."   The fact is, the 
2nd Amendment was written to prevent just this kind of state monopoly 
on deadly force.</p>
     <p>According to Thomas Jefferson, "The strongest reason for people to 
retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect 
themselves against tyranny in government."  The framers wanted military 
power vested in the militia which (in both the National Guard Act of 
1903 and the Militia Act of 1792) "shall consist of every able-bodied 
male citizen."  In fact, in deciding that a certain weapon was <em>not</em> 
protected by the 2nd Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that it 
could not consider it  "any part of the ordinary military equipment" 
(U.S. v. Miller Et. Al. 1939).</p>
     <p>Reasonable people may disagree with Jefferson and the framers, but 
at least try to show more respect for the Bill of Rights.  Either 
accept what it means or follow the process to amend it.  Don't degrade 
it with what Madison called "the gradual and silent encroachment of 
those in power."</p>

<title>Lobbying</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Politics Without Holding Office</h1>

<p>May 1993, from Bryan Griffin (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:bwg@csn.org">bwg@csn.org</a>):</p>

<p>I would like people to consider what will happen if for example we do elect
one congressperson. What will this person spend their time doing? They will
come up with libertarian legislation, and need to spend time trying to lobby
all the other congresspeople to vote for it since one person can not pass a
law. Even if we got several libertarians into office, they would still need to
go through the same process. My question is, how different really is the 0
people in office case from the 1 person in office case? In congress, and in
state legislatures, one vote doesn't mean much. Its possible to draft bills and
lobby legislators without being in office. The same sort of research and
lobbying support that would be required with a person in office can be useful
even without an officeholder.</p>

<p>It is true that a congress person (or state legislator) can actually propose
a bill. However  1 legislator can only introduce so many bills, and most of the
work in getting something passed is done after the bill is introduced anyway.
Most of what will be done once 1 legislator is elected to office, proposing
concrete solutions to problems and lobbying other lawmakers, can be done with 0
legislators in office. If it isn't possible to find a non-libertarian
legislator to introduce a particular piece of legislation, then it probably
wouldn't have been possible to get it passed even if we had 1 person in
office.</p>

<p>The national party may not be involved in local politics, but it needs to
support and encourage local activities to help build the national party.   In
much of the country the LP does not act much like a true political party in
that it doesn't attempt any direct influence on the political process other
than an attempt at election time. People don't go and speak up at city council
meetings, or other public government events. One of the reasons for this is
that much of what goes on is boring, especially to people who don't really wish
the government to do much, and its hard to find people to commit the time
required. One solution may be to get signup sheets and get people to share the
work, each person volunteering to cover a council meeting once in a while. If
individual issues are chosen then the work on those issues can be distributed
and shared, instead of requiring one person to devote enough time to serve as a
candidate and officeholder.</p>

<p>If you give people some concrete active task, which requires only a small,
well defined commitment of time  (even just outreach stuff like manning booths,
or stuffing envelopes, if not front line political lobbying) they may be
willing to get involved. Open ended commitments to being responsible for a
particular area aren't as easy for people to make. Anyone who has tried asking
for contributions in a meeting will know that it is much easier to get people
to contribute money for a concrete purpose than just the group in general. The
point is that people are also more likely to contribute time to concrete well
defined tasks than taking an ill-defined task such as being an officer or
leading some sub-group.</p>

<h2>Outreach to Corporate VIPs</h2>
<p>Last updated 10/29/91 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here's something we at Microsoft have recently done...</p>

<p>We've got both the <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html>Reason
Foundation</a> and the <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato
Institute</a> to send free
subscriptions to policy analyses and special reports and invitations to
conferences to several Microsoft zillionaires who have shown interest in
or sympathy towards libertarian ideals (as judged by Microsoft
libertarians who have had dealings with these people.)</p>

<p>Each of these gifts will come with cards and cover letters from the
respective organizations mentioning that the gifts are from the
Microsoft libertarians (to show that some of their highly intelligent
and highly productive employees are looking out for their bosses'
intellectual development.)</p>

<p>We also discussed with Cato and Reason an idea to invite these
zillionaires to speak at conferences on issues like "the wonderfully
unregulated computer industry" "computers and the revolution in Eastern
Europe" "marketing in post-communist Europe" "computers, technology, and
freedom" and so forth.</p>

<p>So those of you working near other zillionaires might want to consider
doing something similar... At least get your company library to stock up
on some CATO books and studies of general corporate interest (<cite>The
Suicidal Corporation</cite>, for example.)</p>

<h2>Radio Interviews</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/28/84 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>A much-touted, highly publicized poll in 1991 showed that only 28% of 
those surveyed trust the government to, by-and-large, do the right 
thing. This is half of the percentage in 1961. Add to this cover 
stories in Newsweek "Voters want No Bull" and Time "Is Government 
Dead?" and we seem to have fertile ground for the LP.</p>

<p>Some analysts are saying that voters don't necessarily want less 
government, they want <em>better</em> government (one which gives the middle 
class the goodies it wants: health care, tax cuts, etc.)</p>

<p>This is a dangerous combination. If Libertarians don't articulate real 
solutions, the Democratic Socialists will. And big government is 
appealing to many people. Let's at least create some doubts.</p>

<p>This is an ideal time to contact your local talk radio station and get 
them to interview an articulate libertarian. Most talk radio stations 
will do long-distance telephone interviews, so if you don't have a 
strong local propagandist, refer them to someone from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason</a> or <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato</a> or 
the National LP. Have a list of contacts and numbers for them (see below.)</p>

<p>Get some other libertarians to call in and ask for coverage of this 
Libertarian thing.</p>

<p>Let's exploit every opportunity we have.</p>

<p>Libertarian contacts:
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a> (Libertarian
Party, Wash, DC) 202-543-1988;
Erica Hartig (Cato Institute, Wash, DC) 202-546-0200;
Kevin Teasely (Reason Foundation, Los Angeles) 1-800-341-1522.</p>

<h2>Ten Things High School Libertarians Can Do</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<P>Do you want to get some scholarship money for college, impress people of
the opposite gender, disarm your intellectual opponents while
simultaneously winning their admiration and eternal gratitude? Sure, we
all do. Here's how.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Educate yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read.  You probably don't have much time to read, what with homework
and romance and all, but if you do, some good introductions to
libertarianism include: <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite> by
Harry Browne, <cite>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</cite> by Ayn Rand,
<cite>Restoring the American Dream</cite> by Robert Ringer, and <cite>The
Machinery of Freedom</cite> by David
Friedman.  The Ringer book is out of print, but you can find it in most
used book stores.  It's a great book, so if you can't find it, email me
and I'll see if I have a spare copy to send you for $5. The other books
can be found or ordered in any bookstore.  And, of course, there are
lots of great libertarian web sites to read (see below.)</p>

<li><p>Get the free Laissez-Faire books catalog. This is the best source for
books of interest to libertarians. Request a free catalog by calling
them at 1-800-326-0996 or check out their web site at http://www.lfb.org</p>

<li><p>Create your own Q&A file.  As a libertarian, you probably get asked a
lot of questions by friends, family, teachers, and others.  You may find
that your history and economics textbooks are somewhat biased in favor
of big government (textbooks are written for use in government schools,
after all.)  Some questions you'll be able to answer, others you might
not.  Don't sweat it. Just say, "That's a good question, I'll have to
get back to you on that."  And do it.  Write down the question and do
some reading on it (or email me if you want.)  Better yet, ask a real
expert at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy
http://www.mackinac.org/askthe.htm ("Expert help is only 24 hours
away.")  You might start your own "Question and Answer" file to keep
track of tough questions, statistics, etc.  Mine is a simple Microsoft
Word document (in outline format) arranged alphabetically by category
(e.g., Drug Policy, Education, Environment, Gun Control, Laissez Faire
Myths, etc.)  In each section I write in bold text the common questions
or talking points (e.g., "Doesn't capitalism destroy the environment?")
followed by short answers or "sound bites" including references.  By
keeping such a file, I'm able to sharpen my answers (and I find that I
remember them better.)  Plus, these answers are easy to "recycle" when
you get into email debates, write reports, write letters to the editor,
call talk shows, etc.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Add libertarian links to your web page.
Here are some great libertarian links you may already know about:
http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html = an online "Nolan chart" survey that
tells you whether you're a libertarian, conservative, liberal, or ...?
http://www.audionet.com/shows/ponte/ = The Lowell Ponte Show (an archive
of this Libertarian's nationwide daily talkshow).  To listen to it, your
computer must have audio capability (duh) and you must first download
the free RealAudio software.
http://www.free-market.com/ = the Mother of All Libertarian Resources on
the Web, including thinktanks, academic resources, etc.</p>

<li><p>Bug Your School Librarian.
See if your school library has the books mentioned above. If not, ask
the library to buy them (so that future students can benefit.)  Also,
ask them to subscribe to the two best libertarian magazines for
students: Reason and The Freeman.  You may need to show them copies
before they agree to subscribe.  You can email me for free copies of
both.  If your librarian won't purchase these items, ask if s/he'll
accept donated subscriptions and books.  If so, contact your local
Libertarian Party and ask someone to donate one or more of these items
to your school library (I'm sure they'd love to.)</p>

<li><p>Use Your School Newspaper.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Put a copy of the Nolan survey in the school newspaper.  This is a
simple way to introduce many people to libertarian ideas.  Just download
a copy of the survey and get the school newspaper to print it (maybe
they can do it as a school-wide opinion poll.)  Or get your Civics
teacher to put a copy on the classroom wall.  Or just have your friends
do it.  Again, that link is http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html.  If you
don't have access to the web, email me and I'll send you a copy of the
quiz.</p>

<li><p>Write editorials.  If you like to write, consider writing an
occasional "libertarian" editorial for the school newspaper.  Hell, a
few people might even read it.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Invite LP Speakers to Your Class.
Call up your local Libertarian Party (they're in the phone book) and ask
if they have speakers available to come speak to your Civics or Social
Studies class.  If they do, pass that person's name and number to your
teacher and encourage him to invite the speaker for all of his classes
for the day.  Your teacher will be able to take the classes off, and you
won't have any homework assignments.  What a deal.</p>

<li><p>Organize Debates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you're really motivated and can use some extra-credit points, you
can organize after-school debates, maybe once every semester (assuming
you can't get your Civics teacher to just do these debates in class.)
Pick one or two highly controversial issues that would attract an
audience (legalizing drugs, gun control, censorship, etc.) Organize your
team to present the libertarian position ("As a libertarian, I think
that..."), and invite another team to present the opposing position.
Have a teacher help you organize the debate and act as the moderator.
And if I were organizing this, I would invite some of the smarter
cheerleaders to do some hilarious "debate" cheers for each side before
it presents its opening argument. But I'm weird that way.</p>

<li><p>If you can't get people interested in the above, see if you can get
your school involved in the nation-wide Lincoln-Douglas high school
debate program. For more info, call 1-800-884-2189 or email
grehmke@free-enterprise.org or check out the web site at
http://www.free-enterprise.org/eahome.htm . The bi-monthly debate topics
typically feature issues of interest to libertarians, and the Free
Enterprise Institute features all kinds of free study materials to help
present the libertarian argument.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Organize a Production of "Night of January 16th".
If you're into theater, you could get your school's theater group to
consider doing a production of Ayn Rand's play "Night of January 16th."
The basic plot is a murder trial where the audience is the jury and
actually returns a verdict.  The play has different endings, depending
on the verdict. Themes in the play include individualism, etc. You can
find the play in any bookstore.  This play is popular with High Schools
because it is highly entertaining, relatively easy to produce, and not
too long. If your school does do it, you might volunteer to write the
"liner notes" for the play, mentioning Rand's other novels with
"libertarian themes."</p>

<li><p>Do Projects on Libertarian Themes.
If you have a class assignment that lends itself, or can use some
extra-credit points, consider doing a presentation or report on a
libertarian theme.  For Civics class, you could present the Nolan Chart
as a better way of viewing politics than the one-dimensional Left/Right
spectrum or you could present the platform and history of the
Libertarian Party.  For English class, you could do a book report on an
Ayn Rand novel ("Anthem" is a popular one because it is short and has
some great themes.)</p>

<li><p>Hook up with College Libertarian Groups.
Here are some directories of college groups.  Sometimes libertarians
call themselves "classical liberals" so search on that as well.
http://www.libertarian.com/wwlp/st/
http://www.free-market.com//student.html</p>

<li><p>Check Our These Scholarships for High School Students.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Free Enterprise Institute offers the "Economics in One Lesson"
Scholarship Program with an annual (?) essay contest open to all high
school students. Based on journalist Henry Hazlitt's classic Economics
in One Lesson, students compete for $7,500 in college scholarships. For
more info, call 1-800-884-2189 or email grehmke@free-enterprise.org or
check out the web site at http://www.free-enterprise.org/eolhome.htm to
see last year's info.</p>

<li><p>For Oregon high school-age students, the Cascade Policy Institute
offers the third annual Independence Essay Competition "Exploring the
Foundations of Freedom." Up to $5,000 in total prizes to be awarded for
the best essays on the Bill of Rights. Deadline this year is March 3,
1997.  For more info, call 503-242-0900 or email
Essay97@CascadePolicy.org or check out the web site at
http://www.cascadepolicy.org/essay/essay97.htm.</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Bumperstickers</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/24/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>In my humble opinion, every Libertarian ought to have one of these 
bumperstickers on their car. It's free publicity and helps to make the 
LP a household word.</p>

<p>The best (and also the most popular) are "Legalize Freedom" and 
"Pro-Choice on Everything" because they look good (they're red, white & 
blue), get the point across, and feature the 1-800 number.</p>

<p>Just put them on your car's back window (for easy peel-off removal when 
you sell your car) and become a mobile advertisement for truth, 
justice, and the American way. It's an excellent conversation starter, 
and you'll even get some thumbs-up on the road (I average about a dozen 
a year.)  I even keep a few extras in the car to give away.</p>

<p>State and local LP organizations should give them away for free, not 
sell them! Think of it this way: they are mobile billboards. So why not 
maximize the number of billboards out there? Subsidize their cost some 
other way. You can order them in quantity discount from the National 
LP. Order with VISA or MasterCard by calling 202-543-1988. Give them 
away at meetings, conventions, and <a href="booths.html">Nolan survey
booths</a>.</p>

<h3>To Make Your Own Bumperstickers</h3>

<p>Williams & Macias sells a glossy paper stock that lets you print bumper 
stickers from an ordinary laser printer.</p>

<p>Product 2041 has 3 stickers on a 8.5 x 11 sheet (somewhat small for a 
bumpersticker), Product 2042 has 2 stickers on a 8.5 x 11 sheet.</p>

<p>Both products have a weatherproof adhesive, and are made from 
weather-resistant paper.  The products come in 20-sheet packs.  Both 
versions are $19/pack.  Obviously, you should do test runs on normal 
paper before using the sticker paper.  So -- a fast and cheap way to 
crank out small runs of black and white bumper stickers (or use a color 
printer at Kinko's Copy Center.)</p>

<p>The phone number is (800) 310-0890 or (509) 624-5170.</p>

<p>And here's another service, as advertised in LP News:</p>

<p>BUMPERSTICKERS  Made to Order - Quantity 1 to 50
Ideal for local issues and campaigns or just to try out a new slogan 
(No Profanity). 24 Color combinations. Text color (pick one): Red, 
Orange, Green, Blue, White, Yellow. Background Color (pick one): Black, 
Red, Navy Blue, Green. 3 lines of text, 17 characters including spaces 
per line. First line is $2.00 per bumpersticker, each additional line 
is $1.00 per bumpersticker. Send your name, address, phone, text, color 
choices, quantity, and payment to <a

<h2>C-SPAN coverage of your event</h2>
<p>Last updated 10/27/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>If you have an event that you think C-SPAN should cover (debate, 
campaign speech for a statewide or Congressional race, conference, 
etc.) give their assignment desk a call: 202-626-7979.</p>

<p>C-SPAN has been very friendly to Libertarians, they've covered speeches 
by Libertarian candidates, the LP Convention, and other things.  If 
your campus group wants to sponsor an academic panel forum (or debate 
or lecture) on some libertarian issue, this would be an ideal way to 
get coverage.</p>

<title>College Activism</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>College Libertarian Activism</h2>
<p>Last updated 1/12/97 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<P>I think that college groups are the most important front in the libertarian
movement.  The most important function of a college group is not
to establish a small club of libertarians who discuss libertarian theory, but
to expose the entire campus community to the libertarian message.
Unfortunately, most college groups fall into the trap of becoming miniscule
debate societies and not doing any outreach (Nolan booths being the most
efficient way to find new libertarians.)  I think this is a tremendous waste
of an opportunity.  That's why I strongly advise against setting up monthly
discussion meetings.  The point is to do outreach, not drink beer with
the choir.</P>

<hr><h3>Run Regular Nolan Booths and Introductory Seminars</h3>

<p>I would argue that a college group should do nothing else until it is
successfully running a "Nolan survey" booth every month and at least one
introductory seminar on "What is the Libertarian Party?" every semester.  A
Nolan booth, by the way, is basically a survey table that lets passersby give
their opinion on political issues.  You use this booth, not to debate or to
convert, but to discover who on campus is already a "libertarian" (at least
philosophically.)  You collect the names and addresses of these libertarian
sympathizers and later on you invite them to the introductory seminar.  Of
course, you can hand out introductory literature at the booth as well.</p>

<P>You can get bulk literature from the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">National LP</a> (your state LP
may have some pamphlets gathering dust, so give them a call first.)  I
recommend that you hand out the "Libertarian Party Special Report" booklet
available from the National LP.  It is advertised in the LP NEWS along
with some other well-done literature.  The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/ISIL.html">International Society for
Individual Liberty (ISIL)</a> also publishes an excellent
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.creative.net/~star/pamph.htm">series of pamphlets</a>.</p>

<hr><h3>Stock the University Library</h3>

<p>Does your library stock your favorite libertarian books, journals, and
magazines?  If not, find out how to submit purchase requests.  Also ask
if the library will accept gift subscriptions and purchases, and if so,
contact the author or publisher to get free copies/subscriptions.
Frankly, I can't imagine
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/Liberty.html"><cite>Liberty</cite></a>
or <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite></a>
or <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato</a> refusing to donate
subscriptions to university libraries willing to display them (it's a
great way to get in front of future subscribers and donors.)  Or you can
contact your state Libertarian Party (LP) to ask them to make the
donation.</P>

<hr><h3>Bring Speakers to Campus</h3>

<p>For those in your group who are not interested in doing Nolan booths (which
are actually a lot of fun) they can form a committee in charge of bringing
libertarian speakers (authors, thinktankers, etc.) to campus.  Depending on
your college's rules, you may need to form a non-partisan, student group to
access the college's funds and resources to bring these speakers on campus.
So, you might have the Whatsamatta U. Libertarians be the LP group that does
the Nolan booths and you might have the Whatsamatta U. Students for
Individual Liberty be the non-partisan group that uses college funds to bring
libertarian luminaries to campus.</p>

<hr><h3>Write Columns and Commentaries</h3>

<p>An easy way to promote your group is to have your members write
editorials and letters to the campus newspaper or, if anyone actually
listens to it, participate in campus radio (e.g., host a weekly
political talk show.)</p>

<hr><h3>Host Debates</h3>

<p>Another good way to promote your group on campus is to sponsor debates.  Once
a month (or whatever) you can debate a controversial issue.  One of you guys
provides the libertarian position, and a speaker from another campus group
provides the statist position.  Don't set up a three-way debate between
Republicans/Democrats/Libertarians, just do a two-way debate (pro and con.)
Allow the other group to set up their literature table as well.</p>

<hr><h3>Fundraising</h3>

<p>If you need help raising funds (after milking the Student Activities
Office for all it's worth), you should approach the local Libertarians in
your area.  You can get a list of their names and addresses from your
local Libertarian Party.  Better yet, you can put an ad in your state's
LP newsletter.  People would be glad to invest in college LP groups,
especially if you make it clear what you will use the money for (purchase
literature for distribution at our monthly literature booths, etc.)  You
could offer "sponsorships" each academic year: for a donation of $25 or
so, donors would receive notification and invitations of events
(including receptions with the speakers that you invite to campus, etc.)</p>

<hr><h3>Mentors Needed for Campus Groups</h3>

<p>A key to successful and long-lasting college groups is having at least
one dedicated off-campus mentor. If your group doesn't have one, find a
good one now so that your organization doesn't die when the seniors
graduate.  Your mentor may be a faculty member or a dedicated
libertarian.  This person would help organize Nolan booths at the start
of each school year, and be the institutional memory of the group, year
after year.  The mentor would become familiar with university policies
governing your group and would help guide groups through the process.
The mentor could also purchase and own any "durable" goods the group
needs (Nolan booth kits, answering machines, computers, bulk literature,
etc.)</p>

<hr><h3>Other Projects</h3>

<p>Once your group is already doing the high-priority items (Nolan booths and
hosting lectures/debates), you might consider doing some activism focused on
making your University a more libertarian place.  For example, you might work
to repeal bad University policies, like bans on non-lethal weapons (such as
pepper spray) on campus.  Or are students at your campus forced to subsidize
Ralph Nader's PIRG groups?  Probably.  Why not start a project where you
fight this coercive financing?  Here's a quote form a web site that features
lots of <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.realchange.org/nader.htm">dirt on Saint Ralph</a>:
"Penn State's Board of Overseers declined Nader's PIRG group's coercive
funding and voted instead to let students check a box to make a donation
(like presidential campaign funding on 1040 tax forms) -- a perfectly
reasonable compromise."</p>

<hr><h3>Resources for College Groups</h3>

<p>Here are the email addresses of others involved in campus Libertarian clubs.
A good place to start is to get yourself on the mailing list for the
Libertarian Student Club E-mail Network. (Contact the LSCEN e-mail network at
<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:mcpherso@lumina.ucsd.edu">mcpherso@lumina.ucsd.edu</a>.)</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>County LP improvements</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/6/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>This was formerly "Local LP improvements"...</p>

<p>The general suggestions I have are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Job number one is finding new Libertarians via <a
href="booths.html">Nolan booths</a>.
Everything else is of much less importance and is probably diverting 
energy from this most crucial activity.  Growing the party is job one.  
Get the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all prospects to the 
state party so they can be added to the mailing list.</p>

<li><p>Supper clubs and <a href="newsletters.html">newsletters</a> may be
fun, but if you aren't doing 
regular Nolan booths (at least once a month on a local college campus, 
mall, gun show, etc.) they are a dead-end.  Worse, most local 
newsletters look awful.  They do more harm to the Party than good.  I 
think it's better to have <em>no</em> newsletter than to have the usual crappy 
one.  Leave the newsletter to the state party.</p></li>

<li><p>Every month, have the state LP office send you a list of new 
prospects/members in your county so you can update your county 
database.  Call up every prospect and member and survey them regarding 
their level of interest, volunteering, etc.  For a copy of the survey 
we use in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> state,
contact me.</p></li>

<li><p>Look and act professional when whenever you represent the LP.  That 
means dress well (business suits).  Make sure that all candidates 
follow this rule even more strictly, and never let the media think you 
are a bunch of hippies or worse.  People will take unconventional ideas 
from conventional looking people, but not unconventional ideas from 
unconventional people.</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure you have a solid outreach effort to local <a
href="highschools.html">high schools</a>
and colleges (giving talks to classes, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>Don't invite new members to business meetings where they will be 
bored and just hear about how little money you have and why so-and-so 
is a so-and-so for using Helvetica Bold on the front of the newsletter 
instead of Univers. Instead, invite them to monthly speakers programs 
and to monthly <a href="supperclubs.html">supper clubs</a>, and have
these events well organized and 
designed to give your organization as smooth and professional a look as 
possible.</p></li>

<li><p>Recruit your army before going to war. Try to find people who are 
already libertarians and don't know it before trying to do massive 
education efforts. Nolan survey booths and the like are good for this.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep everyone enthusiastic. You should set achievable goals and 
achieve them; it keeps people thinking that they are doing some good. 
Don't set unachievable goals; keep things realistic.</p></li>

<li><p>Don't be a jerk. Don't do things to drive new potential recruits 
away, and don't do things to make people think you are a crackpot. 
Listen to a "Liberty Communicator" audio tape course from Advocates for 
Self Government (1-800-932-1776 for a free catalog); it may be one of 
the most valuable things you do.</p></li>

<li><p>Above all, talk to the people who have done this already. Call up 
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>, the
Communications Director at LPHQ (202-543-1988). He's a 
nice guy, and his information is very very very useful.  This is the 
single best piece of advice I have!</p></li>

<li><p>Learn from the major parties.  This may be a heretical suggestion, 
but I think it's sheer brilliance:  become your precinct's committee 
officer for the Republican (or Democratic) party.  You will get all 
kinds of useful information, training, and experience.  Not to mention 
the voting lists for people in your precinct that you can pass along to 
the LP.  Get involved in the local Republican party.  Attend their 
meetings, see how they do things.  We need that kind of experience and 
training.</p></li>

<title>Fundraising</title>

<h1>Fundraising and Membership Ideas</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/MatthewGaylor.html">Matthew
Gaylor</a>:</p>

<p>The following are the better responses to a survey asking for ideas
that generate money, members and/or votes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Talk Radio appearances (mentioned by many
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
 activists as their first
indication that LP is in town). LP name and phone must be repeated, of course.
<li>Op-eds.  Effective mainly in wealthy north suburbs, where younger people
actually read.
<li>Voter's Guides  (although phone # in phone book must be right for this to
work...)
</ol>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWalker.html">Bill Walker</a> said:
there is one
strategy I've used to raise money which seems to work very well. And that is to
send a fund-raising letter that promotes a radio or TV ad campaign. In fact,
I've been able to raise money at LP meetings simply by announcing that I'm
putting an ad on the air, and I leave the meeting with upwards of $100 for the
ads. It seems to me that Libertarians are tired of donating money without 
getting some specific satisfaction in return. I've found that a radio or TV ad
is ideal. Donors know exactly what the money is going towards, they know that
advertising is crucial to increasing membership and most importantly, they have
something to point to (or listen to on their own radios! what a thrill!) that
they can say, "I helped put that there! That's my ad!"</p>

<p>Two important tricks of the trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer a range of recommended donations with associated "premiums." 
For example, everyone who donates at least $25 will get notification of 
when the ads will air. Those who donate at least $50 will also get 
their own tape copy of the ad for use in their own area. Those who 
donate at least $100 (the cost of one ad) will also get an autographed 
copy of <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/EdClark.html">Ed Clark's</a> campaign
book (or some other premium.)
<li>Always send thank you cards to any donor and track their donations 
in the membership/prospect database (total donated so far & date of 
last donation). And make sure you send letters to prospects as well. 
Sometimes give more than members do.
</ol>

<p>I have found that information tables are the most effective method of
increasing the number of voters registered Libertarian in an area.  In
Alachua County, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>,
we went from 70 registered LP folks in 1989 or so
to 182 in 1993.  We assume that this is due in large part to the tables
since this is an all time high, and that was the time when we started
tabling at the local fair and other libertarian events.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> said:
For fund raising, putting out a newsletter regularly is good.  Folks like
to see where their money is going.  Also, specific fund raising for
things or events works well.</p>

<p>Jen (<a href="/images/mail.gif" alt=[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:arms45@bikini.cis.ufl.edu">arms45@bikini.cis.ufl.edu</a>) said:
One thing we have started doing here is to get our local newsletter in
gear.  We send it out to every registered libertarian in the county and
every issue has a membership form.  It isn't fancy (1 photocopy sheet,
both sides, tri-folded, bulk mailed) and it doesn't have any articles
that are time consuming to write, just what the local LP is up to and
what happened at the last state LP exec comm meeting.  Also, every copy
has a schedule of events for the next month and phone numbers of who to
contact for more info.</p>

<ol>
<li>Put a method of donation and or membership on every piece of outreach
literature. This is to include a method to reach the organization by mail,
phone, e-mail etc. Also marketing studies have shown that the use of a
telephone icon next to your phone number will increase your call rate by 300%.
<li>Maintain a contact database and keep a handle on who contributes and how
often.  Your database of members,contacts,voters,etc is the most valuable
thing an organization owns.
<li>If possible obtain a 800 number for calls outside of your area.  Its
important to realize that many people like to argue and use the 800 # as an
entertainment device.  Therefore put an answering machine on the line with a
message like the following: "Hello you have reached the Libertarian Party , we
are currently out of the office, if you want some information mailed to you on
the Libertarian Party leave your name, address and phone number, if you need to
speak to a staff member please call (Area code) local number. Thank you."  This
will not only cut your phone bill, keep the 800 line open, but it will also act
as a screening device for the truly interested.

<title>Media Kits</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Media kits and cultivating journalists</h2>
<p>Last updated by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Much of the following information comes from a former journalist who is 
now in public relations.</p>

<p>Q:  What should a media kit include?</p>
<p>A:  It should look professional, not home made.  Include a Nolan Chart 
survey (a.k.a. "The World's Smallest Political Quiz"),  the LP Program 
(not the huge platform), a cover letter, and a reply form which asks 
them whether they'd like to receive a free sampling of libertarian 
magazines (<a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire Books</a>
catalog, etc.), brochures, and a 
VIP subscription to the state <a href="newsletters.html">newsletter</a> (so
they can keep on top of 
your issues; assuming of course that your state newsletter isn't 
pathetic.)  The form should also have a special space for their 
comments and/or questions (since they're reporters).  Include a 
business reply mail envelope (and fax number) so they'll send in their 
responses.  You can then tailor future contacts and mailings to 
reporters who care enough to respond.</p>

<p>Q:  How can state and local parties develop good relationships with
reporters?</p>
<p>A:  Nobody is run more ragged than the daily or weekly news reporter.  
His/her concentration is 80% on what's happening right now, 10% on what 
happened yesterday, and 10% on backgrounding himself about unfamiliar 
subjects.  Individually, they vary greatly in maturity, self-knowledge, 
and experience.  IF their cynicism is not developed from reporting 
experience, it is a traditional attitude they embrace to fit in with 
their on-staff role models.</P>

<p>They look upon Libertarians as just another political party, and 
individuals within it as "sources".  Developing relationships with 
reporters is the original "double-edged sword".  After awhile, if they 
can't find anything wrong with what you're doing, they may <em>look</em> --- if 
only to tell themselves they are being "objective".  For example, they 
will purposely seek out detractors of Libertarianism for quotes in a 
given story.</P>

<p>Nevertheless, you can bet the Ds & Rs know local reporters by name, 
statewide.  They try their damnedest to cut a reporter out of the 
"herd" and groom him/her for future stories, knowing full well the 
reporter with the most sources wins the newsroom games.  On the other 
hand, if reporters develop a good working knowledge of libertarianism, 
it will affect the very questions they ask their sources, which will 
affect what they write  and in turn what people read every day.  This 
process often occurs without the reporter even being aware of it.</P>

<p>After you send out media kits to journalists who cover "our" beat 
(after the elections), you can call them up and invite them to lunch to 
talk about the local/state LP.  Local Libertarians could develop 
relationships with the reporter as Rs and Ds do.  As I said, this is a 
two-edged sword.  But if local Libertarians become respected 
information sources (reliable = accurate), they will be consulted 
concerning Libertarian views on any number of upcoming official 
decisions or current events.  The local Libertarian should be a
respected fact source even for non-political events.  Reporters, 
remember, also thrive on (1) scoops and (2) feature stories on unique 
persons/interesting events.  Reporters may return the favor when 
steered to a "good" story.</P>

<p>A nurtured respect earns you access to one-on-one coffeetime chats with 
them about politics.  You have the right to state at each clatch what 
is on and off the record.   When a reporter chats with you, he most 
likely will be on duty, covering his beat.  Such coverage includes 
chats over coffee or lunch.  While you are developing the relationship, 
the reporter will be aware of your intent.  It's all right with him <em>if</em> 
you can help make his time profitable in terms of providing highly 
current and often little known facts for his editorial mill.  So be 
prepared in that area, too.  Find out what your reporter's beat is 
(schools, city, etc.) and toss him some story leads whenever you can.  
That is the key.  Daily reporters are cautioned not to accept lunch or 
other favors.  Weekly  reporters are, for the most part, less cautious.</P>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Newsletter ideas</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/6/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>For you current or potential LP newsletter editors out there, here are
a couple of ideas for your consideration.  First, let me say that I
think that newsletters should be left to the state LP.  Many
Libertarians are literary wannabes and the Party suffers from an
abundance of absolutely pitiful local newsletters.</p>

<p>Remember, in politics image is everything.  If our prospects and members
are getting crappy, kooky, amateurish mailings, they'll write us off.  Most
of our prospects and members will get their <em>only</em> impression of the
LP from the stuff we mail them.  If you want to work on a newsletter, work
on your state LP's newsletter.  It can probably stand some improvements.</p>

<p>Remember, there are many affordable newsletter design services out
there.  In fact, the local Kinko's Copy shop provides this service. 
You give them the text, and they lay it out.  It looks great, and you
can use it as a template for future issues.  Whatever it costs, you
will get the money back in future donations from people who weren't
scared off by a pathetic newsletter.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of a Newsletter</h3>

<ol>

<li><p>If you can't say anything nice, shut up!</p>

<p>I believe that the purpose of each LP newsletter is to increase morale,
membership, and donations. When I was editor of the <cite>Washington
Libertarian</cite>, which is now in even better hands, I saw each issue as a
combined  fund-raising letter, membership letter, prospect kit, and
volunteer recruitment appeal. Therefore, I am stunned by the number of
newsletters out there that whine about apathy, do dirty laundry in
public, tear down other Libertarians, etc. Nothing turns off prospects,
members, donors, and volunteers faster! Instead of whining about how no
one volunteers for anything, how about writing an article proposing a
new project?</p>

<p>Impressions are everything, and it is a self-fulfilling
prophecy. If your newsletter focuses only on the good stuff, you'll
find more good people becoming motivated to do more good stuff. If your
newsletter whines and complains and tears down, you will encourage more
of the same. I never published letters that were critical of
libertarians, I never ran kooky ads (e.g., "Get the Facts on Infant
Genital Mutilation!"), and I never used off-color language or material.
We must look as professional as possible, not just to show prospects
and the media that we're serious and worth supporting, but to motivate
our members and volunteers (who are also our donors.)</p>

<li><p>Prospect Page</p>

<p>Since newsletters are often used as an outreach piece (in
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> we
send it out in our prospect kit and distribute copies to sympathetic
newsstands) we should have a regular "prospect page" in each issue that
gives a"Libertarianism in One Page" sort of overview. That way, someone
who's reading the newsletter for the first time (maybe it's the first
piece of Libertarian literature they've ever seen) could tell what
we're all about from that page. Run this same page in every issue
(maybe reserve the next to that last page for it.) The top 1/2 would be
an abbreviated LP Program (or something like that) and the bottom 1/2
would be a Nolan survey and the membership/subscription coupon.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Suggestions from a Marketing Consultant</h3>

<p>Here are several excellent suggestions I received for <cite>Washington
Libertarian</cite> (the Washington LP newspaper) and <cite>Liberty
Today</cite> (the national outreach tabloid) from a marketing guru here
at Microsoft who is also a libertarian.  I think they apply to all LP
newsletters...</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Masthead for "Washington Libertarian" should, if not duplicate,
complement one of "Liberty Today."  Goal is to demonstrate that this is
an organized, national, coherent effort - that people won't be pissing
away their money on the Washington Lib Party which is somehow
independent of the national party (read:  50 separate, disparate,
unleveraged efforts).  Ideas:  Same Statue of Liberty icon - pick one
and go with it.  Both are kind of garish but the one on "Liberty Today"
is better - would be worth, but not required, looking at getting a
version of the Statue of Liberty icon which doesn't look so
impersonal/cold.  (Now it has that impersonal look that, say, the
Communist Party would like on their letterhead).</p></li>

<li><p>In masthead of <cite>Washington Libertarian</cite> you <em>must</em>
do as the <cite>Liberty Today</cite> did and put in the phone numbers, CIS
ID and call to action.</p></li>

<li><p><cite>Liberty Today</cite> is a meaningless name - the goal of this
organization is to effect political change, to do that it must recruit
members, the newsletter must do that and keep current members 'home'
(it is akin to a college alumni newsletter).  Change the name to
<cite>Libertarian Party News</cite> or something like that.  Get the party
name in there (if someone were walking by a recruitment table and just
scanning, what's the thing you want to spend your biggest font - the
thing you know they'll read - on....right, the party name.  Now you may
argue, "No, no one has heard of us, we want our message to scream out,
not our name."  I disagree - you're in a loop of a self-fulfilling
prophecy that way - you guarantee they'll never know the party name. 
You aren't selling the idea of freedom - you are selling a political
party and you want people to pay you with votes.  In the voting booth
there is no message next to your candidates' names - just party
affiliation.  I think the party is pretty well known, in any case, so
we can use this analogy:  The Democratic Party has its name above its
tables at events not their slogan "Economic Dark Ages NOW!" or whatever
it is they stand for (helping people, I guess they would say.)</p></li>

<li><p>An idea:  Use the national paper for recruiting new people and the
state paper for recruiting new people but primarily for informing
existing members.  This idea perhaps should be chucked if all major
states don't have their own newspapers.  I suggest this because I
assume the national party has the bucks and they can produce a better
looking product - let that product be your vehicle for getting out the
message - don't waste space redundantly by selling the message in both
newspapers.  Use the local paper to communicate what is happening
locally and what people can do locally - that makes sense because that
is where you want people involved - locally.  This will also nicely
dovetail this way:  "See, we are a national organization with shared
values and we have things you can do to support those values in your
own backyard."</p>

<li><p>In every issue have a column or section titled something like
"Welcome new Libertarians!"  You want the newsletter to focus on
topical events, but you need to realize it is partly a recruiting
device and that new people may be hesitant getting and staying involved
- make 'em feel welcome!  Explain the purpose of the newsletter, the
state party, what they can do, etc.  Perhaps change it every issue
(maybe focusing on what is happening for new people at that time or
where new people are needed at that time) so that existing people don't
get bored with it.</p></li>

<li><p>Text font is fine, headlines font is unprofessional.  Look at what
daily newspapers use and see if that might work.  Current font is a bit
too 'contemporary' and inappropriate for serious communication.</p></li>

<li><p>Letters to the editor.  This ain't a general daily trying to provide
a 'balanced' (yes, I'm rolling on the floor in laughter as I type) view
of the news.  That means, since you are using this for recruiting, that
the ugliest letters of dissent must not be printed.  However, healthy
debates are good because they show people this is a group of
intellectually open people (again, not <em>too</em> open - you don't want
people to think the organization is not well-run and that infighting paralyzes
it).  More letters would be good to demonstrate that and to show that
people are active in the rank-and-file and listened to by the party
'elders.'  Consider expanding this section.</p></li>

<li><p>International News Bites.  Why is this here?  Shouldn't the national
party be focusing on stuff like that?  I'm not dead set against this
section here, but I'd think you could find local things that people
will care more about to write about here (or national, even - most
people really don't give a rat's patootie about the six <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadians</a> who
have a clue and are libertarian).</p></li>

<li><p>Advertisements.  If they are needed financially to stay afloat, then
fine - but they sure give the paper and party that "we're not really
professional politicians" look and feel.</p></li>

<li><p>Bits about rallies, meetings, etc. where the members can go to
voice their opinions are great.  All in all, I'd always emphasize
<em>activities</em> that the party is doing quite heavily, with calls to action
for how people can be involved (even if it is just giving money).</p></li>

<li><p>If the party is pretty big in the state and growing fast, a monthly
chart showing the size and growth rate would be nice - shows people
they are reaching critical mass to effect real change and not some
bizarre little splinter group.  Also helps with recruiting - everyone
loves to jump on a bandwagon.  (If there are really only 100 people in
the party, don't do it - it will drive people off by showing you aren't=
a force.  I'd say the threshold number is 10,000).</p></li>

<li><p>Calendar is excellent - expand and always include.</p></li>
<li><p>News Bites [similar to <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason</a> magazine's "Brickbats"]
is cute and light - keep it.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the membership form.</p></li>
<li><p>All in all, I think the local paper is better than the <cite>Liberty
Today</cite>.  It conveys more relevant information, is more professional and
does a better job of protraying the party as serious and not some
bizarre, wacko group of anarchists.  Very nice job!</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Planning the Content</h3>

<p>Layout templates and spreadsheets</p>

<p>Some editors change the layout every issue, but when I was editor, I
used the same template for each issue so that I knew I always needed a
500-word article for the top of page 5, and a half-page ad for the
bottom of page 5, etc. It saved a lot of time, and I always knew what
length text to ask my authors for.</p>

<p>I also used a spreadsheet to lay-out current and future issues. The
first column looked like this:</p>

<p>Items Needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 1: full page cover story (750 words with photo, 1000 words
	without)</li>
<li>Page 1: 3 x 5 photo or artwork (optional)</li>
<li>Page 2: 1/4 page "From the Chair" column (250 words)</li>
<li>Page 2: 1/4 page "Projects" column (250 words)</li>
<li>Page 2: 1/2 page advertisement or article (500 words)</li>
<li>etc.
</ul>

<p>The second column listed the next issue ("FEBRUARY") and the third
column listed the subsequent issue and so on. In the appropriate cells,
I'd then list the name of the article or the author or the advertiser
(and when the ad was paid for). This way, I was able to reserve space
for multiple ads, regular features, etc. It saved me a lot of time and
bother because I could always tell what I still needed for the next
issue (and for several issues down the road.)</p>

<h3>Getting Articles</h3>

<p>Libernet is a great source of news items.  Also, you should contact
allied organizations (national, state, and local) and ask them to add
you to their press release list.  That way, you can cover their
projects as well (National Taxpayers Union, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato</a>, Reason, etc.)</p>

<title>Nolan Booths</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Nolan booth procedures</h2>
<p>Last updated 8/5/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Lots of people requested more information on running successful Nolan 
booths on campus, so I decided to mail LIBERNET. I hope that this 
encourages all of you (students and non-students) to spend a nice 
afternoon at your local campus introducing students to libertarianism. 
In my 7 years of activism, I haven't found anything more <em>fun</em>, more 
rewarding, or more important!</p>

<h3>Purpose of Nolan Booths</h3>

<p>I've run many Nolan booths on campus and I encourage you to do the 
same. The following tips are the results of lots of mistakes and 
successes, so learn from my experiences! I think campus Nolan booths 
are the single most important activity a libertarian organization can 
undertake for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discovering young libertarians for recruitment. Get 'em when they're 
young and they're yours forever!</li>
<li>Helping the student population find out what a libertarian is (and
isn't).</li>
<li>Providing a libertarian presence on campus.</li>
<li>It's a fun activity for libertarians to do. You find 'em, and then 
put 'em to work finding others!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Location and Timing</h3>

<p>Pick the best high-traffic (pedestrian, of course) area you can on 
campus. You probably don't need permission to set up a booth outside, 
but you may need permission to set up inside campus buildings. The best 
time to do this is early in the term before people get too busy and 
when they are still open to joining campus groups. If you can do these 
booths regularly (once a month?) that's awesome, if you can only do it 
a couple of times, focus on the beginning of the term.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Nolan Booths</h3>

<p>I recommend that you own these materials yourself. If it's owned in 
common, it gets lost or trashed. He who pays for it (or works for it) 
gets to own it. When you graduate, donate it to the next activist. If 
you are low on funds, hit up the local or state LP and explain the 
importance of campus outreach. If that fails, hit up the good folks on 
LIBERNET or at the national LP...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At least one, at best three, volunteers for each 2-hour shift.
Friendly, outgoing people are the best! They don't need to be gifted 
orators because the point is to process surveys, not debate 
libertarianism. In fact, you should <em>not</em> debate or explain, it wastes 
time and creates a hostile atmosphere. Just refer people to the free 
literature. Be really friendly and pleasant. No arguing! If someone 
acts like a jerk, ignore them!</p></li>
<li><p>Clipboards with Nolan surveys. You'll go through about 25 an hour 
per clipboard.</p></li>
<li><p>A crate of prospect kits that your state LP normally sends to 
prospects. By handing them out to your new prospects, you can save the 
state LP a lot of postage costs. Expect to give out about 5 per manhour 
(see STATISTICS, below.) All of your printed materials (including the 
survey) should have your group's name and phone number.</p></li>
<li><p>A card table to hold free literature (don't forget
paperweights!)</p></li>
<li><p>A Nolan chart poster attached to foamcore or cardboard, laminated. 
(optional)</p></li>
<li><p>Sticky post-it dots for scoring people on the poster.
(optional)</p></li>
<li><p>An easel to hold the Nolan poster. (optional)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>How to Run the Booth</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask passersby, "Do you have a minute for our political opinion
poll?"</p></li>
<li><p>Ask them the survey questions and circle their answers. Plot them on 
the sheet. By doing it for them, you speed up the process and passersby hear
what's going on.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot dots on the big poster, if you have one. This is a real 
attention getter, and soon people will be stopping at the booth waiting 
in line for the survey! No kidding!</p></li>
<li><p>When, you've scored the person, identify yourself as a member of the 
campus libertarian group and:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>give them their survey back and encourage them to try it on
	their friends later,</li>
	<li>if they score high libertarian (80/80 or higher) ask if they'd
	"like to receive more info on the LP."</li>
	<li>give them the official prospect kit (do this after you get their
	address.) Put a checkmark next to their name so you know that you don't
	spend money sending them the same kit.</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>Keep a sign-up sheet at the bottom of each clipboard and write down 
their name/address/phone/year. Since you write it down <em>legibly</em>, you're 
able to read it, and it goes quickly. Getting names is the single most 
important reason you're doing this! These people will be your future 
members and activists... Make sure to get phone numbers!</p></li>
<li><p>When you're done for the day, go grab a pizza with your volunteers 
to celebrate and talk about what worked and what can be improved. (This 
builds esprit de corps that's crucial to any group.)</p></li>
<li><p>Send these names to your state LP membership director ASAP so they 
can be put on the mailing list. If you've already given these people 
prospect kits, make sure the membership director understands this! 
You'll save them a lot of money!</p></li>
<li><p>EXTRA CREDIT: Submit one of these surveys to the campus newspaper 
along with a press release showing the statistics over a couple of 
months. This would be an interesting news item, wouldn't it? That's an 
easy way to get publicity for your campus group, libertarianism, and 
the booth itself. If you want to get fancy, break down the info by year 
or by sex or by major, etc.</p></li>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>Call the folks on the sign-up sheet about a week later and ask what 
they think about libertarianism, if they're interested in staying on 
the mailing list, and if they'd like to help with the next Nolan booth. 
By getting them involved, even before they're 100% sure, you speed them 
along the educational curve. This is more than enough for any campus 
group to do, but if you're ambitious, you can bring speakers to campus, 
hold discussion groups, etc.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>In my experience, you can expect to process about 25 surveys each 
man-hour (one person working one hour.) About 20% of all your 
participants will score high libertarian (80/80 or higher) and sign 
your mailing list. That means you will distribute about 5 prospect kits 
each man-hour (e.g., so two people doing a four hour shift should bring 
at least 40 prospect kits.)</p>

<h3>More Info?</h3>

<p>If you'd like to get copies of the Nolan booth literature we're using 
(survey and other handouts), send me a 55-cent stamp and I'll rush a 
kit to you. Then, if you like, I can make customized masters for you 
(with your student group address and info) all for the same low price 
(just the postage.) Also, let me know if you have any further questions 
on technique or strategy.</p>

<title>Organizers</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Organizers -- Recruiting & Training Them</h2>
<p>Last updated 5/29/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>The LP needs lots of local organizers to find new prospects and members 
using <a href="booths.html">Nolan booths</a>, seminars, etc.</p>

<p>It should be the goal of every state LP to have active organizers in 
each county (or at least each major city) in the state.  And someone on 
your executive committee (the state chair, the membership chair, etc.) 
should be responsible for personally recruiting these organizers.  (If 
you're not on the executive committee yourself, but would like to be an 
organizer or help recruit organizers, offer them your services!)

<p>It is crucial that instead of just designating some stranger to be the 
organizer for a particular county or city that you meet him or her in 
person and make sure that the person is qualified.  Nothing is worse 
than having an organizer who turns people off.  It is better to not 
have an organizer at all than to have a poor one.  (After all, that 
person represents the LP and might be scaring off potential members, 
volunteers and donors.)  You want someone who has his/her act 
together, is friendly and outgoing, is not a kook, and shows common 
sense.  (They will learn the skills later.)  To make these important 
judgements, you need to meet prospective organizers in person and watch 
them in action.  An ideal way to do this is to get them together to do 
a Nolan booth in their area.  (Or if not you, then someone you trust in 
a nearby area, such as the organizer in the next county.)</p>

<p>To recruit your prospective organizers, get a list of volunteers for 
each particular area.  Find those who have volunteered to be organizers 
or help with Nolan booths or be candidates, etc.  Call them up and ask 
them to help do a Nolan booth and figure out ideal dates and locations. </p>

<p>Remember, you are organizing this one, so it's up to you to ultimately 
decide the details. Hopefully, you'll be able to involve as many 
volunteers (ones you think might be good organizers) as possible.  
You'll be training them and doing the Nolan booth with them, so you'll 
get to see them in action.  When the day is done, make notes on the 
volunteers and determine if you have found any potential organizers.</P>

<p>If not, repeat this process with a new batch of volunteers in that 
county or city.  If you think you have found some organizers, give them 
a call soon after to thank them again for their help and to ask if 
they'd like to continue doing Nolan booths.  If so, ask if they'd like 
to organize the next one (you will be their mentor.)  Basically, this 
is the way to get organizers started.  In fact, the most important 
thing local organizers can do is organize Nolan booths (and send the 
list of prospects they've found to the state office.)  Anything else is 
icing on the cake (but the cake comes first!)</p>

<p>Once they've run their first Nolan booth, ask them to become the 
official LP organizer in their area.  Explain to them that their main 
task would be organizing Nolan booths and that the state LP will get 
them the names of volunteers, etc.  Offer to sell them (at cost) the 
Nolan booth kit (card table, easel, and poster) so that they have one 
of their very own (this also helps determine their committment.)  Call 
this organizer every few months to encourage and offer help.  Send 
monthly updates of volunteers in their area.  If the person turns out 
to be a good organizer, encourage them to move onto the next level 
(creating an official regional LP.)  If the person turns out to be a 
dud (give them at least 6 months, but no more than a year) find a new 
organizer!</p>

<title>High School Outreach</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: current -->
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Outreach to High Schools</h2>
<p>Last updated 9/5/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>I have spoken to almost a dozen high school and college classes and I 
find it one of the most personally rewarding activities.  It's also 
very important to reach students (and teachers) with our message.  It 
legitimizes the LP when they get invited to speak to your class.  And 
when they see what a good job you do (whether they agree with you or 
not) it gives a good image of the LP.</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to expose these kids to Libertarian ideas and to 
give them enough information so they can progress on their own (by 
giving them a solid info packet.)</p>

<p>The following ideas assume that you want to organize a speaker's bureau 
in your area (check with your county LP first to make sure there isn't 
one already.)  However,  you'll find plenty of ideas to use even if 
intend to go solo.</p>

<h3>Identify Good Speakers</h3>

<p>Interest in having political speakers is usually highest in October 
(because of the elections in early November) but I've been invited to 
speak throughout the school year.  At any rate, get into the routine at 
the beginning every school year of identifying the volunteers who would 
be good speakers.  They don't need to be awesome orators, they just 
need to be nice, friendly people who don't come across as raving kooks. </p>

<p>They need to be comfortable with public speaking, obviously, but they 
also need to dress respectably (i.e., business suit.)  You want to look 
like you're ready to assume public office.  If you don't take yourself 
seriously, they won't take you seriously either.  People who have (or 
want to) run for office should practice their public speaking by 
talking to high school classes.</p>

<h3>Solicit Speaking Engagements</h3>

<p>Once you've identified your stable of speakers, assign each one of them 
a local school district.  Have them draw up a list of all the high 
schools in their district (don't forget private schools).  Focus on 
high schools in upper-class neighborhoods (the kids are better 
educated, college-bound, and, who knows, you might get their rich 
parents interested, too!)  Get the address and phone number for each 
school.  Then, call up each of the schools and ask for the names of all 
the Civics/Social Studies/Politics/Government (or whatever they call it
in your area) teachers that teach Seniors.  (Juniors are ok, too, but 
don't waste your time with younger kids.)  Make sure you get the 
spelling of their names right and get their personal phone numbers as well.</p>

<p>The coordinator then creates a database with all of this information 
and sends a form letter to all of the teachers.  The letter might read 
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Ms. Jackson,</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party often gets requests to send a representative to 
speak to local high school classes.  Many teachers would like their 
students to be exposed to alternative political parties, and we are 
happy to oblige with classroom presentations on the third largest party 
in the country (and its history, positions, and unique role in American 
politics.)   We have already done well-received presentations at 
Churchill, Gateway, and Penn Hills High Schools.</p>

<p>I am writing to let you know that we are again booking speakers in 
your area.  Please contact me as soon as possible to ensure that 
speakers are available when you need them.</p>

<p>We are also happy to provide schools with reference materials on the 
Libertarian Party, including books and videotapes, and to provide 
participants for debates, political fairs, or materials for class projects.</p>

<p>I have enclosed materials to acquaint you with the Libertarian Party 
and its views.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Tom Isenberg, 206-936-7359</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Send your standard prospect kit to the teacher (it should include the 
National LP Program and the Nolan Chart survey.)  To see the awesome 
prospect kit that we use, send two 29-cent stamps to: LPWS, P.O. Box 
20732, Seattle, WA 98102.</p>

<p>Two weeks after these letters have gone out, have your speakers do a 
follow-up call to the teachers in their assigned schools.  The call 
might go as follows:  "Hello, this is Tom Isenberg.  I'm with the 
Libertarian Party of King County and I wanted to make sure you received 
the information we sent you on our speakers program.  Would you like a
representative of the Libertarian Party to make a presentation to your 
class?  Etc."</p>

<p>Arrange for a mutually satisfactory time, get 
directions, find out how many students you will be speaking to, and 
call back to confirm the day before the speech.  Try not to schedule 
more than two classes on a given day, you'll be exhausted.  If 
possible, schedule for early morning classes (teenagers get sleepy 
after lunch.)</p>

<h3>Prepare Handouts</h3>

<p>Image is everything in politics.  That's why you have to look and act 
first-class.  Also, your literature has to look sharp.  We want to make 
sure that students have something to take home and show their family 
and friends, put up on their bedroom wall, and maybe even act on later. </p>

<p> So bring enough copies of the Nolan Chart survey (with your membership 
form, reading list, etc. on the back) and the "Bill of Rights: Void 
Where Prohibited by Law" handbill for each student (if you want to get 
a copy of either, contact me.)  Have your assistant hand them out 
before class begins.</p>

<p>Also, you'll want to bring some prospect kits for students who want 
them (about 30% of the class.)  Start with your standard prospect kit
and add a free issue of Reason magazine, the Cato books catalog, the 
Freeman, and the Laissez-Faire Books catalog.  (These organizations 
have provided free supplies for distribution, so ask them.)  For more 
information on professional-looking prospect kits, contact me.  Also, 
include photocopies of contests/scholarship/seminar info for college 
libertarians (you know, the full page ads you see in Reason.)  Many 
kids are college-bound and may be interested in such things.</p>

<p>Make sure you give a copy of this prospect kit for the teacher, in 
addition to a copy of Robert Ringer's <cite>Restoring the American Dream</cite>
or other introductory book for his classroom library.</p>

<h3>Give the Presentation</h3>

<p>To get a copy of the <a href="speech.html">standard high school speech</a>
 I give, contact me.</p>

<p>Always bring an assistant with you.  Bring someone who would like to 
give speeches, so they can see what it's like (to see that it's not so 
hard.)  You'll want them to dress as professionally as you do, because 
you're both representing the Libertarian Party, a serious political 
party.  Have your assistant distribute handouts and take notes (ideas 
for improvements, questions that were asked, etc.)  You'll use these
notes to improve next time.</p>

<p>Dress for success.  Wear a suit.  Look like you're in office already.  
If you look like a schmoe, go give a speech on behalf of the Socialist 
Workers Party instead, you'll help our cause more.</p>

<p>Hang out with the teacher before and after class.  Make conversation.  
Let him get to know you as a
decent normal person (not a fanatic kook).  Don't debate politics with 
him, make friends with him.  You want him to invite Libertarians back, 
year after year.</p>

<h3>Solicit the Junior Statesmen Foundation</h3>

<p>Finally, check with your state and county LP to see if you should make 
yourself available as an LP representative to the Junior Statesmen 
Foundation chapter in your area: call 1-800-334-5353, in Northern CA, 
call 415-347-1600.  Or write to: The Junior State of America, 60 E. 
Third Ave #320, San Mateo, CA 94401-4032.  This nationwide organization 
is geared towards high school students who are interested in politics.  
They hold annual conventions complete with debates, keynote speakers, 
seminars, and political fairs.  The 1994 Junior State of America
regional conventions were held in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/Spokane.html">Spokane</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>,
Anaheim, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>,
Seattle,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>, and Santa Clara.</p>

<p>In
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> state,
they always invite the Libertarians to set up a 
literature table.  We do the <a href="booths.html">Nolan booth</A> there,
and it's always the hit 
of the political fair.  If you can address the entire convention (by 
giving a speech or participating in a debate) that'd be awesome.  Push 
for that.  But at least participate in the political fair.  Obviously, 
you want to encourage libertarian students in your area to attend this 
and give presentations.</p>

<title>Primaries vs. Conventions</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Primaries vs. conventions</h2>
<p>Last updated 9/11/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<h3>Primaries -- <em>bad</em> idea</h3>

<p>In 1992 and 1994 in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, the LP had
the right to have primaries.
In Texas, if the LP chooses to have a primary, that applies to the whole
state.  It is not permitted to have primaries in some counties and
conventions in other counties.  Only about 10 to 15 counties in Texas even
have an active county party that has had a convention.</p>

<p>Even the best organized counties in Texas do not have the quantity of
activists necessary to hold a primary.  Honey Lanham and I did the research
on the possiblity of having a primary in Dallas County.</p>

<p>There are several hundred polling places in Dallas County.  You need three
people per polling place.  They cannot be a candidate in that precinct.</p>

<p>The LP could, with permission of the FEC and the U.S. Dept. of Justice and
the Secretary of State of Texas, combine precincts and reduce the number of
polling places.  According to Bruce Sherbert, Dallas County Election
Administrator, those agencies would <em>never</em> approve fewer than 16 polling
places for a county the size and population of Dallas.  3 x 16 = 48 workers
minimum.  They must not be candidates.</p>

<p>There was a book 2 inches thick full of rules and regulations to be
studied.  There were all kinds of enormous paperwork burdens.  There was
enough work to keep one person busy at least 4 hours a day for several weeks
... maybe months before the primary -- just in Dallas County.  If Dallas and
Tarrant and Harris and a few other counties had primaries, the 200 other
counties in Texas would have <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>The filing fees for the 1992 LP Texas candidates would have been $80,000
to $100,000.  Most of our offices were uncontested at the convention.  Why
have a primary if only one libertarian applied for the job?  Would you run
for County Commisioner if you had to pay $500 to do so?</p>

<h3>History of Primaries in Texas</h3>

<p>In 1900, there was virtually no Republican Party in Texas.  As the
Republicans began to gain in strength, the Democrats who ran the Texas
Legislature passed a law requiring political parties to have primaries if
that party's candidate for governor got more than 20% of vote.  Between 2%
and 20%, a primary was optional.  For 20 years, the Republicans had the
option to have a primary and they chose to <em>not</em> have one. Then, one
year, they got 19% of the vote for governor and they had one anyway.  In that
year, the Republican candidate for governor got only 15% of the vote.
Having a primary <em>hurt</em> the Republican Party.</p>

<p>The Republicans <em>never</em> had another primary unless they
<em>had</em> to.</p>

<p>The history was obvious - The Republicans gradually gained strength until
they <em>had</em> to have a primary.  Then, when they held the primary they
did worse than the had done in the previous election <em>without</em> a
primary.</p>

<p>The explanation is very clear.  Running a primary is an enormously
expensive burden on a party because of the paperwork and bureaucracy.  It
is an enormously expensive burden on its candidates because of filing fees.</p>

<p>Each time the Republican Party had a primary, its candidates did
<em>worse</em> than
they did in the preceeding election when there was no primary to drain the
party of resources.</p>

<p>This happened repeatedly for 20 to 30 years.  Got more than 20% and they
were <em>forced</em> to have a primary.  The primary drained their resources and
they got less than 20% and chose to <em>not</em> have a primary.  Regained some
resources and got more than 20% again and were <em>forced</em> to have a primary
again.  Lost momentum again.  They did not consistently stay above 20%
until the 1940s.  From the <em>first</em> time they got more than 20%, it was 20
to 30 years before they <em>always</em> got more than 20% for governor.</p>

<p>The Democrats <em>forced</em> the Republicans to have a primary to weaken
it.</p>

<p>In Texas, each party pays for its own primary and the state of Texas
reimburses the party for most of its expenses.  In 1992, the Republicans
and Democrats received $12 Million <em>each</em> from the state of Texas
as <em>partial</em> reimbursement for holding a primary.</p>

<p>If the LP had a primary in 10 counties (leaving the other 200 with nothing),
the LP would probably have to spend over $4 Million and then apply to the
state of Texas for reimbursement.  The Democrats and Republicans have to
authorize a special bill authorizing this reimbursement.  What happens if
they claim we did not fill out the forms correctly.  They might delay payment
and we go broke.</p>

<p>Where is the LP Texas going to get $4 Million?</p>

<p>A primary is an expensive burden on the taxpayers of Texas.</p>


<p>These are the facts for Texas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Primary costs LP Texas over 4 Million dollars.</li>

<li>LP applies to Texas for reimbursement of most of that money.</li>

<li>Primary costs LP candidates $80,000 to $100,000 in filing fees.</li>

<li>Primaries can only be held in largest counties because only they have
   a county organization.  All other counties are ignored.</li>

<li>Each county needs full time person to fill out forms and talk to
   bureaucrats for several weeks/months before primary.</li>

<li>On primary day, each large county like Dallas, needs at <em>least</em> 48
poll workers all day long (14 hours).</li>

<li>LP candidates cannot be poll workers in their own district.</li>

<li>LP activists have no money and little energy left after the costly
primary to campaign and they will get fewer votes in the general election.</li>

<li>Primaries were created by large parties to weaken small parties and
subsidize large parties.  The taxpayer pays in both cases.</li>
</ol>

<title>Phone Service</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Phone service for LP groups</h2>
<p>Last updated 4/2/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<h3>Your Phone Line Is Your Life Line</h3>

<p>The most basic function of each state LP is to have a phone line to 
handle inquiries. Ideally, this should consist of both a local and 
toll-free number that goes to a voice mail box, not a physical phone or 
someone's answering machine. The reason is that a voice mail box is 
always on duty, always cheerful, never screws up, and the phone number 
won't ever need to be changed (i.e., because your phone staffer moves 
or is not doing a very good job.) In Washington state, we disconnected our 
physical phoneline and had the existing number redirected to a voice 
mail box. Things are much more efficient now!</p>

<h3>Voice Mail Boxes</h3>

<p>Instead of having a residential phone/answering machine, get a "market 
expansion line" and a voice mail box from your local phone company. 
(You can keep your existing number.) Your phone company's voice mail 
service won't cost much more than cheaper companies, and they're not 
likely to go out of business. Remember, your phone number will be on a 
lot of literature, so you don't want to have to change it! In 
Washington state, our "phone bill" is about $30 a month with a one-time 
setup fee of $40. Make sure that only one person (ideally, the 
membership chair, or whoever handles prospect mailings) knows the 
password to the voice mail box. Make sure that only one person (your 
Treasurer?) is authorized to make any changes/cancellations to this 
service and arrange with the voice mail company to demand a password 
before implementing any changes. Have an attractive female voice record 
your friendly voice mail message. "Thank you for calling the 
Libertarian Party of Washington! We're sorry, but all our lines are 
busy. [Technically, that's true. ;-)] To receive a free information 
packet, please leave your name, address, and phone number. Thank you 
for calling!"</p>

<h3>Toll-Free Numbers</h3>

<p>Also, get a toll-free number for prospects outside your local calling 
area. In
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>,
we use Sprint (1-800-877-4020) for our toll-free 
number, and it doesn't cost much more than cheaper services (plus 
they'll be in business for a while.) Our toll-free bill is about $25 a 
month, and there is no setup fee. You can pick your toll-free number, 
so make it something easier to remember (if you were to hear it on a 
radio ad, for example.) There are still some 1-800-nnn-1776 numbers 
left! And make sure that your 1-800 number also goes to your voice mail 
box. Again, make sure that only one person (your Treasurer?) is 
authorized to make any changes/cancellations to your toll-free service 
and arrange with the phone company to demand a password before 
implementing any changes.</p>

<h3>Phone Listings</h3>

<p>Call <em>all</em> the local phone companies that service your state to get 
your 1-800 number listed in all the major phone books in the state 
(outside of the local calling area, of course.) Put the number in the 
White Pages, don't bother with the Yellow Pages (it costs extra and 
most people wouldn't know what heading to look under.) List the local 
number in your local area directories only. Due to the monopoly nature 
of local phone service, phone books do not overlap coverage areas. It 
costs about $1 a month for each phone book listing (included on your  
phone bill.) Also, make sure that your toll-free numbers are listed 
statewide with directory assistance, the Secretary of State, the League 
of Women Voters, etc. Anticipate the different ways people will try to 
find your number!</p>

<title>Selling the LP</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Selling the LP</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/16/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some answers I give to friends who raise common objections to 
the LP of the "I like you guys, but..." variety.  This is written for 
Republicans, but can be easily modified for Democrats.</p>

<p>I have started keeping a file of "debate" answers so I don't have to 
spend time rewriting them. I just cut and paste and modify. It only 
took me 7 years to figure this out, too! &lt;g&gt;</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  There are some areas of the Libertarian platform that bother me.</p>

<p>A. Nobody agrees with any given platform 100%, but maybe the LP is 
closer to your principles than the Rs or Ds are. I figure that as long 
as the LP train is going in the right direction (reducing the 
size/power/cost of government) I'll ride as far as I can with them on 
those issues that I agree with. At some point, we all get off at 
different stops.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q. Isn't voting Libertarian just throwing your vote away?</p>

<p>A. Well, I think we're throwing our votes away if we don't vote for 
Libertarians. We're only encouraging the other statist parties. We're 
giving them our sanction by voting for them.  A vote for Libertarians, 
on the other hand, sticks out like a sore thumb. No one knows why 
someone votes Republican (because their parents are Republicans?) A 
Libertarian vote says, "Wake up, Republicans. I mean it when we say we 
want free markets and individual liberty."  Besides, Libertarians <em>are</em>
winning at the state and local level. There are four state legislators 
now (and about 120 other office-holders nationwide.) This is more than 
any other minor party. And LP numbers are increasing every year.</p>

<p>Perhaps you were thinking of the presidential race? Of course the LP 
candidate won't win in the foreseeable future, but that's not the 
point. The point of entering the presidential race is to get out there 
and spread the message with a high-level campaign. And we get 
exponentially more coverage each time.</p>

<p>The LP's purpose is two-fold. One is obviously to get people elected, 
and we're having more success every year. I hope that we will reach 
"critical mass" at some point and start a snowball effect, probably 
when we elect our first U.S. Congressman. Until then, the more people 
vote Libertarian, the more the Rs and Ds will have to move in a 
libertarian direction to re-capture those votes. This has already 
happened in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> U.S. Senate
race where the Republican candidate 
(Paul Coverdell) promised to enter some Libertarian bills if the 
Georgia LP promised to withdraw their "spoiler" candidate and endorse 
him instead. As you may know, this strategy worked well for Norman 
Thomas' Socialist Party in the '30s and '40s. They never got anyone 
elected to anything besides mayor of Milwaukee, but they quit running 
candidates in 1956 because the Rs and Ds had adopted all of their 
platform planks!</p>

<p>Perhaps the LP can have the same effect in the 
opposite direction. Obviously, we try to pick our battles wisely.  It 
makes no sense to run a Libertarian against a pretty good Republican.  
Libertarians run against crappy moderate Republicans, where the 
Democrat is no worse. Believe me, there are more of these races than 
the former.  We don't want to waste our votes, either, and we support 
good Republicans wherever possible. But where they stink, we'll be 
there as spoiler candidates (at the least) or run hard campaigns to win 
(at the best.)  Either way, the Republican Party learns a lesson and 
puts up better, more "libertarian" candidates next time around. For 
many years, Libertarians have generated some of the best ideas to be 
adopted by the Republicans: privatization, term limits, school choice, 
legalized gold ownership, etc.</p>

<p>The other purpose is to serve as an educational "clearinghouse." LP 
members (candidates, students, etc.) spread the libertarian message via 
advertisements, campus lectures, talk shows, interviews, op-ed columns
or in discussion with friends. Interested people then call up the LP 
and get an info kit that presents them with a complete, consistent, 
principled vision and moral defense of limited government (often for 
the first time in their lives.) They also learn about the wide range of 
libertarian/conservative organizations, thinktanks, magazines, books, 
etc. Whether they end up becoming LP members or not doesn't really 
matter (it's nice, especially if they send $$$ to help out with these 
activities.) But we're happy if they become better Republicans (or even 
better Democrats) and help move their parties in a more libertarian 
direction on those issues that they agree with the LP on, e.g., make 
the Republicans deliver on their free-market rhetoric and make the 
Democrats deliver on their individual liberties rhetoric. Did you know 
that Rep. Dana Rohrbacher (R-CA) was once the chair of the California 
LP? Several other Republicans (particularly at the state legislature 
level) were also LP stalwarts before they decided to run as Republicans.</p>

<p>Bottom line: join the LP.  If you think their train is going in the 
right direction (free markets and limited government), ride it as far 
as you can.  At least they're going in the right direction.  The 
Democrats and Republicans are both heading in the wrong direction 
(socialism and Big Brother), just at different speeds. If you're really 
in favor of free markets, individual liberty & <em>responsibility</em>, and 
limited constitutional government (all of which must mean that you're 
disgusted with the Republicans) call the Libertarian Party for a free 
information kit: 1-800-353-1776.</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Speech: What is the LP?</h2>
<p>Last updated 4/24/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are the notes for my standard speech to <a
href="highschools.html">high school classes</a> and
introductory seminars. The presentation takes about 30 minutes (not
including the Q&A portion, of course.) Maybe you can use it in your
presentations.</p>

<p>I gave this speech yesterday to a local H.S. class and it was very
well-received. The teacher especially liked it (she scored Libertarian,
herself.) So call up your local H.S., ask for the names of civics
teachers, and write them a letter announcing your availability to do a
presentation on the LP.</p>

<p>This speech has evolved over the years, and I'm still trying to improve
it. Send your suggestions directly to <a
href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Bring:</h3>

<ul>
<li>overhead foils: Nolan quiz and chart</li>
<li>handouts: Nolan quizzes, Bill of Rights: Void Where Prohibited By Law</li>
<li>prospect kits for teacher and kids who want more info (include cool
things like <a href="bumperstickers.html">bumperstickers</a>)</li>
<li><cite>Restoring the American Dream</cite> and <cite>Capitalism: The
Unknown Ideal</cite> as
gifts for the teacher's classroom library (also a recent sample issue
of <cite>Reason</cite> and <cite>The Freeman</cite>.)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>The Speech</h3>

<h3>Introduce Myself</h3>

<p>Name, where I work, how long I've been involved with the LP, etc.
Write your name, address, and phone on the index card if you want to be
on the mailing list.</p>

<p>This talk is a quick 30 minute overview, so let's hold Q&A until the end.
I have info packets if you want more info. Pick one up on your way out
after class.</p>

<h3>What is the LP?</h3>

<p>3rd largest US party, 100s in office (state legislators and mayors),
organized in all 50 states;
LP is only a small part of the movement: thinktanks, professors, 
magazines, conferences, etc.;
(Info packet available at the end.)</p>

<h3>What is Libertarianism?</h3>

<p>Probably the same as your personal philosophy: live and let live.
Thou shalt not aggress;
Aggression = theft, violence, fraud, trespass, pollution, breaking
contracts, etc;
Derivation: Self-ownership => property rights => all human rights
=> Free markets, civil liberties, non-intervention in foreign affairs;
This is the philosophy of Founding Fathers and Declaration of Independence;
LP puts these philosophical principles first when taking positions.
Rs and Ds put politics ahead of what's right. But does might make
right? Does majority make right?</p>

<h3>Is the LP Liberal or Conservative or What?</h3>

<p>Was Thomas Jefferson right-wing or left-wing?
Libs combine the best of liberalism and the best of conservatism for a
consistent pro-individual rights platform.
Bogosity of one-dimensional left-right "map": where do you put friend
who things both guns and drugs should be legal? Where do you put a
friend who thinks both guns and drugs should be illegal?</p>

<p>Explain the Nolan chart.
Have everyone take the Nolan quiz.
Go through each question and explain it. Explain how a Libertarian
would answer it.
Show students how to score themselves and ask for show of hands for
each quadrant.
Encourage students to survey their friends & parents later to see if
they're Nazis or what...</p>

<h3>Why the LP?</h3>

<p>No one agrees with any party 100%, but maybe we're closest to what you
believe. Don't waste your vote. Vote libertarian to send a clear message that
people will understand.
Minor parties don't need to win to have a profound impact (e.g., U.S.
Socialists in 1930s.)
Rhetoric aside, Rs and Ds are pretty much the same: big government
power brokers.
Their philosophy is get elected and stay elected, whatever it takes.
Republicans aren't really pro-free-markets (give examples)
Democrats aren't really pro-civil-liberties (give examples)</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

<p>First off, if I don't get to <em>your</em> question, these info packets will
probably have the answer so make sure you pick one up on your way out
of you're interested in the LP.
(If no one has a question, start them off with one. For example, say
"Often I get the question, doesn't laissez-faire capitalism result in
oppression?" Pick a tough one and answer it well.)</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Spokespersons</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/1/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here is some Q&A about appointing a spokesperson for your LP group.</p>

<blockquote>
We here are looking at setting up a media committee, especially now that
we got us some candidates.  The idea is to get a group of 3 people (5 max)
who can practice working out replies to media when they call for interviews,
and prep candidates to do likewise.
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent idea! At the very least, all candidates and party officers 
should get this training. Here in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>,
we do it as part of our annual 
Campaign Management School in May. (We promote this in one of our 
quarterly fundraiser mailings to all our members, encouraging them to 
be candidates or campaign workers or campaign donors for the coming 
elections.) Let me recommend that you order some of David Bergland's 
"Bite Size Answers" tapes from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ASG.html">Advocates for Self Government</a>
(about $10 
and I believe you can make and distribute free copies.) They are 
perfect for this sort of training; I think every Libertarian should own 
one! Call them at 1-800-932-1776 for a complete catalog.</p>

<blockquote>
My question for you:  what is your protocol when the media call?  Do you
assign a spokesperson?
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we assign a spokesperson.  I am usually that person, due to my 
experience and ability and comfort-level.  I am also the "receptionist" 
who checks our statewide 1-800 voicemail system several times a day, 
so I'm able to meet these needs as soon as they arise.  It's a good 
idea to train your receptionist as well or to at least make sure they 
have an updated list of authorized spokespersons who are available 
during the day and also at night.</p>

<blockquote>
Do you try to get your top-billing candidate to do
the interview (ours has radio experience, which was our main reason for
picking him)?
</blockquote>

<p>That depends. Sometimes reporters ask for the Chair or for a candidate. 
But if either of these are poor speakers, I steer them to our 
"authorized" speakers.</p>

<blockquote>
Do reporters generally give out their questions ahead of time,
or was it amateurish of me to ask?
</blockquote>

<p>It was amateurish of you to ask, but understandable! You should keep a 
list of questions that reporters typically ask so that you can train 
people to answer them.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<title>Supper Clubs</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Supper Clubs</h2>
<p>Last updated 5/17/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Someone recently posted the criticism that LP meetings have speakers 
who "preach to the converted" as opposed to " talk about effective 
communications, history, etc."  As someone who helps run the Patrick 
Henry Lecture Series here in the Seattle area ("supper club" sounds too 
dowdy to me), I have some ideas on this.</p>

<p>I have nothing against "preaching to the converted" as long as the 
converted are eager to pay the entrance fee and are encouraged to bring 
newcomers as well. This definitely has its place. But variety is the 
spice of life, so we try something different every time.</p>

<p>We ask a $2 donation at the door and we keep track of attendance, so we 
have a sense of what the "market" wants. Our best attended lectures (we 
average 20) have been given by people who are fighting the government 
in high-profile cases (e.g., Dr. Jonathan Wright vs FDA). Also, 
representatives of well-known organizations draw a lot of people. (We 
also try to invite politicians who support our position on a particular 
bill. This is more for them to get to know us than vice versa.)</p>

<p>For activist-oriented topics (e.g., effective communications, 
campaigning, etc.) we hold separate LP workshops, since these topics 
have limited interest.</p>

<p>If people in my area have ideas for topics or speakers, they get in 
touch, and I'm glad they do. So, if you want to improve your local 
supper club, let the organizer know what you want.</p>

<p>Another problem we occasionally face is, how shall I put it, weirdos. 
People who are either kooks or druggies or very unpleasant.  I've been 
to supper clubs that I would feel embarrassed to bring newcomers 
(because of the weirdos.) Frankly, I give weirdos the cold shoulder, 
because they scare off the normal people who contribute time and money. 
If he's really obnoxious, I'll ask him to "find another group that 
would suit your style more." If he's really detrimental, I'll ask him 
to "help our cause by joining the Young Democrats instead." (Hey, it
works.)</p>

<p>By the way, I always dress in suit and jacket at these events, and I go 
out of my way to make newcomers feel welcome. I strongly encourage 
others to do the same. It's really improved our image to both guests 
and speakers, and it's also improved our morale and attendance. A big 
part of that was moving to a nicer restaurant with a private banquet room.</p>

<title>Prospect Survey</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Survey your prospects</h2>
<p>Last updated by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>The Washington State LP surveys our prospects.  When we send database 
updates to our county LP's database managers, we also include printed 
surveys for all new prospects.  Each county LP is responsible for 
surveying those prospects and sending the completed surveys back to the 
state office.</p>

<p>The ideas is that two weeks after we send out a prospect kit, we call 
the prospect. We ask him/her a few questions and put these responses in 
a survey database (so we can do some analysis later.)</p>

<p>Our goals are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give <em>every</em> prospect some human contact, to "humanize" our 
political party and show them we care.</li>
<li>Discover what makes prospects contact us.</li>
<li>Discover how easy it is for prospects to contact us.</li>
<li>Discover what issues turn people on.</li>
<li>Get their impressions of the LP and answer their questions (<em>not</em>
try to convert them)</li>
<li>Encourage prospects to take the next step (become members, 
volunteers, donors)</li>
<li>Weed out prospects who aren't interested after all. Why keep them on 
the mailing list?</li>
<li>Find out what kind of talents and experience they have (occupation, 
organizations.)</li>
<li>Find out what their donor potential is (occupation, organizations.)</li>
<li>Give our volunteers something to do!</li>
<li>Find out who are volunteers are and what tasks they want to help with.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Survey</h3>

<p>NOTE: Have a cheerful, positive disposition and be extremely polite and 
respectful. Remember, they will get their first (and lasting) 
impression of the Libertarian Party from you! Be very diplomatic. 
Sometimes people will chew your ear off with their own theories and 
gripes. Don't waste time debating with them! Just stick to the 
following questions (in order.) Have a pen ready to mark their answers.</p>

<p>Hello, this is (insert your name) calling for (insert their name). I'm
a volunteer with the Libertarian Party of Washington State. I'm just getting
in touch with people on our mailing list to get your opinion on a few
questions.</p>

<p>Is this a good time to talk?
(IF NO: When should I call back: ___________.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Great! My first question is: Was it easy for you to find the phone 
number of the Libertarian Party when you first contacted us?
	<ol>
	<li>phone book/directory assistance</li>
	<li>Washington Libertarian newsletter</li>
	<li>other literature (specify):</li>
	<li>at an event (specify):</li>
	<li>advertisement (specify):</li>
	<li>other (specify):</li>
	<li>I didn't call.</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>Where did you first hear about the Libertarian Party?
	<ol>
	<li>news story (specify):</li>
	<li>friend</li>
	<li>other literature (specify):</li>
	<li>at an event (specify):</li>
	<li>advertisement (specify):</li>
	<li>other (specify):</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>What made you decide to contact the Libertarian Party?</li>
<li><p>Did you have a chance to look over the materials we sent you?</li>
<li><p>Would you like to become a member of the Libertarian Party? It's 
free and it does not affect your voter registration at all.

<p>IF NO: Would you like us to take you off of our mailing list?
IF YES: We'll do that. Thank you very much for your time! Goodbye!</p>

<p>IF YES: Great! Do you still have the membership card we sent you?
IF YES: Great! Just send put it in the mail as soon as you can!
IF NO: We'll send a new membership card to you at: (insert address)</p>

<li><p>Would you like to volunteer with the Libertarian Party in your area?
IF NO: (Go to question 13.)</li>

<li><p>Have you had any political experience before?</li>

<li><p>What are your interests or talents, for example, what's your
occupation?
	<ol>
	<li>student</li>
	<li>retired</li>
	<li>full-time parent</li>
	<li>attorney</li>
	<li>accountant</li>
	<li>secretary</li>
	<li>advertising</li>
	<li>marketing</li>
	<li>other (specify):</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>OK, I have a list of possible volunteer activities and you just say 
YES or NO if you'd be interested in them. You don't need any 
experience, because we'll train you if you're really interested, so 
just say YES or NO to each of the following choices. Would you like to:
	<ol>
     	<li>attend Libertarian lectures or conferences?</li>
     	<li>work on a campaign?</li>
     	<li>write letters to the editor?</li>
     	<li>call talk shows?</li>

     	<li>help staff a literature table at the local mall?</li>
    	<li>lobby lawmakers or testify at public hearings?</li>
     	<li>speak to <a href="highschools.html">high-school classes</a>
     		or other groups?</li>
     	<li>help organize college groups?</li>
     	<li>help with convention planning?</li>
     	<li>help do telephone surveys like this one?</li>
     	<li>be an officer in the local or state party?</li>
     	<li>be a discussion group participant or leader?</li>
     	<li>put a Libertarian <a href="bumperstickers.html">bumpersticker</a>
     		on your car? (we'll send you one)</li>
     	<li>help with envelope stuffing?</li>
     	<li>write for our <a href="newsletters.html">newsletter</a> (opinion
     		pieces, articles, etc.)?</li>
     	<li>host a get-together to show a Libertarian video to neighbors 
	and friends?</li>
     	<li>participate in daytime rallies and protests?</li>
     	<li>participate in nightime rallies and protests?</li>
     	<li>run for office?</li>
	</ol>
<p>(NOTE: You'll want to use these same letter or number codes in the
"volunteer?" field of your database.)</p>

<li><p>Are you active in any other political organizations? What do you do
there?</li>

<li><p>Are you involved in any other social organizations? What do you do
there?</li>

<li><p>Would you like to make a small financial contribution at 
this time, say $10?</p>

<p>IF YES: We can do it by credit card over the phone, if you like:
(Visa or MC, name on card:, card number:, expiration date:</p>

<p>IF NO: OK, maybe you can help us out later...</p></li>

<li><p>Do you feel closer to conservatives or liberals or neither?</p></li>
<li><p>What political issues are you most interested in?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any questions you have for us at this time?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you very much for your time and maybe I'll get to meet you in 
person at some Libertarian events!</p>

<title>Campaign Training</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Campaigning</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>:</p>

<p>I attended the three-day Campaign Management Seminar at the LP convention in
Salt Lake City and it really opened my eyes and got me motivated. Everyone who
attended raved about it. (And several of us have attended Republican Party
campaign workshops.)</p>

<p>The professional campaign consultant who led the workshop, Sal Guzzetta, 
debunked several misconceptions we Libertarians often have about campaigning.
According to him:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Name recognition is the key to victory. 85% of the voters in non-federal
elections cite this as their main motivation for voting. The rest, only 15%,
care strongly about party affiliation and/or the candidate's actual positions.
The good news, obviously, for Libertarians is that our label and positions are
not liabilities for the vast majority of voters. The bad news is, many
Libertarian  candidates would rather debate their controversial positions
instead of doing the real work of ringing doorbells and handing out name
cards.</p></li>

<li><p>You only need 51% of the voters to win. And then you can educate the 
public as much as you want when the reporters interview you as a lawmaker.
Therefore you must do telephone polls to find out who's for you, who's against
you, and who's undecided. You ignore the folks who are pro and con and target
the undecideds <em>only</em>. (Obviously you target the FOR's for donations and
volunteer work, but you don't bother doorbelling or mailing them.)</p></li>

<li><p>Campaigns are not won so much as they are fumbled even worse by the
other guy. Successfull campaigning is a pretty straight-forward discipline that
few campaigns follow: find out who's undecided and doorbell, mail, doorbell,
mail. The day before the election you call up all the PROs and the undecideds
to "get out the vote."</p></li>

<li><p>Libertarians have a built-in fund-raising advantage over the other 
parties: a network of committed folks across the country. The Rs and Ds target
only about 35 races around the country (typically an important seat that they
won or lost the last time by < 5% of the vote.) That means that 99% of the
candidates are <em>not</em> funded by their party and have to handle their own
fund-raising and volunteering.  They are in the same position as we are.
Fund-raising is easier for Libertarians because we support candidates outside
our districts. The Rs and Ds typically don't.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There's obviously a lot more detail and how-to knowledge involved, so for
that I strongly recommend you spend the $35 to get his campaign manuals (we got
them as part of the seminar, and they are awesome!) To get a catalog, call
1-800-562-6624.  Good luck!</p>

<title>Campaign Software</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Campaign Software</h2>
<p>Last updated 1/25/97 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillot.html">Ken Gaillot</a></p>

<p>A shareware program is available to help manage
political campaigns. <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.digitals.org/digitals/pages/software.html">Precinct
Walker 3.1c</a> has three functions: a personal information manager
to keep track of contacts and the relationships between them; a
precinct manager to aid canvassing; and a "Democratic Toolkit"
containing information about recent politicians and their voting record.</p>

<p>Precinct Walker 3.1c is distributed by Digitals, but I believe
it is the same program that used to be distributed by Profile Software.</p>

<p>Although I haven't heard from anyone with experience using the
program in a campaign, Brent Jass (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:bwjass@cris.com">bwjass@cris.com</a>) downloaded and
tested it. Jass said, "Someone has used version 2.6 of FoxPro to create
the program ... I'm more inclinded to try learning Access. I may
still recommend Precinct Walker to others, especially since it looks
pretty self-explanatory."</p>

<h1>Nurses and Politics</h1>

<p>When running for political office, candidates often find
that nonpolitical interest groups to which they belong are a
great source of contacts and publicity. Sometimes publications
dealing with an industry will do stories on people in that
industry running for political office.</p>

<p>An example is health professionals.
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/EricGarris.html">Eric Garris</a>,
a libertarian who works for <cite>Nurseweek</cite> and <cite>Nursing and
Allied Healthweek</cite> weekly magazines, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>Nurseweek</cite> goes to all nurses in California (200,000).
<cite>Nursing and Allied Healthweek</cite> goes to 120,000 nurses and allied
health professionals in Texas. They love to cover stories about nurses and
health professionals running for office, and sometimes who just are heavily
involved in campaigns.  They have done articles on the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
and libertarian candidates in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A candidate who is a Registered Nurse in California, or
a Registered Nurse, Licensed Vocational Nurse, Occupational Therapist,
Physical Therapist, Physical Therapy Assistant, Pharmicist, Pharmacy
Assistant, Medical Social Worker, Dietitian, Radiologist, Medical Tech, or
other Allied Health field in Texas, should contact Garris for more
information.</p>

<title>Signature collecting</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Signature collecting for ballot access</h2>
<p>Last updated 8/23/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>The perfect place to get ballot access signatures is at polling places, 
on primary election day.</p>

<p>In <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>,
Ken Krawchuk is running for a State House seat. He
decided to hit the polling places on primary day with a virtual army of
petitioners -- about 20, if I recall.  He needed approximately 300
signatures to make the ballot.  He got 1000, all on that one day.</p>

<p>Polling places are ideal for many reasons.  You can be sure that every
person coming up to vote is registered to vote in that district.  It gives
you a political presence.  People are getting hit with handouts anyway, so
they expect to be solicited.  The response is much more positive than in
other, more hostile petitioning situations.</p>

<p>You're also very visible to the opposition parties. The people handing out
literature are not generally hostile to other parties. This is just a task
for them.  From what I've seen, those people are not generally interested
in debating the role of government as they are interested in debating what
kind of pullover will best keep the rain away.  And chatting with the
opposition at this very grass-roots level is a good way to find out what
they're doing, and how they've become successful.  Find out what works and
copy it!</p>

<p>Finally, solicitation at polling places is one of the simple tasks that a
successful political party will do anyway, and we should get used to the
idea of recruiting people to do this kind of work.</p>

<p>One other reason for Ken's success -- he used his kids as petitioners.  Who
could resist a young girl asking people to sign for her dad?  And the
youngest kid apparently attracted the press -- she was the one who got the
quote in the local newspaper.</p>

<title>Campaign Activism: Signs</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Campaign Activism: Signs</h1>

<p>In a July 1996 post to the LPUS mailing list, Lance Flores detailed
the Libertarian Party of Dallas' experience with making campaign signs:</p>

<p>First, about the required disclosure. Most states require, although
unconstitutionally, the Candidate's Name, Organization (i.e. Committee to
Re-elect), Treasurer (make sure title is included) address of the
organization or treasurer, and occasionally the phone number. This is so you
may be found by the Code Enforcement people. They must normally give you
notice before removing your signs. (I have a Sec. 1983 suit withdrawn from
last season when I was running for judge concerning all of this) You can see
an example on <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://webusers.anet-dfw.com/~liberty/index.htm">our web page</a>
of what the disclosure looks like. I put it on
Steven May's sign, so look at his page under the "Election '96" section of
our site.</p>

<p>Now here is how the sign making works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You will need a garage or warehoused space with plenty of area to dry
your signs. Some good dry summer days, and some enthusiasm.</p></li>

<li><p>Now draft the layout of your sign. Although this may seem easy, you can
make big mistakes trying to put too much message on the sign. Keep it simple
with enough open space to make it confortable to read from a
moving vehicle. (We've make all those mistakes already so you won't have to
wait until next season to fix them.) We did one color (blue) last season. We
are going to two colors on white background this year. We used a number of
different graphics last season. One of the mistakes is to use graphics that
are too detailed. This makes it difficult to print because the ink does not
hold seperation well because of some capillary attraction created when the
silk stretches as you squeegee the ink. The Libertarian lady liberty
masthead is ideal and well suited for silk screens. You can get the .tif
file from national for a few bucks. Well worth it.</p></li>

<li><p>Why a graphic? We've experimented with many things in the past. The LP
logo is very powerful, much more so than the stupid pachyderm and ass you
usually see. It says much.</p>

<p>Perception of numbers. One of the comments from last season from the
Republican and Democratic judicial candidates and others, was what an
aggressive race I ran specifically noting that my signs were everywhere.
They weren't. It just seemed that way. We all used similar statute of
liberty logos identifying the libertarian party. I put out 600, Steve May
put out about 75O, and others did similarly. Between all our candidates we
put out about 3000. It realy isn't much for an area like Dallas County which
has about twenty cities and a population of about three million.</p>

<p>What happens is this. Most R's & D's will not put the party logo or
identification on their signs. In Dallas only the Libertarians did this.
Some of the Republicans caught on to this last season and a few started
doing the same. People identify you with the logo. When driving around the
city they will see other libertarian signs. It takes at least three to four
passes for someone to remember your name on a political sign. People will
remember the logo. They will recognize the logo where ever they see it in
the city or county. When candidates all use the same or similar mastheads
all candidates will be preceived to be supported through out a vast area.
Its called synergy.</p></li>

<li><p>Your graphics should not be busy or crowded. Signs are to provide
recognition and the perception of substantial support of the populace. You
can't put the party platform on it! That's what the logo does. (Please look
at the various candidates that I have signs mounted on our web site. e.g.
John Davis, Steven May, Michael Needleman, Randal Morgan, mine isn't ready
yet.) If you're going to use two colors then try to use one common backdrop
like ours, then you will only need one mask and silk screen. We added a
border of stars at the top and bottom. This centers the viewer's focus to
the center of the sign where the message is and gives the sign balance.
Remember, the viewer is moving and you have to focus his eyes immediately on
the message.</p>


<li><p>Now for the nuts and bolts. Lay out your graphics on a good graphics
engine. I suggest Corel, Adobe, or somthing similar. You should try and use
a vector type graphic format or a bitmap with high resolution which will
convert to a vector format without too much distortion. You can save about
half the negative cost if you can give the negative producer the graphic in
the format he uses on his computer. If your supplier uses camera ready art
you will have to provide him a positive and he will shoot it twice to get
another positive.</p>

<p>I'll e-mail a sample of one of ours. We'll give you our background format if
you like. If you use one color you will only need one screen which will
print two images head to head. This will allow you to print both sides of
the sign at one time. You should keep designs proportanate to the size of
one half of the paper size. (14x 22") The paper is available in sheets 28x
22" when folded it makes the standard 14"x 22" sign.</p></li>

<li><p>Here's the materials list:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>22"x28" negative w/head to head image (leave space
	for fold and stake to pass through a hole at the top of sign);
        $48 shoot positive for a negative film, or
        $24 for a negative produced from .eps (encapulated post script) file
	in negative format</li>
  	<li>22"x28" silk screen w/frame coated & processed (aprox 30"x34")
        $23-$40</li>
  	<li>Coated paper 22"x28" ($0.52/sheet for 1-100, $0.45/sheet for
	up to 250, etc.)
  	<li>Ink - NAZ - DAR/Kc $27.35/qt. (1qt/candidate about 6-700 signs),
        $97.30 /gal
  	<li>Screen wash (clean screens & spreader) $19/gal   (1gal/candiate)
  	<li>Retarder $10.98/qt  (1/2 qt/candidate) $31.60/gal
  	<li>Dehazing fluid $25.75/gal (1qt/candidate)
  	<li>Squeeges are about $0.50/in. I'd get two per station. One 4"
	and one 12".
	</ol>

<p>Call your local screen supplier for the materials. This is the most current
pricing in Dallas. Get a NAZ-DAR/KC color chart from your Naz-Dar/KC
dealer. Nos 20(red) & 40(blue) work well but you can vary some.</p></li>

<li><p>Once you've located a place to do your signs, you'll need a table that is
not too wide. It should be about as wide as the screen frame, about 28". An
old door on saw horses is just perfect. Make a couple. Affix two door
hindges to the table and a silk screen frame with the screen mounted flush
on two sides.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Look at all the bill boards and signs on your way to work and back,
and when you go out at night. You will quickly see what
works and doesn't.</p>

<title>TV Myths</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Myths of Television</h1>

<p>From <cite>The 5 Myths of Television Power: Or, Why the Medium Is Not
the Message</cite> by Douglas Davis, 1993 Simon & Schuster, NYC:</p>

<ol>
<li>TV Controls Our Voting
<li>TV Has Destroyed Our Students
<li>TV Is (Our) Reality
<li>TV Pacifies Us (We Are Couch Potatoes)
<li>We Looove TV
</ol>

<p>"You won't see a lot of our ads...  The problems we face are difficult
and complex.  I believe you deserve more than 30 second commercials
with vague promises.  We want you to have a copy of our plan.  Call
us or visit your local library."   --- Lawton Chiles, 1990 TV spot</p>

<p>"Though widely praised, the campaign of Lawton Chiles for governor of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> in November
1990 - or rather, its radical media strategy -
was kept secret, rather like the furtive romance of a priest or 
philosopher-king.  By contemporary standards, Chiles spent a pauper's
sum for television ($5M)... while... Martinez poured dollars into TV
($10M) with the free-spending abandon that has become routine for 
established American politicians...  He not only called TV power into
question: he proved it wrong... </p>

<p>"Chiles' success certainly discomfited most of all those who profit
from the wholesale commitment to TV power, that is, campaign managers
and TV exchequers across the land, which share a pie approaching $1G
every 4 years.  His victory even threatened those who regularly
denounce the medium's power, among them academics, columnists, and
nearly all politicians who lose hard-fought campaigns...</p>

<p>"Michael Robinson, a prof. of gov't at GWU... isolated 60 bitterly
contested primary campaigns in 1988, half D, half R: The candidate
who spent the most money on media and advertising lost in well
over half the elections (60%).  Among... losers... AlGore...</p>

<p>"...the cost of campaigns [increased] tenfold between 1970 and 1990.
The price for a race for a seat in the House... leaped 482% between
1975 and 1990 alone.  The average cost of a competitive senatorial
campaign climbed to $10M by 1988, 10 times the cost in 1974.  In 1988,
[Rs & Ds] together spent $50M on media.  By 1992, Bush alone began
the campaign with a budget of $40M targeted [at TV]."</p>

<p>"...network TV sees the viewer's mind as something like a tiny container
ventilated with holes - a school child's lunch box...  'The attention 
span of the average viewer is short.', Av Westin, ...ABC producer...</p>

<p>"Not that long ago, both politicians and their managers believed
differently.  Though pre-TV political campaigns were boisterous and
sensational, the candidates believed they had to elaborate positions
at length to be taken seriously by the voters, whether the positions
were directly read or herad at all.  In the 1950s... well into the 1970s
the genre of the 'half hour' film or live speech, when the candidate
laid himself on the line in detail, was assumed to be as critical to
victory as kissing babies.  Even in moments of crisis... compelled
to establish their gravity by unveiling positions patiently before the
microphone, the camera, or crowd, then passing out bulky treatises to
the press..."</p>

<h2>Campaigning: Using allied groups</h2>

<p>[Here's a classic example of grassroots activism in action.
This is why we won.  Congrats to Peter and everyone else
around the country who participated one way or another in
campaigns, even if it was just dragging your friends to
the polls.  Great going Peter and others; this is exactly
how it's done!  -- <a

From: Peter Nesbitt &lt;0005111312@mcimail.com&gt;<br>

Subject: Northern California Success!<br>
</p>

<p>Friends,

<p>We did it!  We cut 'em, we dried 'em, we rolled 'em, and we smoked a
bunch of anti-gun incumbents and challengers this past Tuesday.  It should
perfectly clear to the rest of the country that Grassroots created the
landslide that cleaned the hillside in D.C. and other State Capitols
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Congratulations to you all for a job well done.</p>

<p>After the June Primary was completed, the Fairfield/Suisun <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
Members' Council sat down with four Candidates and members of their campaign
staff.  We discussed their campaign strategy, finances, and needs.  We
offered our membership with the understanding that no monetary donations
would be forthcoming from our group, just a lot of hard-working NRA
members.</p>

<p>Our monthly meetings then turned into strategy sessions; get to know
the candidate; and sign-up to work type of meetings.  We asked various
individuals from the community who had been involved with campaigns in the
past, to come and speak to our group.  The County Coordinators for these
four Candidates also attended.</p>

<p>These campaign leaders and experienced people set out with the
difficult task of bringing us up to speed in assisting their Campaigns.
Granted, we had a pretty active group, but we were clueless in the Campaign
arena, as it was our first time out.</p>

<p>We established a Campaign Point-Man within our group for each of the
four Campaigns.  The Point-Man would be directly responsible for working
with the Campaign and their County Coordinator.  The Point-Man would then
work through the Officers of our NRA Members' Council, and utilize a sign-up
sheet of volunteers, and any other personal contacts that might be
available, to accomplish any objectives that may be established by the
Campaign Staff.</p>

<p>Sign up cards were distributed at meetings, asking our membership
what they would be interested in helping out with.  We wanted to know if
they would: Walk precincts, make phone calls, assist with road-side signs,
place signs in their own yard, hold neighborhood meetings, work in the
Campaign HQ, work in the GOP HQ, assist with GOTV (get out the vote) on
election day, etc.</p>

<p>Clip-boards were passed around the room at each meeting, soliciting
volunteers to work for each Campaign.  The Campaign Coordinator and the
Point-Man each received copies of the sign-in sheet for their use.</p>

<p>At each monthly meeting we had boxes and boxes of candidate
information, flyers, bumper stickers, yard signs, and fence signs.  Each
member was asked to take what he could and distribute the material
throughout the community, and to friends and family.</p>

<p>For those people who could not normally attend the Thursday night
meeting, materials were delivered to their residence by one of our
volunteers.</p>

<p>All three gun stores in the local area were <em>very</em> active
participants, and made these materials available to customers who visited
their place of business.</p>

<p>Other businessmen in the community did the same, and one fellow
engaged in a sign war with the Fairfield office of Congressman Dan Hamburg.
Last I heard, Hamburg had run out of window space.</p>

<p>Each Campaign had a life of their own.  Frank Riggs ran a very
high-profile campaign, with many debates and public forums throughout the
1st Congressional District.  Riggs and Hamburg were constantly taking jabs
at each other in the press.</p>

<p>The LeFever campaign appeared to be low key, but I feel that was due
to the fact that our County only makes up a small portion of the 3rd
Congressional District.  We didn't hear very much from either Fazio or
LeFever here, but Fazio did attack LeFever on his stance on guns, abortion,
and religion.  The hit pieces called LeFever an "extremist".</p>

<p>State Senator Maurice Johannessen was without a doubt, the most
prepared of the Campaigns we worked for.  The County Coordinator, Bob Davis,
has been involved with several campaings in the past.  Bob was the first to
have a campaign office up and running in this county.</p>

<p>The Senator made his way through the newy reapportioned 4th Senate
District, gaining support as he went.  The Johannessen Staff knew in advance
what McGowan was going to hit them with.  A McGowan piece would hit the
mail, and the very next day Johannessen would drop his in your mail box.
They were <em>prepared for everything</em> that McGowan threw their
direction.</p>

<p>Bryant Stocking ran a campaign that was very low-profile, yet very
grassroots oriented.  He never attacked incumbent Assemblyman Tom Hannigan,
instead chosing to campaign on his own merits and beliefs, insisting that he
would be a breath of fress air for the 8th Assembly District.</p>

<p>I received many calls asking, "When will Bryant start slinging the
mud?".  The Stocking strategy was to let the sleeping giant sleep, he didn't
want to force Hannigan to campain, and was hoping to be a stealth win.  It
almost worked, and Hannigan never launched into any heavy campaigning.</p>

<p>We established teams of NRA members to travel throughout the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Solano.html">Solano
County</a> area, and place signs in strategic locations.  In many cases,
permission was granted from the land-owner for sign placement on some very
prime spots.</p>

<p>Copies of City and County ordinances were obtained from the
Registrar of Voters so that we would know where we could legally place our
signs.</p>

<p>During the final six weeks before the election, we began phone
banking for our four candidates.  On at least one night per week, we
assisted with one or more phone banks.  It all depended on how many people
were were able to muster during the prior week.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the campaign, several local Realtors and a credit
bureau came on-board with us.  There were a few nights when we had 18+
phones calling precincts throughout the county!</p>

<p>Several of our members agreed to make calls each week, while others
obtained precinct lists from the Campaign HQ and made the calls on their own
when they had the spare time.</p>

<p>During the final two weeks I obtained a partial copy of an NRA
Membership List from the Sacramento office.  The names were members who
resided in the 3rd Congressional District, and our group called most of the
NRA members in the Solano County area, with Sacramento NRA Members' Councils
calling the others.</p>

<p>We actually found a few people on the list who admitted to being FOR
gun control!  Tanya will be notified, and hopefully a strike team sent out
immediately.</p>


<p>Precinct walking was one of the most successful activities that we
participated in.  The local GOP HQ coordinated most of these, however some
campagns did their own work in this area.</p>

<p>Towards the end, all Campaigns were carrying each others material in
a combined effort to cover the whole county.  This was the first time in
many years that all targeted precincts were walked and phoned.</p>

<p>On the Monday before election day, another campaign sent down a bus
full of precinct walkers to the Johannessen campaign.  Myself and others who
were in possession of large vans, acted as shuttle crew members.  We each
took a van full of these walkers, provided them with a precinct list,
campaign material, and then dropped our payload in the appropriate precinct.
Later that afternoon, the walkers would call for pick-up, or to be
repositioned for another precinct.</p>

<p>Several debates and public forums were held in our area.  The dates
and times were mailed out to our membership, and we were instrumental being
present at these events to cheer, hoot, and holler for our candidate.</p>

<p>On several occaisions we were able to have probing questions asked
of our opponent, which was then printed in the local papers the next day.</p>

<p>Voter registration was an important activity during the early months
of the campaign.  Our Members' Council gained permission from the Solano
Mall to set-up a voter registration booth for a week.</p>

<p>While the number of voters who registered was rather dismal, we did
have a good time discussing the various gun issues with Mall patrons.</p>

<p>At one point, we were asked to help register voters in Yolo County
by a Republican group.  Several of our members assisted during the evening
hours at the Republican booth inside the State Fairgrounds.</p>

<p>All three of our local gun stores assisted various campaigns by
offering drawings for firearms.  While I don't recall the exact type of
weapons that were offered, there were only a limited number of tickets sold,
and they were all good fund-raising projects for our Candidates.</p>

<p>The signs for the Riggs campain were normally shipped to a Napa
address, so we made several trips to Napa and then distributed the signs to
various HQ's and individuals who had previously agreed to assist in placing
signs throughout the district.</p>

<p>Some of the small yard signs need to be stapled onto wooden stakes,
so we did that too.</p>

<p>Charlton Heston was supposed to fly into the Nut Tree airport on
October 30th to offer his support for Frank Riggs, but bailed out on the eve
of his visit.  We had already printed the info in our monthly newsletter,
flyers placed in gun stores and old-folks homes, press releases were mailed
out to local media outlets, and I phone-banked the day before.</p>

<p>It was pretty embarrassing to be there and tell everyone that Moses
wasn't going to make it.</p>

<p>One late night on the week before election day, a Riggs staffer
called me at 1:00 a.m.  He had been clued into a press conference the next
day at noon.  Apparently Congressman Dan Hamburg was going to have a
"Veterans for Hamburg" press conference, and announce an 8.2 million dollar
grant from the Government to build a new Veterans Hospital.  (Riggs laid the
groundwork for this when he was in office previously)</p>

<p>The next morning we were able to must 15 NRA members between 9:00
a.m. and 11:00 a.m.  We met at the GOP HQ, made anti-Hamburg signs, and
printed  original press-releses and news articles about the work of Frank
Riggs in bringing the VA Hospital to this area when he was in office.</p>

<p>We left the GOP HQ and marched through the downtown business section
of Fairfield to the old County Courthouse.  There were slightly more of them
than there were of us, and when we arrived on the scene, we were threatened
with arrest!  After explaining to the Hamburg Staff-puke that we were on
public property and that we were excercising our right to assemble, and the
right of free speech...well...they got real quiet, then called us jerks, and
finally walked away.</p>

<p>Hamburg and Martin Nellis (his Fairfield Field Representative)
walked up the sidewalk.  Hamburg didn't look too happy too see us there, as
we have been a pain in his neck for the last year.  Martin said, "Hey Peter,
don't be too depressed on the day after the election.", to which I snapped
back, "Oh don't worry, I won't.  We'll help you guys move out of your office
if you need the help!"</p>

<p>If looks could kill!  Both he and Hamburg stopped dead in their
tracks, and turned to us.  They were speechless.</p>

<p>Our people mixed in with the Hamburg folks and we had a video camera
there to record the whole thing.</p>

<p>While Hamburg was speaking, three of our people went to the street
corner with Riggs signs and posters.  As the big trucks drove by, they
motioned for them to blast their air horns.  The press conference was
disrupted on several occaisions by horns and people yelling their support
for Frank Riggs.</p>

<p>One last comment on this, one of the Hamburg staff knocked the
American Flag to the ground right after the event.  We offered to turn the
flag over to the local Vets group for ceremonial burning, but they refused.</p>

<p>Election morning we had 10 NRA members with another 10 Riggs
supporters on a street corner in Fairfield at 7:00 a.m.  Armed with a cup of
coffee, "Riggs for Congress" signs, a large banner, and "Honk for Riggs"
signs, we positioned ourselves at a major intersection.</p>

<p>Frank was right there with us too!  It was fantastic!  We split
ourselves into four groups, with one group on each corner.</p>

<p>As the morning traffic began to build, so did our excitement.
People were driving by waving and smiling, honking their horns, and giving
us the thumbs-up-signal.</p>

<p>People who were walking to work would stop and talk to Frank, and a
few people even pulled over to wish him luck in the election.  At 9:00 a.m.,
Frank looked at us and said, "Guys...we're going to win this election."</p>

<p>A local newspaper photographer came by for the photo opportunity,
and everyone lined up on the same corner with their signs and banners.</p>

<p>We then went to Suisun, and ate breakfast at "Bab's Delta Diner"
with Frank and many of his supporters.  As we sat there eating, I noticed my
Mayor and several City Council members a few tables over.  They were all Dan
Hamburg supporters, and would not even look towards the Riggs party.</p>

<p>Finally, Frank got up to say hello and wish them luck.  As I watched
this, I couldn't help but laugh to myself...when Frank wins the election,
these people will have to call him and ask for help at some point.  It will
certainly be a painful phonecall to make!</p>

<p>At 12:00 noon I was back at the GOP HQ.  Myself and other NRA
members were there to act as "poll watchers".  Basically, we were to take
precinct lists, drive to the polling place, then check off those Republicans
who had voted.  We would then return to the GOP HQ, hand the lists over to
other volunteers who would call the people who had not voted, and encrouage
to get out and vote.</p>

<p>Between 12:00 noon and 7:00 p.m., we each took 3-5 precinct sheets,
and made the rounds to the various precincts.  This was very mind numbing
and exhausting work.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion I ran into opposition forces doing the
same thing.  Since there was only one packet I was forced to wait while
several of them would drag their feet and try to go as slow as possible.  I
would just go to the next precinct, then return a short time later to finish
up after they had left the area.</p>

<title>PC Little Red Riding Hood</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Politically-Correct Little Red Riding Hood</h1>

<p>Posted November 15, 1994 by Tim Starr (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:timstarr@netcom.com">timstarr@netcom.com</a>) to
LiberNet:</p>

<p>There once was a young person named Little Red Riding Hood who lived 
on the edge of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants 
that would probably provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the 
time to study them. </p>

<p>Red Riding Hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes 
referred to as "mother", although she didn't mean to imply by this term 
that she would have  thought less of the person if a close biological 
link did not in fact exist.</p>

<p>Nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of nontraditional 
households, although she was sorry if this was the impression conveyed.</p>

<p>One day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown 
fruit and  mineral water to her grandmother's house.</p>

<p>"But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people 
who have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages 
between various people in the woods?"</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union 
boss and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form.</p>

<p>"But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?"</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for 
womyn to oppress each other, since all womyn were equally oppressed until 
all womyn were free.</p>

<p>"But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket, 
since he's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be oppressed?"</p>

<p>And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was 
attending a special rally for animal rights, and besides, this wasn't 
stereotypical womyn's work, but an empowering deed that would help 
engender a feeling of community.</p>

<p>"But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick and 
hence unable to independently further her own selfhood?"</p>

<p>But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn't 
actually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way, 
although that was not to imply that any of these conditions were inferior 
to what some people called "health".</p>

<p>Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of 
delivering the basket to her grandmother, and so she set off.</p>

<p>Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous  
place, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based on 
cultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded the 
natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed that natural 
predators were in fact intolerable competitors.</p>

<p>Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, but 
Red Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized 
peoples would be able to "come out" of the woods and be accepted as valid 
lifestyle role models.</p>

<p>On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a woodchopper, 
and wandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers.</p>

<p>She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked 
her what  was in her basket.</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers, 
but she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality, and 
chose to dialogue with the Wolf.</p>

<p>She replied, "I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a 
gesture of solidarity."</p>

<p>The Wolf said, "You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl 
to walk  through these woods alone."</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood said, "I find your sexist remark offensive in the 
extreme, but  I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an 
outcast from society,  the stress of which has caused you to develop an 
alternative and yet entirely valid worldview.  Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I would prefer to be on my way."</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards her 
grandmother's house.</p>

<p>But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish 
adherence to linear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker 
route to Grandma's house.</p>

<p>He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action 
affirmative of his nature as a predator.</p>

<p>Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he 
put on  Grandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited 
developments.</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said, </p>

<p>"Grandma, I have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you 
in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch."</p>

<p>The Wolf said softly "Come closer, child, so that I might see you."</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood said, "Goddess!  Grandma, what big eyes you have!"</p>

<p>"You forget that I am optically challenged."</p>

<p>"And Grandma, what an enormous, what a fine nose you have."</p>

<p>"Naturally, I could have had it fixed to help my acting career, but 
I didn't give in to such societal pressures, my child."</p>

<p>"And Grandma, what very big, sharp teeth you have!"</p>

<p>The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a 
reaction appropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed, 
grabbed Little Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she 
could see her poor Grandmother cowering in his belly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you forgetting something?" Red Riding Hood bravely shouted.  
"You must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of 
intimacy!"</p>

<p>The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his 
grasp on her.</p>

<p>At the same time, the woodchopper burst into the cottage, brandishing an
ax.</p>

<p>"Hands off!" cried the woodchopper.</p>

<p> "And what do you think you're doing?" cried Little Red Riding Hood.  
"If I let  you help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence in 
my own abilities, which would lead to poor self esteem and lower 
achievement scores on college entrance exams."</p>

<p>"Last chance, sister!  Get your hands off that endangered species!  
This is an FBI sting!" screamed the woodchopper, and when Little Red 
Riding Hood nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head. </p>

<p>"Thank goodness you got here in time," said the Wolf.  "The brat and 
her grandmother lured me in here.  I thought I was a goner."</p>

<p>"No, I think I'm the real victim, here," said the woodchopper.  
"I've been dealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those 
protected flowers earlier.  And now I'm going to have such a trauma.  Do 
you have any aspirin?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the Wolf.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"I feel your pain," said the Wolf, and he patted the woodchopper on 
his firm, well padded back, gave a little belch, and said "Do you have 
any Maalox?"</p>

<body>

<h1>Dan Quayle -- From the Horse's Mouth</h1>

<p>Some Quayle quotes:</p>

<p>"<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/hi/">Hawaii</a> has
always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific.  It is
<em>in</em> the Pacific.  It is a part of the United States that is an island 
that is right here." Hawaii, September 1989</p>

<p>"What a terrible thing to have lost one's mind.  Or not to have a mind
at all.  How true that is."  -- speaking to the United Negro College Fund</p>

<p>"Republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and
child."</p>

<p>"You all look like happy campers to me.  Happy campers you are, happy
campers you have been, and, as far as I am concerned, happy campers you
will always be." -- to the American Samoans</p>

<p>"We expect them to work toward the elimination of human rights."
-- on El Salvador</p>

<p> "El Salvador is a democracy so it's not surprising that there are many
voices to be heard here. Yet in my conversations with Salvadorans... I
have heard a single voice."</p>

<p>"I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and
democracy - but that could change."</p>

<p>"If we do not succeed, then we run the risk of failure." --  Quoted in
the Phoenix Republican Forum, March 1990</p>

<p>"Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things."</p>

<p>"I have made good judgements in the Past. I have made good judgements in
the Future."</p>

<p>"We're going to have the best-educated American people in the world."</p>

<p>"I stand by all the misstatements that I've made."</p>

<p>"It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities
in our air and water that are doing it."</p>

<p>"We have a firm commitment to NATO, we are a <em>part</em> of NATO. We have a
firm commitment to <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. We are a <em>part</em> of
Europe."</p>

<p>"The other day [the President] said, I know you've had some rough times,
and I want to do something that will show the nation what faith that I
have in you, in your maturity and sense of responsibility. (He paused,
then said) Would you like a puppy?" --  (LA <cite>Times</cite> 5/21/89)</p>

<p>"I love <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
I practically grew up in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>."</p>

<p>"My friends, no matter how rough the road may be, we can and we will,
never, never surrender to what is right." -- In a speech to the Christian
Coalition</p>

<p>"We are leaders of the world of the space program. We have been the
  leaders of the world of our... of the space program and we're not going
  to continue where we're going to go, not withstanding the Soviet Union's
  demise and collapse - the former Soviet Union - we now have independent
  republics which used to be called the Soviet Union. Space is the next
  frontier to be explored. And we're going to explore. Think of all the
  things we rely upon in space today: communications from... <a
  href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>,
  detection of potential ballistic missle attacks. Ballistic missiles are
  still here. Other nations do have ballistic missles. How do you think we
  were able to detect some of the Scud missles and things like that?
  Space, reconnaissance, weather, communications - you name it. We use
  space a lot today."</p>

<p>"I deserve respect for the things I did not do."</p>

<p>"I feel that this [1981] is my first year, that next year is an election
year, that the third year is the mid point and that the fourth year is
the last chance I'll have to make a record since the last two years,
I'll be a candidate again.  Everything I do in those last two years will
be posturing for the election.  But right now I don't have to do that."</p>

<p>  "This president is going to lead us out of this recovery."
-- At a campaign stop in California and and then at CA State University,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Fresno.html">Fresno</a>
(The Quayle Quarterly, Spring/Summer 1992)</p>

<p>"We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur."</p>

<p>"For NASA, space is still a high priority."</p>

<p>"[The U.S. victory in Gulf war was a] stirring victory for the forces of
aggression."</p>

<p>"The best thing about rain forests is they never suffer from drought."</p>

<p>"The global importance of the Middle East is that it keeps the Near East
and the Far East from encroaching on each other."</p>

<p>"Our party has been accused of fooling the public by calling tax
increases 'revenue enhancement.'  Not so.  No one was fooled."</p>

<p>"People are not homeless if they're sleeping in the streets of their own
hometowns."</p>

<p>"Republicans have been accused of abandoning the poor.  It's the other
way around.  They never vote for us."</p>

<p>"Bank failures are caused by depositors who don't deposit enough money
to cover losses due to mismanagement."</p>

<p>"Air travel efficiency would improve if more travelers started going to
less popular places."</p>

<title>Democrat Hitchhiker</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Democrat Hitchhiker</h1>

<p>A boy is hitchhiking on a country road. A car stops for him, and the
driver asks, "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?"</p>

<p>"Democrat," says the boy, and the car speeds off.</p>

<p>Another car stops, and the driver asks, "Are you a Republican or a
Democrat?"</p>

<p>"Democrat," says the boy, and the car speeds off.</p>

<p>This happens two or three times, and the boy decides he's giving the
wrong answer. The next car that stops is a convertible driven by a
beautiful blonde. "Are you a Republican or a Democrat?" she asks.</p>

<p>"Republican," says the boy, and she lets him in.</p>

<p>But as they're driving along, the wind from the open top begins to push
the blonde's skirt higher and higher up her legs. And the boy finds himself
becoming aroused.</p>

<p>Finally he can't control himself any longer. "Stop!" he hollers. "Let
me out! I've only been a Republican for ten minutes and already I feel
like screwing somebody!"</p>

<p>-- popular joke from the 1930's, reprinted in <a
href="/revolution/by_name/O/PJORourke.html">P.J. O'Rourke's</a>
<cite>Republican Party Reptile</cite>.</p>

<title>Teaching About Politics</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Teach Your Child About Politics</h1>

<p>by Joseph Sobran</p>

<p>Because I write about politics, people are forever asking me the best
way to teach children how our system of government works. I tell them
that they can give their own children a basic civics course right in
their own homes.</p>

<p>In my own experience as a father, I have discovered several simple
devices that can illustrate to a child's mind the principles on which
the modern state deals with its citizens. You may find them helpful,
too.</p>

<p>For example, I used to play the simple card game WAR with my son.
After a while, when he thoroughly understood that the higher
ranking cards beat the lower ranking ones, I created a new game I called
GOVERNMENT. In this game, I was Government, and I won
every trick, regardless of who had the better card. My boy soon
lost interest in my new game, but I like to think it taught him
a valuable lesson for later in life.</p>

<p>When your child is a little older, you can teach him about our
tax system in a way that is easy to grasp. Offer him, say, $10 to mow the
lawn. When he has mowed it and asks to be paid, withhold $5 and explain
that this is income tax. Give $1 to his younger brother, and tell him
that this is "fair". Also, explain that you need the other $4 yourself
to cover the administrative costs of dividing the money. When he cries,
tell him he is being "selfish" and "greedy". Later in life he will thank
you.</p>

<p>Make as many rules as possible. Leave the reasons for them
obscure. Enforce them arbitrarily. Accuse your child of
breaking rules you have never told him about. Keep him anxious
that he may be violating commands you haven't yet issued. Instill in him the
feeling that rules are utterly irrational. This will prepare him for living
under
democratic government.</p>

<p>When your child has matured sufficiently to understand how the
judicial system works, set a bedtime for him and then send him
to bed an hour early. When he tearfully accuses you of breaking
the rules, explain that you made the rules and you can interpret
them in any way that seems appropriate to you, according to
changing conditions. This will prepare him for the Supreme
Court's concept of the U.S. Constitution as a "living document".</p>

<p>Promise often to take him to the movies or the zoo, and then,
at the appointed hour, recline in an easy chair with a newspaper
and tell him you have changed your plans. When he screams, "But
you promised!", explain to him that it was a campaign promise.</p>

<p>Every now and then, without warning, slap your child. Then
explain that this is defense. Tell him that you must be vigilant
at all times to stop any potential enemy before he gets big enough to hurt you.
This, too, your child will appreciate, not right at that moment, maybe, but
later in life.</p>

<p>At times your child will naturally express discontent with your
methods. He may even give voice to a petulant wish that he
lived with another family. To forestall and minimize this
reaction, tell him how lucky he is to be with you the most
loving and indulgent parent in the world, and recount lurid
stories of the cruelties of other parents. This will make him loyal to you and,
later, receptive to schoolroom claims that the America of the postmodern
welfare state is still the best and freest country on Earth.</p>

<p>This brings me to the most important child-rearing technique
of all: lying. Lie to your child constantly. Teach him that words mean nothing
- or rather that the meanings of words are continually "evolving", and
may be tomorrow the opposite of what they are today.</p>

<p>Some readers may object that this is a poor way to raise a
child. A few may even call it child abuse. But that's the whole point: Child
abuse is the best preparation for adult life under our form of GOVERNMENT.</p>

<title>World's Greatest Political Quiz</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>New and Improved World's Greatest Political Quiz</a></h1>

<p>I've lost the author and date of this piece:</p>

<p>Fed up with small, slanted political quizzes? I present a new unbiased 
political quiz which will enlighten you to your actual political views.
Just calculate your rating for each political category and see which one
is greatest.</p>

<pre>
I.   Your Conservative Rating                              1  0
- My moral views are superior to those of others.......... Y  N
- My prosperity is a result of God's favor................ Y  N
- Rush Limbaugh is the greatest hope for our nation....... Y  N
- A woman's place is in the home.......................... Y  N

II.  Your Liberal Rating                                   1  0
- All economic problems can be solved by taxing the rich.. Y  N
- Criminals are not responsible for crime, society is..... Y  N
- Values are a dangerous and evil concept, abolish them... Y  N
- All white males are racists and sexist.................. Y  N

III. Your Libertarian Rating                               1  0
- People without money deserve to starve and die.......... Y  N
- All trespassers should be shot on sight................. Y  N
- Nothing bad can possibly happen in a free market........ Y  N
- The law of gravity is coercive, repeal it............... Y  N
</pre>

<p>And now that you have learned of your own political leanings, it is time
to test your knowledge of the other philosophies. Just match the phrase
with the political group it represents.</p>

<p>Our country would be so much better if we could just eliminate
<ol>
<li>atheists.
<li>the rich.
<li>the government.
</ol></p>

<p>All I want is for other people to
<ol>
<li>live like I do.
<li>let me spend their money.
<li>fuck off.
</ol></p>

<p>If I had $1 million, I would
<ol>
<li>give it to Pat Robertson.
<li>create a new bureaucracy.
<li>buy more land and fence it in.
</ol></p>

<p>All my opponents are just like
<ol>
<li>Adolph Hitler
<li>Adolph Hitler
<li>Adolph Hitler
</ol></p>

<title>Quotes on Political Parties</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Quotes on Political Parties</h1>

<hr>
<h2>O'Rourke on the American Political System</h2>

<p>The American political system is like a gigantic Mexican Christmas
fiesta. Each political party is a huge pi&ntilde;ata -- a
papier-mach&eacute; donkey, for example. The donkey is filled with full
employment, low interest rates, affordable housing, comprehensive medical
benefits, a balanced budget and other goodies. The American voter is
blindfolded and given a stick. The voter then swings the stick wildly in
every direction, trying to hit a political candidate on the head and
knock some sense into the silly bastard.</p>

<p>-- <a href="/revolution/by_name/O/PJORourke.html">P.J. O'Rourke</a>,
in <cite>Parliament of Whores</cite></p>

<hr>
<h2>Teddy on the Two-Party System</h2>

<p>The old parties are husks, with no real soul within either, divided on
artificial lines, boss-ridden and privilege-controlled, each a jumble of
incongruous elements, and neither daring to speak out wisely and
fearlessly on what should be said on the vital issues of the day.</p>

<p>-- Theodore Roosevelt</p>

<hr>
<h2>On Affiliation</h2>

<p>I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.</p>

<p>-- Will Rogers</p>

<title>The War Inevitable</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The War Inevitable, March 1775, by Patrick Henry</h1>

<p>They tell us, Sir, that we are weak---unable to cope with so
formidable an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will
it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are
totally disarmed, and when a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> guard shall be stationed
in every house?  Shall we gather strength by irresolution and
inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance
by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom
of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and
foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of
those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.</p>

<p> Three millions of People, armed in the holy cause of
liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess,
are invincible by any force which our enemy can send
against us. Beside, Sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of
Nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles
for us.  The battle, Sir, is not to the strong alone. It is to
the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, Sir, we have
no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now
too late to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but
in submission and slavery!  Our chains are forged! Their
clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war
is inevitable. and let it come! I repeat, Sir, let it come!</p>

<p>      It is in vain, Sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen
may cry, Peace, Peace!---but there is no peace. The war
is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the
North will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!
Our breathren are already in the field! Why stand we here
idle? What is it that Gentlemen wish? What would they
have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery! Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take; but as for
me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>

<title>Bill Clinton on Freedom</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Bill Clinton on Why We Don't Really Want Freedom</h2>

<p>... a lot of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/">Asian</a> societies that are doing very
well now have low
crime rates and high economic growth rates, partly because they have very
coherent societies with strong units where the unit is more important than
the individual, whether it's the family unit or the work unit or the
community unit.</p>

<p>My own view is that you can go to the extreme in either direction. And when
we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution
with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual
freedom to Americans, it was assumed that the Americans who had that
freedom would used it responsibly. That is, when we set up this country,
abuse of people by government was a big problem. So if you read the
Constitution, it's rooted in the desire to limit the ability of government's
ability to mess with you, because that was a huge problem. It can still be
a huge problem. But it assumed that people would basically be raised in
coherent families, in coherent communities, and they would work for the
common good, as well as for the individual welfare.</p>

<p>What's happened in America today is, too many people live in areas where
there's no family structure, no community structure, and no work structure.
And so there's a lot of irresponsibility. And so a lot of people say
there's too much personal freedom. When personal freedom's being abused,
you have to move to limit it. That's what we did in the announcement I
made last weekend on the public housing projects, about how we're going to
have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer
in their communities. So that's my answer to you. We can have -- the
more personal freedom a society has, the more personal responsibility a
society needs, and the more strength you need out of your institutions --
family, community and work.</p>

<p>-- Bill Clinton, President of the United States, on MTV's "Enough Is
Enough."</p>

<title>Clinton on Being Libertarian</title>
<!-- Place: unknown -->
<!-- Time: unknown -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Bill Clinton: "Almost a Libertarian?"</h1>

<p><b>Q.</b> Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian
representatives came
out of a meeting with you and expressed  in the most ringing terms, their
confidence in your understanding of  them and their political aspirations, and
their belief that you would  fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that
you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations?</p>

<p><b>THE PRESIDENT:</b>  ... I believe that this country's policies should
be heavily
biased in favor of nondiscrimination. I believe when you tell people they can't
do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be
an overwhelming and compelling reason for it. ...</p>

<p>... When I was Governor, I was attacked from the other direction for
sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care
centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards. I just
have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the
rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their
capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.</p>

<title>Quotes on Freedom</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Quotes on Freedom</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Liberty vs. Safety</h2>

<p>They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety,
deserve neither liberty nor safety.</p>

<p>- Benjamin Franklin, 1759.</p>

<hr>

<h2>U.N. View of Rights</h2>

<p>These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the
purposes and principles of the United Nations.</p>

<p>- UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 29(3).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Churchill on Fighting for Rights</h2>

<p>Still if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without
bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not so
costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the
odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival. There may be a
worse case. You may have to fight when there is no chance of victory,
because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.</p>

<p> - Winston Churchill.</p>

<title>Dan Quayle Quotes</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Dan Quayle -- From the Horse's Mouth</h1>

<p>Some Quayle quotes:</p>

<p>"<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/hi/">Hawaii</a> has
always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific.  It is
<em>in</em> the Pacific.  It is a part of the United States that is an island 
that is right here." Hawaii, September 1989</p>

<p>"What a terrible thing to have lost one's mind.  Or not to have a mind
at all.  How true that is."  -- speaking to the United Negro College Fund</p>

<p>"Republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and
child."</p>

<p>"You all look like happy campers to me.  Happy campers you are, happy
campers you have been, and, as far as I am concerned, happy campers you
will always be." -- to the American Samoans</p>

<p>"We expect them to work toward the elimination of human rights."
-- on El Salvador</p>

<p> "El Salvador is a democracy so it's not surprising that there are many
voices to be heard here. Yet in my conversations with Salvadorans... I
have heard a single voice."</p>

<p>"I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and
democracy - but that could change."</p>

<p>"If we do not succeed, then we run the risk of failure." --  Quoted in
the Phoenix Republican Forum, March 1990</p>

<p>"Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate things."</p>

<p>"I have made good judgements in the Past. I have made good judgements in
the Future."</p>

<p>"We're going to have the best-educated American people in the world."</p>

<p>"I stand by all the misstatements that I've made."</p>

<p>"It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities
in our air and water that are doing it."</p>

<p>"We have a firm commitment to NATO, we are a <em>part</em> of NATO. We have a
firm commitment to <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. We are a <em>part</em> of
Europe."</p>

<p>"The other day [the President] said, I know you've had some rough times,
and I want to do something that will show the nation what faith that I
have in you, in your maturity and sense of responsibility. (He paused,
then said) Would you like a puppy?" --  (LA <cite>Times</cite> 5/21/89)</p>

<p>"I love <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
I practically grew up in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>."</p>

<p>"My friends, no matter how rough the road may be, we can and we will,
never, never surrender to what is right." -- In a speech to the Christian
Coalition</p>

<p>"We are leaders of the world of the space program. We have been the
  leaders of the world of our... of the space program and we're not going
  to continue where we're going to go, not withstanding the Soviet Union's
  demise and collapse - the former Soviet Union - we now have independent
  republics which used to be called the Soviet Union. Space is the next
  frontier to be explored. And we're going to explore. Think of all the
  things we rely upon in space today: communications from... <a
  href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>,
  detection of potential ballistic missle attacks. Ballistic missiles are
  still here. Other nations do have ballistic missles. How do you think we
  were able to detect some of the Scud missles and things like that?
  Space, reconnaissance, weather, communications - you name it. We use
  space a lot today."</p>

<p>"I deserve respect for the things I did not do."</p>

<p>"I feel that this [1981] is my first year, that next year is an election
year, that the third year is the mid point and that the fourth year is
the last chance I'll have to make a record since the last two years,
I'll be a candidate again.  Everything I do in those last two years will
be posturing for the election.  But right now I don't have to do that."</p>

<p>  "This president is going to lead us out of this recovery."
-- At a campaign stop in California and and then at CA State University,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Fresno.html">Fresno</a>
(The Quayle Quarterly, Spring/Summer 1992)</p>

<p>"We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur."</p>

<p>"For NASA, space is still a high priority."</p>

<p>"[The U.S. victory in Gulf war was a] stirring victory for the forces of
aggression."</p>

<p>"The best thing about rain forests is they never suffer from drought."</p>

<p>"The global importance of the Middle East is that it keeps the Near East
and the Far East from encroaching on each other."</p>

<p>"Our party has been accused of fooling the public by calling tax
increases 'revenue enhancement.'  Not so.  No one was fooled."</p>

<p>"People are not homeless if they're sleeping in the streets of their own
hometowns."</p>

<p>"Republicans have been accused of abandoning the poor.  It's the other
way around.  They never vote for us."</p>

<p>"Bank failures are caused by depositors who don't deposit enough money
to cover losses due to mismanagement."</p>

<p>"Air travel efficiency would improve if more travelers started going to
less popular places."</p>

<title>LiberNet and LiberNet-D Electronic Mailing Lists</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>LIBERNET and LIBERNET-D Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>From the LIBERNET automated reply (modified to reflect change
in mail servers):</p>

<p>All subscription requests concerning the Libernet lists are now handled by
an automated server.  Guidelines for new users are shown below, including
subscription information.  Please save this for future reference, as it
also tells you how to unsubscribe and change subscription modes.</p>

<h2>Libernet Guidelines for New Users</h2>

<p>Libernet is intended to be a forum for high-quality, real-world oriented
presentation of information of interest to classical liberals, libertarians,
objectivists, and anyone else interested in applying the philosophy of
liberty to the problems of our day.  It is also intended for the
rapid dissemination of news items that friends of liberty might be
interested in.  Accordingly, the following topics are appropriate
for postings to Libernet:</p>

<ol>
<li>News items: quotes/articles from major newspapers relating to
market-oriented approaches to social problems, support for civil
liberties, etc.
<li>Book reviews
<li>Election results
<li>Personal stories about campaigning, convincing others about the
merits of liberty, etc.
<li>Copies of letters to the editor
<li>Conference/seminar announcements
<li>Upcoming media events of interest
<li>Questions about any of the above.
</ol>

<p>The overriding principle of Libernet is that is not to be used as a
forum for interactive discussion.  Questions are perfectly appropriate, 
provided their answers are suitable material for Libernet.  Within this 
context, readers are asked to use their judgement.</p>

<p>LIBERNET-D: Users interested in a more opinion and idea-oriented forum may
wish to subscribe to Libernet-d (the "d" stands for discussion and debate).
Libernet-d is intended for the interactive discussion of the more 
philosophical issues related to a free society, such as political strategy, 
ideology, and intellectual analysis of libertarian positions.  There
is no coupling between Libernet and Libernet-d; readers may subscribe
to either one or both.  </p>

<p>SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION: Both Libernet and Libernet-d are available in two 
subscription modes: batch mode and reflective mode.  Batch mode subscribers 
receive one message every day, the "Digest", consisting of the most 
recent contributions to Libernet or Libernet-d packaged together according to 
RFC 1154.  (If you don't know what this means don't worry about it; nothing 
special is required to receive batch mode messages).  Reflective mode 
subscribers receive individual messages as they are posted.  </p>

<p> To subscribe to Libernet and/or Libernet-d in the appropriate mode,
send one or more of the following in an email message
to <img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:Majordomo@listserv.rmii.com">Majordomo@listserv.rmii.com</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>subscribe libernet-batch-list
<li>subscribe libernet-reflected-list
<li>subscribe libernet-d-batch-list
<li>subscribe libernet-d-reflected-list
</ul>

<p>This will subscribe the account from which you send the message to the
appropriate list.  Multiple requests may be included in a single message.</p>

<p>If you wish to subscribe another address instead (such as a local
redistribution list), you can use a command of the form:</p>

<ul>
<li>subscribe [list name] other-address@your_site.your_net
</ul>

<h2>Unsubscribing and Mode Changes</h2>

<p>To unsubscribe, replace "subscribe" with "unsubscribe" in the commands
of the previous section.  Mode changes are accomplished through 
unsubscribing and subscribing from and to the appropriate lists.</p>

<p>ATTRIBUTION: Libernet messages are frequently reprinted in other publications, 
along with an acknowledgement of the posting party.  If you do not wish this
to happen, please indicate so in your posting.  Otherwise, it is assumed that 
all postings to Libernet may be reproduced provided ackowledgement of
the author is given.</p>

<p>PRIVACY: The list of Libernet subscribers and sites is regularly made
available to anyone.  Please contact <img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:owner-libernet@listserv.rmii.com">owner-libernet@listserv.rmii.com</a> if
this presents a problem.</p>

<p>HOW TO POST: To post to Libernet, send your contribution to 
<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:libernet@listserv.rmii.com">libernet@listserv.rmii.com</a>.
To post to Libernet-d, replace "libernet" with
<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">"<a
href="mailto:libernet-d@listserv.rmii.com">libernet-d</a>" in the previous 
addresses.</p>

<p>LONG POSTS:  Frequently bills before Congress, articles from magazines
and other items that may be of interest to Libernet are excessively
lengthy for a complete submission.  Contributors are encouraged to
summarize the contents and provide information as to where the full
text can be found.  Complete submissions of legislative drafts,
book chapters, and so forth are probably not appropriate, but concise summaries
of them are.  Uuencoded images and other binary files should not be
posted, but announcements of their availability and instructions on
how to obtain them are appropriate for Libernet.</p>

<p>In accordance with this policy, articles longer than 32K will be deleted 
from both digests by the Libernet software.  They will, however, be sent 
out in their entirety to reflected mode subscribers.</p>

<p>INACTIVE ACCOUNTS: If you learn that your account is about to become
inactive (for example due to graduation or a career change) please ask 
to be removed from Libernet.  This will save me a lot of hassle with 
bounced mail messages.</p>

<p>COMPUSERVE USERS:  Please check your mail often, and do not let your
mailbox fill up.</p>

<p>MICROSOFT MAIL USERS: When posting to libernet and libernet-d, turn the
"Automatically send read receipts" option off.  Otherwise, every time you
read a message a return receipt will be posted to me and/or the entire list.
Similarly, do not request return receipts when posting to libernet and
libernet-d.</p>

<h2>More Information and Help</h2>

<p>To find out more about the automated server, send the following command
to <img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">"<a
href="mailto:Majordomo@listserv.rmii.com">Majordomo@listserv.rmii.com</a>":</p>

<ul>
<li>help
</ul>

<p>If you need to reach me directly, send email to
<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">
<a href="mailto:owner-libernet@listserv.rmii.com">owner-libernet@listserv.rmii.com</a>
</p>

<p> These guidelines are voluntary, as Libernet is unmoderated.</p>

<title>LPUS Electronic Mailing List</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: present -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>LPUS Mailing List</h1>

<p>October 1996 introductory message from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/D/JoeDehn.html">Joe Dehn</a>,
from the administrator of the LP-US mailing list:</p>

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>

<p>The LPUS echo/list is dedicated to discussion of
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
business at the national level.  It is expected that the content will
primarily be of interest to committee members, officers, staff, and
contractors of the national LP and its state affiliates, but any LP
activist, member, or even non-member is welcome to participate as long
as comments are constructive and on-topic.</p>

<p>LP "business" means matters pertaining to the LP as an organization.
Messages about political theory, about libertarian approaches to public
policy questions, about other libertarian organizations, or about
activities of interest to libertarians in general belong in
<a href="libernet.html">Libernet/Libernet-D</a>/LIBERTY.  Please do not
post newspaper articles
unless they relate specifically and directly to a matter that is 
itself on-topic.</p>

<p>"National level" means that messages should pertain to the national LP,
to the relationship between the national LP and its affiliates, or to
matters that would be of interest to LP organizations anywhere in the
U.S.; messages about topics of purely local concern (i.e., within one
state) should not be posted here.</p>

<h2>CATEGORY SYSTEM</h2>

<p>In order to facilitate the selection of messages by users who may not
be interested in following all of the discussion on all topics, each
LPUS message is assigned to a "category" as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>LPUS: news and announcements of overall interest
<li> LPUS-PRES: presidential campaign
<li>LPUS-CAMP: campaigns (other than presidential)
<li>LPUS-PLAT: platform amendments
<li>LPUS-WWW: World Wide Web site operations
<li>LPUS-MISC: discussion that does not fit into specialty categories
</ul>

<p>Categories are assigned primarily on the recommendation of the user
posting the message; however the list owner reserves the option to
change the category of any message.</p>

<p>Users receiving LPUS messages via the Internet may specify which
categories are included in their subscriptions, except that the main
"LPUS" news and announcements category will be sent to all subscribers.
By default, subscriptions will include all categories except LPUS-PLAT
and LPUS-WWW.</p>

<p>Each message is posted under one category only, i.e., no "cross-posting"
across categories.  All subscribers receive the basic "LPUS"
distribution of news and announcements, so there is no need to post
those items again under another category in order for them to be
discussed.  If you have information that everybody <em>really</em> needs to
see, it probably belongs in the "LPUS" category.  Otherwise, if you
have something to say about more than one topic please post separate
messages focused on each topic, to allow subscribers to concentrate on
the aspects which interest them.</p>

<p>Detailed description of each category:</p>

<h3>LPUS</h3>

<p>News and announcements relating to the Libertarian Party overall.
Discussion of items posted here should be conducted under one of
the other categories.</p>

<p>Examples of appropriate messages:</p>

<ul>
<li>announcements and reports from national officers and committees
<li>news from the national office
<li>news about legislation that would affect party business (e.g.
          ballot access, campaign finance)
<li>corrections and updates to previous messages in this category
</ul>

<h3>LPUS-PRES</h3>

<p>News and discussion relating to the Libertarian presidential and
vice-presidential campaigns.</p>

<h3>LPUS-CAMP</h3>

<p>News and discussion relating to Libertarian campaigns for public
office <em>other</em> than president/vice-president.  As this is a national
forum, messages should relate in some way to the interests of a
national readership, in one or more of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>messages about campaign techniques and procedures of general
         applicability nationwide
<li>messages about campaigns of national prominence
<li>messages which illustrate an issue or problem that is likely to
         be of interest to people working on other campaigns
 </ul>

<p>The following types of messages should <em>not</em> be posted:

<ul>
<li>announcements of local campaign meetings or appearances
<li>internal discussion of plans or problems of a specific campaign
</ul>

<h3>LPUS-PLAT</h3>

<p>Proposals for amending the national Platform.  This is intended
to provide for consideration of actual concrete wording, not for
abstract discussion of libertarian concepts.  Participants should
be familiar with the Platform.</p>

<h3>LPUS-WWW</h3>

<p>Discussion of WWW sites for LP organizations -- issues of site
construction and maintenance, helping people to establish new
sites, ideas and tools for improving existing sites.</p>

<h3>LPUS-MISC</h3>

<p>Discussion of any topic relating to the national LP organization
or to LP organizations nationwide <em>other</em> than those for which
there is a separate specialty category.</p>

<p>Examples of appropriate topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>matters relating to the LNC or the national office
<li>techniques for state and local party organization
<li>campaigns for internal party offices
</ul>
      
<p>Note: Although LPUS-MISC is "MISC", remember that it is still "LPUS".
This category is not intended as a general libertarian discussion
forum -- all messages should still meet the basic LPUS criteria of
"LP business" and "national".</p>

<h2>RELATED LISTS</h2>

<p>Several states now have mailing lists for discussion of LP business at
the state or local level.  For further information, check with your
state party or consult the list of libertarian mailing lists, which is
available via WWW at
"<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><A href="http://www.rahul.net/dehnbase/liberml/">http://www.rahul.net/dehnbase/liberml/</a>"
and as
"Libertarian FAQ: Mailing Lists" (archive-name: libertarian/mailing-lists).</p>

<h2>CROSS-POSTING</h2>

<p>Please do not cross-post announcements to Libernet and LPUS unless they
are important and urgent.  Please do not cross-post comments to
Libernet-D and LPUS unless they contain important followup information
(e.g., corrections, updates) relating to messages that previously
appeared in both places.  LPUS subscribers who want to receive general
libertarian announcements should subscribe to Libernet.  LPUS
subscribers who want to participate in a general libertarian
discussion/debate should subscribe to Libernet-D.  Please respect the
desires of individuals who <em>don't</em> want to receive such types of
messages by utilizing each forum for its intended purpose.</p>

<h2>INTERNET ACCESS</h2>

<p>LPUS is available via the Internet as a mailing list. Mailing list
subscribers may elect to receive their messages one at a time (i.e., as
soon as available) or in "batches" approximately twice per day. (A
batch contains several LPUS messages sent as one e-mail message, with
just one set of Internet headers.) If they do not otherwise specify,
CompuServe users will receive batches, other subscribers will get
messages one at a time.</p>

<p>Users may additionally specify which categories they wish to receive.
Users who receive messages one at a time may request any combination
of categories (except that the main "LPUS" category is always included.)
A limited form of this option is available to batch subscribers:
the categories that are included with a default subscription all
appear in one batch, but the categories that are only included by
request (LPUS-PLAT and LPUS-WWW) are batched separately.  Batch
subscribers will not receive such batches unless they specifically 
request those categories.</p>

<p>To subscribe, to change your category selection, or to cancel your
subscription, send a request to:</p>

<p><img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:LPUS-request@dehnbase.fidonet.org">LPUS-request@dehnbase.fidonet.org</a></p>

<p>To post a message, send to:</p>

<p>category@dehnbase.fidonet.org</p>

<p>where "category" is the category you believe best fits your message.
For example, to post a general announcement, sent your message to
"LPUS@dehnbase.fidonet.org"; to post a comment about the presidential
campaign, send to "LPUS-PRES@dehnbase.fidonet.org".</p>

<h2>FIDONET ACCESS</h2>

<p>LPUS is available to Fidonet users as an echo. Sysops should set access
to the area as seems appropriate to them based on the description above
and the nature of their BBS; if the system has many non-libertarian
users, it may be best to allow access only to LP members or by request,
to avoid extraneous traffic being generated by people who are not
familiar with the topic.</p>

<p>Fidonet BBSs carrying LPUS will receive all categories.  Users posting
a message should indicate the category by putting the category name
(e.g., "LPUS-PRES") in the Fidonet "To" field.  Messages without a
valid category name, including messages addressed to "All", will be
considered to be in category LPUS-MISC.</p>

<h1>Clinton Administration E-mail Directory</h1>

<p>The following Clinton Administration e-mail addresses were obtained from a
November 2, 1994 memorandum distributed on the Libernet mailing list. This list
is not guaranteed to be correct. In fact I suspect the system administrator
would have changed most or all of these addresses after they became
publicized.</p>

<p>Of particular interest are Ira Magaziner (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:MAGAZINER_I@a1.eop.gov">MAGAZINER_I@a1.eop.gov</a>), George
Stephanopoulos (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:STEPHANOPO_G@a1.eop.gov">STEPHANOPO_G@a1.eop.gov</a>),
and Dee Dee Myers (I'd bet her account isn't active anymore).</p>

<h1>1996 Libertarian Campaigns</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All in all, 1996 was a banner year for the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>.
The party set new membership and candidate records, built upon its
base of support, and saw its ideas included in mainstream politics
like never before in this century.</p>

<p>In the <a href="browne/">presidential race</a>, the Libertarian ticket
of Harry Browne and Jo Jorgensen received 485,120 votes (0.5% of the
total). This is the second-best Libertarian showing ever. The L.P. became
the first third party ever to be on all fifty state ballots two presidential
elections in a row.</p>

<p>In an election season widely characterized as boring, voter turnout was
the lowest since 1824, at 49%. However, minor parties were exceptionally
strong, with more candidates on the ballot than usual and stronger minor
candidates for President than usual.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<dl>
<p>
<dt><strong>Winning campaigns.</strong></dt>
<dd>The party's number of appointed and elected officeholders topped
170 even before the November elections. From <a href="early.html">January
to April 1996</a>, nearly twenty Libertarians were elected or appointed
to various nonpartisan offices. In November, two Libertarians were
re-elected to nonpartisan office in California (one to a utilities district
board and one as a county supervisor).</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong><a href="senate.html">Senate races.</a></strong></dt>
<dd>The LP's best results were Ken Blevens's 4% showing in New Hampshire
and Jack Cashin's 4% in Georgia. Both of those races held the balance of
power, which often gives the state affiliate bargaining power in future
political decisions.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong><a href="governors.html">Governors races.</a></strong></dt>
<dd>Wallace Johnson's 3% showing in West Virginia earns major party status
in that state, one of the toughest for ballot access.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong><a href="house.html">U.S. House races.</a></strong></dt>
<dd>Best results were Richard Eaton's 25% in Maine, Robert Anderson's 6%
in Arizona and Emil Rossi's 7% in California. Eaton's was a two-way race,
and each of the others held the balance of power.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Other partisan races.</strong></dt>
<dd>The best results that I have so far are Karen Benson's 34% county
council showing in Indiana, Richard Eaton's 25% showing
for Maine State Representative and Carol Hill's 22% for
county commission in Colorado. Quite a few candidates received between
15% and 20% for various state level races (state house, state senate
and state supreme court).</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Other nonpartisan races.</strong></dt>
<dd>Two Libertarians were re-elected to county and local office in
California. A Libertarian came in second with 33% for Colorado Regional
Transportation District.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Other important facts for the party.</strong></dt>
<dd>The party ran a record 775 candidates in the November elections,
including 170 for Congress. Paid membership doubled from '94 to '96 to
record levels.  Libertarian candidates received
<a href="endorsements.html">endorsements</a> from a wide range of groups.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The year was not entirely cheery for libertarians, however. Many
libertarians expected Browne to get close to 1%, and the Party lost
ballot status in four states -- New Hampshire, Hawaii, Illinois
and Massachusetts -- while gaining it in only one, West Virginia.
Increased competition from other minor party candidates resulted in lower
average vote totals.</p>

<h2>1988 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h2>

<p>The 1987 Libertarian national convention nominated <a
href="/revolution/by_name/P/RonPaul.html">Ron Paul</a> for
President and <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/AndreMarrou.html">Andre Marrou</a>

Marrou had served in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a> state
legislature as a Libertarian.</p>

<p>The nominating convention was spirited. Native American activist
Russell Means lost the presidential nomination to Paul.</p>

<p>The Paul/Marrou ticket was on the ballot in 46 states plus the
District of Columbia and received 432,116 votes.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpil/givot.html">Givot for
	Senate</a>: 60,000 votes (1.25%)</li>
<li>Bergland/Lewis for President/Vice President: 228,314 votes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1984 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h2>

<p>The 1983 Libertarian national convention nominated <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David Bergland</a> for
President and <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/JimLewis.html">Jim Lewis</a>
for Vice President. Bergland was a Coast Mesa,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> lawyer,
had been the Libertarian 1976 vice presidential candidate,
and served as party chair from 1977 to 1981. Lewis was a salesman and
tax protestor.</p>

<p>Radio talk show host Gene Burns had been the frontrunner for the
presidential nomination, but withdrew a week before the convention when
he decided the party didn't have enough funding for a strong campaign.</p>

<p>The delegates quickly centered around Bergland as representative of
the party's radical wing, and Earl Ravenal as representative of
the more moderate Cato Institute-oriented wing. After Ravenal lost,
many of his supporters left the party.</p>

<p>Many states tightened ballot access laws after strong independent and
Libertarian showings in the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1980/">1980 presidential
election</a>. The Bergland/Lewis
ticket was on 40 ballots and won 228,314 votes. This was the first and
so far only time the Libertarian Party presidential candidate had the
third highest candidate vote total. (The party has had the third highest
party total -- excluding independents -- for most elections.)</p>

<h1>1980 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>The 1979 Libertarian Party national convention nominated <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/EdClark.html">Ed Clark</a> for President and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/K/DavidKoch.html">David Koch</a> for
Vice President. Clark had made an impressive effort in the 1978
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
gubernatorial race, and David Koch was a millionaire who pledged to
contribute at least $500,000 to the campaign.</p>

<p>During the campaign, Clark urged independent candidate John Anderson to
withdraw from the race.</p>

<p>Clark received three daily newspaper endorsements. (Republican Ronald Reagan
received 443, Democrat Jimmy Carter 126, and independent John Anderson 40.)</p>

<p>Columnist Nicholas von Hoffman praised the consistency of the Libertarian
platform and the strength of Libertarian candidates' following the platform.
Hoffman railed that a vote for Carter, Reagan or Anderson is just "ratifying
what has been done, reaffirming it, and giving legitimacy to what will follow.
But a vote for Clark is something else again. It carries a message for now and
a threat for the future."</p>

<p><cite>People</cite> made a common criticism, that the Libertarian platform
"is seductive -- less government, more freedom -- but in specifics in becomes
less so. Libertarians call for an end to mandatory public education; phasing
out of social security and welfare; dismantling of all federal regulatory
agencies plus the FBI and CIA; a neutralist foreign policy; and the repeal,
among other things, of laws against abortion, gambling, drugs, and
prostitution."</p>

<p>What that boils down to, is that the difference between Libertarians and
other advocates of smaller government is that Libertarians mean it.</p>

<p>The 1980 Libertarian ticket was on all 51 ballots and won 921,299 votes
(1.05% of the total). Voter turnout was 53.95%.</p>

candidates and votes than any other minor party.</p>
