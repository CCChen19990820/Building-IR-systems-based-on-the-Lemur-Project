SOURCE:  Adopted at 5 Ill. Reg. 12713, effective October 30,
1981; codified at 7 Ill. Reg. 268, effective December 15, 1982;

<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 801.10  Authority
 
This Rule is promulgated by the Director of Insurance under
Section 124.6 and Subsection (a) of Section 401 of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 73, pars. 736.6 and
1013), which empowers the Director "to make reasonable rules and
regulations as may be necessary for making effective" the
insurance laws of this State.

     (Source:  Amended at 8 Ill. Reg. 15058, effective August 8,
         1984) 

 
Section 801.20  Purpose and Scope
 
It is the purpose of this Rule to implement Article VIII and
Section 136 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983,
ch. 73, pars. 736, et. seq. and 748) by requiring domestic
insurance companies to comply with Section 124.6 of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 73, par. 736.6).

     (Source:  Amended at 8 Ill. Reg. 15058, effective August 8,
         1984) 
 
Section 801.30  Procedures for Valuing Investments
 
     a)  The "Valuation of Securities Manual," the "Accounting
         Practices and Procedures Manual for Life and Health
         Insurance Companies" and the "Accounting Practices and
         Procedures Manual for Fire and Casualty Insurance
         Companies" as published by the National Association of
         Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) have been adopted for use
         in Illinois by Sections 124.6 and 136(1) of the Illinois
         Insurance Code.  The procedures outlined in these
         publications are to be used for valuing investments for
         which valuations are not otherwise defined by statute or
         rule.  The Director shall disallow any accounting
         practice or procedure prescribed by the publications if
         he deems it necessary to ascertain the condition and
         affairs of any company.  In making the disallowance
         determination, the Director shall consider such factors
         as the nature of the investment (stocks, bonds, real
         estate); the financial stability of the issuing company;
         the applicability of other standardized accounting
         procedures; and other factors affecting the accuracy of
         the valuation.

     b)  

          1)  As a result of the adoption of the "NAIC Accounting
              Practices and Procedure Manuals," the manner in
              which investments in subsidiaries are accounted for
              will change accordingly.  The newly adopted
              accounting procedures will apply to all
              acquisitions of subsidiaries by domestic companies
              that take place on or after January 1, 1984.

          2)  Domestic companies presently amortizing the
              difference between the cost and equity value of a
              subsidiary under control of the domestic company
              prior to January 1, 1984 under the procedures
              described by the "Illinois Accounting Practices
              Manual" generally will continue to value their
              subsidiaries under those procedures until the
              amortization is complete.  Any replacement of such
              accounting methods with those prescribed by the
              NAIC must be approved by the Director.  A change in
              the accounting method will be considered only if
              the company is presently amortizing other
              subsidiaries under the current NAIC accounting
              practices and procedures.  The Director shall
              approve a change in accounting methods if, after
              considering the method used to amortize the value
              of goodwill involved in acquisition of a
              subsidiary, the Director determines that the
              accounting method used will continue to accurately
              reflect their valuation and will be consistent with
              other accounting procedures used by the company.

     c)  The following procedures shall be required for the
         listed investment.

          1)  Bonds with Call Options

                   No investment shall be carried at above the
                   call price for the entire issue during any
                   period within which the investment may be so
                   called.  Premiums paid at purchase shall be
                   amortized to the first call date at which the
                   entire issue may be redeemed.

          2)  Real Estate

               A)  Sale and Leaseback transactions which qualify
                   pursuant to Section 125.17a of the Illinois
                   Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 73,
                   par. 737.17a) shall be accounted for in
                   accordance with generally accepted accounting
                   principles.

               B)  Appraisals of real estate in written form
                   shall be submitted to the Department for
                   review prior to any approval being given to
                   hold real estate under Section 125.20a(d) of
                   the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.
                   1983, ch. 73, par. 737.20a).  Additionally,
                   appraisals shall be obtained and kept on
                   record at the company for all properties held
                   under Sections 125.19a and 125.20a of the
                   Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983,
                   ch. 73, pars. 737.19a and 737.20a).  The
                   appraisal shall be reviewed to insure that the
                   appraisal was performed by persons qualified
                   under this Section, performed in the customary
                   manner and that the appraisal supports the
                   valuation amount expressed by the company in
                   its annual statement.  Such appraisals shall
                   be performed by a member of the American
                   Institute of Real Estate Appraisers except in
                   the case or property to be qualified hereunder
                   by reason of producing gas or other minerals.
                   Then the appraisal must be made by an engineer
                   or geologist with experience in the relevant
                   field.

          3)  Limited Partnerships

               A)  All limited partnerships shall be valued at
                   the equity method of accounting in the same
                   manner prescribed for valuing subsidiaries by
                   the National Association of Insurance
                   Commissioners "Valuation of Securities Manual"
                   unless another method of accounting which will
                   more accurately reflect the value of the
                   limited partnership has been formally approved
                   by the Director of the Illinois Insurance
                   Department for a specified limited
                   partnership.

                   Annual financial statements of the limited
                   partnership must be kept at the company for
                   examination purposes.

               B)  The ordinary gains earned on the company's
                   portion of the interest in the partnership
                   shall be treated as an ordinary gain on the
                   books of the insurance company.  Likewise,
                   capital gains earned from the partnership
                   shall be treated as capital gains on the
                   insurance company's books.

          4)  Valuation of Investments Otherwise Undefined

              A company which has an investment which cannot be
              valued in accordance with the foregoing procedures
              must file a request for valuation with the Illinois
              Department of Insurance within 15 days following
              the end of the month in which the investment is
              acquired.  This request shall include at a minimum
              the following information:

               A)  A description of the investment

               B)  Date of acquisition

               C)  Name of Vendor

               D)  Cost of investment to company

               E)  Par value, if relevant

               F)  Rate and/or amount of interest, dividend or
                   other compensation earned or accrued

               G)  Any other significant terms of the investment.

     (Source:  Amended at 8 Ill. Reg. 15058, effective August 8,
         1984) 

 
Section 801.40  Severability Provision
 
If any section or portion of a section of this rule, or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of the rule, or the
applicability to other persons or circumstances, shall not be
effected thereby.

              escrowed securities to be kept segregated by the
              bank or other custodial agent from other financial
              instruments owned by the insurer or others, which

     b)  Any insurer which sells (writes) put options guaranteed
         by funds it owns shall:

          1)  maintain custodial agreements which call for its

              of such put option for the purchase of financial
              instruments in amounts which, when aggregated with
              current holdings, including potential holdings
              under Section 125.23a of the Illinois Insurance
              Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 737.23a)

         1993) 

 
Section 802.50  Accounting for Transactions in Call and Put Options
 
     a)  Accounting procedures for call and put options purchased
         by an insurance company shall be in accordance with the
         following principles:

          1)  The consideration paid for the call or put option
              shall be treated as a deferred asset.

          2)  If the call or put option is expires without
              exercise, the expiration shall be treated as a sale
              of the call or put option on the expiration date,
              and the resultant loss shall be recognized
              currently.

          3)  If the call option is exercised, the consideration
              paid for it shall be added to the price paid for
              the underlying financial instrument and thus
              treated as a capital expenditure.

          4)  If the put option is exercised, the consideration
              paid for it shall be deducted from the price
              received for the underlying financial instrument
              and thus treated as a reduction of proceeds.

          5)  If the call or put option is terminated through a
              closing sale transaction, the difference between
              the consideration paid in the purchase of the call
              or put option and the consideration received in the
              closing sale transaction shall be treated, at the
              time of such closing sale transaction, as a gain or
              loss, as the case may be.

     b)  Accounting procedures for call or put options sold
         (written) by an insurance company shall be in accordance
         with the following principles:

          1)  The consideration for selling the call or put
              option shall not be included in income at the time
              of receipt, but shall be carried in a deferred
              account until one of the following occurs:

               A)  the call or put option expires through the
                   passage of time, or

               B)  the insurer sells the underlying financial
                   instrument pursuant to the exercise of the
                   call option, or

               C)  the insurer purchases the underlying financial
                   instrument pursuant to the exercise of the put
                   option, or

               D)  the insurer engages in a closing purchase
                   transaction.

          2)  If the obligation under the call or put option
              expires through the passage of time, the
              consideration for the option shall be recognized
              currently at the time of such expiration.

          3)  If the underlying financial instrument is sold
              pursuant to the exercise of the call option, the
              consideration received for the option shall be
              treated as increasing the amount realized upon the
              sale of the underlying financial instrument and
              shall be included in determining capital gain or
              loss.

          4)  If the underlying financial instrument is purchased
              pursuant to the exercise of the put option, the
              consideration received for the option shall be
              treated as reducing the cost basis of the financial
              instrument so purchased.

          5)  If the obligation under the call or put option is
              terminated through a closing purchase transaction,
              the difference between the consideration received
              from the sale of the call or put option and the
              consideration paid in the closing purchase
              transaction shall be treated, at the time of such
              closing purchase transaction, as a gain or loss, as
              the case may be.

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 6783, effective April 26,
         1993) 

 
Section 802.60  Valuation
 
     a)  Each exchange-traded call or put stock or stock index
         option purchased by an insurance company shall be valued
         at the current market price therefor on a registered
         national securities exchange.  This "mark-to-market"
         will result in an unrealized gain or loss.

     b)  Stock owned by an insurance company with respect to
         which a call option has been sold shall be valued, so
         long as the option exists, at the current market price
         of the stock.

     c)  The amount held in a deferred account for call or put
         stock options sold shall be valued at the current market
         price.  The adjustment will result in an unrealized gain
         or loss.

     d)  The amount held in a deferred account for a call or put
         option may be valued at cost if the underlying financial
         instrument:

          1)  would be carried at amortized cost if acquired by
              the insurance company, or

          2)  is a debt financial futures or a debt index
              contract.

     e)  Amounts may be deferred for expired or closed options
         contracts if the contracts are related to uncompleted
         hedging transactions as defined in 50 Ill. Adm. Code
         Part 805.

     f)  Debt instruments owned by an insurance company with
         respect to which a call option has been sold shall
         continue to be valued in the same manner as any other
         such instruments owned by said company.

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 6783, effective April 26,
         1993) 

 
Section 802.70  Administration and Recordkeeping
 
     a)  Prior to engaging in transactions in call and put
         options, an insurer shall develop and adequately
         document policies and procedures regarding investment
         strategies and objectives, recordkeeping needs, and
         reporting matters.  Such policies and procedures shall
         address authorized investment and liability positions,
         applicable limitations, authorization and approval
         procedures, accounting and reporting procedures and
         controls, and shall provide for review of activity in
         call and put options by the insurer's board of directors
         or its designee as set forth in subsection (b) below.

     b)  Recordkeeping systems must be sufficiently detailed to
         permit auditors and insurance department examiners to
         determine whether operating personnel have acted in
         accordance with policies and procedures established by
         the insurer pursuant to subsection (a) above.  Insurer
         records must identify for each hedging transaction the
         related call and put options, the hedged items, and the
         risks being reduced by the hedging transaction.

     c)  Each call and put option transaction must be authorized
         or ratified by the company as provided in Section 124.1
         of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991,
         ch. 73, par. 736.1) [215 ILCS 5/124.1].

Section 803.30  Definitions
 
         "Bank or Trust Company" means any bank or trust company
         organized under the laws of the United States or any

         regularly examined pursuant to such laws.

         "Lending of Securities" means the investment practice
         other than repurchase agreements, whereby an agreement
         is entered which transfers ownership rights and
         possession of securities to the borrower of such
         securities with the agreement providing for a return of
         ownership rights and possession of the securities to the
         lender at a specified date or upon demand.

         "Registered Securities Broker" means a securities broker
         registered under the Federal Securities Exchange Act of
         1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).

 
Section 803.40  Agreement
 
The agreement between the domestic company and the borrower must
be reduced to writing and contain provisions providing for the
following:

     a)  All loans must terminate no more than one year from the
         date of origination.  In addition, the domestic company
         must have the right to terminate the loan in a maximum
         of the normal settlement time for the loaned security
         plus one day, after receipt of the notice by the
         borrower.  Such right must include the ability to
         terminate a loan at the domestic company's discretion to
         permit the domestic company to vote on any matter
         presented to the owners of record of said security.

     b)  At the termination of the loan, the borrower must be
         obligated to return securities identical in all respects
         to the securities lent, except as to certificate number.

     c)  The domestic company must be entitled to receive from
         the borrower all distributions made by the issuer of the
         loaned securities during the duration of the loan,
         including cash dividends, stock dividends, stock splits
         and interest distributions of any kind declared, granted
         or made by the issuer, or any affiliate thereof, and
         rights to purchase or subscribe for additional
         securities.

     d)  The borrower must provide at the inception of the loan
         collateral in the form of cash in an amount at least
         equal to the market value of the loaned securities, or
         an irrevocable letter of credit drawn on a bank
         acceptable to the domestic company in an amount at least
         equal to the market value of the loaned securities, or
         U.S. Government securities having a market value at
         least equal to the market value of the loaned
         securities.

     e)  If the market of the collateral provided by the borrower
         should become an amount less than 100% of the market
         value of the loaned securities at the close of any
         business day, the borrower must immediately provide
         additional collateral to increase the market value of
         the collateral up to an amount at least equal to the
         market value of the loaned securities.

     f)  If the collateral is an irrevocable letter of credit, a
         replacement letter of credit replacing the existing
         letter or credit must be in the possession of the
         domestic company a minimum of the normal settlement time
         for the security loaned plus four business days before
         the expiration date of the existing letter of credit.
         If a replacement letter of credit is not in the
         possession of the domestic company by the required time,
         the domestic company must perfect its rights under the
         existing letter of credit.  The release of a letter of
         credit, before  expiration, must be conditioned to the
         actual return of the loaned securities to the domestic
         company.

     g)  The domestic company must have and exercise the right to
         use the collateral to purchase securities of the same
         issue in the principal market where the securities are
         traded should the borrower fail to return the securities
         as required or requested.  The loan agreement between
         the domestic company and the borrower must detail how to
         handle excess collateral, or a deficiency, after such
         purchase.

 
Section 803.50  Limitations, Valuation and Reporting
 
     a)  The borrower must be a registered securities broker, or
         bank or trust company or registered as a primary dealer
         of government securities with the Federal Reserve
         System.

     b)  If the domestic company has investment discretion
         concerning the collateral, the collateral may only be
         invested in assets with a maturity date no later than
         one year from date of purchase, and that, if held
         directly by the domestic company, would qualify as
         admitted assets pursuant to Article VIII of the Illinois
         Insurance Code.

     c)  Each security loan transaction and investment of the
         collateral must receive action by the domestic company
         as provided for in Section 124.1 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code.

     d)  The valuation procedures as prescribed in the National
         Association of Insurance Commissioner's "Valuations of
         Securities" manual shall be used to value loaned
         securities in the financial statements filed with the
         Illinois Director of Insurance.

     e)  In the financial statements filed with the Illinois
         Director of Insurance, loaned securities will be
         reported as designated by the Illinois Director of
         Insurance.  The Illinois Supplement to the Annual
         Statement will contain reporting instructions and all
         necessary forms to report loaned security activities.

     f)  In those situations where the securities are held out of
         State, the domestic company must deposit the collateral
         with a bank or trust company.  All accounts or deposits
         pursuant to this Part must be established in strict
         conformity with the applicable provisions of Department
         of Insurance Rule, Internal Security Standards and
         Fidelity Bonds (50 Ill. Adm. Code 904).

     g)  The domestic company shall maintain within the State of
         Illinois original copies of all agreements to lend
         securities and any attachments, amendments or exhibits
         thereto.  A current inventory of all loaned securities
         containing the identity of and location of all
         collateral shall be continuously maintained within the
         State of Illinois.  In addition, adequate records will
         be maintained within the State of Illinois to verify the
         domestic company's activities in loaned securities and
         the possession of the necessary collateral.

Section 803.60  Severability Provision
 
If any section or portion of a section of this Part, or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of the part, or the
applicability of such provision to other persons or
circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.

         to writing.

     b)

          1)  When any company enters into a repurchase
              transaction, the company must acquire securities
              having fair market value at least equal to 98%
              (margin) of the fair market value of the
              consideration paid.  Either party to the

               B)  owned by the company in respect to other
                   outstanding repurchase transactions, and

               C)  transferred and subject to reacquisition by
                   the company pursuant to reverse repurchase
                   transactions and

               D)  owned by the company but on loan pursuant to
                   outstanding lending of securities
                   transactions, must not exceed the limits
                   provided by the Illinois Insurance Code
                   authorizing that category of investments
                   except to the extent that the obligation of
                   the seller to reacquire qualifies as a
                   permitted investment or admitted asset under
                   the Illinois Insurance Code.

     c)  When any domestic company enters into a reverse
         repurchase transaction, the company must receive cash or
         other consideration having a fair market value at least
         equal to 95% (margin) of the fair market value of the
         securities transferred.  Either party to the transaction
         may be obligated to provide either additional securities
         or collateral or cash such that the margin may be
         maintained during the term of the transaction.  The
         securities transferred and subject to reacquisition by
         the company pursuant to a reverse repurchase transaction
         when combined with the aggregate of all other securities
         of the same category which are

          1)  owned directly by the company, and

          2)  owned by the company in respect to outstanding
              repurchase transactions, except to the extent that
              the obligation of the seller to reacquire qualifies
              as a permitted investment or admitted asset under
              the Illinois Insurance Code and

          3)  transferred and subject to reacquisition pursuant
              to other outstanding reverse repurchase
              transactions, and

          4)  owned by the company but on loan pursuant to
              outstanding lending of securities transactions,
              must not exceed the limits provided by the Illinois
              Insurance Code authorizing that category of

     d)  Securities acquired by a company and owned subject to
         reacquisition pursuant to an outstanding repurchase
         agreement may not be sold pursuant to a reverse
         repurchase agreement.  Consideration received from a
         reverse repurchase agreement may be used to acquire
         securities which are either equivalent or similar to the
         securities transferred pursuant to such reverse
         repurchase agreement, however, such acquired securities
         may not be sold pursuant to a reverse repurchase
         agreement.

     e)  Each repurchase or reverse repurchase transaction must
         receive action by the company as provided for in Section
         124.1 of the Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 804.50  Accounting Treatment, Valuation and Reporting
 
     a)  Repurchase Agreements

          1)  Repurchase agreements acquired and disposed of by
              companies are to be accounted for in the same
              manner as is required for the acquisition and
              disposition of any other investments.  The
              repurchase agreement is to be reported as the
              investment, not the securities acquired in respect
              thereto.  The income received pursuant to the terms
              of the repurchase agreement is to be accounted for
              as investment income.  The Illinois Supplement to
              the Annual Statement will contain forms and
              additional reporting instructions.

          2)  Repurchase agreements are to be valued in
              accordance with the provisions contained in the
              National Association of Insurance Commissioners
              "Valuation of Securities" Manual.

     b)  Reverse Repurchase Agreements

          1)  Each transaction by which securities are
              transferred and the equivalent securities are to be
              reacquired pursuant to the terms of a reverse
              repurchase agreement is to be accounted for as a
              financing (borrowing) transaction.  A liability is
              to be recorded for the amount of the proceeds
              received and the transferred securities are not to
              be removed from the accounting records.  The
              liability is to be reported on the "Borrowed money"
              line and identified as arising from, and related
              to, a reverse repurchase transaction.  The company
              may pay interest on the funds received pursuant to
              a reverse repurchase agreement and such interest is
              to be recorded as interest expense and not netted
              against the interest income from the securities
              transferred subject to repurchase.  Amortization of
              original premium or accrual of original discount
              and interest income on the transferred securities
              is to be recorded as though the securities had not
              been transferred. The transferred securities are to
              be valued in accordance with the provisions in the
              National Association of Insurance Commissioners
              "Valuation of Securities" Manual.  If the margin is
              less than 100%, the value reported for the
              transferred securities is to be the "Association"
              value less the difference between 100% and the
              margin.

          2)  Each transaction by which securities are
              transferred and other than the equivalent
              securities are to be acquired pursuant to a reverse
              repurchase agreement is to be accounted for as two
              separate transactions.  The transferred securities,
              including unamortized original premium or unaccrued
              original discount, are to be removed from the
              accounting records and the resulting gain or loss
              recognized immediately.  When the other than
              equivalent securities are acquired pursuant to the
              reverse repurchase agreement, they are to be
              recorded at cost.  The company may pay interest on
              the funds received and such interest is to be
              recorded as interest expense and not netted against
              interest income.

          3)  In the financial statements filed with the Illinois
              Director of Insurance, securities sold or
              transferred and subject to reacquisition pursuant
              to a reverse repurchase agreement will be reported
              as designated above.  The Illinois Supplement to
              the Annual Statement will contain forms and
              additional reporting instructions for reverse
              repurchase agreement activities.

 
Section 804.60  Location of Records and Securities
 
     a)  The company shall maintain within the State of Illinois
         original or true copies of all repurchase or reverse
         repurchase agreements and any attachments, amendments or
         exhibits thereto.  A current inventory of all securities
         subject to such agreements, and any related collateral,
         containing the identity of and location of all
         securities and collateral shall be continuously
         maintained within the State of Illinois.  In addition,
         adequate records will be maintained within the State of
         Illinois to verify the company's activities in
         repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and the
         possession of the necessary securities or collateral.
         However, the Illinois Director of Insurance may allow
         such agreements, inventories and records to be located
         outside the State of Illinois by the company adopting
         and filing a plan of operations with the Illinois
         Director of Insurance and obtaining the approval of such
         plan pursuant to Section 133(2) of the Illinois
         Insurance Code.

     b)

          1)  In those situations where the purchase or
              repurchase occurs within one year from the date of
              origination of the related transaction and it is
              impractical to safekeep within the State of
              Illinois the securities owned, or related
              collateral held pursuant to a repurchase agreement,
              or the investments acquired with the proceeds of a
              reverse repurchase agreement, with such investments
              being designated to be used to complete the
              repurchase, the company must deposit the securities
              or collateral or investments with a bank or trust
              company.  Such account for deposits must be
              established in conformity with the applicable
              provisions of Department of Insurance Rule Internal
              Security Standards and Fidelity Bonds (50 Ill. Adm.
              Code 904) and the securities, collateral or
              investments may be in book entry form.

          2)  In all other situations, such securities or
              collateral or investments must be safekept within
              the State of Illinois in conformity with the
              applicable provisions of Department of Insurance
              Rule Part 904.  Such securities or collateral or
              investments may be maintained in a safekeeping
              account of the type authorized by Section 124.18 of
              the Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 804.70  Exemption
 
Repurchase agreements entered with any one bank in amounts not
exceeding $100,000 and having a duration of no greater than 31
days are exempt from the provisions of Sections 804.40 (b) and
804.50 (a) above.  Such repurchase transactions are to be
reported as cash in the financial statements filed with the
Illinois Director of Insurance.

 
Section 804.80  Severability Provision
 
If any section or portion of a section of this rule, or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of this rule, or the
applicability of such provision to other persons or
circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.

Section 805.30  Definitions
 
         Commodity Futures Trading Commission means the federal
         regulatory agency charged and empowered under the
         Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 (7
         U.S.C. 1 et seq.) with regulation of the commodity
         exchanges or any other agency of the federal government
         which thereafter succeeds to or shares such power.

         Deferred gains or losses are the amounts of unrecognized
         increase and decrease in the value of financial futures
         contracts related to uncompleted hedging transactions.
         These deferred amounts may, in some cases, result from
         terminated financial futures contracts.

         Exchange-traded means traded under the terms and
         conditions required by, or substantially similar to, a
         National Securities Exchange registered under the
         Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78(a) et
         seq.) which has been authorized to provide a market for
         option contracts pursuant to Rule 9b-1 of the Securities
         and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or traded on a
         commodity exchange designed as a contract market
         regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
         (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 737.24(a)) [215 ILCS
         5/125.24a].

         Financial futures contract means an exchange-traded
         contract which is based upon a "commodity" as defined in
         Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as
         amended (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), or any other successor
         statute or one or more financial instruments, under
         terms and conditions regulated by the Commodity Futures
         Trading Commission.

         Financial instrument means:

              a security, currency, deposit or any other
              instrument, or index of a group of securities,
              currencies, deposits or instruments authorized or
              permitted under Sections 125.1a through 125.12a or
              Section 125.21a of the Illinois Insurance Code
              (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, pars. 737.1a through
              737.12a and 737.21a) [215 ILCS 5/125.1a through
              125.12a and 125.21a]; or
              an index or pool which is composed of (or is
              otherwise based upon) insurance-related items.

         Hedge is a positioning of a hedged item with one or more
         hedging transactions.

         Hedged Item is a company asset, liability, revenue or
         expense, group, combination or ratio of company assets,
         liabilities, revenues or expenses, or any such items or
         group of items reasonably expected to be acquired,
         incurred  or generated by the company in the normal
         course of business.  Such items must bear price,
         valuation, interest rate or, with respect to
         insurance-related items, underwriting or other
         insurance-related risk.

         Hedging Transaction is the opening or closing, as such
         transaction may be adjusted from time to time, of one or
         more qualifying financial futures contracts or call or
         put options which can reasonably be expected to reduce
         the price, valuation, interest rate or, with respect to
         insurance-related items, underwriting or other
         insurance-related risk of the hedged item.

         Insurance-related items are those assets, liabilities,
         revenues or expenses (including groups, combinations or
         ratios thereof) or other data of an insurance company
         related to the issuance of insurance policies or
         reinsurance treaties or the assumption of risk inherent
         therein, or otherwise related to the business of
         insurance.

         Margin includes initial and maintenance margins and
         means any type of deposit or settlement made or required
         to be made with a futures commission merchant, security
         broker, clearinghouse, or safekeeping agent to ensure
         performance of the terms of the financial futures
         contract.  For purposes of this Part, "maintenance
         margin" includes "variance margin."

         Qualifying financial futures contract means a financial
         futures contract which is based upon one or more
         financial instruments or which has been approved in
         writing by the Director, upon an insurer's demonstrating
         to the satisfaction of the Director that the use of such
         financial futures contract can reasonably be expected to
         reduce the price, valuation, interest rate or, with
         respect to insurance-related items, underwriting or
         other insurance-related risk to which the insurer is
         subject.

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 6775, effective April 26,
         1993) 

 
Section 805.40  Transactions in Financial Futures
 
     a)  An insurer shall not enter into a financial futures
         contract unless it is a qualifying financial futures
         contract and is used in the context of a hedging
         transaction.  If during the life of a hedge, the total
         dollar variation between the hedged item and the hedging
         transaction no longer is expected to be significantly
         correlated, the transaction will no longer be considered
         a hedge and the financial futures contract must be
         closed.  Transactions in financial futures must be
         evidenced by a trade confirmation or other evidence of
         ownership issued to the insurer by an entity authorized
         to do so, as described in the definition of
         "Exchange-traded" in Section 805.30 of this Part.

     b)  An insurer shall never have an aggregate of any form of
         margin and net deferred gains and losses from terminated
         financial futures contracts outstanding, under Section
         125.23a of the Illinois Insurance Code, of more than 10%
         of the excess of its capital and surplus over the
         minimum requirements of a new stock or mutual company to
         qualify for a certificate of authority to write the kind
         of insurance which the insurer is authorized to write.
         Insurer assets utilized to fulfill margin requirements
         shall be classified exclusively under Section 125.23a,
         notwithstanding any other investment sections of the
         Code under which the assets may have previously or may
         in the future be qualified.  Further, with respect to
         any financial futures contract which relates to an
         underlying investment position authorized or permitted
         under Section 125.1a through 125.12a or Section 125.21a
         of the Illinois Insurance Code, an insurer shall not
         take a "long" financial futures position (i.e., buy
         futures contracts) representing an amount of securities,
         currencies, deposits or other instruments which, when
         aggregated with current holdings would exceed the
         applicable limitations contained in Sections 125.1a
         through 125.12a and Section 125.21a of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par.
         737.1a through 737.12a and 737.21a) [215 ILCS 5/125.1a
         through 125.12a and 125.21a] whether or not the
         underlying investment position is taken at the delivery
         date of the future contract.

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 6775, effective April 26,
         1993) 

 
Section 805.50  Accounting for Transactions in Financial Futures Contracts
 
     a)  Assets or liabilities carried at amortized cost.

          1)  Gains and losses from hedged transactions may be
              deferred for hedged items carried at amortized
              cost.  If the dollar change in the hedged item is
              different than the total dollar change from the
              hedging transactions, the difference in dollar
              change (i.e., the extent to which the transaction
              is not effective as a hedge), if expected to be
              permanent, shall be recognized currently.  Until a
              hedge is terminated, deferred gains and losses are
              liabilities and assets respectively.

          2)  After the hedge is terminated, deferred gains and
              losses shall be included in the amortized cost of
              the hedged item subject to the limitation that the
              amortized cost of the hedged item may not be
              increased above its fair market value.  If the
              hedged item is no longer anticipated to be acquired
              or incurred, the hedge must be terminated and the
              deferred gain or loss from the hedging transactions
              must be recognized currently.

          3)  Allocation of gains or losses to the hedged item
              shall be recognized in a systematic and rational
              method, as set forth in Section 805.60(b) of this
              Part.

     b)  Assets or liabilities carried at market value.
         For assets and liabilities carried at market value,
         gains or losses on open hedging transactions shall be
         recognized currently.

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 6775, effective April 26,
         1993) 

 
Section 805.60  Administration and Recordkeeping
 
     a)  Prior to engaging in transactions in financial futures
         contracts, an insurer shall develop and adequately
         document policies and procedures regarding investment
         strategies and objectives, recordkeeping needs, and
         reporting matters.  Such policies and procedures shall
         address authorized investment and liability positions,
         applicable limitations, authorization and approval
         procedures, accounting and reporting procedures and
         controls, and shall provide for review of activity in
         financial futures contracts by the insurer's board of
         directors or its designee, as set forth in subsection
         (b) below.

     b)  Recordkeeping systems must be sufficiently detailed to
         permit auditors and insurance department examiners to
         determine whether operating personnel have acted in
         accordance with established policies and procedures, as
         set forth in subsection (a) above, and for determination
         of compliance with other Sections of this Part.  Insurer
         records must identify for each hedging transaction the
         related financial futures contracts, the hedged items
         and the risks being reduced by the hedging transaction.

     c)  Each financial futures contract transaction must be
         authorized or ratified by the company as provided for in
         Section 124.1 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 736.1) [215 ILCS 5/124.1].

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 6775, effective April 26,
         1993) 

 
Section 805.70  Severability Provision
 
If any Section or portion of a Section of this Part, or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstances, is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of this Part, or the
applicability of such provision to other persons or
circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.

Section 851.20  Purpose

              to" and shall indicate the date of the amendment
         and not the date of the original filing.  If the person

         Insurance Code, the name of the domestic insurer on the
         cover page shall be indicated as follows:

         Company."

              signed copy.  If the signature of any person is
              affixed pursuant to a power of attorney or other
              similar authority, a copy of such power of attorney
              or other authority shall also be filed with the
              statement.

     C.  Requirements as to Printing and Language

          (1) All copies of any filed statements, papers or
              documents shall be clear, readable and suitable for
              photocopying.  Debits in credit categories and
              credits in debit categories shall be designated in
              a manner other than color so as to be
              distinguishable on photocopies.

          (2) Statements shall be in the English language and
              monetary values shall be stated in United States

              into the English language and any monetary values
              shown in a foreign currency shall be converted into
              United States currency.  Monetary conversions in
              the financial statement shall be made as of the
              date of the financial statement.  Other required
              conversions shall be made as of the date stated on
              the Form A cover page.

     D.  Preparation of Statement

         This form is not to be used as a blank form to be filled
         in, but only as a guide in the preparation of the
         statement. The statement shall contain the numbers and
         captions of all items, but the text of the items may be
         omitted at the option of the acquiring party provided
         the answers thereto are so prepared as to indicate to
         the reader the coverage of the items without the
         necessity of his referring to the text of the items or
         instructions thereto.  All instructions, whether
         appearing under the items of the form or elsewhere
         therein, are to be omitted.  Unless expressly provided
         otherwise within this Part, if any item is inapplicable
         or the answer thereto is in the negative, an statement
         to that effect shall be made.

     E.  Additional Information

         In addition to the information expressly required to be
         included in the statement, there may at the option of
         the acquiring party be added such further material
         information, if any, as may be necessary to make the
         information contained therein not misleading.

     F.  Information Unknown or Not Available

         Information required need be given only insofar as it is
         known or reasonably available to the acquiring party.
         If any required information is unknown and not
         reasonably available to the acquiring party, either
         because the obtaining thereof would involve unreasonable
         effort or expense, or because it rests peculiarly within
         the knowledge of another person not affiliated with the
         acquiring party, the information may be omitted, subject
         to the following conditions:

          (1) The acquiring party shall give such information on
              the subject as it possesses or can acquire without
              unreasonable effort or expense including but not
              limited to impossibility or the loss or destruction
              of documents, together with the sources thereof.

          (2) The acquiring party shall include a statement
              either showing that unreasonable effort or expense
              would be involved or indicating the absence of any
              affiliation with the person within whose knowledge
              the information rests and stating the result of a
              request made to such person for the information.

     G.  Incorporation by Reference

          (1) Matters required by any item of this statement may
              be incorporated by reference in answer or partial
              answer to any other item.

              to the Federal Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.
              77a et seq.) the Federal Securities Exchange Act of
              1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) or a state law
              requiring registration or disclosure and
              information contained in any financial statement,
              annual report, proxy statement or any other
              document may be incorporated by reference in any
              answer or partial answer to any item or items of
              this Statement, provided such information meets the
              requirements of this statement.  A copy of such
              incorporation documents shall be included as an
              exhibit to Form A.

          (3) Material incorporated by reference shall be clearly
              identified in the reference.  An express statement
              that the specified matter is incorporated by
              reference shall be made at the particular place in
              the statement where the information is required.
              Matter shall not be incorporated by reference in
              any case where such incorporation would render the
              statement incomplete, unclear or confusing.

     H.  Summaries or Outlines of Documents
         Where an item requires a summary or outline of the
         provisions of any document, only a brief statement shall
         be made as to the most important provisions of the
         document.  In addition to such statement, the summary or
         outline may incorporate by reference particular parts of
         any exhibit and may be qualified in its entirety by such
         reference.

     I.  Additional Exhibits

         The acquiring party may file such exhibits as it may
         desire, in addition to those expressly required by the
         statement.  Such exhibits shall be so marked as to
         indicate clearly the subject matters to which they
         refer.

     J.  Omission of Identical Documents

         In any case where two or more documents required to be
         filed as exhibits are identical in all respects except
         as to the parties thereto, the dates of execution, or
         other details, the acquiring party need file a copy of
         only one of such documents, with a schedule identifying
         the omitted documents and setting forth the details in
         which such documents differ from the documents a copy of
         which is filed.  The Director may at any time in his
         discretion require the filing of copies of any omitted
         documents in order to verify that the omitted documents
         are identical to documents on file.

              the previous 10 years, the financial statements
              need not be audited, provided they are based on the

              requires that (Name of Domestic Insurer) send to

              Acquiring Party) regarding the acquisition of
              control of (Name of Domestic Insurer).

              For purposes of this instruction a change in
              business operations or corporate structure or

              overall impact of the change on the corporation.

           acquiring party shall submit information regarding its

           stability of a domestic insurer when a corporate

           consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make
           any other material change in its business or corporate
           structure or management, are fair and reasonable to
           the policyholders of the domestic company.  Briefly
           outline any intended business relationship between the
           company to be acquired and the acquiring party or any
           affiliate of the acquiring party.  For purposes of
           this Item a change in business operations or corporate
           structure or management shall be deemed material where
           it is likely that a reasonable corporate officer would

           overall impact of the change on the corporation.

ITEM 18.   Qualifications of the Managing Persons

           Briefly describe the competence, experience and
           integrity of those persons who would manage the
           operation of the domestic company so as to show that
           the change of control would not be adverse to the
           policyholders of the domestic company and of the
           insurance buying public.

ITEM 19.   Signature and Certification

           Signature and Certification shall be in the following

     a)  An insurer required to file a statement pursuant to
         Section 131.13 of the Illinois Insurance Code shall
         furnish the required information in the format and as
         specified in the instructions contained in Form B which
         is Illustration A to this Part.  The insurer is to

         amendment to the Form B.

     b)  An annual filing shall be made on or before each May 1st
         in the format of Form B containing current information

              days after the end of any month in which the
              following occurs:

               A)  there is a change in the control of the

              insurer pursuant to Section 131.14 of the Insurance
              Code.  A registration statement may include
              information regarding any insurer in the insurance
              holding company system even if such insurer is not
              authorized to do business in this State.  In lieu

              file a copy of the registration statement or
              similar report which the authorized insurer is
              required to file in its State of domicile provided:

               A)  the statement or report contains substantially
                   similar information required to be furnished
                   on Form B. The report or statement shall be
                   deemed substantially similar when a Department
                   analyst can reasonably make the same
                   determinations regarding the information
                   contained in the report or statement as the
                   analyst does for Form B filings made by
                   domestic insurers; and

               B)  the filing insurer demonstrates that such
                   insurer is the principal insurance company in
                   the insurance holding company system.  The
                   principal insurer shall be the insurer which:

                    i)   has the most admitted assets; or

                    ii)  has the most insurance in force; or

                    iii) has the most premium volume on an
                         annualized basis; or

                    iv)  is the insurer that controls all other
                         insurers.

          2)  The question of whether the filing insurer is the
              principal insurance company in the insurance
              holding company system as defined in Section
              131.1(c) of the Illinois Insurance Code, is a
              question of fact and an insurer filing a
              registration statement or report in lieu of Form B
              on behalf of an affiliated insurer, shall, when
              required by the Director set forth a brief
              statement of facts which will substantiate the
              filing insurer's claim that it, in fact, is the
              principal insurer in the insurance holding company
              system.

          3)  With the prior approval of the Director, an
              unauthorized insurer  which is the principal
              insurer may follow any of the procedures which
              could be done by an authorized insurer under
              subparagraph (d)(1) above.

     e)  Exemptions

          1)  A foreign or alien insurer otherwise subject to
              this Section shall not be required to register
              pursuant to Section 131.13 of the Illinois
              Insurance Code if:

               A)  it is admitted in the domiciliary State of the
                   principal insurer (as the term is defined in
                   subsection (d)(2) of this Section) and in said
                   State is subject to disclosure requirements
                   and standards adopted by statute or regulation
                   which are substantially similar to those
                   contained in Sections 131.13 through 131.19 of
                   the Illinois Insurance Code, provided that the
                   Director may require a copy of the
                   registration statement or other information
                   filed with the domiciliary State; and

               B)  it has filed, as an attachment to its Annual
                   Statement filed with the Illinois Department
                   of Insurance, an affidavit setting forth, in
                   the format designated by the affidavit form
                   which is Illustration B of this Part, that it
                   filed on its behalf a registration statement
                   substantially similar to the statement
                   required under Sections 131.13 through 131.19
                   of the Illinois Insurance Code.

          2)  The State of entry of an alien insurer shall be
              deemed to be its domiciliary State for the purpose
              of this Part.

     f)  Disclaimers and Termination of Registration

          1)  A disclaimer or a request for termination of
              registration, claiming that a person does not or
              will not upon the taking of some proposed action,
              control any other person (hereinafter referred to
              as the "subject") shall contain the following
              information:

               A)  the number of authorized, issued and
                   outstanding voting securities of the subject;

               B)  with respect to the person whose control is
                   denied and all affiliates of such person:

                    i)   the number and percentage of shares of
                         the subject's voting securities which
                         are held of record or known to be
                         beneficially owned, and the number of
                         such shares concerning which there is a
                         right to acquire, directly or
                         indirectly;

                    ii)  information as to all transactions in
                         any voting securities of the subject
                         which were effected during the past six
                         months by such persons.

               C)  All relationships and basis for affiliation
                   between the subject and the person whose
                   control is denied and all affiliates of such
                   person.

               D)  A statement explaining why such person would
                   not be considered to control the subject.

          2)  A request for termination of registration shall be
              deemed to have been granted unless the Director,
              within 30 days after he receives the request,
              notifies the registrant otherwise. Such request
              will be granted provided that the request is in
              compliance with the requirements of Article VIII
              1/2 of the Insurance Code and this regulation.

 
Section 852.40  Summary of Changes to Registration Statement
 
An insurer required to file a statement pursuant to Section
131.13 of the Illinois Insurance Code shall also file a summary
of changes to the registration statement in the format and as
specified in Form C, which is Illustration C of this Part.  A
Summary of Changes to the Registration Statement must be filed
simultaneously with the annual registration statement filed
pursuant to 50 Ill. Adm. code 852.30(c).

 
Section 852.ILLUSTRATION A  Insurance Holding Company System Registration Statement - Initial, Annual or Amendment
 
                             FORM B
                      GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

     A.  Use of Form B

         Form B shall be used by an insurer required to file a

         amendments also shall be filed on Form B, but shall
         include on the top of the cover sheet "Amendments
         No.______ to" and shall indicate the date of the
         amendment and not the date of the original filing.

          1)  Two complete copies of each statement, including
              exhibits and all other papers and documents filed
              as a part thereof, shall be filed with the
              Director.  If a consolidated filing is made to
              amend the individual registration statement of more
              than one insurer, a complete copy of such an
              amendment shall be filed for each insurer.

          2)  Each statement filed with the Director shall be
              manually signed in the manner prescribed by this
              form.  If the signature of any person is affixed
              pursuant to a power of attorney or other similar
              authority, a copy of such power of attorney or
              other authority shall also be filed with the
              statement.

     B.  Requirements as to Printing and Language

          1)  All filed statements, papers or documents shall be
              clear, readable and suitable for photocopying.
              Debits in credit categories and credits in debit
              categories shall be designated in a manner other
              than color so as to be distinguishable on
              photocopies.

          2)  Statements shall be in the English language and
              monetary values shall be stated in United States
              currency.  If any exhibit or other paper or
              document filed with a statement is in a foreign
              language, it shall be accompanied by a translation
              into the English language and any monetary value
              shown in a foreign currency shall be converted into
              United States currency.  Monetary conversions made
              in financial statements shall be made as of the
              date of financial statements.  Other required
              conversions shall be made as of the date of the
              Form B cover page.

     C.  Preparation of Statement

         This form is not to be used as a blank form to be filled
         in, but only as a guide in the preparation of the
         statement.

         The statement shall contain the numbers and captions of
         all items but the text of the items may be omitted
         provided the answers thereto are so prepared as to
         indicate to the reader the coverage of the items without
         the necessity of his referring to the text of the items
         or instructions thereof.  All instructions, whether
         appearing under the items of the form or elsewhere
         therein, are to be omitted.  Unless expressly provided
         otherwise within this Part, if any item is inapplicable
         or the answer thereto is in the negative, a statement to
         that effect shall be made.

     D.  Additional Information

         In addition to the information expressly required to be
         included in the statement, there may, at the option of
         the acquiring party, be added such further material
         information, if any, as may be necessary to make the
         information contained therein not misleading.

     E.  Information Unknown or Not Available

         Information required need be given only insofar as it is
         known or reasonably available to the Registrant.  If any
         required information is unknown and not reasonably
         available to the Registrant, either because the
         obtaining thereof would involve unreasonable effort or
         expense, or because it rests peculiarly within the
         knowledge of another person not affiliated with the
         Registrant, the information may be omitted, subject to
         the following conditions:

          1)  The Registrant shall give such information on the
              subject as it possesses or can acquire without
              unreasonable effort or expense including by not
              limited to impossibility or the loss or destruction
              of documents, together with the source thereof.

          2)  The Registrant shall include a statement either
              showing that unreasonable effort or expense would
              be involved or indicating the absence of any
              affiliation with the person within whose knowledge
              the information rests and stating the result of a
              request made to such person for the information.

     F.  Incorporation by Reference

          1)  Matters required by any item of this statement, may
              be incorporated by reference in answer or partial
              answer to any other item.

          2)  Information contained in a statement filed pursuant
              to the Federal Securities Act of 1933, the Federal
              Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or a state law
              requiring registration or disclosure and
              information contained in any financial statement,
              annual report, proxy statement or any other
              document may be incorporated by reference in any
              answer or partial answer to any item or items of
              this statement, provided such information meets the
              requirements of this statement.  A copy of such
              incorporated documents shall be included on an
              exhibit to Form A.

          3)  Material incorporated by reference shall be clearly
              identified in the reference.  An express statement
              that the specified matter is incorporated by
              reference shall be made at that particular place in
              the statement where the information is required.
              Matter shall not be incorporated by reference in
              any case where such incorporation would render the
              statement incomplete, unclear or confusing.

     G.  Summaries or Outlines of Documents

         Where an item requires a summary or outline of the
         provisions of any document, only a brief statement shall
         be made as to the most important provisions of the
         document.  In addition to such statement, the summary or
         outline may incorporate by reference particular parts of
         any exhibit and may be qualified in its entirety by such
         reference.

     H.  Extension of Time for Furnishing Information

         If it is impractical to furnish any required
         information, document or report at the time it is
         required to be filed, the Registrant may file with the
         Director as a separate document an application (l)
         identifying the information, document or report in
         question (2) stating why the filing thereof at the time
         required is impractical, and (3) requesting an extension
         of time for filing the information, document or report
         to a specified date.  The application shall be deemed
         granted unless the Director, within thirty (30) days
         after receipt thereof, shall enter an order denying the
         application.

         Information required need to be given only insofar as it
         is known or reasonably available to the registrant.  If
         any required information is unknown and not reasonably
         available to the registrant, either because the
         obtaining thereof would involve unreasonable effort or
         expense, or because it rests peculiarly within the
         knowledge of another person not affiliated with the
         registrant, the information may be omitted, subject to
         the following conditions:

          1)  The registrant shall given such information on the
              subject as it possesses or can acquire without
              reasonable effort or expense including but not
              limited to impossibility or the loss or destruction
              of documents, together with the sources thereof.

          2)  The registrant shall include a statement either
              showing that unreasonable effort or expense would
              be involved or indicating the absence of any
              affiliation with the person or indicating the
              absence of any affiliation with the person within
              whose knowledge the information rests and stating
              the result of a request made to such person for the
              information.

     I.  Additional Exhibits

         The Registrant may file such exhibits as it may desire,
         in addition to those expressly required by the
         statement.  Such exhibits shall be so marked as to
         indicate clearly the subject matters to which they
         refer.

     J.  Omission of Substantially Identical Documents

         In any case where two or more documents required to be
         filed as exhibits are substantially identical in all
         material aspects except as to the parties thereto, the
         dates of execution, or other details, the registrant
         need file a copy of only one of such documents, with a
         schedule identifying the omitted documents and setting
         forth the material details in which such documents
         differ from the documents a copy of which is filed.  The
         Director may at any time in his discretion require the
         filing of copies of any omitted documents in order to
         verify that the omitted documents are substantially
         identical to documents on file. For purposes of this
         Instruction, documents will be deemed substantially
         similar in all material aspects when a Department
         analyst, upon examining the documents independently,
         could reasonably make the same determinations and
         decisions regarding the documents.

     K.  Financial Statements

         The financial statements shall include the annual
         financial statements of each ultimate controlling person
         in the insurance holding company system as of the end of
         the person's latest fiscal year.  If at the time of the
         initial registration the annual financial statements for
         the previous fiscal year are not available, annual
         statements for the previous fiscal year shall, unless
         previously filed by amendment, be filed and similar
         financial information consisting of balance sheet,
         operational statement and a statement of source and
         application of funds shall be filed for any subsequent
         period to the extent such information is available.  The
         financial statements are to be audited by an independent
         certified public accountant in accordance with generally
         accepted auditing standards and are to contain financial
         information presented in accordance with generally
         accepted accounting principles.  If the ultimate
         controlling person is an insurer which has been actively
         engaged in the business of insurance for the previous 10
         years, the financial statements need not be audited,
         provided they are based on the Annual Statement of such
         insurer filed with the insurance department of the
         insurer's domiciliary State and are in accordance with
         requirements of insurance or other accounting principles
         prescribed or permitted under law and regulations of
         such state.

     L.  Shareholder Reports and Proxy Material

         Exhibits shall include copies of the latest annual
         reports to shareholders of the ultimate controlling
         person and any proxy material used by the ultimate
         controlling person during the preceding year.

     M.  Signature and Certification

         For purpose of filing the Form B and Form C, the
         signatures and certifications required by this Part
         shall be signed by an executive officer of the
         registrant.

     N.  Filing Fee

         Pursuant to Section 408 of the Illinois Insurance Code
         (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 73, par. 1020), the Director
         shall collect a fee for the filing of a registration
         statement.  The filing of the registration statement
         shall not be deemed complete until the Director has
         received the appropriate filing fee as required by
         Section 408.

                             FORM B

                   INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION
                             FORM B

         Filed with the Insurance Department of the State of

         information required by Illustration A, Form D-2 of this Part.
         Supplemental information required by the Director may include but
         is not limited to:  a statement in narrative form of the effects
         of the proposed dividends on the company's most recent Management
         Discussion and Analysis; a statement of financial position; a
         statement of operations; a statement of cash flows; a statement of
         changes in capital and surplus accounts; a statement in schedule
         form of risk-based capital requirements; and a statement of
         significant trends in reinsurance programs, premium volume and/or
         mix, losses, benefits, and general expenses.

     e)  For the purposes of the Department's review of proposed dividend
         payments, the factors set forth in Section 131.20(2) of the
         Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/131.20(2)] are not intended to
         be an exhaustive list.  In determining the adequacy and
         reasonableness of an insurer's surplus, no single factor shall be
         controlling.  The Director, instead, will consider the net effect
         of all these factors plus any other factors bearing on the
         financial condition of the insurer.  In comparing the surplus,
         maintained by other insurers, the Director will consider the
         extent to which each of the factors varies from company to company
         and, in determining the quality and liquidity  of investments in
         subsidiaries, the Director will consider the individual subsidiary
         and may discount or disallow its valuation to the extent that the
         individual investments warrant.

Section 901.5  Introduction
 
No domestic company shall destroy any books, records, documents,
accounts or vouchers, hereafter referred to as "records", except
in conformity with the requirements of this Part.

 
Section 901.10  Definitions
 
         "Non-Record" material means:

              Material not filed as evidence of the company's
              administrative or business activities or for the
              informational content thereof;

              Extra copies of documents or reproductions of
              documents maintained for convenience or reference;
              Stocks of printed or reproduced documents kept for
              supply purposes, where file copies have been
              retained for record purposes;

              Books, periodicals, newspapers, posters, pamphlets
              and other materials made or acquired and preserved
              solely for reference or exhibition purposes;

              Private materials neither made nor received by a
              company pursuant to law or in connection with the
              transaction of its business;

              Company dailies more than six (6) months after
              expiry or cancellation date of the policy if the
              data therein contained is, to the extent material
              or necessary to the determination of the financial
              condition of the company, contained in other
              records.

         "Records" material means all books, papers and
         documentary materials regardless of physical form or
         characteristics, made, produced, executed or received by
         any domestic insurance company pursuant to law or in
         connection with the transaction of its business and
         preserved or appropriate for preservation by such
         company or its successors as evidence of the
         organization, function, policies, decisions, procedures,
         obligations and business activities of the company or
         because of the informational data contained therein. If
         doubt arises as to whether certain papers are
         "non-record" materials, it should be assumed that the
         documents are "records".

         Non-Record materials may be destroyed at any time by the
         company in possession of such materials without the
         prior approval of the Director of Insurance.

 
Section 901.20  Procedures for Compiling and Submitting Lists and Schedules of Records for Destruction
 
     a)  The company shall submit to the Director lists or
         schedules of records in its custody that are not needed
         in the transaction of current business or for the final
         settlement or disposition of any claim arising out of a
         policy of insurance issued by the company and are not
         required to determine the financial condition of the
         company for the period since the date of the last
         examination report of the company officially filed with
         the Department of Insurance and that do not have
         sufficient administrative legal or fiscal value to
         warrant their further preservation, or that the
         retention of the records is an unnecessary expense to
         the company and such records serve no useful purpose.

          1)  Lists are applications for authority to destroy
              accumulated records.

          2)  Schedules are applications for continuing authority
              to destroy records after specified periods of time
              or the occurrence of specified events.

     b)  New schedules are required whenever the informational
         contents of a  records series are changed.

     c)  Duplicate copies of all requests for authority to
         destroy records, accompanied by lists or schedules of
         such records, shall be submitted to the Director of
         Insurance at the offices of the Department in
         Springfield, Illinois, attached to duplicate executed
         copies of the following form of Affidavit:

                            AFFIDAVIT

of the State of Illinois; that, as to scheduled records
containing any information necessary to the determination of the

Department of Insurance of the State of Illinois; that listed
records do not contain any information necessary for the final
settlement or disposition of any claim arising out of any policy

against all matters to which listed records may pertain and that
no scheduled records will be destroyed if prior to the time
scheduled for destruction the Company receives notice that the
Statute of Limitations has not run against matters to which the
records may pertain; that no listed records are required to be
retained in order to determine the financial condition of the
Company or to verify the condition of the Company as stated in
any annual statement filed subsequent to the date of the last

become material in the future for the determination of the
financial condition of the Company.

records, to save unnecessary expense of unwarranted preservation,
and for no other purpose.

     a)  Joint Expenses

          1)  Whenever personnel or facilities are used in common
              by two or more companies, or whenever the personnel
              or facilities of one company are used in the
              activities of two or more companies, the expenses
              involved shall be apportioned in accordance with
              the regulations relating to Joint Expenses,
              (Section 903.310) and such apportioned expenses
              shall be allocated by each company to the same
              operating expense classifications as if the
              expenses had been borne wholly.  Any difference
              between the actual amount paid, and the amount of
              such apportioned expenses shall be included in the
              operating expense classification "Miscellaneous".

          2)  This instruction does not apply to the allocation
              of the following, which are covered by separate
              instructions herein:

               A)  Reinsurance commission and allowances (see
                   Commission and Brokerage-Reinsurance Assumed
                   and Ceded).

               B)  Commission and brokerage paid to managers and
                   agents (see Commission and Brokerage-Direct).

               C)  Allowances to managers and agents (see
                   Allowances to Managers and Agents).

               D)  Expenses allocable in accordance with the
                   instruction "Income from Special Services".

     b)  Expenses for Account of Another

         Whenever expenses are paid by one company for account of
         another, the payments shall not appear among the
         expenses reported by the former, and shall be included
         by the latter in the same expense classifications as if
         originally paid by it.

     c)  Income from Special Services

          1)  Whenever an insurance company receives compensation
              for sales or services, such as loss adjustment or
              inspection not related to policies written by the
              company, and such compensation is not calculated as
              a joint expense reimbursement, the amount thereof
              shall be included in the operating expense
              classification "Miscellaneous".  Where an insurance
              company pays the compensation, allocation shall be
              made to the expense classification dictated by the
              nature of the expense.

          2)  This instruction is of limited applicability and
              does not apply to the allocation of the following,
              which are covered by separate instructions herein:

               A)  Reinsurance commission and allowances (see
                   Commission and Brokerage-Reinsurance Assumed
                   and Ceded).

               B)  Expenses incurred for the benefit of companies
                   in the same group or fleet.  Such expenses are
                   covered by the Instruction "Joint Expenses"
                   (Section 903.310).

     d)  Analogous Items

         The lists of expenses includible in the operating
         expense classifications are representative and do not
         exclude analogous items which are omitted from the

              applicable and appropriate to the expense group of
              which such expense is a part.

          3)  Example - Expenses which are allocated to lines of
              business as an Overhead on Salaries shall be
              calculated in relation only to the salaries
              included in the same expense group.

              susceptible of direct and accurate allocation, and
              companies shall allocate directly to lines of
              business and shall not employ any apportionments or
              estimations.

          2)  For definitions of the terms Special Studies,
              Premiums and Overhead on Salaries, see Subpart B,
              Section 903.310(b).

     c)  Other Bases Permitted or Prescribed

         For those expense classifications permitting the basis
         Overhead on Salaries or Premiums, any other basis of
         allocation may be adopted which yields more accurate
         results.  The bases Overhead on Salaries and Premiums
         shall not be used if clearly inappropriate.

     d)  Other Instructions Applicable

         In making any allocations to lines of business,
         companies shall observe the General Instructions
         Regarding Allocation Bases (see Subpart E, Section
         903.620)

     e)  Records Required

         The methods followed in allocating to lines of business
         shall be described, kept and supported as set forth
         under Detail of Allocation Bases (see Subpart E, Section
         903.630(g)).

     f)  The effects of the application to each operating expense

         on records kept in clear and legible form.  Such records
         shall be readily available for examination.

          SUBPART E:  SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS RELATING TO
          THE ALLOCATION OF SALARIES AND OTHER EXPENSES
                                

 
Section 903.610  General Procedures in Allocating Salaries
 
     a)  Direct Allocations

         Wherever possible, salaries of individuals or similarly
         employed groups shall be allocated direct to companies,
         expense groups and primary lines of business.  In other
         words, salaries of employees whose work is solely in
         connection with a specific company, expense group or
         line of business shall be allocated thereto.

     b)  Allocations Other Than Direct

          1)  When a direct allocation is not made, salaries,
              with certain exceptions hereinafter noted, shall be
              allocated on whichever of the following bases, or
              combinations thereof, are appropriate:

               A)  Number of Items or Units

               B)  Time Studies

               C)  Overhead on Other Allocations

               D)  Premiums

               E)  Dollar Volume of Losses

               F)  Other Special Studies

          2)  All bases of allocation, and the application
              thereof, shall be subject to restrictions,
              modifications and exceptions in the General
              Instructions Regarding Allocation Bases which
              follow.

 
Section 903.620  General Instructions Regarding Allocation Bases
 
     a)  Number of Items or Units

          1)  Item and unit counts may include the following:

               A)  Number of Premium Entries

               B)  Number of Policies

               C)  Number of Loss Entries

               D)  Number of Accidents

               E)  Number of Employees

              and any other unit or item counts which aid in the
              allocation of expenses.  To the greatest practical
              extent, such unit or item counts shall be applied
              only to expenses incurred in activities having a
              direct relationship to the bases.

          2)  In determining the applicability of Number of
              Premium Entries as a basis of allocation,
              consideration shall be given to the number of
              premiums on original policies plus additional
              premiums, return premiums, reinsurance premiums,
              and return premiums on reinsurance.  Where more
              than one card is punched or more than one entry is
              made covering only one amount, consideration shall
              be given thereto.  Consideration shall also be
              given to the effect on cost of procedural
              differences in connection with types of entries.

          3)  In determining the applicability of Number of
              Policies as a basis of allocation, consideration
              shall be given to policies underlying another
              policy, to policies covering more than one line of
              business, to policies for various terms, and to the
              effect on cost of procedural differences in
              connection with types of policies.

          4)  In determining the applicability of Number of Loss
              Entries as a basis of allocation, consideration
              shall be given to the number of gross entries plus
              salvage entries and reinsurance entries, for paid
              or outstanding losses, or both, and to the effect
              on cost of procedural differences in connection
              with types of loss entries.

          5)  In determining the applicability of Number of
              Accidents as a basis of allocation, consideration
              shall be given to accidents on which specific
              estimates are set up, those on which no specific
              estimate is made, and those for which no claim is
              made, and to the effect on cost of procedural
              differences in connection with types of accidents.

          6)  The basis Number of Employees is of limited
              application and shall be used only where the cost
              logically follows the number of employees.  It may
              be of use, where properly weighted, in allocating
              such units as cafeteria, personnel department, and
              payroll department.

     b)  Time Studies

         Time studies are actual measurements of time required to
         make motions, to complete a routine of regularly
         occurring procedure.  In contemplating the use of a time
         study as a basis of allocation, consideration shall be
         given to the  number of motions which must be studied to
         obtain a valid average and to possible distortions in
         the average caused by exceptional conditions during the
         study.

     c)  Overhead on Other Allocations

         Salaries of supervisors and executives may be
         distributed as an overhead on the salaries of employees
         whom they supervise.  Salaries of departments such as
         mail and general stenographic may be distributed as an
         overhead on the salaries of people whose work is
         handled.  However, no salaries shall be distributed as
         an overhead on other allocations if any other basis is
         more appropriate.

     d)  Premiums

          1)  Premiums shall not be used as a basis of allocation
              except when specifically noted as a permissible
              basis or when the expense is incurred as a
              percentage of premiums (subject to instructions
              under Commission and Allowances in Subpart C,
              Section 903.420(c)(2)), or when the expenses are
              logically allocable on the basis of premiums.  In
              no event shall premiums be used as a basis of
              allocation in connection with clerical, technical,
              secretarial, office maintenance, supervisory and
              executive activities unless such basis is clearly
              appropriate and until all other reasonable bases of
              allocation have been considered and found less
              appropriate than premiums.

          2)  In determining the applicability of premiums as a
              basis of allocation, consideration shall be given
              to the applicability of direct and reinsurance
              premiums, and written, earned and unearned
              premiums, as well as to subdivisions thereof.

     e)  Dollar Volume of Losses

          1)  Dollar Volume of Losses shall be used as a basis of
              allocation only when the activities resulting in
              expense are influenced by the dollar amounts of
              losses, and only when all other reasonable bases of
              allocation have been considered and found less
              appropriate than Dollar Volume of Losses.

          2)  In determining the applicability of Dollar Volume
              of Losses as a basis of allocation, consideration
              shall be given to the applicability of direct and
              reinsurance losses, and paid, incurred and
              outstanding losses as well as to subdivisions
              thereof.

     f)  Other Special Studies

         Salaries may be allocated on the basis of other special
         studies, provided demonstrably more accurate results are
         thereby produced than through the use of the bases
         heretofore discussed, but not otherwise.

     g)  Weightings

         Weightings may be applied in using any bases of
         allocation but the justification for such weightings
         shall be stated in the Detail of Allocation Bases (see
         Subpart E, Section 903.630(g)).  Weightings shall not be
         used as a means for giving effect to a basis which is
         prohibited by these instructions.

     h)  Bases Shall Be Appropriate

          1)  The bases of allocation used shall be appropriate
              and applicable to the expenses to which such bases
              are applied.  All bases shall be limited and
              subdivided in such manner that the expenses to
              which the bases are applied have a reasonable
              relationship to each component of the bases.  For
              example, an allocation basis which includes a
              particular line of business shall not be applied to
              expenses incurred for activities which do not
              include that line.
          2)  Any basis of allocation which is found to be
              inappropriate shall be discontinued.
     i)  General Work On Totals
         Where an individual or a group of employees work on
         totals, the allocation of the expenses involved may be
         based on the information entering into the totals.
     j)  Bases Shall Be Made In Current Period
         All bases of allocation shall be compiled or calculated
         from the transactions or procedures for the period
         applicable to the expenses to be allocated, unless the
         use of any other period is justified by investigation
         made during the applicable period.  Such justification
         shall be set forth on the Detail of Allocation Bases
         (see Subpart E, Section 903.630(g)).

 
Section 903.630  Special Statements and Records Required
 
     a)  The following types of records shall be prepared by each
         company or  fleet in allocating salaries to companies,
         expense groups and primary lines of business:

          1)  Allocation of Salaries

          2)  Recapitulation of Salaries

          3)  Detail of Allocation Bases

     b)  The Allocation of Salaries and the Recapitulation of
         Salaries shall be prepared,

          1)  for the twelve months of the current calendar year,
              or

          2)  for twelve months ending not earlier than September
              30th of the current year, in which case the ratios
              established shall be applied to the total salaries
              for the twelve months of the current calendar year.
              The method of (2) shall not be followed if
              operations during the period used were materially
              different from operations during the period to
              which the ratios are to be applied.  All amounts
              included in the operating expense classification
              Salaries, for the period used in preparing the
              Allocation of Salaries and the Recapitulation of
              Salaries shall be accounted for on such records.

     c)  Forms of the records are shown hereinafter.  The forms
         may be of any convenient size, and may be entered in
         ink, type, or by other mechanical means, provided the
         entries are legible.  If the organization or method of
         operation of any company is such as to make desirable
         changes in the forms such as a rearrangement of the
         columns, or a separation of the forms into two or more
         parts, such changes may be made, provided the
         substituted forms do not, in any respect, show less
         information than called for on the forms shown herein,
         and do not result in confusing the presentation of
         salary allocation.

     d)  Such records shall be maintained in good order and shall
         at all times be readily available for examination.

     e)  Allocation Of Salaries Form

          1)  The form, Allocation of Salaries, is shown on the
              preceding page.  To aid in the understanding of the
              form, specimen entries have been made thereon and,
              as further aids to understanding, each column is
              explained in the following paragraphs:

               A)  Column 1:

                    i)   List each similarly employed unit within
                         each departmental or other division in
                         the organization.  By "similarly
                         employed" is meant employed in
                         essentially the same or similar
                         activities in or for the same
                         departmental or other division.

                    ii)  The personnel shall be divided into as
                         many units as necessary to show each
                         type of work done by each departmental
                         or other division in the organization.
                         Employees whose duties are not solely
                         related to the work performed by one
                         unit, such as some in supervisory
                         positions, shall be listed separately by
                         title or job classification.

               B)  Column 2:  Gross salaries applicable to each
                   unit shown in Column 1.

               C)  Columns 3, 4 and 5:

                    i)   These columns are for use when the
                         Salaries classification is affected by
                         allocations made to other companies.

                    ii)  A separate line is to be used for the
                         allocation to each company or group of
                         companies.  When intercompany
                         allocations are not made, or when quota
                         share percentages can be applied to
                         fleet totals, Columns 3,4 and 5 need not
                         be used.

                    iii) Designating numbers shall be entered in
                         Column 4 for the methods used in
                         intercompany allocations.

               D)  Column 6:  Designating numbers shall be
                   entered in this column for the methods used in
                   allocating salaries to expense groups.

               E)  Columns 7 to 10:  The amounts assigned to each
                   expense group shall be in accordance with the
                   method shown in Column 6.  At the side of each
                   expense group column (except the column
                   Investment Expenses) is shown a narrow column
                   captioned "Line Distribution", wherein shall
                   be entered designating numbers for the methods
                   to be followed in distributing salaries to
                   primary lines of business.

          2)  Pool and Quota Share Reinsurance

              When quota share reinsurance is in effect and when
              salaries may be allocated in strict accordance with
              the quota share percentages, the amounts shown in
              the Allocation of Salaries Form may be those
              subject to quota share.  Quota share percentages
              may, in such cases, be applied to the totals either
              on the Allocation of Salaries or the Recapitulation
              of Salaries.

          3)  Branch and Field

              Branch office salaries shall be shown separately in
              the Allocation of Salaries and in the
              Recapitulation of Salaries.  In combining branch
              employees into similarly employed units, it shall
              be permissible to consider as a unit all similarly
              employed personnel in all branch offices having
              similar functions, and handling approximately the
              same relative volume of each line of business.

          4)  Salary Reimbursements to Other Companies

              Due to expense sharing with another company,
              outside of the company or fleet, debits may appear
              in the salary accounts for reimbursements to
              outside companies.  Such payments are to be shown
              under separate caption in the Allocation of
              Salaries.  Where such payments amount to less than
              10% of gross salaries paid by the company to its
              own employees, the amounts shown on the Allocation
              of Salaries may be distributed as an overhead on
              all other salary distributions. If more than 10%,
              the distribution shall be obtained from the other
              company.

          5)  Salaries Not Specifically Reimbursable

              When the employees of a company devote time to the
              affairs of another company, and the reimbursements
              therefor are handled in accordance with the
              instructions, Expenses for Account of Another or
              Income from Special Services (see Subpart b,
              Section 903.220(b) and (c)), the salaries for each
              similarly employed unit applicable to work done for
              such other company shall be shown separately on the
              Allocation of Salaries (in Columns 3 to 10 incl.).

     f)  Recapitulation of Salaries Form

          1)  When all distributions called for on the Allocation
              of Salaries Form have been completed, the
              Recapitulation of Salaries shall be made.

          2)  For each company to which salaries have been
              allocated on the Allocation of Salaries Form, the
              amounts shown in each expense group column shall be
              combined by the line distribution codes shown in
              the "Line Distribution" columns.  The totals thus
              obtained shall be entered on the Recapitulation of
              Salaries Form and allocated to primary lines of
              business in accordance with the line distribution
              codes.

          3)  The forms, Recapitulation of Salaries, are shown on
              the preceding page.

          4)  Although presented on one page, there are three
              separate forms, one for Loss Adjustment Expenses,
              another for Acquisition, Field Supervision and
              Collection Expenses, and another for General
              Expenses.  For purposes of illustration, the
              specimen entries, applicable to Company A, made on
              the Allocation of Salaries Form have been continued
              on the Recapitulation of Salaries Form.  Note that,
              for Company A, the figures in the expense group
              columns on the Allocation of Salaries Form have
              been combined by "Line Distribution" codes, entered
              on the Recapitulation of Salaries Form, and then
              spread to primary lines of business based on the
              "Line Distribution" codes.

     g)  Detail of Allocation Bases Form

          1)  The bases of allocation used on the Allocation of
              Salaries Form shall be fully described on the
              Detail of Allocation Bases Form.  There shall be a
              separate sheet for each basis and the sheets shall
              be kept in consecutive numerical order, available
              at all times for examination.

          2)  When the basis of allocation cannot be fully
              described on the form,  subsidiary worksheets,
              compilations and data shall be either attached to
              the form or filed separately and readily available.

          3)  The Detail of Allocation Bases Form and all
              subsidiary worksheets, compilations and data shall
              be clear and legible; shall show the sources,
              detail and dates of all figures used; shall
              disclose the names of persons or groups responsible
              for all compilations, data, calculations, studies,
              estimates, judgment factors, weightings, etc., and
              the dates thereof; and, in general shall include
              complete explanations of all figures used and
              decisions made.

          4)  Note:  The Detail of Allocation Bases Form need not
              be prepared each year, but with appropriate changes
              in supporting worksheets, etc., may remain current
              as long as the bases are in effect.

          5)  Four illustrations of the Detail of Allocation
              Bases Form are shown on the pages which follow.
              The allocation bases No. 1, 101, 105 and 501 shown
              on the Allocation of Salaries Form have been
              carried into the forms and specimen explanations
              given.

              (Editor's Note:  The illustrations referred to were
              omitted from Rule 9.03 (now 50 Ill. Adm. Code 903)
              as filed July 11, 1958.  The Department of
              Insurance has advised that the specimen material
              intended by the rules may be found in "Instructions
              for Uniform classifications of Expenses of
              Fire-Marine-Casualty-Surety Insurers Effective
              January 1, 1949 (NAIC Proc. 1949 pp. 42-125)"
              together with official NAIC amendments thereto and
              interpretations thereof.)

Section 904.5  Authority and Purpose
 
     a)  The following Rule is promulgated and adopted pursuant
         to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 401
         of the Illinois Insurance Code.

     b)  All domestic insurance companies as well as domestic
         nonprofit hospital service corporations, medical service
         plan corporations and health services plan corporations
         hereinafter referred to as "such companies" are hereby
         directed and required, either prior to effective date of
         this Rule as hereinafter fixed or as soon thereafter as
         possible, by resolution of the Board of Directors
         thereof or other appropriate action, to conform their
         internal functions to the following minimum standards:

 
Section 904.10  Registration of Securities
 
All bonds, stocks, notes, shares, debentures, evidences of
indebtedness, certificates of interest or participation,
certificates of deposit for a security and other securities,
whether negotiable or not, hereinafter referred to as "such
securities", belonging to or in the possession, custody or
control of any such company shall be registered, issued to, and

     a)  Transfer, sale, assignment or disposition of any

              followed pursuant to such authorization requires an
              officer or employee, other than the authorized
              signer, to approve such payment prior to the
              issuance of such check.

              requirements of subsection (a)(1) above are met,
              and further provided that:

               A)  The company has prepared a list of authorized
                   signers by name or job classification with
                   approved limits of authority for each
                   authorized signer.  This list must be approved
                   by the Board and a copy must be kept on file
                   and available for review by Department

                   accountants or the internal audit staff of the
                   company, provided such staff report directly

                   of Directors.  This compliance review must be
                   performed annually.

     b)  Facsimile signatures may be affixed to checks or drafts
         if such procedure has been authorized by the Board of
         Directors and adequate controls over the use of such
         signatures have been established.  Control procedures
         shall be reduced to writing and shall provide for
         written approval of the disbursement of funds by
         officers or employes other than those affixing such
         facsimile signatures, for supervision and policing of
         the machines or appliances used for affixing such
         signatures and for the recording of checks and drafts to
         which such signatures have been affixed.  Written
         control procedures shall be kept on file and available
         for review by examiners.

Section 906.10  Authorizations
 
     a)  No companies authorized to do business in Illinois shall
         give, offer, allow or make available to any insured a
         differentiation in rate or coverage in this State based
         solely upon membership in any group or association.
         This is in accordance with the Illinois Insurance Code
         which requires that filings of rates, rating plans or
         forms covering risks in this State shall not be unfairly
         discriminatory.

     b)  Furthermore, there are no enabling statutes in Illinois
         which authorize the writing of group fire, casualty,
         inland marine or surety insurance.  The effect of the
         Illinois Law is to require that all fire, casualty,
         inland marine or surety insureds of the same class shall
         be treated alike.

     c)  The regulation is not applicable where the Illinois
         Insurance Code specifically authorizes the grouping of
         risks.

Section 908.20  Recording of Premiums Collected
 
     a)  From and after the effective date of this Part, all
         receipts from premium collections entered on each
         company's records must be identifiable to a definite
         individual policy, endorsement, rider or other
         amendment, to indicate the allocation of the collection
         to an individual insured.

     b)  Listings, cards or other data must be maintained clearly
         identifying the individual policyholder on all accounts
         covering uncollected premiums or agents' balances, and
         the total of these subsidiary ledger records must
         balance to the general ledger uncollected premium
         (agents' balances) control account.  Detail shown on
         these subsidiary accounts must include individual policy
         numbers, net due per policy and the effective date

     c)  In computing over 90 day balances, the actual effective
         date of the policy, endorsement, rider or other
         amendment developing the premium charge shall govern.
         If any installment of any premium has been due and
         unpaid for more than ninety days at the date of

         shall be allowed as an admitted asset.

term "Gross Premium" in any particular case is defined as the
total amount charged the insured, excluding only the following:

     a)  policy and/or membership fees, when these charges appear

         under the company's approved rate filing; and

     b)  taxes where the Company acts only as a collection agency
         and the amounts collected clearly appear as separate
         charges on the policy.

Section 909.10  Authority
 
This Rule is issued by the Director of Insurance pursuant to
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981,
Ch. 73, par. 1013), which empowers the Director to make
reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for making
effective the insurance laws of this State.  The purpose of this
Rule is to set forth minimum standards and guidelines to assure a
full and truthful disclosure to the public of all material and
relevant information in the advertising of life insurance
policies and annuity contracts.  This Rule implements the
Illinois Insurance Code by defining acts and practices which
constitute a violation of one or more of the following sections
of the Illinois Insurance Code:  Sections 149, 151, 236, 237, 426
and 502 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, Ch. 73, pars. 761, 763, 848, 849,
1033 and 1065.49), which generally relate to the use of false or
misleading statements in the sale of insurance and which apply
variously to life insurance companies and to agents, brokers and
solicitors.

 
Section 909.20  Definitions
 
For the purpose of this Rule:

         "Advertisement" for the purpose of this Rule shall not
         include:

              communications or materials used within an
              insurer's own organization and not intended for
              dissemination to the public;
              communications with policyholders other than
              material urging policyholders  to purchase,
              increase, modify, reinstate or retain a policy;
              a general announcement from a group or blanket
              policyholder to eligible individuals on an
              employment or membership list that a policy or
              program has been written or arranged, provided the
              announcement clearly indicates that it is
              preliminary to the issuance of a booklet explaining
              the proposed coverage.

         "Advertisement" shall be material designed to create
         public interest in life insurance or annuities or in an
         insurer, or to induce the public to purchase, increase,
         modify, reinstate or retain a policy including:

              printed and published material, audio-visual
              material and descriptive literature of an insurer
              used in direct mail, newspapers, magazines, radio
              and television scripts, billboards and similar
              displays;

              descriptive literature and sales aids of all kinds
              issued by an insurer or agent, including but not
              limited to circulars, leaflets, booklets,
              depictions, illustrations and form letters;
              material used for the recruitment, training, and
              education of an insurer's sales personnel, agents,
              solicitors and brokers which is designed to be used
              or is used to induce the public to purchase,
              increase, modify, reinstate or retain a policy;
              prepared sales talks, presentations, and material
              for use by sales personnel, agents, solicitors and
              brokers.

         "Insurer" shall include any organization or person which
         issues life insurance or annuities to residents of this
         State.

         "Policy" shall include any policy, plan, certificate,
         contract, agreement, statement of coverage, rider or
         endorsement which provides for life insurance or annuity
         benefits.

         "Preneed Funeral Contract or Prearrangement" shall mean
         an arrangement by or for an individual before the
         individual's death relating to the purchase or provision
         of specific funeral or cemetary merchandise or services.

     (Source:  Amended at 14 Ill. Reg. 13584, effective August
         14, 1990) 

 
Section 909.30  Applicability
 
     a)  This Rule shall apply to any life insurance or annuity
         advertisement intended for dissemination in this State.

     b)  Every insurer shall establish and at all times maintain
         a system of control over the content, form and method of
         dissemination of its advertisements.  All such
         advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created,
         designed or presented, shall be the responsibility of
         the insurer.

 
Section 909.40  Form and Content of Advertisements
 
     a)  Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in
         fact or by implication.  The form and content of an
         advertisement shall be sufficiently complete and clear
         so as to avoid deception.  It shall not have the
         capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.  Whether an
         advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or
         deceive shall be determined by the Director of Insurance
         from the overall impression that the advertisement may
         be reasonably expected to create upon a person of
         average education or intelligence within the segment of
         the public to which it is directed.

     b)  No advertisement shall use the terms "investment,"
         "investment plan," "founder's plan," "charter plan,"
         "expansion plan," "profit," "profits," "profit sharing,
         " "interest plan," "savings," "savings plan," or other
         similar terms in connection with a policy in a context
         or under such circumstances of conditions as to have the
         capacity or tendency to mislead a purchaser or
         prospective purchaser of such policy to believe that he
         will receive, or that it is possible that he will
         receive, something other than a policy or some benefit
         not available to other persons of the same class and
         equal expectation of life.

 
Section 909.50  Disclosure Requirements
 
     a)  The information required to be disclosed by this Rule
         shall not be minimized, rendered obscure or presented in
         an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of
         the advertisement so as to be  confusing or misleading.

     b)  No advertisement shall omit material information or use
         words, phrases, statements, references or illustrations
         if such omission or such use has the capacity, tendency
         or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or
         prospective purchasers as to the nature or extent of the
         insurance, any policy benefit payable, loss covered,
         premium payable or state or federal tax consequences.
         The fact that the policy offered is made available to a
         prospective insured for inspection prior to consummation
         of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the premium
         if the purchaser is not satisfied, does not remedy
         misleading statements.

     c)  In the event an advertisement used "Non-Medical," "No
         Medical Examination Required" or similar terms where
         issue is not guaranteed, such terms shall be accompanied
         by a further disclosure of equal prominence and in
         juxtaposition thereto to the effect that issuance of the
         policy may depend upon the answers to the health
         questions.

     d)  An advertisement shall not use as the name or title of a
         life insurance policy or an annuity, any phrase which
         does not include the words "life insurance" or "annuity"
         unless accompanied by other language clearly indicating
         it is life insurance.

     e)  An advertisement shall prominently include the specific
         title of the type of the policy being marketed and such
         title shall not be misleading as to the policy benefits.

     f)  An advertisement of an insurance policy marketed by the
         direct response techniques shall not state or imply that
         because there is no agent or commission included, there
         will be a cost savings to prospective purchasers unless
         such is the fact.  No such cost savings may be stated or
         implied without justification satisfactory to the
         Insurance Director prior to use.

     g)  An advertisement for a policy containing graded or
         modified benefits shall prominently display any
         limitation of benefits.  If the premium is level and
         coverage decreases or increases with age or duration,
         such fact shall be prominently disclosed.

     h)  An advertisement for a policy with non-level premiums
         shall prominently describe the premium changes.

     i)  Dividends

          1)  An advertisement shall not utilize or describe
              dividends in a manner which is misleading or has
              the capacity or tendency to mislead.

          2)  An advertisement shall not state or imply that the
              payment or amount of dividends is guaranteed.  If
              dividends are illustrated they must be based on the
              insurer's current dividend scale and the
              illustration must contain a statement to the effect
              that they are not to be construed as guarantees or
              estimates of dividends to be paid in the future.

          3)  An advertisement shall not state or imply that
              illustrated dividends under a participating policy
              and/or pure endowments will be or can be sufficient
              at any future time to assure, without the further
              payment of premiums, the receipt of benefits, such
              as a paid-up policy, unless the advertisement
              clearly and precisely explains:

               A)  what benefits or coverage would be provided at
                   such time and

               B)  under what conditions this would occur.

     j)  An advertisement shall not state that a purchaser of a
         policy will share in or receive a stated percentage or
         portion of the earnings on the general account assets of
         the company.

     k)  Testimonials or Endorsements by Third Parties

          1)  Testimonials used in advertisements must be
              genuine; represent the current opinion of the
              author; be applicable to the policy advertised, if
              any; and be accurately reproduced.  In using a
              testimonial the insurer acknowledges as its own all
              of the statements contained therein, and such
              statements are subject to all the provisions of
              this Rule.

          2)  If the individual making a testimonial or an
              endorsement has a financial interest in the insurer
              or a related entity as a stockholder, director,
              officer, employee or otherwise, or receives any
              benefit directly or indirectly other than required
              union scale wages, such fact shall be disclosed in
              the advertisement.
          3)  An advertisement shall not state or imply that an
              insurer or policy has been approved or endorsed by
              a group of individuals, society, association or
              other organization unless such is the fact and
              unless any proprietary relationship between an
              organization and the insurer is disclosed.  If the
              entity making the endorsement or testimonial is
              owned, controlled or managed by the insurer, or
              receives any payment or other consideration from
              the insurer for making such endorsement or
              testimonial, such fact shall be disclosed in the
              advertisement.

     l)  An advertisement shall not contain statistical
         information relating to any insurer or policy unless it
         accurately reflects recent and relevant facts.  The
         source of any such statistics used in an advertisement
         shall be identified therein.

     m)  Introductory, Initial or Special Offers and Enrollment
         Periods

          1)  An advertisement of an individual policy or
              combination of such policies shall not state or
              imply that such policy or combination of such
              policies is an introductory, initial or special
              offer or that applicants will receive substantial
              advantages not available at a later date, or that
              the offer is available only to a specified group of
              individuals, unless such is the fact.  An
              advertisement  shall not describe an enrollment
              period as "special" or "limited" or use similar
              words or phrases in describing it when the insurer
              uses successive enrollment periods as its usual
              method of marketing its policies.

          2)  An advertisement shall not state or imply that only
              a specific number of policies will be sold, or that
              a time is fixed for the discontinuance of the sale
              of the particular policy advertised because of
              special advantages available in the policy.

          3)  An advertisement shall not offer a policy which
              utilizes a reduced initial rate in a manner which
              overemphasizes the availability and the amount of
              the initial premium.  When an insurer charges an
              initial premium that differs in amount from the
              amount of the renewal premium payable on the same
              mode, all references to the reduced initial premium
              shall be followed by an asterisk or other
              appropriate symbol which refers the reader to that
              specific portion of the advertisement that contains
              a full rate schedule for the policy being
              advertised.

          4)  An enrollment period during which a particular
              insurance policy may be purchased on an individual
              basis shall not be offered within this State unless
              there has been a lapse of not less than six months
              between the close of the immediately preceding
              enrollment period for the same policy and the
              opening of the  new enrollment period.  The
              advertisement shall specify the date by which the
              applicant must mail the application, which shall be
              not less than ten days and not more than forty days
              following the date on which such enrollment period
              is advertised for the first time.  This Rule
              applies to all advertising media: i.e., mail,
              newspapers, radio, television, magazines and
              periodicals, by any one insurer.  The phrase "any
              one insurer" includes all the affiliated companies
              of a group of insurance companies under common
              management or control.  This Rule does not  apply
              to the use of a termination or cut-off date beyond
              which an individual application for a guaranteed
              issue policy will not be accepted by an insurer in
              those instances where the application has been sent
              to the applicant in response to his request.  It is
              also inapplicable to solicitations to employees or
              members of a particular group or association which
              otherwise would be eligible under specific
              provisions of the Insurance Code for group or
              blanket insurance.  In cases where an insurance
              product is marketed on a direct mail basis to
              prospective insureds by reason of some common
              relationship with a sponsoring organization, this
              Rule shall be applied separately to such sponsoring
              organization.

     n)  An advertisement of a particular policy shall not state
         or imply that prospective insureds shall be or become
         members of a special class, group, or quasi-group and as
         such enjoy special rates, dividends or underwriting
         privileges, unless such is the fact.

     o)  An advertisement shall not make unfair or incomplete
         comparisons of policies, benefits, dividends or rates of
         other insurers.  An advertisement shall not falsely or
         unfairly describe other insurers, their policies,
         services or methods of marketing.

     p)  An advertisement for the solicitation or sale of a
         preneed funeral contract or prearrangement as defined in
         Section 909.20 above, which is funded or to be funded by
         a life insurance policy or annuity contract shall
         disclose the following:

          1)  the fact that a life insurance policy or annuity
              contract is involved or being used to fund a
              prearrangement as defined in Section 909.20, and

              merchandise or services, the administrator and any
              other persons,

              prearranged provider of funeral/cemetery
              merchandise and services upon the demise of the
              insured,

          4)  the fact that in the event the policy proceeds

         18, 1991) 

 
Section 909.60  Identity of Insurer
 
     a)  The name of the insurer shall be clearly identified, and
         if any specific individual policy is advertised it shall
         be identified either by form number or other appropriate
         description.  An advertisement shall not use a trade
         name, any insurance group designation, name of the
         parent company of the insurer, name of the particular
         division of the insurer, service mark, slogan, symbol or
         other device or reference without disclosing the name of
         the insurer, if the advertisement would have the
         capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the
         true identity of the insurer or create the impression
         that a company other than the insurer would have any
         responsibility for the financial obligation under a
         policy.

     b)  No advertisement shall use any combination of words,
         symbols or physical materials which by their content,
         phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are
         so similar to a combination of words, symbols or
         physical materials used by a governmental program or
         agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that
         they tend to mislead prospective insureds into believing
         that the solicitation is in some manner connected with
         such governmental program or agency.

 
Section 909.70  Jurisdictional Licensing and Status of Insurer
 
     a)  An advertisement which is intended to be seen or heard
         beyond the limits of the jurisdiction in which the
         insurer is licensed shall not imply licensing beyond
         such limits.

     b)  An advertisement may state that an insurer is licensed
         in the state where the advertisement appears, provided
         it does not exaggerate such fact or suggest or imply
         that competing insurers may not be so licensed.

     c)  An advertisement shall not create the impression that
         the insurer, its financial condition or status, the
         payment of its claims or the merits, desirability or
         advisability of its policy forms or kinds of plans of
         insurance are recommended or endorsed by any
         governmental entity.  However, where a governmental
         entity has recommended or endorsed a policy form or
         plan, such fact may be stated if the entity authorizes
         its recommendation or endorsement to be used in an
         advertisement.

 
Section 909.80  Statements about an Insurer
 
An advertisement shall not contain statements, pictures, or
illustrations which are false or misleading, in fact or by
implication, with respect to the assets, liabilities, insurance
in force, corporate structure, financial condition, age or
relative position of the insurer in the insurance business.  An
advertisement shall not contain a recommendation by any
commercial rating system unless it clearly defines the scope and
extent of the recommendation.

 
Section 909.90  Enforcement Procedures
 
     a)  Each insurer shall maintain at its home or principal
         office a complete file containing a specimen copy of
         every printed, published or prepared advertisement
         hereafter disseminated in this State, with a notation
         indicating the manner and extent of distribution and the
         form number of any policy advertised.  Such file shall
         be subject to inspection by this Department.  All such
         advertisements shall be maintained in said file for a
         period of either four years or until the filing of the
         next regular report of examination of the insurer,
         whichever is the longer period of time.

     b)  Every insurer subject to the provisions of this Rule
         shall file with this Department with its Annual
         Statement a certificate of compliance executed by an
         authorized officer of the insurer wherein it is stated
         that to the best of his knowledge, information and
         belief the advertisements which were disseminated by or
         on behalf of the insurer in this State during the
         preceding statement year, or during the portion of such
         year when this Rule was in effect, complied or were made
         to comply in all respects with the provisions of this
         Rule and the Insurance Laws of this State as implemented
         and interpreted by this Rule.

 
Section 909.100  Penalties (Renumbered)
 
Any insurer or any of its officers, directors, producers or
employees thereof which, or who, violate any of the provisions of
this regulation, or knowingly participate in or abet such
violation, shall be subject to a fine up to $1000 for each
violation and/or subject to suspension or revocation of their
certificate of authority or license.

     (Source:  Section 909.100 renumbered to Section 909.110, new
         Section 909.100 adopted at 14 Ill. Reg. 13584, effective
         August 14, 1990) 

 
Section 909.110  Conflict with Other Rules (Renumbered)
 
It is not intended that this Rule conflict with or supersede any
rules currently in force or subsequently adopted in this State
governing specific aspects of the sale or replacement of life
insurance including, but not limited to, rules dealing with life

sale of life insurance and replacement of life insurance
policies.  Consequently, no disclosure required under any such
rules should be deemed to be an advertisement within the meaning
of this Rule.

SOURCE:  Filed November 9, 1964, effective December 1, 1964;

at 7 Ill. Reg. 269.
<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 912.5  Authority
 
The following Rule is promulgated and adopted pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 401 of the Illinois
Insurance Code, which empowers the Director "...to make
reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for making
effective..." the insurance laws of this State.  It is the
purpose of this Rule to implement Sections 133 and 136 of the
Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, pars. 745
and 748) by providing for the method of accounting to be used in
reflecting the amount of commissions in the annual statement.

 
Section 912.10  Application
 
This Rule applies to all domestic, foreign and alien insurance
companies authorized to transact any of the business of insurance
specified under Classes 1(b), 2 and 3 of Section 4 of the
Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 912.20  Commissions Reflected in the Financial Statements
 
Commissions shall be reflected in the financial statements for
all premiums written.  Financial statements shall not reflect
commissions, paid or incurred, on an earned premium basis except
as provided in Section 912.40 below.

 
Section 912.30  Mandatory Commission Reserve
 
A reserve shall be established for unpaid commissions whenever
commissions are paid on an earned premium basis but are not
dependent on loss experience under the insurance written.  This
reserve shall be known as a Mandatory Commission Reserve and
shall be based on the unearned premium reserve and shall be
computed by use of the company's weighted average commission rate
for a certain line times the unearned premium for the same line.

 
Section 912.40  Commissions Based on Loss Experience
 
Whenever a company's agency contracts provided that commissions
will be determined by use of a formula which relates to loss
experience, then a Mandatory Commission Reserve must be
established for the earned portion contingent upon such
experience.  The amount of this Mandatory Commission Reserve
shall be based on adequate company experience, if available, or
on some reasonable average industry experience, and shall be the
sum of the amounts of commission earned but not yet paid nor
credited to the agents as of the date of the company's statement,
computed under the contract formulas on the experience as of such
date, whether or not the contracts provide for payment to the
agents at such date or at a later date and whether or not the
amount of commission payable may be changed by subsequent loss
experience.

 
Section 912.50  Financial Reporting of the Mandatory Commission Reserve
 
Where a company is required to provide a Mandatory Commission
Reserve it shall report such charges in its financial statements
as an operational charge.

 
Section 912.60  Effective Date of the Mandatory Commission Reserve
 
In all cases, the Mandatory Commission Reserve shall be fully
established not later than December 31, 1964.  The Director shall
have the authority to extend the time for the establishment of
this reserve by any company for reasons which he shall deem good
and sufficient.

         appear to the Director or to the applicant that any

         whatever particulars are necessary to correct such

Securities Act,  and two copies of all subsequent amendments and

The incorporators, organizers, promoters or other persons
similarly situated of any domestic company organized after the

permit for a public sale by the Director pursuant to Section 20
of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73,
par. 632), deposit in escrow in a bank or trust company in this
State pursuant to an agreement, a sum of money sufficient to

15% of said shares and shall further provide that the total
shares so purchased shall likewise be held in escrow and not in

(3) years from and after the date that the company receives a
Certificate of Authority pursuant to Section 24 of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 636).  The
agreement shall also provide that the incorporators, organizers,
promoters and like parties understand their obligations as such
and agree to faithfully perform the same and also that they
understand, in the event of a later public sale at a higher
offering price per share, that they may be required to deposit
all or part of their own shares under an escrow agreement
pursuant to Section 913.80 of this Part.

Section 913.80  Escrow Requirements
 
If application is made to the Director for a Permit authorizing
the applicant to sell to the public shares of stock of an issue
subject to this Part, and it shall appear to the Director that
shares of stock of the issuer have, within the five (5) years
next preceding the date of the application for such Permit, been
issued or sold by the issuer or a controlling person for a
consideration at a price less than the proposed public offering
price, then the Director may for the protection of the
prospective purchasers of the shares proposed to be offered,
require that the shares issued for such consideration and help by
officers and directors and holders of 10% of outstanding stock be
delivered to a bank or trust company in this State authorized to
accept and execute trusts, under an escrow agreement providing
that the owners of the shares so escrowed shall not, in case of
dissolution or insolvency of the issuer, participate in its
assets until after the owners of all the shares of the issuer
(other than those escrowed) shall have received an amount per
share equal to the public offering price of the proposed
offering.  Such escrow agreement shall remain in force until the
first to occur of the following:

     a)  Written consent is given by the Director authorizing the
         release of such escrowed shares;

     b)  Financial statements of the issuer prepared in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
         which have been audited by an independent certified
         public accountant in accordance with generally accepted
         auditing standards have been submitted to the Director
         establishing that the issuer has earned an amount equal
         to an average of 5% per annum in any 24 month period or
         at least 10% per annum in any 12 month period of a sum
         equal to the number of shares then outstanding,
         multiplied by the public offering price at time of the
         imposition of the escrow, adjusted for any intervening
         stock splits, dividends or combination; or

     c)  The question of the release of such escrow is first put
         to the shareholders of the issuer and receives the
         affirmative vote of the holders of not less than the
         majority of the outstanding shares held by others than
         parties to the escrow.

Section 913.90  Stock Option Plans
 
The Director shall be guided in the granting of a permit to issue
shares to implement stock option plans by the following:

     a)  Any stock option or purchase plan which meets the
         requirements of Sections 422, 423 or 424 of the Internal
         Revenue Code of 1954, as hereafter may be amended, shall
         be deemed prima facie reasonable by the Director,
         provided however, that the number of shares to be
         granted pursuant to such a plan, together with the
         number of shares in respect of which unexercised options
         are outstanding or may be granted under any and all
         other option plans of the company, shall in no event
         exceed 10% of the total shares outstanding.  The burden
         shall be upon the applicant to prove that such plan
         complies with the provisions of said Sections 422, 423
         or 424, as amended, and such proof shall be made prior
         to the issuance of any  Permit in connection with the
         execution of such plan.

     b)  Any stock option plan which does not comply with the
         Internal Revenue Code as referred to above, shall be
         approved by the Director only upon proof that the
         following conditions have been met:

          1)  The option price is not less than 100% of the
              market price of shares on the date the plan becomes
              effective, or if there is no market price of such
              shares on the date the plan becomes effective, the
              last highest public offering price;

          2)  The total of all shares to be granted pursuant to
              such plan, together with the number of shares in
              respect of which unexercised option are outstanding
              or may be granted under any and all other option
              plans of the company, shall in no event exceed 10%
              of the total shares outstanding;

          3)  In the event an individual at the time the option
              is granted owns 10% of the stock of the issuer, the
              option price is not less than 110% of the market
              price of the shares on the date the plan becomes
              effective, or if there is no market price of such
              shares on the date the plan becomes effective, the
              last highest public offering price;

          4)  Such options require the optionee to hold the stock
              for 1 year from the date of the exercise of the
              option;

          5)  Such options by their terms are not exercisable
              after the expiration of 5 years from the dates such
              options are granted;

          6)  The options are given only in respect of benefits
              which will be given to the company by the person
              receiving the option; and

          7)  The plan has been submitted to a vote of the
              shareholders of the company and received the
              affirmative vote of the holders of not less than
              2/3 of the outstanding shares.

     c)  The Director may waive any requirements for option plans
         under Section 913.90(b) in those cases in which he finds
         that valid contractual rights were acquired prior to the
         effective date of this Part, under plans which had been
         previously approved by the Director.

         substituted filing must be withdrawn by completing a
         transmittal sheet.

     e)  A policy form submitted for filing under this Part may
         be issued or delivered only after the policy form has
         been approved by the Director of Insurance.

     (Source:  Repealed at 8 Ill. Reg. 11365, effective August 1,
         1984) 

 
Section 917.20  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Rule is:

     a)  To regulate the activities of insurers and agents with
         respect to the replacement of existing life insurance or
         annuities;

     b)  To protect the interests of life insurance and annuity
         policyowners by establishing minimum standards of
         conduct to be observed in the replacement or proposed
         replacement of existing life insurance by:

          1)  Assuring that the policyowner receives information
              with which a decision can be made in his or her own
              best interest;

          2)  Reducing the opportunity for misrepresentation and
              incomplete disclosures.

     (Source:  Amended at 8 Ill. Reg. 11365, effective August 1,
         1984) 

 
Section 917.30  Definition of Replacement
 
"Replacement" means any transaction except those exempted by
Section 917.50 in which new life insurance or annuity will be
purchased, and it is known or should be known to the proposing
agent, or to the proposing insurer if there is no agent, that by
reason of such transaction, existing life insurance or annuity
has been or is to be:

     a)  Lapsed, forfeited, surrendered, to otherwise terminated;

     b)  Converted to reduced paid-up insurance, continued as
         extended term insurance, or otherwise reduced in value
         by the use of nonforfeiture benefits or other policy
         values;

     c)  Amended so as to effect either a reduction in benefits
         or in the term for which coverage would otherwise remain
         in force or for which benefits would be paid;

     d)  Reissued with any reduction in cash value; or

     e)  Pledged as collateral or subjected to borrowing, whether
         in a single loan or under a schedule of borrowing over a
         period of time for amounts in the aggregate exceeding
         twenty-five percent (25%) of the loan value set forth in
         the policy.

     (Source:  Amended at 8 Ill. Reg. 11365, effective August 1,
         1984) 

 
Section 917.40  Other Definitions
 
         "Agent" for the purposes of this Rule shall have the
         same meaning as "insurance agent" as defined in Section
         490 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.

            REPLACING YOUR LIFE INSURANCE OR ANNUITY?

Are you thinking about buying a new life insurance policy or
annuity and discontinuing or changing an existing one?  If you
are, your decision could be a good one -- or a mistake.  You will
not know for sure unless you make a careful comparison of your
existing benefits and the proposed benefits.

Make sure you understand the facts.  You should ask the agent or
company that sold you your existing policy to give you
information about it.

Hear both sides before you decide.  This way you can be sure you
are making a decision that is in your best interest.

We are required by law to notify your existing company that you
may be replacing their policy.

of policies which are involved

         11, 1989) 

 
Section 919.20  Scope and Purpose
 
     a)  This Part shall apply to all insurance companies
         authorized to transact in this State the kind or kinds
         of business described in Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 of
         Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 616) except fidelity and
         surety, ocean marine and worker's compensation; to all
         producers licensed under Article XXXI of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 983
         et seq.); to all Medical Service Plan Corporations; to
         all Voluntary Health Service Plan Corporations; to all
         Vision Service Plan Corporations; to all Dental Service
         Plan Corporations; to all Health Maintenance
         Organizations; and to all Pharmaceutical Service Plan
         Corporations; and to any individual association,
         corporation, partnership, insurance company or other
         legal entity licensed under the Illinois Insurance Code
         which acts as a third party administrator. This Part
         shall apply to all claims handling activity occurring on
         or after the effective date of this Part and to all
         pertinent policy forms on file or hereafter filed with
         the Illinois Department of Insurance after the effective
         date of this Part.

     b)  The purpose of this Part is to set forth minimum
         standards for the investigation and disposition of
         claims arising under contracts and certificates issued
         to residents of Illinois.  The provisions of the Part
         establish the general criteria to be used by the
         Director in selecting companies to be examined and the
         minimum standards for record keeping to be followed by
         the companies subject to the Part.  The various
         provisions of the Part are intended to define procedures
         and practices that committed with such frequency as to
         indicate a general practice will ultimately be the basis
         for a regulatory finding of unfair claims practices.

Section 919.30  Examinations

         on Illinois risks are subject to examination and
         inspection by the Director of Insurance or by his duly
         appointed designees.  Examples of the criteria which may
         be used to determine the frequency of examinations
         include but are not limited to:

          1)  High ratio of written complaints to premium volume
              or units of exposure or enrollment;

          2)  Examination of a percent of a particular market;

          3)  Examination of a particular specialty line for
              which claims handling, underwriting or marketing
              practices or procedures raise questions of
              compliance with any insurance laws or rule;

          4)  Examination of a particular company whose practice
              or procedure for the handling of claims,
              underwriting or the marketing of policies raise
              questions of compliance with any insurance laws or
              rules.

     b)  Each company shall maintain claim data that should be
         accessible and retrievable for examination by the
         Director.   A company shall be able to provide the claim
         number, line of coverage, date of loss and date of
         payment of the claim, date of denial, or date claim
         closed without payment.  This data must be available for
         all open and/or closed files for the current year and
         the two preceding years.  The examiners' review may
         include but need not be limited to an examination of the
         following claims:

          1)  Claims Closed With Payment;

          2)  Claims Denied;

          3)  Claims Closed Without Payment;

          4)  First Party Automobile Total Losses; and/or
              Subrogation Claims.

     c)  Detailed documentation shall be contained in each claim
         file in order to permit reconstruction of the company's
         activities relative to each claim file.

     d)  For those companies who do not maintain hard copy files,
         claim files must be accessible from cathode ray tube
         (CRT) or micrographics and capable of duplication to
         hard copy.

Section 919.50  Required Practices for all Insurance Companies
 
     a)  The company shall affirm or deny liability on claims
         within a reasonable time and shall offer payment within
         30 days of affirmation of liability, if the amount of
         the claim is determined and not in dispute.  For those
         portions of the claim which are not in dispute and the
         payee is known, the company shall tender payment within
         said 30 days.

          1)  On first party claims if a settlement of a claim is
              less than the amount claimed, or if the claim is
              denied, the company shall provide to the insured a
              reasonable written explanation of the basis of the
              lower offer or denial within 30 days after the
              investigation and determination of liability is
              completed.  This explanation shall clearly set
              forth the policy definition, limitation, exclusion
              or condition upon which denial was based.  Notice
              of Availability of the Department of Insurance
              shall accompany this explanation.

          2)  Within 30 days after the initial determination of
              liability is made, if the claim is denied, the
              company shall provide the third party a reasonable
              written explanation of the basis of the denial.

     b)  No company shall deny a claim upon information obtained
         in a telephone conversation or personal interview with
         any source unless such telephone conversation or
         personal interview is documented in the claim file.

     c)  The company's standards for claims processing shall be
         such that notice of claim and proofs of loss submitted
         against one policy issued by that company shall fulfill
         the insured's obligation under any and all similar
         policies issued by that company and specifically
         identified by the insured to said company to the same
         degree that the same form would be required under any
         similar policy.  If additional information is required
         to fulfill the insured's obligation under other similar
         policies, the company may request the additional
         information.  When it is apparent to the company that
         additional benefits would be payable under an insured's
         policy upon receipt of additional proofs of loss from
         the insured, the company shall communicate to and
         cooperate with the insured in determining the extent of
         the company's additional liability.

Section 919.60  Improper Practices or Procedures for all Insurance Companies
 
     a)  No company shall indicate to an insured on a payment
         draft, check or in any accompanying letter that said
         payment is "final" or "a release" of any claim unless
         the policy limit has been paid or there is a bonafide
         dispute either over coverage or the amount payable under
         the policy.

     b)  No company shall make any statement, written or oral,
         requiring an insured to complete a proof of loss in less
         time than is provided in the policy.

     c)  No company shall make any statement requiring an insured
         to give written notice of loss within a specified time
         so that the company is relieved of its obligations under
         a policy if such time limit is not complied with, unless
         such a statement is made after the insured's
         unreasonable failure to give written notice.

     d)  No company shall request or require any insured to
         submit to a polygraph examination.  The use of
         examinations under oath, sworn statements or similar
         procedures shall not be so restricted, if authorized
         under the applicable insurance contracts.

Section 919.70  Claims Practices - Life, Accident and Health Companies, Chapter 32 Plan Act Companies, Third Party Administrators and Health Maintenance Organizations
 
     a)  Required Practices.

          1)  If a claim remains unresolved for 45 days from the
              date it is reported, the company shall provide the
              insured or, when applicable, the insured's
              beneficiary, with a reasonable written explanation
              for the delay.  In credit or mortgage claims, the
              notice must be provided to the debtor/insured in
              addition to the policyholder.  Notice of
              availability of the Department of Insurance shall
              accompany the written explanation to the insured
              beneficiary.

          2)  If a company is under contract for direct filing of
              claims either with a provider or another carrier on
              behalf of the insured, the requirement for
              acknowledgment of claims or notice requirements are
              waived provided the insured has otherwise received
              prior notice of such arrangements.  If a claim
              remains unresolved for more than 90 days from the
              date the administrator provides notice to the
              company, the notice of delay, as specified in
              Section 919.70(a), shall be required.  Nothing in
              this Section shall waive the written notice
              requirement for denial of a claim.

          3)  A disability claim settlement on a lump sum basis
              shall be accompanied with a written explanation of
              the basis of the settlement including a comparison
              of the different modes of settlement.

     b)  Improper Practices or Procedures.

          1)  No company shall settle a claim involving both a
              covered and non-covered condition, on a percentage
              basis of contributing loss, unless said percentage
              is reasonable under the circumstances and the
              insured is provided with written explanation.  The
              basis for settlement must be maintained in the
              file.

          2)  No company shall undertake any activity that has
              the effect of misrepresenting policy provisions or
              otherwise unduly influencing the insured to settle
              a disability claim on a lump sum basis.

Section 919.80   Claim Practices - Section 919.80   ClaimPractices - Section 919.80   Claim Practices - Section 919.80  Claim Practices - Property and Casualty Companies
 
     a)  All companies shall report vexatious or unreasonable
         delay findings by a court of law to the Director of
         Insurance within 30 days of such findings and enclose
         with that report a copy of said findings and penalties,
         if any, pursuant to Section 155 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 767).

     b)  Unreasonable Delays.

          1)  The period used in computing the "median payment
              period" shall mean the period measured from the
              date of notification of loss to the date of final
              payment or the rendering of the repaired automobile
              to the insured or third party claimant.

          2)  An unreasonable delay to pay automobile collision
              claims exists when the median payment period
              exceeds 40 calendar days.  If a first party
              physical damage automobile claim remains unresolved
              for more than 40 calendar days from the date it is
              reported, the company shall provide a reasonable
              written explanation for the delay to the insured.
              Notice of availability of the Department of
              Insurance shall accompany the written explanation.

          3)  An unreasonable delay to pay automobile property
              damage liability claims exists when a median
              payment period exceeds 60 calendar days.  If an
              automobile property damage liability claim remains
              unresolved in excess of 60 calendar days from the
              date it is reported, the company shall provide a
              reasonable written explanation for the delay to the
              third party claimant.  Notice of availability of
              the Department of Insurance shall accompany the
              written explanation.

          4)  Written explanations under subparagraphs (2) and
              (3) above shall be considered reasonable if they
              exhibit a rational basis for the delay and are not
              frivolous.

     c)  Total Loss Vehicle Claims.
         When the insured vehicle has been determined a total
         loss, and the insurance policy provides for the
         adjustment and settlement of first party vehicle claims
         on the basis of actual cash value or replacement, the
         company shall establish a procedure to provide the
         insured with, at a minimum, the information contained in
         the attached Section 919.Exhibit A within 7 days of this
         determination, and shall follow one of the following
         methods:

          1)  The company may elect to replace the insured
              vehicle, providing that it is:

               A)  Comparable in that it will be by the same
                   manufacturer, same year, similar body style,
                   and similar options and price range as the
                   insured vehicle and in as good or better
                   overall condition and available for inspection
                   at a licensed dealer within a reasonable
                   distance of the insured's residence.  The file
                   must contain a description of the replacement
                   vehicle, including the vehicle identification
                   number and a schedule of options.

               B)  Replacement vehicles of the current model plus
                   the 3 previous model years must be purchased
                   through licensed dealers.  This requirement
                   may be waived in writing by the insured.  The
                   signed waiver must be maintained in the file.

               C)  Once the replacement vehicle is located, the
                   insured shall be advised of the location of
                   the vehicle and the replacement value
                   including the applicable taxes, license and
                   transfer fees.  In the event the insured
                   elects a cash settlement instead of such
                   replacement vehicle, the company need pay only
                   the amount it would have otherwise paid on the
                   replacement vehicle.  As a condition precedent
                   to this method of settlement, the company must
                   first offer the replacement vehicle to the
                   insured and the insured must reject the offer.
                   Evidence of such must be apparent in the file.

               D)  In the event that a replacement vehicle
                   meeting the requirements of subsection (A) is
                   not available or the insured rejects a
                   replacement vehicle or the insured wants
                   another available vehicle substantially
                   similar in value, the option to replace the
                   insured vehicle may be exercised provided the
                   company has the insured's written waiver in
                   the claim file that the acceptance of another
                   vehicle is of his or her own free will and
                   choice.  The company need pay only the amount
                   it would have otherwise paid on the
                   replacement vehicle, including the applicable
                   taxes, and transfer fees.

          2)  The company may elect to pay a cash settlement.
              The company shall use one of the following
              methodologies to determine the market value of the
              insured vehicle:  The cash settlement may be based
              upon the retail value of the vehicle as determined
              from one of the following sources:

               A)  A source or sources which are published on a
                   regular basis, at least once every two (2)
                   months, and contain the average retail,
                   wholesale and finance value for all makes and
                   models for at least each of the last five (5)
                   model years as well as a listing and price for
                   all major options; or

               B)  An electronically computerized source or
                   sources which:

                    i)   computes statistically valid retail
                         values including all major options and
                         equipment, and applicable allowances for
                         mileage and condition, for at least
                         eighty-five percent (85%) of all makes
                         and models for at least each of the last
                         fifteen (15) model years;

                    ii)  the retail value so generated shall be
                         based on data from the area immediately
                         surrounding the location where the
                         insured vehicle was principally garaged
                         and such value shall be based upon data
                         compiled on at least 1.5 million
                         passenger vehicles;

                    iii) compiles, maintains and provides, upon
                         request, a record of valuations and
                         monthly summaries of the average retail
                         value, option value, and mileage for
                         each general metropolitan area for the
                         preceding twenty-four (24) month period.

               C)  The settlement may be based upon an
                   electronically computerized service.  Such
                   settlement must incude at least two (2)
                   currently available vehicles from licensed
                   dealers in Illinois or two (2) vehicles that
                   have been sold by licensed dealers in
                   Illinois, one of which was sold within the
                   past thirty (30) days and one of which was
                   sold within the past ninety (90) days. The
                   location of the licensed dealer for each
                   available or recently sold vehicle shall be
                   within fifty (50) miles of the general
                   metropolitan area where the data is gathered.
                   The name and location of the licensed dealers,
                   as well as the vehicle identification numbers
                   (VINs), shall be maintained in the claim file.
                   If the electronically computerized service
                   does not include a sufficient number of
                   vehicles to satisfy the requirements of this
                   subsection, the service may provide an average
                   from at least two (2) published sources that
                   comply with subsection (2)(A) above.

               D)  If the insured vehicle is not quoted in the
                   source or sources used by the company, the
                   company shall then base the settlement upon at
                   least two written dealers' quotations.  The
                   company shall furnish the names and locations
                   of the dealers used to determine the market
                   value to the insured, and a copy of the
                   dealers' quotations.

               E)  In subsections (A), (B) (C) and (D) above, the
                   claim file shall contain documentation of how
                   the market value of the insured automobile was
                   determined.

               F)  Right of Recourse - If within 30 days of the
                   receipt of the claim draft, the insured cannot
                   purchase a comparable vehicle in excess of
                   such market value, the company will reopen its
                   claim file and the following procedure(s)
                   shall apply:

                    i)   The company may locate a comparable
                         vehicle by the same manufacturer, same
                         year, similar body style and similar
                         options and price range for the insured
                         for the market value determined by the
                         company at the time of settlement.  Any
                         such vehicle must be available through
                         licensed dealers; or

                    ii)  The company shall either pay the insured
                         the difference between the market value
                         before applicable deductions and the
                         cost of the comparable vehicle of like
                         kind and quality which the insured has
                         located, or negotiate and effect the
                         purchase of this vehicle for the
                         insured; or

                    iii) The company may elect to offer a
                         replacement in accordance with the
                         provisions set forth in subsection
                         (c)(1) of this Section; or

                    iv)  The company may conclude the loss
                         settlement as provided for under the
                         appraisal section of the insurance
                         contract in force at the time of loss.
                         This appraisal shall be considered as
                         binding against both parties, but shall
                         not preclude or waive any other rights
                         either party has under the insurance
                         contract or at common law.

                    v)   The company is not required to take
                         action under this subsection (c)(2)(F)
                         if its documentation to the insured at
                         the time of settlement included written
                         notification of the availability and
                         location of a specified and comparable
                         vehicle of the same manufacturer, same
                         year, similar body style and similar
                         options in as good or better condition
                         as the total loss vehicle which could
                         have been purchased for the market value
                         determined by the company before
                         applicable deductions.  The
                         documentation shall include the vehicle
                         identification number.

          3)  Provisions applicable to subsections (c)(1) and
              (c)(2) of this Section.

               A)  If a replacement vehicle is provided, the
                   company is required to pay the applicable
                   sales tax and transfer and title fees.

                    i)   If a cash settlement is provided, and if
                         within 30 days of the receipt of the
                         settlement by the insured, the insured
                         has purchased or leased a vehicle, the
                         company is required to reimburse the
                         insured for the applicable sales taxes
                         and transfer and title fees incurred on
                         account of the purchase or lease of the
                         vehicle, but not exceeding the amount
                         payable on account of the value of the
                         total loss vehicle.  If the insured
                         purchases or leases a vehicle with a
                         market value less than the amount of the
                         settlement, then the company is required
                         to reimburse only the amount of the
                         applicable sales tax and transfer and
                         title fees incurred by the insured.  If
                         the insured cannot substantiate such
                         purchase and the payment of such taxes
                         and fees, by submission to the company
                         of appropriate documentation within 33
                         days after the receipt of settlement,
                         the company shall not be required to
                         reimburse the insured for the sales
                         taxes or transfer or title fees.  In
                         lieu of this reimbursement procedure,
                         the company may directly pay the
                         required amounts of sales taxes, and
                         transfer and title fees to the insured
                         at the time of settlement.  With respect
                         to leased vehicles, sales taxes and
                         transfer and title fees shall be deemed
                         to be incurred by the insured at the
                         time the lease is entered into, but only
                         if such sales taxes and transfer and
                         title fees are included in the cost of
                         the lease or are paid directly by the
                         insured.

                    ii)  Any form required by the company for
                         applying for the reimbursement must be
                         furnished by the company with either the
                         notice or at the time of settlement.

               B)  Deductions of the kind commonly referred to as
                   "get ready to go" and "dealer prep", or dealer
                   preparation charges are prohibited.

     d)  Practices Concerning Travel, Loss of Use, Storage/Towing
         and Betterment, Replacement Crash Parts and Automobile
         Repairs.

          1)  Unreasonable Travel.

               A)  The company shall not require the insured or
                   claimant to travel unreasonably to inspect a
                   replacement vehicle, nor shall the company
                   require the insured or claimant to locate a
                   replacement vehicle.

               B)  The company shall not require the insured or
                   claimant to travel unreasonably either to
                   obtain a repair estimate or to have the
                   vehicle repaired at a  specific repair shop
                   that is recommended by the company.

               C)  The Department will consider availability and
                   cost consideration in determining reasonable
                   travel requirements.

          2)  Loss of Use.  In automobile property damage
              liability claims in which liability is reasonably
              clear, the company shall pay for the reasonable and
              necessary costs, in direct proportion to the extent
              of its liability, incurred in the rental of another
              automobile provided that the loss of use claim is
              submitted and substantiated.  In those cases where
              the company pays a flat rental amount per day, week
              or month, it must disclose to the claimant where
              the claimant can obtain a vehicle for the amount of
              its payment.

          3)  Storage and Towing.  The company shall provide
              reasonable notice to an insured prior to
              termination of payment for automobile storage
              charges and document such notice in the claim file.
              Reasonable notice shall constitute sufficient
              notice to the insured to allow them to remove the
              vehicle from storage prior to the termination of
              payment.  Unless the company has provided an
              insured with the name of a specific towing company
              prior to the insured's use of another towing
              company, the company shall pay any and all
              reasonable towing charges irrespective of the
              towing company used by the insured.  A company
              shall make no advance charge deductions for storage
              and towing charges unless excessive charges have
              resulted from the insured's own actions.  The
              company shall itemize each advance charge deduction
              and maintain in the claim file documentation of the
              reasons and dollar amounts involved in each
              deduction.  Any determination of reasonable towing
              charges shall consider policy coverage as well as
              the cost and distances involved in each claim.

          4)  Betterment deductions are allowable only if the
              deductions:

               A)  reflect a measurable decrease in market value
                   attributable to the poorer condition of, or
                   prior damage to, the insured vehicle;

               B)  are for prior wear and tear, missing parts and
                   rust damage that is reflective of the general
                   overall condition of the vehicle considering
                   its age, any such deductions for this type of
                   damage may not exceed $500; and

               C)  are measurable, itemized, specified as to
                   dollar amount and documented in the claim
                   file.

               D)  No company shall require the insured or
                   claimant to supply part for replacement.

          5)  Replacement Crash Parts

               A)  Purpose

                   The purpose of this subsection is to set forth
                   standards for the prompt, fair and equitable
                   settlements applicable to automobile insurance
                   with regard to the use of replacement crash
                   parts.  It is intended to regulate the use of
                   replacement crash parts in automobile damage
                   repairs which insurers pay for on their
                   insured's vehicle.  It also requires that all
                   replacement crash parts, as defined in this
                   Section, be identified and be of the same
                   quality as the original part.

               B)  Identification

                   All replacement crash parts, which are subject
                   to this Section and manufactured after the
                   effective date of this Section, shall carry
                   sufficient permanent non-removable
                   identification so as to identify its
                   manufacturer.  Such identification shall be
                   accessible to the extent possible after
                   installation.

               C)  Like Kind and Quality

                   No insurer shall require the use of
                   replacement crash parts in the repair of an
                   automobile unless the replacement crash part
                   is at least equal in like kind and quality to
                   the original part in terms of fit, quality and
                   performance.  Insurers specifying the use of
                   replacement crash parts shall consider the
                   cost of any modifications which may become
                   necessary when making the repair.

          6)  Vehicle Repairs

              If partial losses are settled on the basis of a
              written estimate prepared by or for the company,
              the company shall supply upon request of the
              insured, a copy of the estimate upon which the
              settlement is based.  The estimate prepared by or
              for the company shall be reasonable, in accordance
              with applicable policy provisions, and of an amount
              which will allow for repairs to be made in a
              workmanlike manner.  If the insured subsequently
              claims, based upon a written estimate which he
              obtains, that necessary repairs will exceed the
              written estimate prepared by or for the company,
              the company shall review and respond promptly to
              the insured and provide the insured with the name
              of a repair shop that will make the repairs in a
              workmanlike manner.  Failure of the company to so
              inform the insured of the name of such a repair
              shop shall require the company to provide written
              notice to the insured that any and all reasonable
              costs incurred for repair or replacement related to
              the partial loss in excess of the company's
              estimate will be reimbursed by the company.  The
              company shall maintain documentation of all such
              communications.

          7)  Required Practices - Fire and Extended Coverage
              Claims

               A)  An unreasonable delay to pay claims on
                   policies of fire and extended coverage
                   insurance, as defined in Section 143.13 of the
                   Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987,
                   ch. 73, par. 755.13), exists when a median
                   payment period exceeds 40 calendar days.

               B)  If a claim on a policy of fire and extended
                   coverage insurance, as defined in Section
                   143.13 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill.
                   Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 755.13), remains
                   unresolved for more than 75 calendar days from
                   the date it is reported, or 25 calendar days
                   after receipt of proof of loss, whichever is
                   less, the company shall provide a reasonable
                   written explanation for the delay to the
                   insured.  Notice of  availability of the
                   Department of Insurance shall accompany the
                   written explanation to the insured.

               C)  If partial losses are settled on the basis of
                   a written estimate prepared by or for the
                   company, the company shall supply upon request
                   of the insured, a copy of the estimate upon
                   which the settlement is based.  The estimate
                   prepared by or for the company shall be
                   reasonable, in accordance with applicable
                   policy provisions, and of an amount which will
                   allow for repairs to be made in a workmanlike
                   manner.  If the insured subsequently claims,
                   based upon a written estimate which he
                   obtains, that necessary repairs will exceed
                   the written estimate prepared by or for the
                   company, the company shall review and respond
                   promptly in writing to the insured in regard
                   to his written estimate and provide the
                   insured with the name of a repair shop or
                   contractor that will make the repairs in a
                   workmanlike manner.  Failure of the company to
                   so inform the insured of the name of a
                   contractor shall require the company to
                   provide written notice to the insured that any
                   and all reasonable costs incurred for repair
                   or replacement related to the partial loss in
                   excess of the company's estimate will be
                   reimbursed by the company.

          8)  Actual Cash Value Losses.

               A)  When the insurance policy provides for the
                   adjustment and settlement of losses on an
                   actual cash value basis on residential fire
                   and extended coverage as defined in Section
                   143.13 of the Illinois Insurance Code, the
                   company shall determine actual cash value,
                   except for instances in which the insured's
                   interest is limited as set forth in (B) below,
                   as follows:  replacement cost of property at
                   time of loss less depreciation, if any. Upon
                   the insured's request, the company shall
                   provide a copy of the claim file worksheet(s)
                   detailing any and all deductions for
                   depreciation, including, but not necessarily
                   limited to, the age, condition, and expected
                   life of the property.

               B)  In cases in which the insured's interest is
                   limited because the property has nominal or no
                   economic value, or a value disproportionate to
                   replacement cost less depreciation, the
                   determination of actual cash value as set
                   forth in subsection (A) above is not required.
                   In such cases, the company shall provide, upon
                   the insured's request, a written explanation
                   of the basis for limiting the amount of
                   recovery along with the amount payable under
                   the policy.

               C)  When the period within which the insured may
                   bring suit under a residential fire and
                   extended coverage policy is tolled in
                   accordance with Section 143.1 of the Illinois
                   Insurance Code, the company, at the time it
                   denies the claim, in whole or in part, shall
                   advise the insured in writing of the number of
                   days the period was tolled, and how many days
                   are left before the expiration of the time to
                   bring suit.

Section 919.90  Improper Practices or Procedures - Property and Casualty Companies
 
     a)  A claim shall not be denied on the basis of failure to
         exhibit property unless there is documentation of breach
         of the policy provisions in the claim file.

     b)  No company shall make any statement, written or oral,
         requiring a liability claimant to complete a proof of
         loss form, accident description, or release of claim for
         damages, which indicates that the claimant's rights may
         be impaired if such forms are not completed within a
         specified time, unless such statement is given for the
         purpose of notifying the claimant of the provisions of
         the statute of limitations.

     c)  No company shall advise liability claimants to make
         claims under their own policies in cases where liability
         is reasonably clear.

     d)  No company shall fail to effect settlement on first
         party claims on the basis that responsibility for
         payment should be assumed by other persons or insurers.

     e)  No company issuing a motor vehicle insurance policy
         covering damages to a motor vehicle shall abandon the
         salvage of a motor vehicle to a towing service and/or
         storage yard service in lieu of the towing and storage
         charges, without the agreed permission of the towing
         service or storage yard service.

     f)  No company shall deny a claim for storage charges on
         actual cash value fire and extended coverage losses when
         the personal property limits have been exhausted, if
         coverage exists under additional living expense.

Section 919.100  Severability Provision
 
If any provision of this Part or an application thereof to any
person or circumstance is held invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions or applications of this Part
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application shall not be thereby affected, and to this extent the
provision of this Part are severable.

     (Source:  Section 919.100 renumbered from Section 919.70 and
         amended at 7 Ill. Reg. 11489, effective October 1, 1983)
         
 
Section 919.EXHIBIT A  Total Loss Automobile Claims
 
1)   Total Loss Claims

When you are involved in an automobile accident, one of the first
things you may have to do is file a claim for damages to your
vehicle.  If your car is a total loss, this procedure can
sometimes be confusing.

Your automobile insurance policy requires both you and your
insurance company to follow certain steps after a loss occurs.
This publication summarizes those requirements and outlines your
rights.

The Illinois Department of Insurance has established regulations
to protect you when you file an insurance claim.  It is also
important that you read your policy carefully so that you clearly
understand your responsibilities.

If you still have questions, you can contact our Consumer
Services Section at one of the following locations:

     320 West Washington Street
     Springfield, Illinois 62767
     (217) 782-7446

OR

     100 West Randolph Street, Suite 15-100
     Chicago, Illinois 60601
     (312) 917-2427

2)   Your Duties

     1.  You must immediately report all losses directly to your
         insurance producer or company.

     2.  If you suspect theft or vandalism, you must also report
         it immediately to the police.  If you fail to do so,
         your company may deny your claim.

     3.  You must protect your automobile from futher damage.
         For example, if you fail to cover a broken windshield
         and the upholstry is damaged by rain, your company can
         refuse to repair the seat.

     4.  Most insurance policies require that, within 91 days
         after the loss, you must submit a sworn proof of loss.
         A sworn proof of loss usually states the date of loss,
         how it happened, and for what purpose the automobile was
         being used.  If you fail to submit a proof of loss your
         company may deny your claim.

     5.  You must cooperate with the insurance company, submit to
         examination under oath, if so requested, and show them
         the damaged property.  If you fail to cooperate your
         company may deny your claim.

     6.  You should review the Conditions section of your policy
         for other possible requirements.

     3)  Your Insurance Company's Duties

When you file an automobile insurance claim, your insurance
company has three options:

     1)  Replace the damaged or stolen property;

     2)  Repair the damaged property; or
     3)  Pay for the loss in cash.

Insurance Department regulations require the company to follow
certain standards for each option.

4)   Replacement

If the insurance company elects to replace your vehicle, the
replacement must be a specific make and model comparable to your
totalled vehicle, and it must be available in as good or better
overall condition than your totalled vehicle.

Replacement vehicles must be purchased through licensed dealers.
Vehicles that are no more than three years old must be warranted.
If you reject a replacement vehicle, the insurance company must
pay only the amount it would have otherwise paid for the
replacement vehicle including applicable taxes, transfer and
title fees.  The company must offer you the replacement vehicle
and you must reject the offer.

If you desire a replacement vehicle of similar value, this
replacement method is also permitted.

5)   Cash Settlement

If the insurance company elects to make a cash settlement for
your totalled vehicle, they must first determine its retail
value.  Companies normally use guide books or computerized data
marketed by various sources.

If your vehicle is not listed in one of these sources, the
company can use written dealer quotes.  Ordinarily, however,
newspaper advertisements are not acceptable sources of market
value.

6)   Payment of Sales Tax

If within 30 days of a cash settlement, you can prove that you
have purchased another vehicle, the company must pay the
applicable sales tax, transfer and title fees in an amount
equivalent to the value of the total loss vehicle.  If you
purchase a vehicle with a market value less than the amount
previously settled upon, the company must pay you only the amount
of sales tax that you actually incurred and include transfer and
title fees.  Your insurance company must give you written notice
of this procedure.

7)   Betterment Deductions

The insurance company is allowed to make deductions from the
retail value if your automobile has old, unrepaired collision
damages.  There is no limit to the amount of the deduction.
The insurance company can also make deductions for wear and tear,
missing parts and rust, but the maximum deduction may not exceed
$500.00.

All deductions must be itemized and specified as to dollar
amount.

8)   Retaining Your Totalled Vehicle

In an effort to minimize automobile "chop shop" crime, the
Illinois Vehicle Code does not permit you the right to retain the
salvage once your automobile has been deemed a total loss by your
insurance company.  The insurance company must take possession of
the vehicle, if the vehicle is eight model years or newer.

9)   Right of Recourse

If you cannot locate a replacement vehicle within 30 days of
receiving a cash settlement, you may have some additional rights
under your insurance contract.

If you cannot purchase a substantially similar vehicle for the
market value determined by the company, but you have located a
substantially similar vehicle that costs more, the following
procedures(s) shall apply.

     1)  The company shall either pay your the difference between
         the original settlement and the amount of the
         substantially similar vehicle which you have located or
         attempt to purchase this vehicle for you; or

     2)  The company shall locate a comparable vehicle for you at
         the market value determined by the company at the time
         of settlement; or

     3)  The company shall conclude the loss settlement as
         provided under the appraisal section of the insurance
         policy.

Your insurance company must give you written notice of this
procedure once your vehicle has been determined a total loss.
This chart should assist you in determining the retail value of
your automobile.

Minus Deductible                 
Total                            

The above figure represents an average automobile.  Your
automobile may be worth more or less than the above figure
because of options on the automobile which are not listed in a
guide book or because of the excessive wear and tear or old
unrepaired damage to the automobile.

     c)  Have you accrued earned additional or return reinsurance
         premiums or commissions which, on the basis of loss
         experience to date, would be payable or refundable in
         the future if the reinsurer or you cancelled all of your
         company's reinsurance as of the end of the period
         covered by the accompanying Annual Statement?  If you
         have not so accrued, what would be the amount of such
         additional or return premium or commission?

     d)  What would be the amount of the reduction in surplus as
         of the end of the period covered by the accompanying
         Annual Statement if adjustments were made to reflect the
         full amount described in paragraph (c) above?

         computed at the maximum level provided by the

         amount shown in response to paragraph (c) in
         retrospective adjustment periods covering the most
         recent three years?

         paid and presently accrued (including as accrued the
         amount shown in response to paragraph (c)) on
         retrospective adjustment periods covering the most
         recent three years?

         the end of the period covered by the accompanying Annual
         Statement from the combined effects of the amounts
         described in paragraph (f) and (g)?

         within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter;
         and

     b)  Its reinsurance contract provided that in the event of

     c)  In the event of insolvency of the reinsured company the

         should be reduced to reflect applicable income taxes and
         unearned premium reserves ceded to unauthorized

     c)  The amount determined in response to this paragraph

         year and the results of its operations, cash flows and changes in
         capital and surplus for the report year in conformity with
         statutory accounting practices for preparation of the annual
         statement as described in Section 136 of the Illinois Insurance
         Code, Section 2-7 of the Health Maintenance Organization Act,
         Section 2007 of the Limited Health Service Organization Act, or as
         otherwise permitted by the insurance regulatory authority of the
         insurer's state of domicile.

     b)  The Annual Audited Financial Report shall include the following:

          1)  Opinion of the accountant.

          2)  Balance sheet reporting admitted assets, liabilities, capital
              and surplus or net worth.

          3)  Statement of operations or statement of revenues and expenses

          4)  Statement of cash flows.

          5)  Statement of changes in capital and surplus or net worth.

          6)  Notes to financial statements.  These notes shall be those
              required by the appropriate NAIC Annual Statement
              Instructions and any other notes required by generally
              accepted accounting principles and shall also include:

               A)  a reconciliation of differences, if any, between the
                   Annual Audited Financial Report and the Annual Statement
                   filed pursuant to Section 136 of the Illinois Insurance
                   Code, Section 2-7 of the Health Maintenance Organization
                   Act, or Section 2007 of the Limited Health Service

              language and groupings substantially the same as the relevant
              sections of the Annual Statement of the insurer filed with
              the Director and:

               A)  The financial statements shall be comparative,
                   presenting the amounts as of December 31 of the current
                   year and the amounts as of the immediately preceding
                   December 31.  (However, in the first year in which an
                   insurer is required to file an Annual Audited Financial
                   Report, the comparative data may be omitted.)

               B)  Amounts may be rounded to the nearest thousand dollars.

          8)  Supplementary Data and Information.  This will include any
              additional clarifying information or data which the Director
              may require to be disclosed.

          9)  In the case of Canadian and British insurers, the Annual
              Audited Financial Report shall be defined as the annual
              statement of total business on the form filed by such
              companies with their domiciliary supervision authority duly
              audited by an independent chartered accountant.  For such
              insurers, the letter required by Section 925.60 of this Part
              shall state that the accountant is aware of the requirements
              relating to the Annual Audited Financial Report filed with
              the Director pursuant to Section 925.40 and shall affirm that
              the opinion expressed is in conformity with such
              requirements.

     (Source:  Amended at 19 Ill. Reg. 12229, effective August 14, 1995) 

 
Section 925.60  Designation of Accountant
 
     a)  Each insurer required by this Part to file an Annual Audited
         Financial Report must, within sixty (60) days after becoming
         subject to such requirement, register with the Director in writing
         the name and address of the accountant retained to conduct the
         annual audit set forth in this Part.  Insurers not retaining an
         accountant on the effective date of this Part shall register the
         name and address of their retained accountant not less than six
         (6) months before the date when the first audited financial report
         is to be filed.

     b)  If an accountant, who was not the accountant for the immediately
         preceding filed Annual Audited Financial Report, is engaged to
         audit the insurer's financial statements, the insurer shall within
         thirty (30) days after the date the accountant is engaged notify
         the Director of this event. The insurer shall obtain a letter from
         the accountant and file a copy with the Director stating that the
         accountant is aware of the provisions of the Illinois Insurance
         Code and/or Health Maintenance Organization Act and/or the Limited
         Health Service Organization Act and the Rules and Regulations of
         the insurance regulatory authority of the state of domicile that
         relate to accounting and financial matters and affirming that the
         accountant will express its opinion on the financial statements in
         terms of their conformity to the statutory accounting practices
         prescribed or otherwise permitted by that insurance regulatory
         authority, specifying such exceptions as it may believe
         appropriate.

     c)  If an accountant who was not the accountant for the immediately
         preceding filed Annual Audited Financial Report is dismissed or
         resigns, the insurer shall within five (5) business days notify
         the Director of this event.  The insurer shall also furnish the
         Director with a separate letter within ten (10) business days
         after the above notification stating whether in the twenty-four
         (24) months preceding such event there were any disagreements with
         the former accountant on any matter of accounting principles or
         practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
         procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
         satisfaction of the former accountant, would have caused it to
         make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in
         connection with its opinion.  The disagreements required to be
         reported in response to this subsection include both those
         resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction and those not
         resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction.  Disagreements
         contemplated by this subsection  are those that occur at the
         decision making level, between personnel of the insurer
         responsible for presentation of its financial statements and
         personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its
         report.  The insurer shall also in writing request such former
         accountant to furnish it a letter addressed to the insurer stating
         whether the accountant agrees with the statements contained in the
         insurer's letter and, if not, stating the reasons for which it
         does not agree; and the insurer shall furnish such responsive
         letter from the former accountant to the Director together with
         its own.

Section 925.70  Qualifications of Accountant
 
     a)  The Director shall not recognize any person or firm as a qualified
         accountant that is not in good standing with the American
         Institute of CPA's and in all states in which the accountant is
         licensed to practice or, for a Canadian or British company, that
         is not a chartered accountant.

     b)  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, an accountant shall
         be recognized as qualified as long as he or she conforms to the
         standards of the profession, as contained in the Code of
         Professional Ethics of the American Institute of Certified Public
         Accountants and Rules and Regulations and Code of Ethics and Rules
         of Professional Conduct of the Illinois Board of Public
         Accountancy, or similar code.

     c)  The requirements of this subsection (c) shall become effective for
         years beginning after December 31, 1994.  No partner or other
         person responsible for rendering a report may act in that capacity
         for more than seven (7) consecutive years.  Following any period
         of service such person shall be disqualified from acting in that
         or a similar capacity for the same company or its insurance
         subsidiaries or affiliates for a period of two (2) years.  An
         insurer may make application to the Director for relief from the
         above rotation requirement on the basis of unusual circumstances.
         The Director may consider the following factors in determining if
         the relief should be granted:

          1)  Number of partners, expertise of the partners or the number
              of insurance clients in the currently registered firm;

          2)  Premium volume of the insurer; or

          3)  Number of jurisdictions in which the insurer transacts
              business.

     d)  The Director shall not recognize as a qualified accountant, nor
         accept any Annual Audited Financial Report prepared in whole or in
         part by, any natural person who:

          1)  Has been convicted of fraud, bribery, a violation of the
              Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.
              Sections 1961-1968, or any dishonest conduct or practices
              under federal or state law;

          2)  Has been found to have violated the insurance laws of this
              State with respect to any previous reports submitted under
              this Part; or

          3)  Has demonstrated a pattern or practice of failing to detect
              or disclose material information in previous reports filed
              under the provisions of this Part.

     e)  The Director, as provided in Section 401 of the Code [215 ILCS
         5/401], may as provided in Administrative Hearing Procedures (50
         Ill. Adm. Code 2402), hold a hearing to determine whether an
         accountant is qualified and, considering the evidence presented,
         may rule that the  accountant is not qualified for purposes of
         expressing an opinion on the financial statements in the Annual
         Audited Financial Report made pursuant to this Part and require
         the insurer to replace the accountant with another whose
         relationship with the insurer is qualified within the meaning of
         this Part.

Section 925.80  Consolidated or Combined Audits
 
     a)  An insurer may make written application to the Director for
         approval to file a consolidated or combined Annual Audited
         Financial Report in lieu of separate Annual Audited Financial
         Reports if the insurer is part of a group of insurance companies
         which utilizes a pooling or one hundred percent reinsurance
         agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurer's
         reserves and such insurer cedes all of its direct and assumed
         business to the pool.  In such cases, a columnar consolidating or
         combining worksheet shall be filed with the report as follows:

          1)  Amounts shown on the consolidated or combined Annual Audited
              Financial Report shall be shown on the worksheet.

          2)  Amounts for each insurer subject to this Section shall be
              stated separately.

          3)  Noninsurance operations may be shown on the worksheet on a
              combined or individual basis.

          4)  Explanations of consolidating and eliminating entries shall
              be included.

          5)  A reconciliation shall be included of any differences between
              the amounts shown in the individual insurer columns of the
              worksheet and comparable amounts shown on the Annual
              Statements of the insurers.

     b)  The Director shall require any insurer to file separate Annual
         Audited Financial Reports although permission had previously been
         given to file on a consolidated or combined basis if the Director
         determines the reasons and/or circumstances given for approval of
         the consolidated audit, pursuant to subsection (a), no longer
         exist.

Section 925.90  Scope of Audit and Report of Accountant
 
     a)  Financial statements furnished pursuant to Section 925.50 of this
         Part shall be examined by an accountant.  The examination of the
         insurer's financial statements shall be conducted in accordance
         with generally accepted auditing standards. Consideration should
         also be given to such other procedures illustrated in the
         Financial Condition Examiners' Handbook promulgated by the
         National Association of Insurance Commissioners as the accountant
         deems necessary.

     b)  Property and casualty insurers shall require the accountant to
         subject the current "Schedule P - Part 1" (excluding those amounts
         related to bulk and IBNR reserves and claims counts) to the
         auditing procedures applied in the audit of the current statutory
         financial statements to determine whether Schedule P - Part 1 is
         fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
         statutory financial statements taken as a whole.  It is expected
         that the auditing procedures applied by the accountant to the
         claim loss and loss adjustment expense data from which Schedule
         P - Part 1 is prepared would be applied to activity that occurred
         in the current calendar year (e.g., tests of payments on claims
         for all accident years that were paid during the current calendar
         year).

     c)  Life, accident, and health insurers shall require the accountant
         to subject the information included in the "Supplemental Schedule
         of Assets and Liabilities" and exhibits thereof to the auditing
         procedure applied in the audit of the current statutory financial
         statements to determine whether such information is fairly stated
         in all material respects in relation to the basic statutory
         financial statements taken as a whole and agrees to the insurer's
         annual statement filed with the Department.

     (Source:  Amended at 19 Ill. Reg. 12229, effective August 14, 1995) 

 
Section 925.100  Notification of Adverse Financial Condition
 
     a)  The insurer required to furnish the Annual Audited Financial
         Report shall require the accountant to report, in writing within
         five (5) business days, to the board of directors  or its audit
         committee, any determination by the accountant that the insurer
         has materially misstated its financial condition as reported to
         the Director as of the balance sheet date currently under
         examination, or of any determination that the insurer does not
         meet the minimum capital and surplus requirement of the Illinois
         Insurance Code and the net worth requirements of the Health
         Maintenance Organization Act and the Limited Health Service
         Organization Act, as of that date.

     b)  An insurer who has received a report pursuant to subsection (a)
         above shall forward a copy of the report to the Director within
         five (5) business days after receipt of such report and shall
         provide the accountant making the report with evidence of the
         report being furnished to the Director.  If the accountant fails
         to receive such evidence within the required five (5) business day
         period, the accountant shall furnish to the Director a copy of its
         report within the next five (5) business days.

     c)  No accountant shall be liable in any manner to any person for any
         statement made in connection with subsection (a) and (b) above if
         such statement is made in good faith in compliance with subsection
         (a) and (b) above.

     d)  If the accountant, subsequent to the date of the Annual Audited
         Financial Report filed pursuant to this Part, becomes aware of
         facts which might have affected its report, the Director notes the
         obligation of the accountant to take such action as prescribed in
         Volume 1, Section AU561 of the Professional Standards of the
         American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as of June 1,
         1986, with no later amendments or editions.

Section 925.110   Report on Internal Control
 
In addition to the Annual Audited Financial Report, each insurer shall
furnish the Director with a written report prepared by the accountant
stating its evaluation of the accounting procedures of the insurer and the
insurer's system of internal control, including any remedial action taken
or proposed.  The written report shall include a description of any
significant deficiencies in the insurer's internal control structure noted
by the accountant during the audit.  SAS No. 60, Communication of Internal
Control Structure Matters Noted in an Audit (AU Section 325 of the
Professional Standards of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants) requires an accountant to communicate significant deficiencies
(known as "reportable conditions") noted during a financial statement audit
to the appropriate parties within an entity.  The written report shall be
filed annually by the insurer with the Director, on or before June 1, along
with the filing of the Annual Audited Financial Report.  The insurer is
required to provide a description of remedial actions taken or proposed to
correct significant deficiencies, if such actions are not described in the
accountant's report.

Section 925.115  Accountant's Letter of Qualifications
 
The accountant shall furnish the insurer in connection with,  and for
inclusion in, the filing of the Annual Audited Financial Report, a letter
stating:

     a)  That the accountant is independent with respect to the  insurer
         and conforms to the standards of the profession  as contained in
         the Code of Professional Ethics and  pronouncements of the
         American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants and the Rules
         of Professional  Conduct of the Illinois Board of Public
         Accountancy, or  similar code.

     b)  The background and experience in general, and the  experience in
         audits of insurers, of the staff assigned  to the engagement and
         whether each is an accountant. Nothing within this Part shall be
         construed as prohibiting the accountant from utilizing such staff
         as  deemed appropriate where use is consistent with the  standards
         prescribed by generally accepted auditing  standards.

     c)  That the accountant understands the Annual Audited  Financial
         Report and its opinion thereon will be  filed in compliance with
         this Part and that the Director will be relying on this
         information in the monitoring and regulation of the financial
         position of insurers.

     d)  That the accountant consents to the requirements of Section
         925.120 of this Part and that the accountant  consents and agrees
         to make available for review by the  Director, the Director's
         designee or the Director's  appointed agent the workpapers, as
         defined in Section  925.120.

     e)  A representation that the accountant is properly  licensed by an
         appropriate state licensing authority  and is a member in good
         standing of the American  Institute of Certified Public
         Accountants.

     f)  A representation that the accountant is in compliance with the
         requirements of Section 925.70 of this Part.

     (Source:  Added at 19 Ill. Reg. 12229, effective August 14, 1995) 

 
Section 925.120  Definition, Availability and Maintenance of Accountant Workpapers
 
     a)  Workpapers are the records kept by the accountant of the
         procedures followed, the tests performed, the information
         obtained, and the conclusions reached pertinent to his examination
         of the financial statements of an insurer.  Workpapers,
         accordingly, may include audit planning documentation work
         programs, analyses, memoranda, letters of confirmation and
         representation, abstracts of company documents and schedules or
         commentaries prepared or obtained by the accountant in the course
         of its audit of the financial statements of an insurer and which
         support its opinion thereof.

     b)  Every insurer required to file an Annual Audited Financial Report
         pursuant to this Part shall require the accountant to make
         available for review by the Director's examiners all workpapers
         prepared in the conduct of its examination and any communications
         related to the audit between the accountant and the insurer, at
         the offices of the insurer, at the offices of the Director, or at
         any other reasonable place designated by the Director.  The
         insurer shall require that the accountant retain the audit
         workpapers and communications until the Director has filed a
         Report on Examination covering the period of the audit, but no
         longer than seven (7) years from the date of the audit report.

     c)  In the conduct of the aforementioned periodic review by the
         Director's examiners, it shall be agreed that photocopies of
         pertinent audit workpapers may be made and retained by the
         Director's examiners.  Such review by the Director's examiners
         shall be considered an investigation and all working papers and
         communications obtained during the course of such investigation
         shall be afforded the same confidentiality as other examination
         workpapers generated by the Director's examiners.

     (Source:  Repealed at 19 Ill. Reg. 12229, effective August 14, 1995) 

 
Section 925.140  Exemptions
 
     a)  Upon written application of any domestic insurer, the Director may
         grant an exemption from compliance with this Part if the Director
         finds, upon review of the application, that compliance with this
         Part would constitute a financial or organizational hardship upon
         the insurer.  An exemption may be granted at any time, and from
         time to time, for a specified period or periods.  Within ten (10)
         days from a denial of an insurer's written request for an
         exemption from this Part, such insurer may request in writing a
         hearing on its application for an exemption.  Such hearing shall
         be held in accordance with the Rules of the Illinois Department of
         Insurance pertaining to administrative hearing procedures (50 Ill.

                         inconsistent with the company's
                         experience.

               D)  A company making a filing hereunder which
                   wants an effective date different from that of
                   the advisory organization's advisory effective
                   date must file either:

                    i)   Manual size exception pages in duplicate
                         establishing an automatic uniform
                         delayed effective date applicable to all
                         future advisory organization rule
                         revisions, or

                    ii)  Copies of the Advisory Organization
                         Checking Slip, in duplicate,
                         establishing a special effective date
                         for a particular advisory organization
                         rule revision.

     d)  All filings must be received by the Illinois Department
         of Insurance, Property and Liability Evaluation Section,
         Springfield, Illinois no later than 30 days after their
         effective date.

     e)  In addition to the filings as required herein, the
         Director of Insurance may require the filing of
         statistical data and any other pertinent information
         necessary to determine the manner of promulgation and
         the acceptability or unacceptability of a filing for
         rules, minimum premiums, rates, forms or any combination
         thereof.

     f)  Groups, associations, organizations or companies
         authorized to engage in joint underwriting and joint
         reinsurance activities are prohibited from establishing
         underwriting rules with respect to rates which in any
         way inhibit a company from individually underwriting any
         risks.

     g)  If after a review of the filings, the Director
         determines that the underwriting rules rating plans or
         rates as filed may be excessive, inadequate or unfairly
         discriminatory, he may call a hearing.

If any Section or portion of a Section of this Rule, or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of the Rule or the
applicability of such provision or circumstance shall not be
affected thereby.

Section 930.10  Authority
 
This Part is adopted and promulgated by the Director of Insurance
pursuant to Section 401 and Article XXVI of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, pars. 1013 and 1028
et seq.) relating to unfair methods of competition and unfair
deceptive acts and practices.

 
Section 930.20  Purpose

     a)  The purpose of this Part is to require insurers to
         deliver to purchasers of life insurance, information
         which will improve the buyer's ability to select the
         most appropriate plan of life insurance for his needs,
         improve the buyer's understanding of the basic features
         of the policy which has been purchased or which is under
         consideration and improve the ability of the buyer to
         evaluate the relative costs of similar plans of life
         insurance.

     b)  This Part does not prohibit the use of additional
         material which is not in violation of this regulation or
         any other statute or regulation.

 
Section 930.30  Scope
 
     a)  Except as hereafter exempted, this Part shall apply to
         any solicitation, negotiation or procurement of life
         insurance occurring within this state.  This Part shall
         apply to any issuer of life insurance contracts
         including fraternal benefit societies.

     b)  Unless otherwise specifically included, this regulation
         shall not apply to:

              relating to preneed funeral contracts or
              prearrangements as provided herein.  These
              disclosure requirements shall extend to the

              the master policy.)

          4)  Franchise life insurance as defined in Construction
              and Filing of Life Insurance and Annuity Forms (50
              Ill. Adm. Code 1405).

          5)  Life insurance policies issued in connection with
              pension and welfare plans as defined by and which
              are subject to the federal Employee Retirement
              Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1001
              et seq.).

          6)  Variable life insurance under which the death
              benefits and cash values vary in accordance with
              unit values of investments held in a separate
              account.

     (Source:  Amended at 14 Ill. Reg. 13594, effective August
         14, 1990) 

 
Section 930.40  Definitions
 
For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions
shall apply:

     a)  "Buyer's Guide".  A Buyer's Guide is a document which
         contains, and is  limited to, the language contained in
         Exhibit A prescribed by Section 930.80 of this Part.

     b)  "Cash Dividend".  A Cash Dividend is the current
         illustrated dividend which can be applied toward payment
         of the gross premium.

     c)  "Equivalent Level Annual Dividend".  The Equivalent
         Level Annual Dividend is calculated by applying the
         following steps:

          1)  Accumulate the annual cash dividends at five
              percent interest compounded annually to the end of
              the tenth and twentieth policy years.

          2)  Divide each accumulation of subsection (1) above by
              an interest factor that converts it into one
              equivalent level annual amount that, if paid at the
              beginning of each year, would accrue to the values
              in subsection (1) over the respective periods
              stipulated in subsection (1).  If the period is ten
              years, the factor is 13.207 and if the period is
              twenty years, the factor is 34.719.

          3)  Divide the results of subsection (2) by the number
              of thousands of the Equivalent Level Death Benefit
              to arrive at the Equivalent Level Annual Dividend.

     d)  "Equivalent Level Death Benefit".  The Equivalent Level
         Death Benefit of a policy or term life insurance rider
         is an amount calculated as follows:

          1)  Accumulate the guaranteed amount payable upon
              death, regardless of the cause of death, at the
              beginning of each policy year for ten and twenty
              years at five per cent interest compounded annually
              to the end of the tenth and twentieth policy years
              respectively.

          2)  Divide each accumulation of subsection (1) above by
              an interest factor that converts it into one
              equivalent level annual amount that, if paid at the
              beginning of each year, would accrue to the value
              in subsection (1) over the respective periods
              stipulated in subsection (1).  If the period is ten
              years, the factor is 13.207 and if the period is
              twenty years, the factor is 34.719.

     e)  "Generic Name".  Generic Name means a short title which
         is descriptive of the premium and benefit patterns of a
         policy or a rider.

     f)  "Life Insurance Cost Indexes".

          1)  Life Insurance Surrender Cost Index.  The Life
              Insurance Surrender Cost Index is calculated by
              applying the following steps:

               A)  Determine the guaranteed cash surrender value,
                   if any.

               B)  For participating policies, add the terminal
                   dividend payable upon surrender, if any, to
                   the accumulation of the annual Cash Dividends
                   at five percent interest compounded annually
                   to the end of the period selected and add this
                   sum to the amount determined in subsection A.

               C)  Divide the result of subsection (B)
                   (subsection (A) for guaranteed-cost policies)
                   by an interest factor that converts it into an
                   equivalent level annual amount that, if paid
                   at the beginning of each year, would accrue to
                   the value in subsection (B) (subsection (A)
                   for guaranteed cost policies) over the
                   respective periods stipulated in subsection
                   (A).  If the period is ten years, the factor
                   is 13.207 and if the period is twenty years,
                   the factor is 34.719.

               D)  Determine the equivalent level premium by
                   accumulating each annual premium payable for
                   the basic policy or rider at five percent
                   interest compounded  annually to the end of
                   the period stipulated in subsection (A) and
                   dividing the result by the respective factors
                   stated in subsection (C)  (this amount is the
                   annual premium payable for a level premium
                   plan).

               E)  Subtract the result of subsection (C) from
                   subsection (D).

               F)  Divide the result of subsection (E) by the
                   number of thousands of the Equivalent Level
                   Death Benefit to arrive at the Life Insurance
                   Surrender Cost Index.

          2)  "Life Insurance Net Payment Cost Index".  The Life
              Insurance Net Payment Cost Index is calculated in
              the same manner as the comparable Life Insurance
              Cost Index except that the cash surrender value and
              any terminal dividend are set at zero.

     g)

          1)  "Policy Summary".  For the purposes of this Part,
              Policy Summary means a written statement describing
              the elements of the policy including but not
              limited to:

               A)  A prominently placed title as

               B)  The name and address of the insurance agent,
                   or, if no agent is involved, a statement of
                   the procedure to be followed in order to
                   receive responses to inquiries regarding the
                   Policy Summary.

               C)  The full name and home office or
                   administrative office address of the company
                   in which the life insurance policy is to be or
                   has been written.

               D)  The Generic Name of the basic policy and each
                   rider.

               E)  The following amounts, where applicable, for
                   the first five policy years and representative
                   policy years thereafter sufficient to clearly
                   illustrate the premium and benefit patterns,

                   years for which Life Insurance Cost Indexes
                   are displayed and at least one age from sixty
                   through sixty-five or maturity whichever is

                    ii)  The annual premium for each optional
                         rider.

                    iii) Guaranteed amount payable upon death, at
                         the beginning of the policy year
                         regardless of the cause of death other
                         than suicide, or other specifically
                         enumerated exclusions, which is provided
                         by the basic policy and each optional

                         at the end of the year with values shown
                         separately for the basic policy and each

                         (Dividends need not be displayed beyond

                         under the policy which are not included

                   the basic policy and for each optional term
                   life insurance rider.  Such indexes need not

                   benefits, disability waiver of premium,
                   preliminary term life insurance coverage of
                   less than 12 months and guaranteed
                   insurability benefits nor for the basic
                   policies or optional riders covering more than

                   the same durations at which Life Insurance
                   Cost Indexes are displayed.

               I)  A Policy Summary which includes dividends

                   statement in close proximity to the Equivalent
                   Level Annual Dividend as follows:  An
                   explanation of the intended use of the
                   Equivalent Level Annual Dividend is included
                   in the Life Insurance Buyer's Guide.

               J)  A statement in close proximity to the Life
                   Insurance Cost Indexes as follows:  An
                   explanation of the intended use of these
                   indexes is provided in the Life Insurance
                   Buyer's Guide.

               K)  The date on which the Policy Summary is
                   prepared.

              document.  All information required to be disclosed
              must be set out in such a manner as to not minimze
              or render any portion thereof obscure.  Any amounts
              which remain level for two or more years of the
              policy may be represented by a single number if it
              is clearly indicated what amounts are applicable
              for each policy year.  Amounts in subsection
              (g)(1)(E) above shall be listed in total, not on a
              per thousand nor per unit basis.  If more than one
              insured is covered under one policy or rider,

                  LIFE INSURANCE BUYER'S GUIDE

This guide can show you how to save money when you shop for life
insurance.  It helps you to:

-Decide how much life insurance you should buy.
-Decide what kind of life insurance policy you need, and
-Compare the relative cost of similar life insurance policies.

This guide has been prepared by the Illinois Department of
Insurance, in part using materials developed by National
Association of Insurance Commissioners.

(The following language shall appear at the bottom of page 2)
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is an
association of state insurance regulatory officials.  This
association helps the various State Insurance Departments to
coordinate insurance laws for the benefit of all consumers.  You
are urged to use this Guide in making a life insurance purchase.

THIS GUIDE DOES NOT ENDORSE ANY COMPANY OR POLICY

(The remaining text of the Buyer's Guide shall begin on page 3 as
follows)

Buying Life Insurance

When you buy life insurance, you want a policy which fits your
needs without costing too much.  Your first step is to decide how
much you need, how much you can afford to pay and the kind of
policy you want.  Then, find out what various companies charge
for that kind of policy.  You can find important differences in
the cost of life insurance by using the life insurance cost
indexes which are described in this guide.  A good life insurance
agent or company will be able and willing to help you with each
of these shopping steps.

If you are going to make a good choice when you buy life
insurance, you need to understand which kinds are available.  If
one kind does not seem to fit your needs, ask about the other
kinds which are described in this guide.  If you feel that you
need more information than is given here, you may want to check
with a life insurance agent or company or books on life insurance
in your public library.

Life insurance can be bought either on an individual basis or on
a group basis.  Group insurance may be inexpensive when compared
to individual insurance.  It is important to remember that
insurance purchased on this basis is usually term insurance, and
hence will not develop cash values, and is dependent on your
continued membership in the group or employment.  Also, the
amount of insurance that is available for purchase is usually
limited.

Choosing the Amount

One way to decide how much life insurance you need is to figure
how much cash and income your dependents would need if you were
to die.  Life insurance can provide cash for last expenses, and
income for you family's future living expenses.
Your insurance should come as close as you can afford to make up
the difference between (1) what your dependents would have if you
were to die now, and (2) what they would actually need at some
time in the future when needs change.

Choosing the Right Kind

All life insurance policies agree to pay an amount of money if
you die.  But all policies are not the same.  There are three
basic kinds of life insurance.

          1.  Term insurance
          2.  Whole life insurance
          3.  Endowment insurance

The kind of life insurance you purchase is dependent on the need
you are trying to satisfy.  Some needs are temporary, i.e. do not
exist throughout your life, while other needs are permanent.  As
an example, the need to finance your children's education is a
temporary need.  The need to meet mortgage payments is also a
temporary need since it exists only while the mortgage exists.
On the other hand, the financial needs of your family after your
death is a permanent need.

Remember, no matter how fancy the policy title or sales
presentation might appear, all life insurance policies contain
one or more of the three basic kinds.  If you are confused about
a policy that sounds complicated, ask the agent or company if it
combines more than one kind of life insurance.  The following is
a brief description of the three basic kinds:

Term Insurance

Term insurance is death protection for a "term" of one or more
years.  Death benefits will be paid only if you die within that
term of years.  Term insurance generally provides the largest
immediate death protection for your premium dollar.
Some term insurance policies are "renewable" for one or more
additional terms even if your health has changed.  Each time you
renew the policy for a new term, premiums will be higher.  You
should check the premiums at older ages and the length of time
the policy can be continued.

Some term insurance policies are also "convertible."  This means
that before the end of the conversion period, you may trade the
term policy for a whole life or endowment insurance policy even
if you are not in good health.  Premiums for the new policy will
be higher than you have been paying for the term insurance.

Whole Life Insurance

Whole life insurance gives death protection for as long as you
live.  The most common type is called "straight life" or
"ordinary life" insurance, for which you pay the same premiums
for as long as you live.  These premiums can be several times
higher than you would pay initially for the same amount of term
insurance.  But they are smaller than the premiums you would
eventually pay if you were to keep renewing a term insurance
policy until your later years.

Some whole life policies let you pay premiums for a shorter
period such as 20 years, or until age 65.  Premiums for these
policies are higher than for ordinary life insurance since the
premium payments are squeezed into a shorter period.

Although you pay higher premiums, to begin with, for whole life
insurance than for term insurance, whole life insurance policies
develop "cash values" which you may have if you stop paying
premiums.  You can generally either take the cash, or use it to
buy some continuing insurance protection.  Technically speaking,
these values are called "nonforfeiture benefits."  This refers to
benefits you do not lose (or "forfeit") when you stop paying
premiums.  The amount of these benefits depends on the kind of
policy you have, its size, and how long you have owned it.
A policy with cash values may also be used as collateral for a
loan.  If you borrow from the life insurance company, the rate of
interest is shown in your policy.  Any money which you owe on a
policy loan would be deducted from the benefits if you were to
die, or from the cash value if you were to stop paying premiums.

Endowment Insurance

An endowment insurance policy pays a sum or income to you - the
policyholder- if you live to a certain age.  If you were to die
before then, the death benefit would be paid to your beneficiary.
Premiums and cash values for endowment insurance are higher than
for the same amount of whole life insurance.  Thus endowment
insurance gives you the least amount of death protection for your
premium dollar.

Finding a Low Cost Policy

After you have decided which kind of life insurance fits your
needs, look for a good buy.  YOUR CHANCES OF FINDING A GOOD BUY
ARE BETTER IF YOU USE TWO TYPES OF INDEX NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN
DEVELOPED TO AID IN SHOPPING FOR LIFE INSURANCE.  One is called
the "Surrender Cost Index" and the other is the "Net Payment Cost
Index."  It will be worth your time to try to understand how
these indexes are used, but in any event, use them ONLY for
comparing the relative costs of similar policies.  LOOK FOR
POLICIES WITH LOW COST INDEX NUMBERS.

What is cost?

"Cost" is the difference between what you pay and what you get
back.  If you pay a premium for life insurance and get nothing
back, your cost for the death  protection is the premium.  If you
pay a premium and get something back later on, such as a cash
value,  your cost is smaller than the premium.

The cost of some policies can also be reduced by dividends; these
are called "participating" policies.  Companies may tell you what
their current dividends are, but the size of future dividends is
unknown today and cannot be guaranteed.  Dividends actually paid
are set each year by the company.

Some policies do not pay dividends.  These are called "guaranteed
cost" or "non-participating" policies.  Every feature of a
guaranteed cost policy is fixed so that you know in advance what
your future cost will be.

The premiums and cash values of a participating policy are
guaranteed, but the dividends are not.  Premiums for
participating policies are typically higher than for guaranteed
cost policies, but the cost to you may be higher or lower,
depending on the dividends actually paid.

What Are Cost Indexes?

In order to compare the cost of policies, you need to look at:

          1.  Premiums
          2.  Cash Values
          3.  Dividends

Cost indexes use one or more of these factors to give you a
convenient way to compare relative costs of similar policies.
When you compare costs, an adjustment must be made to take into
account that money is paid and received at different times.  It
is not enough to just add up the premiums you will pay and to
subtract the cash values and dividends you expect to get back.
These indexes take care of the arithmetic for you.  Instead of
having to add, subtract, multiply and divide many numbers
yourself, you just compare the index numbers which you can get
from life insurance agents and companies:

1.    Life Insurance Surrender Cost Index.  This index is useful
      if you consider the level of the cash values to be of
      primary importance to you.  It helps you compare costs if
      at some future point in time, such as 10 or 20 years, you
      were to surrender the policy and take its cash value.

2.    Life Insurance Net Payment Cost Index.  This index is
      useful if your main concern is the benefits that are to be
      paid at your death and if the level of cash values is of
      secondary importance to you.  It helps you compare costs at
      some future point in time, such as 10 or 20 years, if you
      continue paying premiums on your policy and do not take its
      cash value.

There is another number called the Equivalent Level Annual
Dividend.  It shows the part dividends play in determining the
cost index of a participating policy.  Adding a policy's
Equivalent Level Annual Dividend to its cost index allows you to
compare total costs of similar policies before deducting
dividends.  However, if you make any cost comparisons of a
participating policy with a non-participating policy, remember
that the total cost of the participating policy will be reduced
by dividends, but the cost of the non-participating policy will
not change.

How Do I Use Cost Indexes?

The most important thing to remember when using cost indexes is
that a policy with a small index number is generally a better buy
than a comparable policy with a larger index number.  The
following rules are also important:

1)    Cost comparisons should only be made between similar plans
      of life  insurance.  Similar plans are those which provide
      essentially the same basic benefits and require premium
      payments for approximately the same period of time.  The
      closer policies are to being identical, the more reliable
      the cost comparison will be.

2)    Compare index numbers only for the kind of policy, for
      your age and for the amount you intend to buy.  Since no
      one company offers the lowest cost for all types of
      insurance at all ages and for all amounts of insurance, it
      is important that you get the indexes for the actual
      policy, age and amount which you intend to buy.  Just
      because a "Shopper's Guide" tells you that one company's
      policy is a good buy for a particular age and amount, you
      should not assume that all of that company's policies are
      equally good buys.

3)    Small differences in index numbers could be offset by
      other policy features, or differences in the quality of
      service you may expect from the company or its agent.
      Therefore, when you find small differences in cost indexes,
      your choice should be based on something other than cost.

4)    In any event, you will need other information on which to
      base your purchase decision.  BE SURE YOU CAN AFFORD THE
      PREMIUMS, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ITS CASH VALUES,
      DIVIDENDS AND DEATH BENEFITS.  You should also make a
      judgement on how well the life insurance company or agent
      will provide service in the future, to you as a
      policyholder.

5)    These life insurance cost indexes apply to new policies
      and should not be used to determine whether you should drop
      a policy you have already owned for awhile, in favor of a
      new one.  If such a replacement is suggested, you should
      ask for information from the company which issued the old
      policy before you take action.

6)    An important fact to note is the difference in premium
      payments paid during one year's time based on an annual
      premium versus the annualized periodic premium.  For
      example, if you choose to pay premiums on a monthly basis,
      the annualized periodic premium would be twelve (12) times
      the monthly premium.  There may be a significant difference
      between the annualized periodic premium and the annual
      premium and it should be considered when deciding on a
      payment schedule.

7)    In order to assist you in comparing cost indexes for
      similar policies from many life insurance companies,  the
      Illinois Insurance Department will collect cost index data
      for a variety of different types of policies, issue ages
      and face amounts.  This information will be summarized and
      displayed in a yardstick format.  This information along
      with explanatory information will be available at your
      local public library starting July 1, 1980.  Periodic
      updates will be made in order to keep the yardsticks as
      current as possible.

Important Things to Remember - A Summary

The first decision you must make when buying a life insurance
policy is choosing a policy whose benefits and premiums most
closely meet your needs and ability to pay.  Next, find a policy
which is also a relatively good buy.  If you compare Surrender
Cost Indexes and Net Payment Cost Indexes of similar competing
policies, your chances of finding a relatively good buy will be
better than if you do not shop.  REMEMBER, LOOK FOR POLICIES WITH
LOWER COST INDEX NUMBERS.  A good life insurance agent can help
you to choose the amount of life insurance and kind of policy you
want and will give you cost indexes so that you can make cost
comparisons of similar policies.

DON'T BUY LIFE INSURANCE UNLESS YOU INTEND TO STICK WITH IT.  A
policy which is a good buy when held for 20 years can be very
costly if you quit during the early years of the policy.  If you
surrender such a policy during the first few years, you may get
little or nothing back and much of your premium may have been
used for company expenses.

Read your new policy carefully, and ask the agent or company for
an explanation of anything you do not understand.  Whatever you
decide now, it is important to review your life insurance program
every few years to keep up with changes in your income and
responsibilities.

Section 940.10  Purpose
 
This Part is issued to Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code
(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 73, par. 1013) in order to implement
Section 143.16a(e) by the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
Stat. 1985, ch. 73, par. 755.16a(e) by establishing standards and
procedures for the filing and acceptance of certifications of the
loss of reinsurance by the Illinois Director of Insurance.

 
Section 940.20  Definitions
 
     a)  "Department" shall mean the Illinois Department of
         Insurance.

     b)  "Director" shall mean the Illinois Director of
         Insurance.

 
Section 940.30  Certification
 
     a)  No notice of cancellation may be issued by any insurer
         under authority of Section 143.16a(e) of the Illinois
         Insurance Code unless the insurer has filed the
         certification and documents described by this section
         and received notification of its acceptance from the
         Director.

     b)  Certification of the loss of reinsurance under Section
         143.16a(e) of the Illinois Insurance Code shall consist
         of a written statement signed by a  principal officer of
         the company identifying the specific lines of insurance
         affected by the loss of reinsurance, giving an estimate
         of the number of Illinois policies to be cancelled,
         describing the reason for the loss of reinsurance,
         describing all efforts to renew and/or replace the
         reinsurance lost, and affirming that the insurer will
         cancel only those policies which were covered by the
         lost reinsurance.

     c)  Every certification filed under this Part must be
         accompanied by the following documents:

          1)  a copy of the reinsurance contract which had
              provided coverage for the policies to be cancelled;

          2)  a copy of any notice of cancellation of reinsurance
              issued by the reinsurer and effecting the policies
              to be cancelled;

          3)  a copy of any amendment purporting to omit
              reinsurance coverage for the policies to be
              cancelled; and

          4)  a copy of any new reinsurance contract replacing
              the lost reinsurance and purporting to omit
              reinsurance coverage for the policies to be
              cancelled.

     d)  The Director shall give written notice of his acceptance
         of a certification within 30 days of its receipt by the
         Department, unless:

          1)  the filing does not comply with the requirements of
              this Part;

          2)  the filing is insufficient to demonstrate that the
              loss of reinsurance was involuntary on the part of
              the insurer making the filing;

          3)  the certification appears to be untrue; or

          4)  the reinsurance lost does not cover a substantial
              part of the underlying risk.  In determining
              whether or not the reinsurance covers a substantial
              part of the underlying risk, the Director shall
              consider:

               A)  the risk of loss to the insurer in providing
                   coverage to the underlying risk without
                   reinsurance, as compared to such risk of loss
                   to the insurer assuming the reinsurance of the
                   underlying risk continues;

               B)  whether or not the reinsurance terminated
                   actually provided for a transfer of risk from
                   the insurer to the reinsurer; and

               C)  whether or not the termination of the
                   reinsurance contract resulted in, or will
                   result in a decrease in the insurer's
                   statutory capital and surplus as described in
                   (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 786.1).

     e)  Whenever the Director refuses to accept a certification
         he shall give written notice stating the reason for such
         refusal within 30 days of the receipt of the
         certification by the Department.

     f)  The Director's written notice of refusal shall be issued
         under and governed by the provisions of Sections 401.1
         or 403A of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.
         1987, ch. 73, pars. 1013.1 or 1015A) and the insurer
         shall be entitled to all rights of hearing provided for
         therein and in accordance with 50 Illinois
         Administrative Code 2402.

Section 942.10  Authority
 
This Part implements and is authorized by Section 3.1(n) of the Illinois
Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/3.1(n)].

 
Section 942.20  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Part is to allow credit or loss settlements to be taken
by a licensed insurer when there is a tax allocation agreement.

 
Section 942.30  Applicability
 
     a)  Every insurer that is a party to a consolidated corporate income
         tax filing shall have a written agreement governing its
         participation therein approved by the insurer's Board of
         Directors.  The agreement, in addition to all amendments and
         terminations thereto, shall be filed with the Director within
         thirty (30) days after approval or within sixty (60) days after
         the effective date of this Part.

     b)  The ultimate holding corporation, any intermediate corporation
         which owns a controlling interest, as that term is defined in
         Section 131.1(b) of the Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS
         5/131.1(b)], in the stock of the insurer, and the insurer itself
         shall be parties to, but need not necessarily participate in, the
         consolidated corporate income tax agreement.  In the case of an
         alien owned insurer, the ultimate United States corporation, on
         whose behalf the consolidated corporate income tax return is
         filed, may be substituted for the ultimate holding corporation.

 
Section 942.40  Settlements
 
Any settlement resulting under the agreement shall be made within thirty
(30) days after filing the actual consolidated corporate income tax return.
Any settlements that result from revised or amended returns shall be made
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such refund.  In the case where a
refund is due the parent, the parent may defer payment to the insurer
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such refund.  All settlements
shall be in cash or securities eligible as investments pursuant to Section
125.1a through 125.14a of the Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/125a
through 125.14a] for such insurer, at market value.

 
Section 942.50  Tax Allocation Methods
 
Any tax allocations, including penalties, interest, etc., shall be made
between affiliates as if it would have been done on a separate return basis
or on any other basis allowable pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (26
USCS 1552).

Code 952 apply to Credit Life Insurance.

<p>   "Prima Facie Rate" means a rate which will be accepted by the Director without filing detailed
actuarial support as providing a reasonable credit life insurance benefit in relation to the premium
charged.

<p><strong>Section 951.50</strong>  Credit Life Insurance Rates

<p> A credit life insurance rate shall be considered prima facie reasonable in relation to the benefits
provided if the rate is not greater than that set forth below in subsection (a) for coverage
containing no more restrictive exclusions than those described in subsection (b) of this Section.

<p>   a) Premium Rate. Credit life insurance premium rates for  the insured portion of an
indebtedness repayable in  equal monthly installments, where the insured portion of  the
indebtedness decreases uniformly by the amount of  the monthly installment paid, shall be as set
forth in  subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3). Subsections (a)(4),  (5) and (6) refer to premium rates for
other types of  benefits either alone or in combination with the type of  benefits applicable to
subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3). 

<p>  1) If premiums are payable monthly on the outstanding  insured balance basis for term insurance
on a  single insured debtor, the prima facie premium rate  shall be $.72 per month per $1,000 of
outstanding  insured indebtedness.

<p>  2) If premiums are payable on a single premium basis  for term insurance which decreases in
equal monthly  amounts on a single insured debtor, the prima facie  premium rate shall be $.47
per annum per $100 of  initial insured indebtedness.

<p>  3) If premiums are payable on a single premium basis  for level term insurance on a single
insured  debtor, the prima facie premium rate shall be $.94  per annum per $100 of initial insured
indebtedness. 

<p>  4) A combination of the appropriate rate for level  term and the appropriate rate for decreasing
term  (with equal decrements), if coverage provided is a  combination of level term and
decreasing term (with  equal decrements) on a single insured debtor. 

<p>  5) Joint credit life rate shall be 1.67 times the  appropriate single life rate.

<p>  6) If the benefits provided are other than those  described in subsections (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) and 
(5) of this subsection, then rates for such benefits shall be actuarially consistent with the  rates
provided in subsections (a)(1), (2), (3), (4)  and (5) of this subsection.

<p>   b) Exclusions. The premium rates in subsection (a) shall  apply to policies providing credit life
insurance to be  issued with or without evidence of insurability, to be  offered to all debtors, and
containing:

<p>  1) No exclusions other than suicide within one year of  the effective date of coverage. Under
open-end  credit plans, the effective date of coverage may  apply separately with respect to each
additional  purchase or each additional loan to which the  coverage relates.

<p>  2) Either no age restrictions, or age restriction only  for initial eligibility, making ineligible for 
coverage debtors age 65 or over at the time indebtedness is incurred or debtors having attained 
age 65 or over on the maturity date of the  indebtedness, provided that coverage will remain in 
full force and effect in the event the insurer  accepts premium on a debtor whose correctly stated 
age exceeds the maximum for eligibility and the  premium is not refunded within 60 days of
receipt. 

<p>  3) Insurance written in connection with an open-end  credit plan may exclude from the classes
eligible  for insurance, classes of debtors determined by  age, and provide for the cessation of
insurance or  reduction in the amount of insurance upon  attainment of not less than age 65.

<p>  4) On insurance written in connection with open-end  credit plans where the amount of
insurance is based  on or limited to the outstanding unpaid balance, no  provision excluding or
denying a claim for death  resulting from a pre-existing condition except for  those conditions for
which the insured debtor  received medical diagnosis or treatment within 6  months preceding the
effective date of coverage and  which caused or substantially contributed to the  death of the
insured debtor within 6 months  following the effective date of coverage. The  effective date of
coverage for each part of the  insurance attributable to a different advance or  charge to the plan
account is the date on which the  advance or charge is posted to the plan account. 

<p>   (Source: Added at 12 Ill. Reg. 17145, effective January 1,  1996) 

<p><strong>Section 951.60</strong> Experience Reports and Adjustment of Prima Facie Rates 

<p>   a) Each insurer doing credit insurance business in this  state shall annually file with the
Director and the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)  Support &amp; Services
Office a report of credit life  business written in Illinois on a calendar year basis.  Such report
shall utilize the Credit Insurance   Supplement - Annual Statement Blank as approved by the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Such  filings shall be made no later than June
30th of each  year.

<p>   b) Commencing July 1, 1991, and triennially thereafter, the  Director will review the
appropriateness of the prima  facie rates set forth in Section 951.50 based upon  credible Illinois
experience data (statistical data that  would show a negligible sampling error) collected from 
companies writing credit life insurance in the State  during the preceding three years pursuant to
subsection  (a) above. The Director may determine therefrom the  rate of expected claims on a
statewide basis, and  compare such rate of expected claims with the rate of  actual claims for the
preceding triennium, if   actuarially appropriate, determined from the incurred  claims and earned
premiums at prima facie rates reported  in the Annual Statement Supplement and filed with the 
Director pursuant to subsection (a) above. The Director  shall also review changes in mortality
experience for  credit life insurance, changes in the average credit  life policy or certificate size,
changes in the fixed  and variable expenses for credit life insurance, and  other factors relevant to
the credit life insurance  premium rate including a reasonable profit margin for  insurance
companies writing credit insurance in   determining whether to recommend a change in the prima 
facie rate as a result of this triennial review of  credit life insurance experience.

<p><strong>Section 951.70</strong> Credit Life Rate Adjustments

<p>   a) No insurance company may charge or collect a credit life  insurance premium which would
not be considered   reasonable under this Part. Unless otherwise approved  by the Director
pursuant to this Section, no insurance  company writing credit insurance in this state shall  charge
or collect a premium rate in excess of the prima  facie rate established by Section 951.50 of this
Part  which shall be conclusively presumed to satisfy this  general standard.

<p>   b) No insurance company may charge or collect a credit life  insurance premium rate higher
than the prima facie rate,  unless it files with the Director 60 days prior to the  intended effective
date of such rate, credible Illinois  experience data, actuarial procedures and ratemaking 
assumptions in support of its proposed rate, and it  demonstrates to the Director in an
administrative  hearing (see 50 Ill. Adm. Code 2402) that a higher  credit life insurance rate is
reasonable in relation to  the benefits provided for each credit life insurance  policy form which
contains the rate. A hearing request  to determine the reasonableness of a rate must be made  in
writing by the insurance company seeking approval of  the policy form which contains the rate at
least 45 days  prior to the intended effective date of such rate. A  proposed rate will be approved
for a 12 month period  beginning on the effective date of the proposed rate  only if such
ratemaking procedure is actuarially sound,  and will produce a credit life insurance benefit that is 
reasonable in relation to the credit life insurance  premium charged by the requesting company
during the  next 12 months beginning after the effective date. No  policy form may be approved
for more than one year where  the rate contained therein is greater than the prima  facie rate
contained in Section 951.50.

<p><strong>Section 951.80</strong> Effective Date

<p>Approval of all forms not in compliance with this Part are hereby withdrawn as of 60 days
subsequent to the effective date of this Part, and may not be used unless an approved rider has
been attached bringing such form into compliance with this Part.

indicating that the insured does or does not currently work the minimum
number of hours.  Additionally, if the credit accident and health
insurance is offered on a guaranteed-issue basis, the individual policy
or group certificate must include a clear statement that stipulates the
minimum number of hours that must be worked a week.

<P><HR> 
AUTHORITY:  Implementing and authorized by Section 401 of the
Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par.
1013) [215 ILCS 5/401].
<P>
SOURCE:  Adopted at 18 Ill. Reg. 685, effective February 1, 1994.
<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 1103.10  Preamble
 
     a)  The Illinois Insurance Department recognizes that
         licensed insurers routinely enter into reinsurance
         agreements that yield legitimate relief to the ceding
         insurer from strain to surplus.

     b)  However, it is improper for a licensed insurer, in the
         capacity of ceding insurer, to enter into reinsurance
         agreements, for the principal purpose of producing
         significant surplus aid for the ceding insurer,
         typically on a temporary basis, while not transferring
         all  of the significant risks inherent in the business
         being  reinsured.  In substance or effect, the expected
         potential liability to the ceding insurer remains
         basically  unchanged by the reinsurance transaction,
         notwithstanding certain risk elements in the reinsurance
         agreement  such as catastrophic mortality or
         extraordinary survival.  The terms of such agreements
         referred to herein  and described in Section 1103.30
         would violate:

          1)  Section 133 and 136 of the Illinois Insurance Code,
              hereafter the "Code" (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73,
              pars. 745 and 748) [215 ILCS 5/133 and 136],
              relating to financial statements which do not
              properly reflect the financial condition of the
              ceding insurer;

          2)  Section 173.2 of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991,
              ch. 73, par. 785.2) [215 ILCS 5/173.2], relating to
              reinsurance reserve credits, thus resulting in a
              ceding insurer improperly reducing liabilities or
              establishing assets for reinsurance ceded; and

          3)  Section 188 of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch.
              73, par. 800) [215 ILCS 5/800], relating to
              creating a situation that may be hazardous to
              policyholders and the people of this State.

 
Section 1103.20  Scope
 
This Part shall apply to all domestic life, accident and health
insurers and to all other licensed life and health insurers who
are not subject to the same regulation in their domiciliary
state.  This Part shall also apply to licensed property and
casualty insurers with respect to their accident and health
business.  This Part shall not apply to assumption reinsurance,
yearly renewable term reinsurance, or certain nonproportional
reinsurance such as stop loss or catastrophe reinsurance.

 
Section 1103.30  Accounting Requirements
 
     a)  No insurer subject to this Part shall, for reinsurance
         ceded, reduce any liability or establish any asset in
         any financial statement filed with the Department if,
         by the terms of the reinsurance agreement, in substance
         or effect, any of the following conditions exist:

          1)  Renewal expense allowances provided or to be
              provided to the ceding insurer by the reinsurer in
              any  accounting period, are not sufficient to cover
              anticipated allocable renewal expenses of the
              ceding insurer on the portion of the business
              reinsured, unless a liability is established for
              the present value of the shortfall, using
              assumptions equal to the applicable statutory
              reserve  bases on the business reinsured.  Those
              expenses  include commissions, premium taxes and
              direct  expenses including but not limited to
              billing,  valuation, claims and maintenance
              expected by the  company at the time the business
              is reinsured.

          2)  The ceding insurer can be deprived of surplus or
              assets at the reinsurer's option or automatically
              upon the occurrence of some event, such as the
              insolvency of the ceding insurer, except that
              termination of the reinsurance agreement by the
              reinsurer for nonpayment of reinsurance premiums or
              other amounts due, including but not limited to
              modified coinsurance reserve adjustments, interest
              and adjustments on funds withheld, and tax
              reimbursements, shall not be considered to be such
              a  deprivation of surplus;

          3)  The ceding insurer is required to reimburse the
              reinsurer for negative experience under the
              reinsurance agreement, except that neither
              offsetting  experience refunds against current and
              prior years'  losses nor payment by the ceding
              insurer of an  amount equal to the current and
              prior years' losses  under the agreement upon
              voluntary terminations of  in-force reinsurance by
              ceding insurer shall be  considered such a
              reimbursement to the reinsurer  for negative
              experience.  Voluntary termination  does not
              include situations where termination  occurs
              because of unreasonable provisions which  allow the
              reinsurer to reduce its risk under the  agreement.
              An example of such a provision is the  right of the
              reinsurer to increase reinsurance  premiums or risk
              and expense charges to excessive  levels forcing
              the ceding company to prematurely  terminate the
              reinsurance treaty;

          4)  The ceding insurer shall, at specific points in
              time scheduled in the agreement, terminate or
              automatically recapture all or part of the
              reinsurance ceded;

          5)  The reinsurance agreement involves the possible
              payment by the ceding insurer to the reinsurer of
              amounts other than from income realized from the
              reinsured policies.  For example, it is improper
              for a ceding company to pay reinsurance premiums or
              other fees or charges to a reinsurer which are
              greater than the direct premiums collected by the
              ceding company;

          6)  The treaty does not transfer all of the significant
              risk inherent in the business being reinsured.
              Exhibit A of this Part identifies for a
              representative sampling  of products or type of
              business, the risks which  are considered to be
              significant.  For products not  specifically
              included, the risks determined to be  significant
              shall be consistent with Exhibit A;

          7)  Requirements concerning credit quality,
              reinvestment or disintermediation risk.

               A)  The credit quality, reinvestment or
                   disintermediation risk is significant for the
                   business reinsured and the ceding company does
                   not (other than for the classes of business
                   excepted in subsection (a)(7)(B) below) either
                   transfer the  underlying assets to the
                   reinsurer or legally  segregate such assets in
                   a trust account or  escrow account or
                   otherwise establish a mechanism which
                   segregates, by contract or contract
                   provision, the underlying assets.

               B)  Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection
                   (a)(7)(A) above, the assets supporting the
                   reserves for  the following classes of
                   business and any  classes of business which do
                   not have a significant credit quality,
                   reinvestment or  disintermediation risk may be
                   held by the  ceding company without
                   segregation of such  assets; Health Insurance
                   LTC/LTD, Traditional  Non-Par Permanent,
                   Traditional Par Permanent,  Adjustable Premium
                   Permanent, Indeterminate  Premium Permanent,
                   Universal Life Fixed Premium  (no dump-in
                   premiums allowed).  The associated  formula
                   for determining the reserve interest  rate
                   adjustment shall use a formula which  reflects
                   the ceding company's investment earnings and
                   incorporates all realized and unrealized gains
                   and losses reflected in the statutory
                   statement.  The following is an acceptable
                   formula:

                         Rate =     2  (I + CG)    
                                 (X + Y - I - CG)

                    i)   I is the net investment income [(Exhibit
                         2, Line 16, Column 7 of the Life,
                         Accident and Health Annual Statement)
                         and (Underwriting and Investment Exhibit
                         Part 1, Line 15 of the Fire and Casualty
                         Annual Statement)]

                    ii)  CG is capital gains less capital losses
                         [(Exhibit 4, Line 10, Column 6 of the
                         Life, Accident and Health Annual
                         Statement) and (Part 1A, Line 10, Column
                         7  of the Fire and Casualty Annual
                         Statement)]

                    iii) X is the current year cash and invested
                         assets [(Page 2, Column 1, Line 10A of
                         the Life, Accident and Health Annual
                         Statement) and (Page 2, Column 1, Line
                         8A of the Fire and Casualty Annual
                         Statement)] plus investment income due
                         and accrued [(Page 2, Column 1, Line 16
                         of the Life, Accident and Health Annual
                         Statement) and (Page 2, Column 1, Line
                         15, of the Fire and Casualty Annual
                         Statement)] less borrowed money [(Page
                         3,  Column 1, Line 22 of the Life,
                         Accident  and Health Annual Statement)
                         and (Page  3, Column 1, Line 7 plus Line
                         8 of the  Fire and Casualty Annual
                         Statement)]

                    iv)  Y is the same as X but for the prior
                         year

          8)  Settlements are made less frequently than quarterly
              or payments due from the reinsurer are not made in
              cash within ninety (90) days of the settlement
              date;

          9)  The ceding insurer is required to make
              representations or warranties not reasonably
              related to the  business being reinsured;

          10) The ceding insurer is required to make
              representations or warranties about future
              performance of the  business being reinsured;

          11) The amount of the total admitted assets of the
              ceding insurance company less the amount of all
              funds withheld by any reinsurer as a result of all
              reinsurance treaties is less than the total gross
              amount available to policyholders either through
              the exercise of policy cash surrender or loan
              provisions;

          12) The reinsurance agreement is entered into for the
              principal purpose of producing significant surplus
              aid for the ceding company typically on a temporary
              basis, while not transferring all of the
              significant risks inherent in the business
              reinsured, and  the remaining liability to the
              ceding insurer  remains basically unchanged.

     b)  Requirements for reinsurance of in-force business.

          1)  Agreements entered into after the effective date of
              this Part along with any subsequent amendments
              thereto, which involve the reinsurance of business
              issued prior to the effective date of the
              agreements or amendments thereto must meet the
              requirements of Section 174 of the Illinois
              Insurance Code  (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par.
              786) [215 ILCS  5/174].  Each filing shall include
              data detailing  the financial impact of the
              transaction.  The  ceding insurer's actuary who
              signs the financial  statement actuarial opinion
              with respect to valuation of reserves shall
              consider this Part and any  applicable actuarial
              standards of practice when  determining the proper
              credit in financial statements filed with the
              Department.  The actuary  shall maintain
              documentation and be prepared to  describe the
              actuarial work performed for inclusion  in the
              financial statements and to demonstrate that  such
              work conforms to this Part.

          2)  Any increase in surplus net of federal income tax
              resulting from arrangements described in subsection
              (b)(1) above shall be identified separately on the
              insurer's statutory financial statements as a
              surplus item (aggregate write-ins for gains and
              losses in surplus in the Capital and Surplus
              Account (Page 4, Column 1, Line 46 of the Life,
              Accident and Health Annual Statement and Page 4,
              Column 1, Line 30 of the Fire and Casualty Annual
              Statement), and recognition of the surplus increase
              as income shall be reflected on a net of tax basis
              in the "Reinsurance ceded" (Page 4, Column 1, Line
              5, of the Life, Accident and Health Annual
              Statement) and in the "Miscellaneous Income" (Page
              4, Column 1, Line 12, of the Fire and Casualty
              Annual Statement) as earnings emerge from the
              business reinsured.

                   For example, on the last date of calendar year
                   N,  company XYZ pays a $20 million initial
                   commission  and expense allowance to company
                   ABC for reinsuring  an existing block of
                   business.  Assuming a 34% tax  rate, the net
                   increase in surplus at inception is  $13.2
                   million ($20 million - $6.8 million) which is
                   reported on the "Aggregate write-ins for gains
                   and  losses in surplus" line in the Capital
                   and Surplus  Account.  $6.8 million (34% of
                   $20 million) is  reported as income on the
                   "Commissions and expense  allowances on
                   reinsurance ceded" line of the Summary of
                   Operations.  At the end of the year N + 1 the
                   business has earned $4 million.  ABC has paid
                   $.5  million in profit and risk charges in
                   arrears for  the year and has received a $1
                   million experience  refund.  Company ABC's
                   annual statement would  report $1.65 million
                   (66% of ($4 million - $1  million - $.5
                   million) up to a maximum of $13.2  million) on
                   the "Commissions and expense allowance  on
                   reinsurance ceded" line of the Summary of
                   Operations, and -$1.65 million on the
                   "Aggregate write-ins for gains and losses in
                   surplus" line of the Capital and Surplus
                   account.  The experience refund  would be
                   reported separately as a miscellaneous  income
                   item in the Summary of Operations.

 
Section 1103.40  Written Agreements
 
     a)  No reinsurance agreement or amendment to any agreement
         shall be used to reduce any liability or to establish
         any asset in any financial statement filed with the
         Department, unless the agreement, amendment or a binding
         letter of intent has been duly executed by both  parties
         no later than the "as of date" of the financial
         statement.

     b)  In the case of a letter of intent, a reinsurance
         agreement or an amendment to a reinsurance agreement
         must be  executed within a reasonable period of time,
         not exceeding ninety (90) days from the execution date
         of the  letter of intent, in order for credit to be
         granted for  the reinsurance ceded.

     c)  The reinsurance agreement shall contain provisions
         which provide:

          1)  That the agreement shall constitute the entire
              agreement between the parties with respect to the
              business being reinsured thereunder and that there
              are no understandings between the parties other
              than as expressed in the agreement; and

          2)  Any change or modification to the agreement shall
              be null and void unless made by amendment to the
              agreement and signed by both parties.
 

Section 1103.50  Existing Agreements
 
Insurers subject to this Part shall reduce to zero by December
31, 1994 any reserve credits or assets established with respect
to reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the effective
date of this  Part which, under the provisions of this Part would
not be entitled to recognition of such reserve  credits or
established assets provided, however, that such  reinsurance
agreements shall have been in compliance with the  laws and
regulations in existence immediately preceding the  effective
date of this Part.

 
Section 1103.EXHIBIT A  Risk Category
 
     Risk Categories:

     a)  Morbidity

     b)  Mortality

     c)  Lapse

         This is the risk that a policy will voluntarily
         terminate prior to the recoupment of a statutory surplus
         strain experienced at issue of the policy.

     d)  Credit Quality (C1)

         This is the risk that invested assets supporting the
         reinsured business will decrease in value.  The main
         hazards are that assets will default or that there will
         be a decrease in earning power.  It excludes market
         value declines due to changes in interest rate.

     e)  Reinvestment (C3)

         This is the risk that interest rates will fall and
         funds reinvested (coupon payments or monies received
         upon asset maturity or call) will therefore earn less
         than expected.  If asset durations are less than
         liability durations, the mismatch will increase.

     f)  Disintermediation (C3)

         This is the risk that interest rates rise and policy
         loans and surrenders increase or maturing contracts do
         not renew at anticipated rates of renewal.  If asset
         durations are greater than the liability durations, the
         mismatch will increase.  Policyholders will move their
         funds into new products offering higher rates.  The
         company may have to sell assets at a loss to provide
         for these withdrawals.

Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, pars. 798.1  and 798.2) [215 ILCS
5/186.1 and 186.2] and authorized by  Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance
Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.  1991, ch. 73, par. 1013) [215 ILCS 5/401].
<P>
SOURCE:  Adopted at 18 Ill. Reg. 2231, effective February 1, 1994.
<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 1250.10  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Part is to set forth the criteria which the  Director
shall use for identifying insurers in such operational  or financial
condition that their further transaction of  insurance business would be
hazardous to their policyholders,  certificateholders, creditors or to the
public.

 
Section 1250.20  Criteria
 
To determine whether the continued operation of any insurer  transacting
insurance business in this State might be deemed to  be hazardous to the
policyholders, certificateholders, creditors or to the public, the Director
may consider:

     a)  adverse findings reported in financial and market  conduct
         examination reports;

     b)  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  Insurance
         Regulatory Information System and its related  reports, the ratios
         of commission expense, general  insurance expense, policy benefits
         and/or losses  incurred to written premium or any other ratios
         used by  the Department of Insurance to determine an insurer's
         financial condition;

     c)  whether the value, liquidity, and diversity of the  insurer's
         asset portfolio when viewed in light of  current economic
         conditions assures the company's  ability to meet its outstanding
         obligations as they  mature;

     d)  whether the insurer's reinsurance program provides  adequate
         protection for the company's remaining surplus  after taking into
         account the insurer's cash flow and  the classes of business
         written;

     e)  the financial condition of any assuming reinsurer and its ability
         to meet its obligations to the insurer;

     f)  the insurer's operating loss in the last twelve month period or
         any shorter period of time, including  but not limited to net
         capital gain or loss, change in  non-admitted assets, and
         dividends paid to shareholders;

     g)  whether any affiliate, subsidiary or parent of the  insurer is
         insolvent, threatened with insolvency, or  delinquent in the
         payment of its obligations;

     h)  whether contingent liabilities, pledges or guaranties of the
         insurer, either individually or collectively,  involve an amount
         that will affect the solvency of the  insurer;

     i)  whether any "controlling person" or other affiliate of the
         insurer, each as defined in Article VIII 1/2 of the  Illinois
         Insurance Code, is delinquent in the transmitting or payment of
         net premiums or any other payables  to such insurer;

     j)  the age and collectibility of its receivables;

     k)  whether the management of an insurer, including  officers,
         directors, or any other person who directly  or indirectly
         controls the operation of such insurer,  fails to possess and
         demonstrate the competence,  fitness and reputation to serve the
         insurer in such  position;

     l)  whether management of an insurer has failed to respond to
         inquiries from the Department of Insurance concerning the
         condition of the insurer or has furnished false  and misleading
         information concerning an inquiry;

     m)  whether management of an insurer either has filed in  any state a
         false or misleading sworn financial statement, has released a
         false or misleading financial  statement to lending institutions
         or to the general  public or, in the books of the insurer, has
         made a  false or misleading entry, or omitted an entry of
         material amount;

     n)  whether the insurer's premium volume has increased to  the extent
         that it lacks financial and administrative  capacity to meet its
         contractual or statutory obligations;

     o)  whether the company has experienced cash flow and/or  liquidity
         problems;

     p)  the adequacy of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders
         relative to its outstanding liabilities and its financial needs;

     q)  any other relevant factors.

 
Section 1250.30  Director's Authority
 
     a)  For purposes of making a determination of an  insurer's financial
         condition under this Part, the  Director may:

          1)  Disregard any credit or amount receivable resulting from
              transactions with a reinsurer that is insolvent, impaired or
              otherwise subject to a delinquency proceeding or which is a
              slow payor based on  Schedule F or S of the Annual Financial
              Statements  filed with the Department of Insurance by any
              Illinois licensed company having receivables due  from that
              reinsurer;

          2)  Make adjustments to asset values attributable to  investments
              in or transactions with parents,  subsidiaries, or
              affiliates;

          3)  Refuse to recognize the stated value of accounts receivable
              if the ability to collect the receivables is speculative in
              view of the age of the  account or the financial condition of
              the debtor;

          4)  Increase the insurer's liabilities to cover any  contingent
              liability, pledge, or guarantee not  otherwise included;

          5)  Increase the company's reserves for losses, loss adjustment
              expenses, or unearned premium or any  other liability to
              reflect adjustments recommended  by the Department's
              financial examiners or actuaries or by the person preparing
              the statement of actuarial opinion as required by Section 136
              of the  Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch.
              73, par. 748) [215 ILCS 5/136] and the NAIC Annual  Statement
              Instructions for Property and Casualty  Insurers;

          6)  Make any other appropriate adjustment to the  company's
              assets and liabilities necessary to  reflect the insurer's
              financial condition.

     b)  If the Director determines that the continued operation  of the
         insurer licensed to transact business in this  State may be
         hazardous to its policyholders,  certificateholders, creditors or
         to the public, the  Director may issue an order requiring the
         insurer to:

          1)  reduce, by reinsurance, the total amount of its  present
              and/or potential liability for policy  benefits and loss
              claims;

          2)  reduce, suspend or limit the volume of direct  and/or assumed
              business being accepted or renewed;

          3)  reduce general insurance and commission expenses by specified
              methods;

          4)  increase its capital and surplus;

          5)  suspend or limit the declaration and payment of dividends to
              its stockholders or to its  policyholders;

          6)  file a written report indicating the market value  of its
              assets;

          7)  limit or withdraw from certain investments or  discontinue
              certain investment practices to the  extent the Director
              deems necessary;

          8)  document the adequacy of premium rates in relation to the
              risks insured;

          9)  file monthly financial reports;

          10) suspend or limit the repurchases of any of its own
              outstanding shares (i.e., treasury shares);

          11) seek prior approval of the Director before entering into any
              affiliated transactions;

          12) provide statement of actuarial opinion prepared by an
              independent actuary other than that person  having prepared
              the opinion filed by the company in  conjunction with its
              most recent annual financial  statements;

          13) disapprove the payment of any ordinary dividend or other
              distribution to shareholders;

          14) take any other action which the Director deems to  be
              remedial.

     c)  Any insurer subject to an order under subsection (b)  above may
         file a written request for an administrative  hearing.  The
         administrative hearing shall be conducted  pursuant to the
         requirements of Section 186.1 of the  Illinois Insurance Code
         (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73,  par. 798.1(5)(a) and (6)) [215
         ILCS 5/186.1(5)(a) and  (6)].

 
Section 1250.40  Judicial Review
 
Any order or decision of the Director shall be subject to  review in
accordance with Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil  Procedure (Ill. Rev.
Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 3-101) [735 ILCS  5/3-101].

         serving in such forces and is outside the home area,
         provided such death occurs outside the home area or
         within six (6) months after the insured's return to the
         home area in such forces or within six (6) months after
         the termination of service in such forces, whichever is

         units or within six (6) months after termination of
         service in such units; or

     b)  As a result of the special hazards incident to service
         in any civilian non-combatant unit serving with such
         forces, if the cause of death occurs while the insured
         is serving in such units and is outside the home area,
         provided such death occurs outside the home area or
         within six (6) months after the insured's return to the

war, within two (2) years from the date of issue of the policy,
while the insured is not in such forces or units, if the cause of

         or air operations in time of war.

Section 1403.10  Death by Disease - Exclusions
 
If death caused by any disease is to be excluded from the
coverage within the contestable period of the policy, each such
cause of death so excluded shall not be named by general class,
but be named specifically and individually by its accepted
medical designation.  All such exclusion clauses shall appear in
the Insuring Clause on the first page of the policy and shall be
printed in type having the same prominence as that used in the
remainder of the policy.

 
Section 1403.20  Statement of Amount of Insurance
 
The exact amount of insurance on the life of each individual
member of the family group shall be clearly stated on the first

name of each insured member of the family group, together with
the amount of premium charged for the insurance on each
individual within the group.

 
Section 1403.30  Methods of Calculation
 
No policy form shall require the use of any process of division
or confusing method of calculation in order to determine the
amount of insurance in force on an insured member.

 
Section 1403.40  Reference to Greater Amount of Insurance
 
No policy form shall contain any reference to an amount of
insurance greater than that to be actually paid on account of the
death of any one person in the  group.

 
Section 1403.50  Individual Applications - Family Members
 
Each person included as an insured member of a family group shall
execute an individual application, duly witnessed, in which the
amount of insurance on the insured member is specified and the
beneficiary named, -except that a parent or legal guardian may
execute an application on behalf of a child under the age of
fifteen (15) years.

 
Section 1403.60  Application Form Questions
 
Application blanks for family group life insurance policies shall
be composed of questions by the company in the form of clear and
direct interrogatories permitting answers by the applicant only
in the form of direct statements of known facts.

 
Section 1403.70  Changes in Rules
 
This part may be revoked, altered, amended, modified or
supplemented at any time hereafter, provided however, that

changes in then existing policy forms and application blanks as
may be necessary.

Section 1405.10  Authority
 
This Part is issued by the Director of Insurance (Director)
pursuant to Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code, which
empowers the Director...to make reasonable rules and regulations
as may be necessary for making effective... the insurance laws of
this State.  This Part implements Section 143 of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 755) by
establishing a "Policy Form Manual" designed to make uniform the
requirements and practices in the filing of certain policy forms
with the Director.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 22184, effective December
         16, 1988) 

 
Section 1405.20  Illinois Guidelines For Filing and Approval of Life and Annuity Forms
 
Following are some general requirements which should be helpful
to industry personnel involved in drafting and filing policy
forms.

     a)  Policy Forms

          1)  "Policy Form" Defined.  The term "policy form" as
              used in these rules is defined in the Insurance
              Code.  It means any policy, certificate,
              endorsement, rider, by-law or other matter
              incorporated by reference or application blank.  It
              does not include riders or endorsements issued or
              made at the request of the individual policyholder
              relating to the manner of distribution of benefits
              or to the reservation of rights and benefits under
              a life insurance policy.

          2)  Policy forms exempt from filing are as follows:

               A)  Notice Regarding Replacement (see 50 Ill. Adm.
                   Code 917.70).

               B)  Policy Summaries.

               C)  Buyer's Guides (see 50 Ill. Adm. Code
                   930.40(a)).

          3)  Policy forms prohibited pursuant to Sections 143(1)
              and 224(1)(c) of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill.
              Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 755(1) and
              836(1)(c)).

               A)  Certificates issued in lieu of a duplicate
                   insurance policy.

               B)  Forms containing provisions excluding scuba
                   diving, hang-gliding, motorcycle racing, race
                   car or stock car racing, or hazardous sports.

     b)  Form Numbers

          1)  Each "policy form" must be designated by a suitable
              form number which may be made up of numerical
              digits or letters, or both, in the lower left-hand
              corner of the first page.  The form number shall be
              sufficient to distinguish the basic form from all
              others used by the insurer.  Edition date and/or
              designation of a state where a special edition is
              required is permitted in such space, and if printed
              as a continuation of the form number, will be
              considered a part thereof.  The appearance of a
              company's stock number and/or printing date in
              proximity to the form number is permitted.

               A)  Where a descriptive title is in close
                   proximity to the form number, it will not be
                   considered a part of that number for approval
                   purposes unless inclusion is requested by the
                   company.

               B)  Refer to Section 1405.80 of this Part for
                   instructions relating to form numbers when
                   filing a policy on an insert page basis.

          2)  Since the form number must be sufficient to
              identify any form which has been issued by a
              company, each submission must bear a unique number.
              A recently approved but unissued form may be
              corrected or changed by filing a substitute page or
              form which may retain the original form number.

     c)  General Form Requirements pursuant to Section 149 of the
         Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73,
         par. 761).

          1)  The name of the company shall appear on the form.

          2)  Policy shall show location of the Home Office and
              Principal Office, if different.

          3)  Policy shall indicate the Issue or Policy Date and
              the Effective Date, if different.

          4)  Rubber stamp deletions, mechanical overprints or
              paste-over "stickers" are permitted with the prior
              approval of the Department (For rubber stamp
              endorsements, see Section 1405.20(d)(8) of this
              Part).

          5)  The name or title of any policy or class of
              policies may not misrepresent the nature thereof.
              The title shall be specifically descriptive such
              as: Term, Annuity, Endowment or Whole Life.
              Inclusion of words such as "special", "select",
              "preferred" or "inflation" are not allowed in the
              title as they imply receiving something not
              normally offered in a life policy in violation of
              Sections 143(1) and 149 of the Illinois Insurance
              Code.

     d)  Preparation of Forms

          1)  "Policy Forms" must be submitted in duplicate.

          2)  "Policy Forms" submitted for formal approval shall
              be submitted in the form intended for actual issue.
              Typewritten forms may be used only for single cases
              or when their use will be too infrequent to justify
              other preparation.

          3)  All blank spaces of each policy form must be filled
              in (completed in John Doe manner).  The purpose and
              use of the form shall be explained in the
              submission letter.

          4)  When submitting a "policy form" to which a copy of
              the application will be attached when issued, a
              copy of the application shall be attached to the
              policy form, or if previously approved, reference
              must be made to approval date and form number.

          5)  On applicable life policy forms, nonforfeiture
              values, if any, for the age and plan of insurance
              used in filling in the form, must be included.

          6)  On group forms, variable material may be indicated
              for language which may vary from case to case.
              Variable material shall consist of benefit
              provisions and benefit levels.

          7)  Procedures for filing and approval without review
              of life policies as well as the completion of
              Certifications of Compliance are set forth in 50
              Ill. Adm. Code 916.

          8)  All rubber stamp endorsements should be submitted
              for approval, in duplicate, under the insurer's
              letterhead and filed in accordance with 50 Ill.
              Adm. Code 916.

          9)  Combination forms (for Life and Accident and
              Health) shall be submitted in duplicate to both the
              Life Unit and the Accident and Health Unit of the
              Product Evaluation Section.

          10) Use of a 'pilot' form is recommended before
              submission of an entirely new series of policy
              forms.

     e)  Letters of Submission

         The letter of submission must be in duplicate, signed by
         a representative of the company authorized to submit
         forms for filing or approval and must contain the
         following information:

          1)  The letterhead of the company shall show the name
              of the company for whom the forms are being
              submitted.

          2)  The identifying form number of each form submitted.

          3)  If the form is a new one, not replacing an existing
              form, a statement to that effect.

          4)  If the form is intended to supersede another
              approved form, the form number and the approval
              date of the superseded form must be stated together
              with a statement as to any material changes.

          5)  If a company submits a form which has been
              previously submitted, but has not been approved,
              the company shall advise the Department of the date
              of submission or disapproval of the previously
              submitted form and any material changes.

          6)  If the form is other than a policy or contract,
              give the form number of the policy or contract form
              or forms with which it will be used, or, if for
              more general use, describe the type or group of
              such forms.

          7)  When a form is approved, one copy of the submission
              letters will be stamped "approved" and returned to
              the company.  To expedite individual approval, the
              Department of Insurance (Department) encourages
              companies to submit separate submission letters
              with each form submitted.

          8)  Reference to previously approved forms shall
              provide date of approval of such forms.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 22184, effective December
         16, 1988) 

 
Section 1405.30  Applications
 
     a)  General

          1)  The application for a policy  shall contain spaces
              for the name and signature of the producer or other
              licensee who solicited and wrote the application as
              required by Section 493.2 of the Illinois Insurance
              Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 1065.40-2)
              and the policy or contract shall contain spaces for
              a resident producer's countersignature if the
              policy has been negotiated, solicited or effected
              by a non-resident producer as required by Section
              497.2 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
              Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 1065.55-2).

          2)  The size of the type in the declaration portion of
              an application must meet a reasonable standard of
              legibility.

          3)  In applications providing for home office
              endorsement, there shall be no change in the amount
              of insurance or benefits, unless agreed to in
              writing by the applicant.

          4)  Applications shall fully comply with the applicable
              sections of Article XL of the Illinois Insurance
              Code, Insurance Information and Privacy Protection
              (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 1065.701 et
              seq.).

     b)  Health Questions

          1)  Questions requiring applicant's opinion regarding
              past or present health of a person proposed for
              coverage shall be asked as to the best of the
              applicant's knowledge and belief.

          2)  Questions regarding an applicant's past or present
              health which are phrased so as to require factual
              information rather than a statement of the
              applicant's opinion need not be so qualified as in
              subsection (b)(1) above.

          3)  Medical Authorization in an application may be
              handled in one of the following ways:

               A)  By a direct question to be answered "yes" or
                   "no" which clearly indicates that the
                   applicant has or has not waived the privilege;
                   or

               B)  By a statement in the declaration immediately
                   above or in close conjunction to the signature
                   line; or

               C)  By a separate authorization requiring a
                   separate signature of the applicant or other
                   person granting the authorization.

     c)  Automatic Premium Loan Provision

         The application may provide for a specific election of
         an automatic premium loan provision if such provision is
         offered in the policy.  Failure to elect on the part of
         the applicant shall result in no election of the
         automatic premium loan provision as provided for in
         Section 1405.40(c) of this Part.

     d)  Dividend Election

         If the contract applied for is participating, the
         application may provide for election of an available
         dividend option as provided for in Section 1405.40(j) of
         this Part.

     e)  Premium Mode

         "Salary Savings", "Salary Deduction",  "Payroll
         Deduction" and similar designations may be used.

     f)  Replacement

         Applications shall be drafted to comply with the
         replacement provisions of 50 Ill. Adm. Code 917.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 22184, effective December
         16, 1988) 

 
Section 1405.40  Policy Forms
 
     a)  Payment of Premiums

          1)  Receipt - Section 224(1)(a) of the Illinois
              Insurance Code requires that a policy of life
              insurance shall contain in substance the following:
              A provision that all premiums after the first shall
              be payable in advance either at the home office of
              the company or to an agent of the company, upon
              delivery of a receipt signed by one or more of the
              officers who shall be designated in the policy,
              when such receipt is requested by the policyholder.

          2)  Premium Deposits - Contractual premiums under
              individual policy forms may be captioned as
              "Premium deposits" (50 Ill. Adm. Code 909).

          3)  Prepayment of Premiums - Specific premiums may be
              paid in advance, subject to discount.

          4)  Advance Premium Deposits - A fund or account for
              payment of unspecified premiums (whether by policy
              or by rider) must conform to the requirements of
              Section 240 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill.
              Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 852).

          5)  Grace Period - Policy must provide for continuance
              in force during the grace period and deduction (not
              necessarily payment) of any unpaid premium in
              settlement under the policy pursuant to Section
              224(1)(b) of the Illinois Insurance Code.

     b)  Continuation of Premiums Beyond Maturity

         If a policy provides for continuation of premiums, on an
         optional basis, beyond an initial or normal maturity
         date, it must be made clear that coverage and all
         applicable policy provisions also continue while
         premiums are being paid.  The policyholder must be made
         aware of applicable policy values while premiums are so
         continued:  either by including such values in the
         policy, or by specifying that notices of the current
         value will be sent to the policyholder upon request.

     c)  Automatic Premium Loan Provision

          1)  Policy may provide benefit on a positive elective
              basis but not as an automatic nonforfeiture
              benefit.  For provisions regarding automatic
              premium loans in applications see Section
              1405.30(c).

          2)  Provision must conform to the loan provision of the
              policy, subject to Sections 224 (1)(f), 229.3 and
              229.5 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
              Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 836(1)(f), 841.3 and
              841.5). The provision must permit revocation of
              election upon written request.

          3)  Notification of the policyholder with respect to
              the initial interest rate on an automatic premium
              loan must be made as soon as it is reasonably
              practicable after making the initial loan, but in
              no event more than 90 days after the initial loan
              is made.  Notification need not be given to the
              policyholder when a further premium loan is added
              unless a loan rate increase occurs; a reasonable
              advance notice of any increase in rate must be
              made, but in no event less than 15 days prior to
              the increase in rate.  (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch.
              73, par. 841.5(b)(5)(ii) and (iii)).

     d)  Loan Interest Rate

          1)  Provision must conform to Sections 224(1)(f), 229.3
              and 229.5 of the Illinois Insurance Code.  Any
              variable rate must include a specified maximum rate
              of interest.  The Department requires filing of a
              description of procedure for changing a variable
              rate and notifying those policyowners who have
              outstanding loans of such change which must be made
              on a non-discriminatory basis.

          2)  The interest rate charged on a policy loan or the
              interest rate charged upon reinstatement of any
              policy form which was made under a policy issued
              after January 1, 1982, will not exceed the rate
              prescribed in Section 229.5 of the Illinois
              Insurance Code either as a maximum rate of not more
              than 8% or an adjustable maximum interest rate
              established from time to time by the life insurer
              as permitted by law unless the policyholder agrees
              in writing to the applicability of such provisions.

     e)  Contestability

          1)  Limited to a maximum of two years.  Permissible
              exceptions are "provisions relative to benefits in
              the event of total and permanent disability, and
              provisions which grant additional insurance
              specifically against death by accident and except
              for violations of the conditions of the policy
              relating to naval or military service in time of
              war or for violation of an express condition, if
              any, relating to aviation (except riding as a
              fare-paying passenger of a commercial air line
              flying on regularly scheduled routes between
              definitely established airports)"  as provided by
              Section 224(1)(c) of the Illinois Insurance Code.

          2)  The period of contestability shall be determinable
              from the policy, i.e., by reference to a specified
              issue date, policy date or effective date  as
              referred to in subsection (v) of this Part.

     f)  Limitation of Coverage

         Any limitation of coverage in event of death by suicide
         or other specified causes must be confined within the
         contestability period of the policy to comply with
         Section 225(l)(c) and 225(l)(f) of the Illinois
         Insurance Code.  Exceptions to this restricted
         limitation are given in Section 224(l)(c) of the
         Illinois Insurance Code and Section 1405.40(v)(2) of
         this Part.

     g)  Proof of Death

         Section 224(l)(j) of the Illinois Insurance Code
         requires due proof of death.  The Department requires
         that "proof" be singular (not proofs) and not further
         qualified, i.e., to require submission of "interest of
         the claimant".  Insurers shall not require that a
         specific form be used when submitting a claim.

     h)  Time Limit on Claims

          1)  Filing of Death Claims - There is no time limit for
              filing death claims if the claim is not conditioned
              upon other contingencies, i.e., prior disability or
              accident.  Section 224(1)(j) of the Illinois
              Insurance Code requires when there is a claim on a
              policy due to the death of the insured then
              settlement shall be made upon receipt of due proof
              of death.  For purposes of this subsection, due
              proof shall consist of sufficient evidence to
              establish in a court a prima facie case for payment
              of the claim.  Therefore, any limitation with
              respect to death claims arising during and
              contingent upon the insured's continued disability
              must be limited to a requirement that proof of
              disability be furnished within a stipulated period
              as a condition precedent to consideration of a
              death claim.

          2)  Filing of Disability Claims - Reasonable limits are
              permitted.  The form may require notification of
              disability during lifetime and continuance of
              disability and may eliminate accrual of benefits
              because of any disability which was in existence
              more than one year prior to furnishing proof of
              disability.

     i)  Participating - Non-Participating

         A policy must indicate whether the policy is
         participating or non-participating.

     j)  Dividend Provisions

         The following is applicable to individual policy forms:

          1)  Required Options - The policy must provide the
              dividend options required under Section 224(1)(e)
              of the Illinois Insurance Code.

          2)  Disposition of Dividends Left With the
              Company - The policy must indicate what disposition
              will be made of outstanding dividend credits in
              event of lapse, termination or maturity of the
              policy.

          3)  Other Dividend Options - In addition to the
              dividend options required under Section 224(1)(e)
              of the Illinois Insurance Code, other options (such
              as a one-year term insurance dividend option) may
              also be provided by the policy.  Provisions
              pertaining to the automatic withdrawal of any
              accumulated dividends or current and unapplied
              dividends for the purpose of paying premiums unpaid
              at the end of a grace period may be included if the
              policy provides for the notification of the
              policyholder of the application of dividends and
              the policyholder is  given a minimum of 30 days
              after the date of the notice within which to direct
              the insurer to reverse the dividend transaction.

          4)  One-Year Term Insurance Dividend Option - Provision
              must be made for the disposition of the value of
              any one-year term insurance addition in the event
              of lapse of the policy.  The policy may either
              provide for application of any cash value of the
              remaining one-year term insurance under
              nonforfeiture options, or a continuation of such
              term insurance.

          5)  Prohibited Provisions - Prohibited provisions
              regarding individual life policy dividends are
              cited in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 914.

     k)  Nonforfeiture Values

         The nonforfeiture value table must illustrate loan
         values and options available for each of the first 20
         years of the policy or its term, if less, and include a
         provision that upon request, the company will furnish an
         extension of the table.  Values and statements in the
         policy must fulfill the requirements of Section 229.2 of
         the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch.
         73, par. 229.2).

     l)  Standard Nonforfeiture Law - Paid-up Insurance Upon
         Death of Insured (Family Policy).

         A spouse or children entitled to Paid-up Insurance upon
         the death of a covered person under a Family or
         Parent-Child policy, shall be given the right to obtain
         the net cash surrender value of such Paid-up Insurance,
         and the form shall so state.  In lieu of a Table of such
         values, a statement may be included that a notice of the
         current values will be furnished by the company on
         request as provided for in Section 229.1(6) of the
         Illinois Insurance Code.

     m)  Inapplicable Language

         Inapplicable language is prohibited if the inclusion of
         such language results in inconsistencies, ambiguities or
         is misleading  as is required by Section 143 of the
         Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73,
         par. 755).

     n)  Back Dating of Life Policy

         While the Code prohibits a provision under which any
         policy purports to be issued or take effect more than
         six months before the original application was made,
         this limitation is not applicable in conversion from or
         exchanges of one form of policy or annuity to or for
         another form provided credit is given for the reserve
         accumulation of the converted or terminated policy, and
         the form clearly spells out acceptable provisions
         relating to indebtedness, tabular cash values,
         dividends, effective date, and dividend accumulations,
         if any, under the new policy as is prohibited by Section
         225(1)(b) of the Illinois Insurance Code.  The
         conversion or exchange may not result in the
         policyholder being charged for insurance protection that
         was not received.

     o)  Settlement at Maturity - Commuted Value of Unpaid
         Installments

         The form shall:

          1)  provide the basis for determining any commuted
              value as is provided for by Section 224(1)(k) of
              the Illinois Insurance Code; and

          2)  indicate whether benefits at death shall be payable
              to an estate or to a named beneficiary.

     p)  Supplemental Benefits - Accidental Death and
         Dismemberment Benefits; Prohibited Language

          1)  Supplemental Benefits may be added to a life
              policy, even though the Supplemental Death,
              Dismemberment and Loss of Eyesight Benefits are
              limited to accidental cause only as is provided for
              by Sections 4 and 362a of the Illinois Insurance
              Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 616 and
              974a).

          2)  Language in such supplemental benefits which does
              not employ "result" language, and which establishes
              an accidental means test or uses words such as
              "external," "violent," or "visible wound" is
              prohibited.  Additionally, contributory language
              (e.g., "or indirectly," "wholly or in part," or
              "contributed to by") is also prohibited.  For
              purposes of this subsection, "result" language
              includes but is not limited to death as a result of
              war, death as a result of suicide and death as a
              result of flying.  For purposes of this subsection,
              accidental means test requires that both the cause
              and result of the accident to be an accident.

          3)  Provisions for loss due to accident or accidental
              injury shall not contain language limiting,
              reducing or excluding liability for a loss
              resulting from purely accidental circumstances
              (e.g., involuntary, or unintentional ingestion of
              poison or an infectious organism, or inhalation of
              poisonous gases or fumes) as provided for by
              Section 143 of the Illinois Insurance Code.

     q)  Combination Life and Accident and Health Coverages in
         Individual Policies

         Life and Accident and Health coverages may be combined
         in an individual  policy provided, of course, all
         statutory requirements are met and the form meets the
         other tests for approval in Section 143.  All individual
         policies submitted must contain a premium breakdown as
         to coverages and contain a provision to allow for
         separation of either part.

     r)  Spendthrift and Creditor Clause

         The policy may include a Spendthrift and Creditor Clause
         providing in substance that, except as may be otherwise
         provided in the policy, a Beneficiary may not, at or
         after the maturity of the policy, assign, transfer or
         encumber any benefits payable hereunder, and, to the
         extent permitted by law, any such benefits shall not be
         subject to the claims of any creditor of any
         Beneficiary.  Because of the limitations in the
         statutory provisions relating to the exemption from
         execution, attachment, garnishment or other process for
         the debts or liabilities of the insured, no reference to
         these statutory exemptions is required as is provided
         for by Sections 238 and 241 of the Illinois Insurance
         Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, pars. 850 and 853).

     s)  Family Policy - Names of Spouse and Children

          1)  It is necessary to name the spouse and/or children
              in either the application or policy only when a
              separate premium is charged for the individual
              insured in either of such categories.

          2)  For additional family policy guidelines, refer to
              50 Ill. Adm. Code 1403.

         A form providing Term Life Insurance with conversion
         rights without evidence of insurability may not withhold
         such right of conversion because the covered person has
         established a Waiver of Premium Disability Claim.  The
         form may, however, withhold Waiver of Premium Benefits
         under any new policy resulting from the conversion, or,
         as an alternative reduce the face amount in such new
         policy by not exceeding 25% if Waiver of Premium
         Benefits is requested and provided in the new policy.

              expire no later than two years from the latter of
              date of issue of the original policy, date of issue
              of the rider containing the purchase option, date
              of change of the original policy requiring proof of
              insurability or date of last  reinstatement of
              original policy as is provided for by Section
              224(1)(c) of the Illinois Insurance Code.

          2)  Any new policy issued pursuant to a Purchase Option
              may contain a limitation of coverage with respect
              to death by suicide during the period the policy
              would be contestable in the absence of issuance
              under the Purchase Option as provided for by
              Section 1405.40(f) of this Part.

          3)  Company shall indicate to the Department how the

              answered only if coverages additional to those
              permitted under the Option are applied for.

     w)  Insurable Interest at time of Exercising Option
         In a Guaranteed Purchase Option a provision may not be
         included requiring the existence of an insurable
         interest when the person exercising the right to
         purchase is other than the insured.

     x)  Riders and Endorsements

          1)  Descriptive Title - Unless the nature of the rider
              or endorsement is obvious (e.g., Home Office
              Endorsement), the form shall contain a correct
              descriptive title.  Use of words such as
              "preferred", "special", "select" or "inflation" is

Section 1405.60  Franchise Life Insurance
 
Franchise (or Wholesale) Life Insurance is a form of personal
coverage issued under individual policies to a group under
conditions which are similar to Group Insurance but which do not
necessarily qualify under the Group Insurance definition.

     a)  Identity of Insureds

         Franchise life insurance policies shall not be used to
         insure heterogeneous groups, e.g., insureds in a state
         or locality.

     b)  Termination or Non-Renewal of Individual Coverage

         Termination either by cancellation or refusal to renew
         any individual contracts of the group is prohibited,
         unless all like contracts of the group are terminated or
         non-renewed at the expiration of the contract.  The
         termination or non-renewal conditions which may be
         included in such contracts are those which terminate
         coverage because of non-payment of premium,
         discontinuance of employment of the insured by the named
         employer, discontinuance of employee as a member of a
         class of eligible employees, or the discontinuance of
         membership in the designated organization or
         association, and in addition, coverage may be
         automatically terminated at a designated attained age.
         Any other termination or non-renewal conditions must be
         approved by the Director.
 

Section 1405.70  Annuities
 
     a)  Standard Provisions for Annuities and Pure Endowment
         contracts are stated in Section 226 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 838)
         and for Reversionary or Survivorship Annuity contracts
         in Section 227 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 839).

     b)  Group Annuities

         Required and prohibited provisions are not specifically
         set forth in the Illinois Insurance Code.  Contracts are
         subject to requirements of Section 143 and 236 of the
         Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73,
         pars. 755 and 848).

     c)  Group Variable Annuities

         The applicable jurisdiction for Group Variable Annuity
         contracts is the jurisdiction where the group master
         policy is delivered.

     d)  Fixed Dollar or Flexible Premium Individual Annuity
         Contracts - Options to Purchase Additional Annuity

         If options for the purchase of additional annuity
         benefits are provided, including a Flexible annuity
         plan, it must be made clear that the payments are
         considered "premiums" or purchase payments rather than
         deposits to distinguish annuity premiums from premiums
         placed in a Premium Deposit Reserve Account as provided
         for by Section 240 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill.
         Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 73, par. 852).

     e)  Notice to Policyholder

          1)  The policyholder must be made aware of the amount
              of annuity purchased, either by including a table
              of values in the contract, or by specifying therein
              that notices of the current or other values will be
              sent to the policyholder upon request.

          2)  The charges, including but not limited to
              withdrawal and surrender charges, minimum
              guaranteed interest rates, and a statement of the
              mortality table to be used must be incorporated in
              the policy as provided for by Section 229.4 of the
              Illinois Insurance Code.

     f)  Reinstatement

         Evidence of insurability may not be required in order to
         reinstate an annuity benefit.  However, such evidence
         may be a requirement for reinstatement of any
         supplemental benefits that may be attached to an annuity
         contract.

     g)  File and Use

         Procedures for filing and approval without review of
         annuity policies as well as the completion of
         Certifications of Compliance are set forth in 50 Ill.
         Adm. Code 916.

Section 1405.80  Alternate and/or Insert Pages
 
For "alternate" and/or "insert pages", a company may use the
following guideline:

     a)  If the policy jacket or the outside covers are to be
         used with more than one plan of insurance, the form
         shall be submitted on this basis.  The usual title and
         brief explanation of the type of policy need not be
         placed on the jacket or covers if the front cover is
         less than a full policy page, or if the cover contains a
         window.  In those instances, the applicable material
         shall be placed in a position on the first (or
         specification page) so that it would be exposed even
         when the cover jacket is over the first page as provided
         for by Section 224(1)(m) of the Illinois Insurance Code.

     b)  Where the policy is submitted and the review is desired
         with consideration given to each individual page, the
         insert pages shall be properly identified and the letter
         of submittal shall list each page as a form.

     c)  For submittal of alternate or insert pages to be used
         with existing policies in supply, if the page is to be
         inserted at the date of issue of the policy,
         consideration will be given if the form is properly
         identified.  The submittal letter shall fully explain
         the changes that would be made.

     d)  If a change is to be made on a previously issued policy,
         with the consent of the policyholder, this change shall
         be accomplished by an endorsement or rider approved for
         use in the State of Illinois as provided for by Section
         1405.40(x)(2) of this Part.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 22184, effective December
         16, 1988) 

 
Section 1405.90  Substitution Filings
 
A substitution filing of a new form for a previously approved
form having the same form number must contain the following:

     a)  The certification required by 50 Ill. Adm. Code 916 if
         the original form was approved pursuant to the File and
         Use provision of Part 916; and

     b)  The approval date of the original form and a statement
         that the original form was never used.

Section 1407.10  Purpose and Applicability
 
The purpose of this Part is to regulate accelerated benefit
provisions in individual and group life insurance policies,
contracts, riders, endorsements or amendments and to provide
required standards of disclosure. This Part is not applicable to
Long-Term Care policies, contracts, riders, endorsements or
amendments subject to the provisions of Article XIXA of the
Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, pars.
963A-1 et seq.).

 
Section 1407.20  Definitions
 
         "Accelerated Benefits" means amounts payable in advance
         of the time life insurance benefits would otherwise be
         payable because of the occurrence of a terminal illness
         or a qualified covered condition.

         "Qualified Actuary" means a person that meets the
         requirements of 50 Ill. Adm. Code 920.

         "Qualified Covered Condition" means any one of the
         separate covered conditions as set forth in Section 4,
         Class 1(a) of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par. 616(a), as amended by P.A.
         86-1176, effective August 15, 1990) the occurrence of
         which may result in the payment of an accelerated
         benefit of up to 25% of the face amount of the policy.

         "Terminal Illness" means a medical condition which, in
         the opinion of a physician who is licensed to practice
         medicine in all of its branches, would generally result
         in the insured's death within a period not to exceed 24
         months, or any condition which requires continuous
         confinement in an eligible institution if the insured is
         expected to remain until death.

 
Section 1407.30  Form Requirements
 
No policies, contracts, riders, endorsements or amendments which
provide for accelerated benefits may be issued for delivery in
this State unless they meet the following requirements.

     a)  General Standards and Practices

          1)  The name given to the coverage must be descriptive
              of the coverage provided and the terminology
              "accelerated benefit" shall be included in the
              descriptive title.  Products regulated under this
              Part shall not be described or marketed as
              long-term care insurance or as providing long-term
              care benefits.

          2)  The death benefit net of any outstanding policy
              loans shall not be reduced more than the amount of
              the accelerated benefits and any applicable accrued
              interest, or any applicable actuarial present value
              discount appropriate to the policy design.

          3)  The renewability and cost of any accelerated
              benefit life insurance policy must be guaranteed
              for the term of the policy or rider.  This
              requirement will not apply to coverage in which the
              insurer pays the present value of the life
              insurance face amount based on an applicable
              actuarial discount.  The requirements of this
              subsection are not applicable to group insurance.

          4)  The insurer may pay a present value of the face
              amount.  The calculation shall be based on any
              applicable actuarial discount appropriate to the
              policy design.  The interest rate or interest rate
              methodology used in the calculation shall be based
              on sound actuarial principles and disclosed in the
              contract or actuarial memorandum.  The maximum
              interest rate used shall be no greater than the
              greater of:

               A)  The current yield on 90 day treasury bills; or

               B)  The current maximum policy loan interest rate.

          5)  The insurer may accrue an interest charge on the
              amount of the accelerated benefits.  The interest
              rate or interest rate methodology used in the
              calculation shall be based on sound actuarial
              principles and disclosed in the policy or actuarial
              memorandum.  The maximum interest rate used shall
              be no greater than the greater of:

               A)  The current yield on 90 day treasury bills; or

               B)  The current maximum policy loan interest rate.

          6)  The interest rate accrued on the portion of the
              lien which is equal in amount to the cash value of
              the policy at the time of the benefit acceleration
              shall be no more than the policy loan interest rate
              stated in the policy.

     b)  Filing Requirements

          1)  All policy forms and certificate forms pertaining
              to an accelerated benefit shall be filed with the
              Department of Insurance for its review and approval
              prior to their use in this State.

          2)  If the filing is other than a policy or contract,
              the insurer shall provide the form number of the
              policy or contract form or forms with which the
              accelerated benefit filing is to be used.

          3)  If a form provides for a reduction in policy values
              following payment of the accelerated benefit, the
              insurer shall provide the Department with an
              actuarial explanation of the policy value
              reductions and the remaining premium, if any.

          4)  In no event will the benefit for accelerated
              benefit/terminal illness and accelerated
              benefit/qualified covered condition coverage be
              combined under one policy or rider.

          5)  The insurer shall file with the Department the
              disclosure statements it will utilize to comply
              with Section 1407.50 of this Part.

          6)  Concurrently with the accelerated benefit policy
              form filing required by this Section, the insurer

         condition, including clinical, radiological,
         histological or laboratory evidence of the condition.
         Insurers shall evaluate the medical evidence and may

          1)  Lump sum payments.

          2)  Payments of proceeds in installments.

              owner and the insurer  may agree.

     c)  Prior to payment of the accelerated benefit, the
         policyowner or certificateholder and any irrevocable
         beneficiary must give their written consent to this
         accelerated transaction.

 
Section 1407.50  Required Disclosure Provisions
 
     a)  If there is a premium or cost of insurance charge
         assessed, the insurer shall give the applicant an
         illustration numerically demonstrating the effect of the
         payment of the accelerated benefit on the policy's cash
         value, accumulation account, death benefit, premium,
         policy loans and policy liens.

          1)  In the case of producer solicited insurance, the
              producer shall provide the illustration to the
              applicant prior to or concurrently with the
              application.

          2)  In the case of direct mail solicitations, the
              insurer shall provide the illustration to the
              applicant at the time the policy is delivered.

          3)  Information on the policy values shall be furnished
              by the company upon the request of the policy owner
              or certificate holder.

     b)  A written disclosure including, but not limited to, a
         brief description of the accelerated benefit and
         definitions of the conditions or occurrences triggering
         payment of the benefits and an explanation of any effect
         of the payment of a benefit on the policy's cash value,
         accumulation account, death benefit, premium, policy
         loans and policy liens shall be provided the applicant
         in the following manner:

          1)  In the case of producer solicited insurance, the
              producer shall provide the disclosure form to the
              applicant prior to or concurrently with the
              application.  Acknowledgement of the disclosure
              shall be signed by the applicant and the writing
              producer, if any.

          2)  In the case of direct mail solicitations, the
              insurer shall provide the disclosure form to the
              applicant at the time the policy is delivered, with
              a notice that a full premium refund shall be made
              if the policy is returned to the insurer within 30
              days of the initial receipt of the policy by the
              applicant.

     c)  A disclosure statement is required at the time of
         application for the policy, rider or certificate and at
         the time the accelerated benefit payment request is
         submitted indicating that receipt of these accelerated
         benefits may be taxable, and assistance should be sought
         from a personal tax advisor.

     d)  When a policyowner or certificateholder requests an
         acceleration, the insurer shall send a written statement
         to the policyowner or certificateholder and any
         irrevocable beneficiary which demonstrates any effect
         that the payment of the accelerated benefit will have on
         the policy's cash value, face value accumulation
         account, death benefit, premium, policy loans and policy
         liens.

     e)  When the insurer pays an accelerated benefit, it shall
         issue a new or amended schedule page to the policy to
         reflect any new or reduced in-force face amount of the
         policy.

 
Section 1407.60  Reserves
 
     a)  When benefits are provided through the acceleration of
         benefits under group or individual policies or riders to
         such policies, policy reserves shall be determined in
         accordance with Section 223 of the Illinois Insurance
         Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par. 835).  All
         valuation assumptions used in constructing the reserves
         shall be determined as appropriate for statutory
         valuation purposes by a qualified actuary.  Reserves in
         the aggregate shall be sufficient to cover:

          1)  Policies upon which no claim has yet arisen; and

          2)  Policies upon which an accelerated benefits claim
              has arisen.

     b)  For policies and certificates which provide actuarially
         equivalent benefits, no additional reserves need to be
         established.

     c)  Policy liens and policy loans, including accrued
         interest, represent assets of the company for statutory
         reporting purposes.  For any policy on which the policy
         lien exceeds the policy's statutory reserve liability
         such excess must be held as a non-admitted asset.

         An "appointed actuary" is a qualified actuary who is
         appointed or retained to prepare the Statement of
         Actuarial Opinion required by this Part; either directly

         executive officer of the company.  The company shall
         give the Director timely written notice of the name,
         title (and, in the case of a consulting actuary, the
         name of the firm) and manner of appointment or retention
         of each person appointed or retained by the company as
         an appointed actuary and shall state in such notice that
         the person meets the requirements set forth in
         subsection (b) above.  Once notice is furnished, no
         further notice is required with respect to this person,
         provided that the company shall give the Director timely
         written notice in the event the actuary ceases to be
         appointed or retained as an appointed actuary or to meet
         the requirements set forth in subsection (b) above.  If
         any person appointed or retained as an appointed actuary
         replaces a previously appointed actuary, the notice
         shall so state and give the reasons for replacement.

         The asset adequacy analysis required by this Part:

          1)  Shall conform to the Standards of Practice as
              promulgated from time to time by the Actuarial
              Standards Board and on any additional standards
              under this Part, which standards are to form the
              basis of the statement of actuarial opinion in
              accordance with Section 1408.70 and Illustration A
              of this Part; and

          2)  Shall be based on methods of analysis deemed
              appropriate for such purposes by the Actuarial
              Standards Board.

     e)  Liabilities to be Covered

          1)  Under authority of Section 223 of the Code the
              statement of actuarial opinion shall apply to all
              in force business on the annual statement date
              regardless of when or where issued, including
              reserves and equivalent items in the separate
              account statement or statements.

          2)  If the appointed actuary determines as the result
              of asset adequacy analysis that a reserve should be
              held in addition to the aggregate reserve held by
              the company and calculated in accordance with
              methods set forth in Section 223(3)(b), (f) and
              (g), (5) and (7) of the Code, the company shall
              establish such additional reserve.

          3)  For years ending prior to December 31, 1994, the
              company may, in lieu of establishing the full
              amount of the additional reserve in the annual

              opinion based on an asset adequacy analysis and

          3)  A scope paragraph identifying the subjects on which
              the opinion is to be expressed and describing the
              scope of the appointed actuary's work; and

              actuary's opinion  as required by Section 223(1a)
              of the Code.

     b)  Recommended Language

         The following language is that which in typical
         circumstances would be included in a statement of
         actuarial opinion in accordance with this Section.
         Although language may be modified as needed to meet the
         circumstances of a particular case, and the appointed
         actuary should use language which clearly expresses his
         or her professional judgment, the opinion shall retain
         all pertinent aspects of the language provided in this
         Section.

          1)  The opening paragraph should indicate the appointed
              actuary's relationship to the company.

               A)  For a company actuary, the opening paragraph
                   of the actuarial opinion should read:  "I,
                   [name of actuary], am [title] of [name of
                   company] and a member of the American Academy
                   of Actuaries.  I was appointed by, or by the
                   authority of, the Board of Directors of said
                   insurer to render this opinion as stated in a
                   letter to the Director dated [insert date].  I
                   meet the Academy qualification standards for
                   rendering this opinion and am familiar with
                   the valuation requirements applicable to life
                   and health companies."

               B)  For a consulting actuary, the opening
                   paragraph of the actuarial opinion should
                   read:   "I, [name of actuary], a member of the
                   American Academy of Actuaries, am associated
                   with the firm of [insert name of consulting
                   firm].  I have been appointed by, or by the
                   authority of, the Board of Directors of [name
                   of company] to render this opinion as stated
                   in a letter to the Director dated [insert
                   date].  I meet the Academy qualification
                   standards for rendering this opinion and am
                   familiar with the valuation requirements
                   applicable to life and health insurance
                   companies."

          2)  The regulatory authority paragraph should include a
              statement such as the following:  "Said company is
              exempt, pursuant to 50 Ill. Adm. Code 1408.40 of
              the Illinois Department of Insurance rules from
              submitting a statement of actuarial opinion based
              on an asset adequacy analysis.  This opinion, which
              is not based on an asset adequacy analysis, is
              rendered in accordance with Section 1408.60 of the
              Part."

          3)  The scope paragraph should contain a sentence such
              as the following:  "I have examined the actuarial
              assumptions and actuarial methods used in
              determining reserves and related actuarial items
              listed below shown in the annual statement of the
              company, as prepared for filing with state
              regulatory officials as of December 31, [  ]." This
              paragraph should also list items and amounts with
              respect to which the appointed actuary is
              expressing an opinion.  The list should include but
              not be necessarily limited to:

               A)  Aggregate reserve and deposit funds for
                   policies and contracts included in Exhibit 8
                   of the annual statement;

               B)  Aggregate reserve and deposit funds for
                   policies and contracts included in Exhibit 9
                   of the annual statement;

               C)  Deposit funds, premiums, dividend and coupon
                   accumulations and supplementary contracts not
                   involving life contingencies included in
                   Exhibit 10 of the annual statement; and

               D)  Policy and contract claims - liability as of
                   the end of the current year included in
                   Exhibit 11, Part I of the annual statement.

          4)  If the appointed actuary has examined the
              underlying records, the scope paragraph should also
              include a statement which reads:  "My examination
              included such review of the actuarial assumptions
              and actuarial methods and of the underlying basic
              records and such tests of the actuarial
              calculations as I considered necessary."

          5)  If the appointed actuary has not examined the
              underlying records, but has relied upon listings
              and summaries of policies in force prepared by the
              company or a third party, the scope paragraph
              should include a sentence such as one of the
              following:

               A)  "I have relied upon listings and summaries of
                   policies and contracts and other liabilities
                   in force prepared by [name and title of
                   company officer certifying in force records]
                   as certified in the attached statement.  (See
                   accompanying affidavit by a company officer.)
                   In other respects my examination included
                   review of the actuarial assumptions and
                   actuarial methods and such tests of the
                   actuarial calculations as I considered
                   necessary."; or

               B)  "I have relied upon [name of accounting firm]
                   for the substantial accuracy of the in force
                   records inventory and information concerning
                   other liabilities, as certified in the
                   attached statement.  In other respects my
                   examination included review of the actuarial
                   assumptions and actuarial methods and such
                   tests of the actuarial calculations as I
                   considered necessary."

          6)  The opinion paragraph should include a statement
              which reads:  "In my opinion the amounts carried in
              the balance sheet on account of the actuarial items
              identified above:

               A)  Are computed in accordance with those
                   presently accepted actuarial standards which
                   specifically relate to the opinion required
                   under this Section;

               B)  Are based on actuarial assumptions which
                   produce reserves at least as great as those
                   called for in any contract provision as to
                   reserve basis and method, and are in
                   accordance with all other contract provisions;

               C)  Meet the requirements of the Insurance Law and
                   regulations of the State of [state of
                   domicile] and are at least as great as the
                   minimum aggregate amounts required by the
                   state in which this statement is filed;

               D)  Are computed on the basis of assumptions
                   consistent with those used in computing the
                   corresponding items in the annual statement of
                   the preceding year-end with any exceptions as
                   noted below;

               E)  Include provision for all actuarial reserves
                   and related statement items which ought to be
                   established; and

               F)  The actuarial methods, considerations and
                   analyses used in forming my opinion conform to
                   the appropriate Compliance Guidelines as
                   promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board,
                   which guidelines form the basis of this
                   statement of opinion."

          7)  The concluding paragraph should document the
              eligibility for the company to submit an opinion as
              provided by this Section.  It shall include the
              following:

               A)  "This opinion is provided in accordance with
                   50 Ill. Adm. Code 1408.60.  As such it does
                   not include an opinion regarding the adequacy
                   of reserves and related actuarial items when
                   considered in light of the assets which
                   support them.

               B)  Eligibility is confirmed as follows:

                    i)   The ratio of the sum of capital and
                         surplus to the sum of cash and invested
                         assets is [insert amount], which equals
                         or exceeds the applicable criterion
                         based on the admitted assets of the
                         company (50 Ill. Adm. Code).

                    ii)  The ratio of the sum of the reserves and
                         liabilities for annuities and deposits
                         to the excess of the total admitted
                         assets is [insert amount], which is less
                         than the applicable criteria based on
                         the admitted assets of the company
                         (Section 1408.50).

                    iii) The ratio of the book value of the
                         non-investment grade bonds to the sum of
                         capital and surplus is [insert amount],
                         which is less than the applicable
                         criteria of .50.

                    iv)  To my knowledge, the NAIC Examiner Team
                         has neither designated the company as a
                         first priority company in either of the
                         two (2) calendar years preceding the
                         calendar year for which this actuarial
                         opinion is applicable, nor a second
                         priority company in each of the two (2)
                         calendar years preceding the calendar
                         year for which this actuarial opinion is
                         applicable or the company has resolved
                         the first or second priority status to
                         the satisfaction of the Director of the
                         state of domicile.

                    v)   To my knowledge there is not a specific
                         request from any Director requiring an
                         asset adequacy analysis opinion.
                                                                 
                         Signature of Appointed Actuary
                                                                 
                         Address of Appointed Actuary
               
                         Telephone Number of Appointed Actuary"

          8)  If there has been any change in the actuarial
              assumptions from those previously employed, that
              change should be described in the annual statement
              or in a paragraph of the statement of actuarial
              opinion, and the reference to consistency in
              subsection (b)(6)(D) above to consistency should
              read:  ". . . with the exception of the change
              described in Page [  ] of the annual statement (or
              in the preceding paragraph)."  The adoption for new
              issues or new claims or other new liabilities of an
              actuarial assumption which differs from a
              corresponding assumption used for prior new issues
              or new claims or other new liabilities is not a
              change in actuarial assumptions within the meaning
              of this subsection.

          9)  If the appointed actuary is unable to form an
              opinion, he or she shall refuse to issue a
              statement of actuarial opinion.  If the appointed
              actuary's opinion is adverse or qualified, he or
              she shall issue an adverse or qualified actuarial
              opinion explicitly stating the reason(s) for such
              opinion.  This statement should follow the scope
              paragraph and precede the opinion paragraph.

          10) If the appointed actuary does not express an
              opinion as to the accuracy and completeness of the
              listings and summaries of policies in force, there
              shall be attached to the opinion the statement of a
              company officer or accounting firm who prepared
              such underlying data similar to the following:

                   "I [name of officer], [title] of [name and
                   address of company or accounting firm], hereby
                   affirm that the listings and summaries of
                   policies and contracts in force as of December
                   31, [  ], prepared for and submitted to [name
                   of appointed actuary], were prepared under my
                   direction and, to the best of my knowledge and
                   belief, are substantially accurate and
                   complete.

                                                                 
                         Signature of the Officer of the Company
                         or Accounting Firm

                                                                 
                         Address of the Officer of the Company or
                         Accounting Firm

                                                                 
                         Telephone Number of the Officer of the
                         Company or Accounting Firm"

 
Section 1408.70  Statement of Actuarial Opinion Based on Asset Adequacy Analysis
 
A Statement of Actuarial Opinion based on an asset adequacy
analysis shall be consistent with Illustration A of this Part.

 
Section 1408.80  Description of Actuarial Memorandum Including an Asset Adequacy Analysis
 
     a)  General

          1)  In accordance with Section 223(1a) of the Code, the
              appointed actuary shall prepare a memorandum to the
              company describing the analysis done in support of
              his or her opinion regarding the reserves under the
              opinion.  The memorandum shall be made available
              for examination by the Director upon his or her
              request, but shall be returned to the company after
              such examination and shall not be considered a
              record of the Insurance Department or subject to
              automatic filing with the Director.

          2)  In preparing the memorandum, the appointed actuary
              may rely on, and include as a part of his or her
              own memorandum, memoranda prepared and signed by
              other actuaries who are qualified within the
              meaning of Section 1408.40(b) of this Part, with
              respect to the areas covered in such memoranda, and
              so state in their memoranda.

          3)  If the Director requests a memorandum and no such
              memorandum exists, or if the Director finds that
              the analysis described in the memorandum fails to
              meet the standards of the Actuarial Standards Board
              or the standards and requirements of this Part, the
              Director may designate a qualified actuary to
              review the opinion and prepare such supporting
              memorandum as is required for review.  The expense
              of the independent review shall be paid by the
              company but shall be directed and controlled by the
              Director.

          4)  The reviewing actuary shall have the same status as
              an examiner for purposes of obtaining data from the
              company, and the work papers and documentation of
              the reviewing actuary shall be retained by the
              Director; provided, however, that any information
              provided by the company to the reviewing actuary
              and included in the work papers shall be considered
              as material provided by the company to the Director
              and shall be kept confidential to the same extent
              as is prescribed by law with respect to other
              material provided by the company to the Director
              pursuant to Section 223(1a)(A)(11) of the Code.
              The reviewing actuary shall not be an employee of a
              consulting firm involved with the preparation of
              any prior memorandum or opinion for the insurer
              pursuant to this Part for the current year or any
              one of the preceding three (3) years.

     b)  Details of the Memorandum Section Documenting Asset
         Adequacy Analysis (Section 1408.70 of this Part)
         When an actuarial opinion under Section 1408.70 and
         Illustration A of this Part is provided, the memorandum
         shall demonstrate that the analysis has been done in
         accordance with the standards for asset adequacy
         referred to in Section 1408.40(d) of this Part and any
         additional standards under this Part.  It shall specify:

          1)  For reserves:

               A)  Product descriptions including market
                   description, underwriting and other aspects of
                   a risk profile and the specific risks the
                   appointed actuary deems significant;

               B)  Source of liability in force;

               C)  Reserve method and basis;

               D)  Investment reserves; and

               E)  Reinsurance arrangements.

          2)  For assets:

               A)  Portfolio descriptions, including a risk
                   profile disclosing the quality, distribution
                   and types of assets;

               B)  Investment and disinvestment assumptions;

               C)  Source of asset data;

               D)  Asset valuation bases; and

               E)  Disclosure of the methodology for allocating
                   assets, the specific blocks of business and
                   the AVR.

          3)  Analysis basis:

               A)  Methodology;

               B)  Rationale for inclusion/exclusion of different
                   blocks of business and how pertinent risks
                   were analyzed;

               C)  Rationale for degree of rigor in analyzing
                   different blocks of business;

               D)  Criteria for determining asset adequacy; and

               E)  Effect of federal income taxes, reinsurance
                   and other relevant factors.

          4)  Summary of Results

          5)  Conclusion(s)

     c)  Conformity to Standards of Practice
         The memorandum shall include a statement which
         reads:  "Actuarial methods, considerations and analyses
         used in the preparation of this memorandum conform to
         the appropriate Standards of Practice as promulgated by
         the Actuarial Standards Board, which standards form the
         basis for this memorandum."

 
Section 1408.90  Additional Considerations for Analysis
 
     a)  Aggregation

         For the asset adequacy analysis for the statement of
         actuarial opinion provided in accordance with Section
         1408.70 and Illustration A of this Part, reserves and
         assets may be aggregated by either of the following
         methods:

          1)  Aggregate the reserves and related actuarial items,
              and the supporting assets, for different products
              or lines of business, before analyzing the adequacy
              of the combined assets to mature the combined
              liabilities.  The appointed actuary must be
              satisfied that the assets held in support of the
              reserves and related actuarial items so aggregated
              are managed in such a manner that the cash flows
              from the aggregated assets are available to help
              mature the liabilities from the blocks of business
              that have been aggregated.

          2)  Aggregate the results of asset adequacy analysis of
              one or more products or lines of business, the
              reserves for which prove through analysis to be
              redundant, with the results of one or more products
              or lines of business, the reserves for which prove
              through analysis to be deficient.  The appointed
              actuary must be satisfied that the asset adequacy
              results for the various products or lines of
              business for which the results are so aggregated:

               A)  Are developed using consistent economic
                   scenarios, or

               B)  Are subject to mutually independent risks,
                   i.e., the likelihood of events impacting the
                   adequacy of the assets supporting the
                   redundant reserves is completely unrelated to
                   the likelihood of events impacting the
                   adequacy of the assets supporting the
                   deficient reserves.

         In the event of any aggregation, the actuary must
         disclose in his or her opinion that such reserves were
         aggregated on the basis of methods in subsection (1),
         (2)(A) or (2)(B) above, whichever is applicable, and
         describe the aggregation in the supporting memorandum.

     b)  Selection of Assets for Analysis
         The appointed actuary shall analyze only those assets
         held in support of the reserves which are the subject
         for specific analysis, hereafter called "specified
         reserves."  A particular asset or portion thereof
         supporting a group of specified reserves cannot support
         any other group of specified reserves.  An asset may be
         allocated over several groups of specified reserves.
         The annual statement value of the assets held in support
         of the reserves shall not exceed the annual statement
         value of the specified reserves, except as provided in
         subsection (c) below.  If the method of asset allocation
         is not consistent from year to year, the extent of its
         inconsistency shall be described in the supporting
         memorandum.

     c)  Use of Assets Supporting the Interest Maintenance
         Reserve and the Asset Valuation Reserve
         An appropriate allocation of assets in the amount of the
         Interest Maintenance Reserve (IMR), whether positive or
         negative, must be used in any asset adequacy analysis.
         Analysis of risks regarding asset default may include an
         appropriate allocation of assets supporting the Asset
         Valuation Reserves (AVR); these AVR assets may not be
         applied for any other risks with respect to reserve
         adequacy.  Analysis of these and other risks may include
         assets supporting other mandatory or voluntary reserves
         available to the extent not used for risk analysis and
         reserve support.

         The amount of the assets used for the AVR must be
         disclosed in the Table of Reserves and Liabilities of
         the opinion and in the memorandum, as well as the method
         used for selecting particular assets or allocated
         portions of assets, must be disclosed in the memorandum.

     d)  Required Interest Scenarios

          1)  For the purpose of performing the asset adequacy
              analysis required by this Part, the qualified
              actuary is expected to follow standards adopted by
              the Actuarial Standards Board; nevertheless, the
              appointed actuary must consider in the analysis the
              effect of at least the following interest rate
              scenarios:

               A)  Level with no deviation;

               B)  Uniformly increasing over ten (10) years at a
                   half percent per year and then level;

               C)  Uniformly increasing at one percent per year
                   over five (5) years and then uniformly
                   decreasing at one percent per year to the
                   original level at the end of ten (10) years
                   and then level;

               D)  An immediate increase of three percent (3%)
                   and then level;

               E)  Uniformly decreasing over ten (10) years at a
                   half percent per year and then level;

               F)  Uniformly decreasing at one percent per year
                   over five (5) years and then uniformly
                   increasing at one percent per year to the
                   original level at the end of ten (10) years
                   and then level; and

               G)  An immediate decrease of three percent (3%)
                   and then level.

          2)  For these and other scenarios which may be used,
              projected interest rates for a five (5) year
              Treasury Note need not be reduced beyond the point
              where such five (5) year Treasury Note yield would
              be at fifty percent (50%) of its initial level.

          3)  The beginning interest rates may be based on
              interest rates for new investments as of the
              valuation date similar to recent investments
              allocated to support the product being tested or
              may be based on an outside index, such as Treasury
              yields, of assets of the appropriate length on a
              date close to the valuation date.  The method used
              to determine the beginning yield curve and
              associated interest rates shall be specifically
              defined.  The beginning yield curve and associated
              interest rates shall be consistent for all interest
              rate scenarios.

     e)  Documentation

         The appointed actuary shall retain on file, for at least
         seven (7) years, documentation sufficient to determine
         the procedures followed, the analyses performed, the
         bases for assumptions and the results obtained.

              actuarial items which have been analyzed for asset
              adequacy and the method of analysis (see subsection
              (b)(2) below), and identifying the reserves and
              related actuarial items covered by the opinion
              which have not been so analyzed;

          3)  A reliance paragraph describing those areas, if
              any, where the appointed actuary has deferred to
              other experts in developing data, procedures or
              assumptions (e.g., anticipated cash flows from
              currently owned assets), including variation in
              cash flows according to economic scenarios (see
              subsection (b)(3) below), supported by a statement
              of each such expert in the form prescribed by

              individual company cases as follows:

               A)  If the appointed actuary considers it
                   necessary to state a qualification of his or
                   her opinion;

               B)  If the appointed actuary must disclose the
                   method of aggregation for reserves of

                   asset adequacy analysis;

               C)  If the appointed actuary must disclose
                   reliance upon any portion of the assets
                   supporting the Asset Valuation Reserve (AVR)
                   or other mandatory or voluntary statement
                   reserves for asset adequacy analysis;

               D)  If the appointed actuary must disclose an
                   inconsistency in the method of analysis or
                   basis of asset allocation used at the prior
                   opinion date with that used for this opinion;

               E)  If the appointed actuary must disclose whether
                   additional reserves of the prior opinion date
                   are released as of this  opinion date, and the
                   extent of the release; or

               F)  If the appointed actuary chooses to add a
                   paragraph briefly describing the assumptions
                   which form the basis for the actuarial
                   opinion.

     b)  Recommended Language

         The following paragraphs are to be included in the
         statement of actuarial opinion in accordance with
         Section 1408.70 of this Part.  The language is that
         which, in typical circumstances, should be included in a
         statement of actuarial opinion.  The language may be
         modified as needed to meet the circumstances of a
         particular case, but the appointed actuary should use
         language which clearly expresses his or her professional
         judgment.  However, in any event the opinion shall
         retain all pertinent aspects of the language provided in
         this subsection.

          1)  The opening paragraph should generally indicate the
              appointed actuary's relationship to the company and
              his or her qualifications to sign the opinion.

               A)  For a company actuary, the opening paragraph
                   of the actuarial opinion should read:  "I,
                   [name], am [title] of [insurance company name]
                   and a member of the American Academy of
                   Actuaries.  I was appointed by, or by the
                   authority of, the Board of Directors of said
                   insurer to render this opinion as stated in a
                   letter to the Director dated [insert date].  I
                   meet the Academy qualification standards for
                   rendering the opinion and am familiar with the
                   valuation requirements applicable to life and
                   health insurance companies."

               B)  For a consulting actuary, the opening
                   paragraph should read:  "I, [name], a member
                   of the American Academy of Actuaries, am
                   associated with the firm of [name of
                   consulting firm].  I have been appointed by,
                   or by the authority of, the Board of Directors
                   of [name of company] to render this opinion as
                   stated in a letter to the Director dated
                   [insert date].  I meet the Academy
                   qualification standards for rendering the
                   opinion and am familiar with the valuation
                   requirements applicable to life and health
                   insurance companies."

          2)  The scope paragraph should include a statement
              which reads:  "I have examined the actuarial
              assumptions and actuarial methods used in
              determining reserves and related actuarial items
              listed below, as shown in the annual statement of
              the company, as prepared for filing with state
              regulatory officials, as of December 31, 19[  ].
              Tabulated below are those reserves and related
              actuarial items which have been subjected to asset
              adequacy analysis."

          3)  If the appointed actuary has relied on other
              experts to develop certain portions of the
              analysis, the reliance paragraph should include a
              statement such as the following:

               A)  "I have relied on [name], [title] for [e.g.,
                   anticipated cash flows from currently owned
                   assets, including variations in cash flows
                   according to economic scenarios] and, as
                   certified in the attached statement, . . . "
                   or

               B)  "I have relied on personnel as cited in the
                   supporting memorandum for certain critical
                   aspects of the analysis in reference to the
                   accompanying statement."

          4)  If the appointed actuary has examined the
              underlying asset and liability records, the
              reliance paragraph should also include:  "My
              examination included such review of the actuarial
              assumptions and actuarial methods and of the
              underlying basic asset and liability records and
              such tests of the actuarial calculations as I
              considered necessary."

          5)  If the appointed actuary has not examined the
              underlying records, but has relied upon listings
              and summaries of policies in force and/or asset
              records prepared by the company or a third party,
              the reliance paragraph should include a sentence
              such as:

               A)  "I have relied upon listings and summaries [of
                   policies and contracts, of asset records]
                   prepared by [name and title of company officer
                   certifying in force records] as certified in
                   the attached statement.  In other respects my
                   examination included such review of the
                   actuarial assumptions and actuarial methods
                   and such tests of the actuarial calculations
                   as I considered necessary." or

               B)  "I have relied upon [name of accounting firm]
                   for the substantial accuracy of the in force
                   records inventory and information concerning
                   other liabilities, as certified in the
                   attached statement.  In other respects my
                   examination included review of the actuarial
                   assumptions and actuarial methods and tests of
                   the actuarial calculations as I considered
                   necessary."

          6)  The opinion paragraph should include a statement
              which reads:

               A)  "In my opinion the reserves and related
                   actuarial values concerning the statement
                   items identified above:

                    i)   Are computed in accordance with
                         presently accepted actuarial standards
                         consistently applied and are fairly
                         stated, in accordance with sound
                         actuarial principles;

                    ii)  Are based on actuarial assumptions which
                         produce reserves at least as great as
                         those called for in any contract
                         provision as to reserve basis and
                         method, and are in accordance with all
                         other contract provisions;

                    iii) Meet the requirements of the Insurance
                         Law and regulation of the state of
                         [state of domicile] and are at least as
                         great as the minimum aggregate amounts
                         required by the state in which this
                         statement is filed;

                    iv)  Are computed on the basis of assumptions
                         consistent with those used in computing
                         the corresponding items in the annual
                         statement of the preceding year-end
                         (with any exceptions noted below);

                    v)   Include provision for all actuarial
                         reserves and related statement items
                         which ought to be established.

               B)  The reserves and related items, when
                   considered in light of the assets held by the
                   company with respect to such reserves and
                   related actuarial items including, but not
                   limited to, the investment earnings on such
                   assets, and the considerations anticipated to
                   be received and retained under such policies
                   and contracts, make adequate provision,
                   according to presently accepted actuarial
                   standards of practice, for the anticipated
                   cash flows required by the contractual
                   obligations and related expenses of the
                   company.

               C)  The actuarial methods, considerations and
                   analyses used in forming my opinion conform to
                   the appropriate Standards of Practice as
                   promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board,
                   which standards form the basis of this
                   statement of opinion.

                    i)   This opinion is updated annually as
                         required by statute.  To the best of my
                         knowledge, there have been no material
                         changes from the applicable date of the
                         annual statement to the date of the
                         rendering of this opinion which should
                         be considered in reviewing this opinion;
                         or

                    ii)  The following material change(s) which
                         occurred between the date of the
                         statement for which this opinion is
                         applicable and the date of this opinion
                         should be considered in reviewing this
                         opinion:  (Describe the change or
                         changes.)

               D)  The impact of unanticipated events subsequent
                   to the date of this opinion is beyond the
                   scope of this opinion.  The analysis of asset
                   adequacy portion of this opinion should be
                   viewed recognizing that the company's future
                   experience may not follow all the assumptions
                   used in the analysis.
                                                                 
              Signature of Appointed Actuary

                                                                 
              Address of Appointed Actuary

                                                                 
              Telephone Number of Appointed Actuary"

     c)  Assumptions for New Issues

         The adoption for new issues or new claims or other new
         liabilities of an actuarial assumption which differs
         from a corresponding assumption used for prior new
         issues or new claims or other new liabilities is not a
         change in actuarial assumptions within the meaning of
         subsection (b)(6) above.

     d)  Adverse Opinions

         If the appointed actuary is unable to form an opinion,
         then he or she shall refuse to issue a statement of
         actuarial opinion.  If the appointed actuary's opinion
         is adverse or qualified, then he or she shall issue an
         adverse or qualified actuarial opinion explicitly
         stating the reason(s) for such opinion.  This statement
         should follow the scope paragraph and precede the
         opinion paragraph.

     e)  Reliance on Data Furnished by Other Persons

         If the appointed actuary does not express an opinion as
         to the accuracy and completeness of the listings and
         summaries of policies in force and/or asset oriented
         information, there shall be attached to the opinion the
         statement of a company officer or accounting firm who
         prepared such underlying data similar to the following:

              "I [name of officer], [title], of [name of company
              or accounting firm], hereby affirm that the
              listings and summaries of policies and contracts in
              force as of December 31, [    ], and other
              liabilities prepared for and submitted to [name of
              appointed actuary] were prepared under my direction
              and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, are
              substantially accurate and complete.

                                                                 
              Signature of the Officer of the Company or
              Accounting Firm

                                                                 
              Address of the Officer of the Company or Accounting

     a)  Before any company shall deliver or issue for delivery
         variable contracts within this State it shall submit to
         the Director:

          1)  a general description of the kinds of variable
              contracts it intends to issue in this State,

          2)  if requested by the Director, a copy of the
              statutes and regulations of its state of domicile
              under which it is authorized to issue variable
              contracts, and

         it is authorized to transact a variable contract
         business in this State.

 
Section 1451.40  Separate Accounts
 
A domestic company issuing variable contracts shall establish one
or more separate accounts pursuant to Section 245.21 of the
Illinois Insurance Code, subject to the following provisions of
this Section:

     a)  Reserves for

          1)  benefits guaranteed as to dollar amount and
              duration and

          2)  funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated
              rate of interest may be maintained in a separate
              account if a portion of the assets of such separate
              account at least equal to such reserve liability is
              invested in accordance with the laws and
              regulations of this State governing the investments
              of life insurance companies.  Such portion of the
              assets also shall not be taken into account in
              applying the investment limitations otherwise
              applicable to the investments of the company.  If a
              variable contract includes incidental minimum
              guarantees as referred to in Section
              1451.60(c)(3)(B), this paragraph shall apply only
              to the reserves for any excess of such minimum
              guarantees over the reserves for the benefits that
              would be payable under the contract if there were
              no such minimum guarantees.

     b)  The company shall maintain in each separate  account
         assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and
         other contract liabilities with respect to such account,
         except as may otherwise be approved by the Director.

     c)  All provisions of the Illinois Insurance Code and any
         Parts issued thereunder applicable to the officers and
         directors of insurance companies with respect to
         conflicts of interest shall also apply to members of any
         separate account's committee, board or other similar
         body.  No officer or director of such company nor any
         member of the committee, board or body of a separate
         account shall receive directly or indirectly any
         commission or any other compensation with respect to the
         purchase or sale of assets of such separate account.

     d)  Any insurance company which issues or delivers variable
         contracts shall establish such administrative and
         accounting procedures as are necessary to properly
         identify the one or more separate accounts of the
         company derived from or in relation to contributions,
         premiums or considerations received by it under such
         contracts and which meet the standards specified in
         Section 133(1) of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 745).

 
Section 1451.50  Filing of Contracts
 
     a)  The filing requirements applicable to variable contracts
         shall be those filing requirements otherwise applicable
         under existing statutes and regulations of this State
         with respect to individual and group life insurance and
         annuity contract form filings, to the extent appropriate
         as determined by the Director.

     b)  Companies selling variable contracts shall file with the
         Department of Insurance a copy of any sales literature
         and effective prospectus which is applicable to variable
         contracts to be issued or delivered in Illinois.

     c)  Individual contracts which provide for both fixed and
         variable benefits (which are specified at the time of
         the sale of such contracts) shall show, separately, the
         consideration to be paid for the fixed benefits and for
         the variable benefits.

     d)  In the sale of an individual variable contract, made in
         correlation with the sale of either a fixed life
         insurance policy or a fixed annuity contract, there
         shall be a disclosure to the prospective purchaser which
         shows the  consideration to be paid for the variable
         contract separately from the other charges.  If any
         benefits or nonforfeiture values which may accrue prior
         to the death of the insured are involved in the
         presentation of such a correlated sale, the value of
         such fixed life insurance policy or such fixed annuity
         must be shown separately from any other values.
 

Section 1451.60  Contracts Providing for Variable Benefits
 
     a)  Illustrations of benefits payable under any variable
         contract shall not include projections of past
         investment experience into the future or attempted
         predictions of future investment experience; provided
         however, that the form of illustration found in Appendix
         A of this Part may be utilized by companies in the sale
         of immediate variable annuities only.

     b)  No individual variable annuity contract calling for the
         payment of periodic stipulated payments shall be
         delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless it
         contains in substance the following provisions or
         provisions which in the opinion of the Director are more
         favorable to the holders of such contracts:

          1)  A provision that there shall be a period of grace
              of 30 days or of one month, within which any
              stipulated payment to the insurer falling due after
              the first may be made, during which period of grace
              the contract shall continue in force.  The contract
              may include a statement of the basis for
              determining the date as of which any such payment
              received during the period of grace shall be
              applied to produce the values under the contract
              arising therefrom;

          2)  A provision that, at any time within one year from
              the date of default, in making periodic stipulated
              payments to the insurer during the life of the
              annuitant and unless the cash surrender value has
              been paid, the contract may be reinstated upon
              payment to the insurer of such overdue payments as
              required by the contract, and of all indebtness to
              the insurer on the contract, including interest.
              The contract may include a statement of the basis
              for determining the date as of which the amount to
              cover such overdue payments and indebtedness shall
              be applied to produce the values under the contract
              arising therefrom;

          3)  A provision specifying the options available in the
              event of default in a periodic stipulated payment.
              Such options may include an option to surrender the
              contract for a cash value as determined by the
              contract, and shall include an option to receive a
              paid-up annuity if the contract is not surrendered
              for cash, the amount of such paid-up annuity being
              determined by applying the value of the contract at
              the annuity commencement date in accordance with
              the terms of the contract.

     c)  No individual variable life insurance policy shall be
         delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it
         contains in substance the following provisions or
         provisions which in the opinion of the Director are more
         favorable to the holders of such policies:

          1)  A provision that there shall be a period of grace
              of 30 days or of one month, within which payment of
              any premium after the first may be made, during
              which period of grace the policy shall continue in
              force, but if a claim arises under the policy
              during such period of grace before the overdue
              premiums or the deferred premiums of the current
              policy year, if any, are paid, the amount of such
              premiums, together with interest not in excess of
              6% per annum, may be deducted from any amount
              payable under the policy in settlement.  The policy
              may contain a statement of the basis for
              determining any variation in benefits that may
              occur as a result of the payment of premium during
              the period of grace.

          2)  A provision that the policy will be reinstated at
              any time within 3 years from the date of default,
              unless the cash surrender value has been paid or
              unless the period of extended insurance has
              expired, upon the application of the insured and
              the production of evidence of insurability,
              including good health, satisfactory to the insurer
              and the payment of an amount not exceeding the
              greater of:

               A)  all overdue premiums and the payment of any
                   other indebtness to the insurer upon said
                   policy with interest at a rate not exceeding 6
                   per centum per annum compounded annually, or

               B)  110% of the increase in cash surrender value
                   resulting from reinstatement.

          3)

               A)  A provision for cash surrender values and
                   paid-up insurance benefits available as
                   non-forfeiture options under the policy in the
                   event of default in a premium payment after
                   premiums have been paid for a specified
                   period.  If the policy does not include a
                   table of figures for the options so available,
                   the policy shall provide that the company will
                   furnish at least once in each policy year a
                   statement showing the cash value as of a date
                   no earlier than the prior policy anniversary.

               B)  The method of computation of cash values and
                   other non-forfeiture benefits, as described
                   either in the policy or in a statement filed
                   with the Commissioner, Director or
                   Superintendent of the jurisdiction in which
                   the policy is delivered, shall be in
                   accordance with actuarial procedures that
                   recognize the variable nature of the policy.
                   The method of computation must be such that,
                   if the net investment return credited to the
                   contract at all times from the date of issue
                   should be equal to the assumed investment
                   increment factor if the contract provides for
                   such a factor, or 3 1/2% if not, with premiums
                   and benefits determined accordingly under the
                   terms of the policy, the resulting cash values
                   and other non-forfeiture benefits would be at
                   least equal to the minimum values required by
                   Section 229.2 of the Illinois Insurance Code
                   (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 841.2) for
                   a fixed dollar policy with such premiums and
                   benefits.  The method of computation may
                   disregard incidental minimum guarantees as to
                   the dollar amounts payable.  Incidental
                   minimum guarantees include, for example, but
                   are not to be limited to, a guarantee under a
                   policy which provides for an assumed
                   investment increment factor that the amount
                   payable at death or maturity shall be at least
                   equal to the amount that otherwise would have
                   been payable if the net investment return
                   credited to the contract at all times from the
                   date of issue had been equal to such factor.

     d)  Any variable annuity contract delivered or issued for
         delivery in this State shall stipulate the investment
         increment factors to be used in computing the dollar
         amount of variable benefits or other variable
         contractual payments or  values thereunder, and may
         guarantee that expense and/or mortality results shall
         not adversely affect such dollar amounts.  In the case
         of an individual variable annuity contract under which
         the expense and mortality results may adversely affect
         the dollar amount of benefits, the expense and mortality
         factors shall be stipulated in the contract.

          1)  In computing the dollar amount of variable benefits
              or other contractual payments or values under an
              individual variable annuity contract:

               A)  The annual net investment increment assumption
                   shall not exceed 5%, except with the approval
                   of the Director;

               B)  To the extent that the level of benefits may
                   be affected by future mortality results, the
                   mortality factor shall be determined from the
                   Annuity Mortality Table for 1949, Ultimate, or
                   any modification of that table not having a
                   lower life-expectancy at any age, or, if
                   approved by the Director, from another table.

          2)  "Expense," as used in paragraph (d) of this
              Section, may exclude some or all taxes, as
              stipulated in the contract.

     e)  Any individual variable life insurance policy delivered
         or issued for  delivery in this State shall stipulate
         the investment increment factor to be used in computing
         the dollar amount of variable benefits or other variable
         contractual payments or values thereunder and shall
         guarantee that expense and mortality results shall not
         adversely affect such dollar amounts.

     f)  The reverse liability for variable contracts shall be
         established pursuant to the requirements of Section 223
         of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981,
         ch. 73, par. 835) in accordance with actuarial
         procedures that recognize the variable nature of the
         benefits provided and any mortality guarantees, provided
         such actuarial procedures meet the approval of the
         Director.

 
Section 1451.70  Required Reports
 
     a)  Any company issuing individual variable contracts shall
         mail to the contractholder at least once in each
         contract year after the first at his last address known
         to the company, a statement or statements reporting the

alien company provides a degree of protection to the policyholder
and the public which is substantially equal to that provided by
applicable provisions of the Illinois Insurance Code and this
Part, the Director, to the extent deemed appropriate by him in
his discretion, may consider compliance with such law or
regulation as compliance with applicable provisions of the
Illinois Insurance Code and this Part.  The state of entry of an
alien company shall be deemed its place of domicile for the
purposes of this Part.

              association.

     f)  Every applicant applying for license as a variable
         contract agent shall satisfactorily complete the
         variable contract examination required by Section
         1451.90(c) with a grade of at least seventy percent

     k)  Any person licensed in this State as a variable contract
         agent shall immediately report to the Director:

          1)  any suspension or revocation of his variable
              contract agent's license or life insurance agent's

              securities exchange, or national securities
              association, or any federal, or state or

     l)  The Director may reject any application or suspend or
         revoke or refuse to renew any variable contract agent's
         license upon any ground that would bar such applicant or
         such agent from being licensed to sell life insurance
         contracts in this State.  The rules governing any
         proceeding relating to the suspension or revocation of a
         life insurance agent's license shall also govern any
         proceeding for suspension or revocation of a variable
         contract agent's license.

     m)  Renewal of a variable contract agent's license shall

              company and such separate account based upon the

              Hypothetical Illustration of Benefits
               From An Immediate Variable Annuity



Prepared for     John Doe

Single Purchase Payment     $15,000                              


Annuity payments will vary as described in the prospectus, and in
accordance with the actual investment results.

An interest rate of 3 1/2% is used in calculating the initial
payment.  If the investment result after charges and taxes, as
described in the prospectus, is equal to the interest rate
assumed for the annuity, the annuity payment for that period will
be unchanged.  If the investment result is greater, the annuity
payment will increase; if less, the payment will decrease.

The table below illustrates the effect of three hypothetical
annual rates of investment return.  The hypothetical rates of
investment return shown are after provision for any taxes
chargeable to the account, but before deduction of other charges.

The investment results bear no relationship to past or future
investment results.  Actual investment results will vary from
month to month and actual payments may be more or less than shown
above.

Use of this material is prohibited unless preceded or accompanied
by a current prospectus which sets forth the sales expenses and

as follows:

 
Section 1602.10  Military Exclusion
 
Risk of death may be excluded:

     a)  As a result of war or act of war, if the cause of death
         occurs while the insured is serving in the military,
         naval or air forces of any country, combination of
         countries or international organization, provided such

     b)  As a result of the special hazards incident to service
         in the military, naval or air forces of any country,
         combination of countries or international organization,
         if the cause of death occurs while the insured is
         serving in such forces and is outside the home area,
         provided such death occurs outside the home area or
         within six (6) months after the insured's return to the
         home area in such forces or within six (6) months after
         the termination of service in such forces, whichever is

         is serving in such units and is outside the home area,
         provided such death occurs outside the home area or
         within six (6) months after the insured's return to the
         home area in such units or within six (6) months after
         the termination of service in such units, whichever is
         earlier.

Risk of death may be excluded as a result of war on an act of
war, within two (2) years from the date of issue of the policy,
while the insured is not in such forces or units, if the cause of
death occurs while the insured is outside the home area, provided

Section 1605.10  Legal Reserve Life Blank Prescribed
 
Assessment companies operating under Article XVI and Article XXI
of the Illinois Insurance Code will report their transactions on
the legal reserve life annual statement blank.

     a)  The signature of the actuary on page 1 of the annual
         statement will be taken to mean that he personally was
         responsible for the calculation of the actuarial
         liabilities.

     b)  Companies having non-tabular business will show the
         amount representing the balance of the non-tabular fund
         at line 27, page 3.  Line 29, page 3, must include only
         the surplus in the tabular fund.  Tabular and
         non-tabular business will be separated and shown in
         separate columns on page 5 and all supporting exhibits.

          1)  Transactions involving guarantee fund certificates
              are to be shown in the surplus account, lines 34 to
              51, on page 4.

          2)  Coupons guaranteed under the terms of life
              insurance contracts are contract payments and are
              to be shown on line 9, page 4, and should not be
              included in dividends to policyholders, line 29,
              page 4.

     c)  All policy, membership and other fees formerly shown on
         line 5, page 2, of the assessment blank should be shown
         in gross on page 7, Exhibit 1.  The amount paid to or
         retained by agents is to be included on lines 23 to 25
         on page 7.

     d)  All properties are to be shown individually in Schedule

         A.  Permission to summarize will not apply to assessment
         companies.

          1)  Schedule B.  Instead of the five-page schedule in
              the life blank,  assessment companies will continue
              to file a one-page schedule showing all mortgages
              owned and their classification.

          2)  Schedule G.  All payments over $3000 will be shown
              as formerly.  Part 1 will be ignored and the
              amounts shown in Part 2.

          3)  Special interrogatories will be supplied on a
              separate page which will be inserted along with
              Schedule B.

Section 1704.10  Authorization of Fraternal Benefit Societies to Write Accident and Health Insurance
 
No domestic, foreign or alien fraternal benefit society (except a
society providing exclusively for benefits in case of death or
disability resulting solely from accident and which does not
obligate itself to pay natural death or sick benefits), shall
write accident and health insurance under Article XX of the
Illinois Insurance Code pursuant to the authority granted by
Section 288 (2) of Article XVII of said Code unless authorized to
do so by its articles of incorporation, constitution or by-laws.

 
Section 1704.20  Establishment and Maintenance of Separate Accounts
 
Every society which writes accident and health insurance shall
establish and maintain entirely separate accounts for all
transactions pertaining to its accident and health business, to
which accounts shall be credited all moneys collected for
accident and health insurance contracts and the accretions
thereon and to which accounts shall be charged or allocated all
losses and expenses incurred in connection with such contracts
and all dividends paid, if any.

 
Section 1704.30  Provision for Payment
 
Every society must provide for the payment on accident and health
contracts of premiums, assessments or contributions which
together with the accretions thereon shall be sufficient to
provide for the claims, reserves, expenses and other liabilities
attributable to such accident and health contracts.

 
Section 1704.40  Prohibition of Transfer of Money Collected to Pay for Losses
 
No part of the money collected for any purposes other than
accident and health contracts and no part of the accretions
thereon shall be transferred to the accident and health accounts
or be used to pay any losses or expenses of the accident and
health business or to maintain the required reserves thereon
except that before any society commences the writing of accident
and health insurance, the supreme legislative and governing body
may authorize the transfer of a reasonable amount from the
unassigned funds of the society to the accident and health fund.
This transfer shall be for the purpose of defraying the necessary
and incidental expenses of setting up the accident and health
fund and for a period not in excess of three years may be drawn
upon, if necessary, to maintain such fund in a solvent condition,
after which period the residue, if any, shall be returned to the
fund from which transferred.

 
Section 1704.50  Deficiency in Accounts
 
Any deficiency in the accident and health accounts shall be
apportioned only to the accident and health contracts, except
only as provided in Section 1704.40 above, and prompt action
shall be taken to eliminate such deficiency.

 
Section 1704.60  Transferral of Accounts to Other Societies
 
Any society may provide that all or any part of the surplus in
the accident and health accounts may be transferred to and become
a part of any other accounts of the society.

Section 1705.10  Application
 
This Part shall apply to:

     a)  Life Certificates, endorsement, rider and application
         forms filed with the Department by foreign, alien and
         domestic societies as required by Section 143 of the
         Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73,
         par. 755), and

     b)  Accident and health certificates, endorsement, rider and
         application forms filed with the Department by foreign,
         alien and domestic societies as required by Section 355
         of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 967).

 
Section 1705.20  Construction of Life Certificate Forms
 
     a)  

          1)  Fraternal Benefit Societies "Societies" may issue
              certificates providing for the payment of death
              benefits as authorized by the Code.

          2)  Section 288(1) of the Illinois Insurance Code,
              insofar as it authorizes additional benefits,
              permits Societies to provide in the life
              certificate, or supplemental thereto, for the
              following:

               A)  Additional accidental death benefits;

               B)  Waiver of premium disability benefits due to
                   accident or sickness;

               C)  Benefits or an annuity in case a member
                   becomes totally and permanently disabled from
                   accident or sickness; without including
                   Accident and Health Policy Provisions required
                   by Section 357.1 et seq. of the Code (Ill.
                   Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 969.1).  All
                   other accident and health benefits included in
                   the life certificates or supplemental thereto
                   must conform to Article XX of the Code and of
                   Department Rules and Regulations pertaining to
                   construction and filing of accident and health
                   forms, in the same manner as though those
                   benefits were provided under separate
                   certificates.

     b)  If the Director finds that the interests of present and
         future certificate holders of a Society are not
         adversely affected, he may authorize the Society to use
         the Commissioners' 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality
         Table for ordinary insurance, and a rate of interest not
         to exceed 3 1/2 percent per annum for calculating
         reserves and nonforfeiture values, if:

          1)  The Society files with the Department comparative
              figures showing the attained age and the actual
              mortality loss for the previous two years together
              with expected losses on the mortality table then in
              use and on the Commissioners' 1958 Standard
              Ordinary Mortality Table.  This information will be
              acceptable if set out in five year age groups.

          2)  Notice of Election by the Society to comply with
              Section 229.2 of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981,
              ch. 73, par. 841.2)  after a certain specified
              date, must be in the form of a certified copy of
              the Resolution of the governing body, or the Board
              of Directors authorizing such Election.

          3)  Basis of reserves should be stated in the
              certificate.

          4)  The following, which may be in substance, must be
              in the certificate:  "The reserve and nonforfeiture
              values under this certificate are not less than the
              minimum values required by the Standard
              Nonforfeiture laws as adopted by the State of
              Illinois for use by legal reserve life insurance
              policies."

          5)  After the date selected, all certificates issued by
              the Society must be on the Commissioners' 1958
              Standard Ordinary Mortality Table.

          6)  Sections 229.2 and 229.3 and other applicable
              provisions of the Code must be complied with.
 

Section 1705.30  Construction of Accident and Health Forms
 
     a)  A separate certificate which provides for the payment of
         benefits as a result of bodily injury, disablement or
         death by accident and against disablement resulting from
         sickness or old age, and every benefit appertaining
         thereto, as provided for by subsection (2) of Section
         288 of the Illinois Insurance Code, must be issued in
         accordance with Article XX of the Code and of Rules and
         Regulations pertaining to construction and filing of
         Accident and Health forms issued by the Department.
         (See Section 1705.10(b) of this Part relative to
         accident and health benefits provided in or supplemental
         to life certificates.)

     b)  Section 306 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 918) may not be interpreted so
         as to allow an accident and health certificate to
         require that the insured must first seek the services of
         a Society's hospital before benefits of a certificate
         will be paid for expenses incurred and services
         rendered.

     c)  Societies issuing accident and health certificates under
         the authority of Section 288 of the Code are not
         qualified to issue the types of accident and health
         certificates authorized by Section 367 of the Code (Ill.
         Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 979) except that type
         described in paragraph (4) of Section 367 and commonly
         known as "Family Group Accident and Health"; nor is any
         Society qualified to issue the types of certificates
         authorized by Section 367(a) of the Code.

     d)  A certificate issued by Societies of the type authorized
         by paragraph (4) of Section 367 of the Code may insure,
         either originally or by subsequent amendment, and only
         upon the application of an adult member of a family, who
         is deemed the certificateholder and beneficial member of
         the Society, any two or more eligible members of that
         family.  Eligible members of a family include a husband,
         a wife, dependent children or any children under a
         specified age which may not exceed 19 years, and any
         other person dependent upon the certificateholder.

     e)  Societies issuing accident and health certificates under
         Section 288 of the Code are qualified to issue the type
         of accident and health certificate authorized by Section
         368 of the Code, (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par.
         980) but such certificates may be issued only upon the
         signed application of a person who is deemed to be the
         certificateholder and beneficial member of the Society.

 
Section 1705.40  Construction of All Forms Issued by Fraternal Benefit Societies
 
     a)  Certificates issued under Section 288(2) of the Illinois
         Insurance Code may be issued in connection with or
         separate from life certificates issued under Section
         288(1).  Because such certificates must conform, as far
         as practical, to Article XX and Department Rules and
         Regulations pertaining to Accident and Health Benefits,
         (50 Ill. Adm. Code Subchapter z) it is urged that they
         not be issued as a part of, supplemental to, or attached
         to life certificates.

     b)  

          1)  Societies may provide for only one application to
              be made for both the life and the accident and
              health insurance, a copy of the application is made
              a part of each certificate.  This procedure may be
              used only when the life and the accident and health
              certificates are to be issued concurrently.

          2)  A combined application must set forth the amount of
              life insurance and the amount of the accident and
              health insurance in addition to the contribution
              for each class of insurance.

     c)  Societies must state on the face of the certificate, in
         addition to the name of the Society, "Fraternal Benefit
         Society".

     d)  

          1)  Riders, endorsements or supplemental agreements,
              must contain the name of the Society, a descriptive
              title, the date of execution, the signature of at
              least one officer of the Society, and a statement
              indicating the form is attached to and made a part
              of certificate number             , issued on the
              life of                        .

          2)  Endorsements printed or rubber stamped on the
              policy do not require the name of the Society or a
              statement with reference to the endorsement being
              attached to and made a part of the policy.  Such
              imprinted or stamped endorsements must receive
              approval by this Department.

     e)  Application questions:

          1)  Applications must be composed of questions by the
              Society in the form of clear and direct
              interrogatories permitting the answers by the
              applicant only in the form of direct statements and
              may not contain any questions or representations
              based upon indefinite or ambiguous terms.

          2)  Questions in the application must be broken down so
              that each answer thereto pertains to related
              disease or conditions.

     f)  All forms submitted to the Department for approval must
         be submitted in duplicate with illustrative data filled
         in as when prepared for issue and must be accompanied by
         a "Certificate of Compliance" in substantially the form
         appended hereto as Exhibit A.

     g)  The Certificate must have a copy of the application,
         including evidence of insurability, attached to the form
         when submitted.  Where provisions of the constitution or
         by-laws will affect the status of the members, in
         respect to his insurance, and those provisions are not
         contained in the certificate, reference to the
         constitution and/or by-laws must be made in the letter
         of transmittal in order that the Department may properly
         determine the effect of those provisions on the
         certificate.

     h)  Each form submitted to the Department must contain a
         form number which is to appear in the lower left corner
         of the first page and the filing back in addition to a
         descriptive title to be imprinted thereon.  The form
         number may appear in as many additional places on the
         form as the Society may desire.

     i)  The letter of submission for new forms should include
         the form number and approval date of any form being
         discontinued or being replaced.

     j)  All copies of forms submitted to the Department will be
         retained by the Department.  Under no circumstances will
         copies of forms be returned to Societies with the
         Department stamp of approval thereon.  Notice of
         approval will be given by letter only.

Section 1706.5  Prescribed Procedures
 
The following procedures and prescribed to be followed by both
domestic and foreign fraternal benefit societies before adopting
for use in Illinois the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary
Mortality Table:

 
Section 1706.10  Interests of Present and Future Certificate Holders
 
     a)  The societies shall first satisfy the Director that the
         interests of present and future certificate holders will
         not be adversely affected by the adoption of the 1958
         Table for the ordinary forms of insurance.  A society
         may thereafter adopt and use the 1958 Table for the
         ordinary forms of insurance with a rate of interest not
         exceeding 3% per annum for calculating reserves, cash
         surrender values and paid-up non-forfeiture benefits.

     b)  Before commencing the use of the proposed Table the
         society shall

          1)  file with the Department comparative figures
              showing the attained age and the actual and
              expected mortality loss for the previous two (2)
              years on the mortality table currently in use as
              well as on the Commissioners 1958 Table, based on
              the gross amount at risk.  (If desired the
              information may be set out in five (5) year age
              groups);

          2)  file with the Department a certified copy in the
              form of a Resolution of the Governing Body, or the
              Board of Directors of the notice of the election by
              the society to comply with the provisions of
              Section 229.2 of the Illinois Insurance Code after
              a specified date set forth in such Resolution;
              (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 841.2)

          3)  file with the Department and procure tentative
              approval of certificate forms in advance of the
              proposed effective date of the adoption by the
              society of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary
              Mortality Table, which certificates shall contain
              statements of the basis of reserves as well as the
              following, which may be in substance:

               "The cash surrender values and paid-up
               non-forfeiture benefits under this certificate are
               not less than the minimums required by the
               standard Non-Forfeiture Law on the basis of the
               Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality
               Table as adopted by the State of Illinois for use
               in legal reserve life insurance policies."

 
Section 1706.20  Adult and Juvenile Certificates
 
After the date selected, all adult and juvenile certificates
issued by the society must be on the Commissioners 1958 Standard
Mortality Table except those certificates issued in states which
at said date have not yet authorized or permitted the use of said
Table by fraternal benefit societies.

 
Section 1706.30  Compliance
 
All provisions of Section 229.2 and Section 229.3 of Article XIV
of the Illinois Insurance Code together with other applicable
provisions of the Code must be complied with.

Section 2001.10  Application
 
This Part shall apply to:

     a)  Individual and family group accident and health policy,
         certificate, endorsement, rider and application forms
         filed with this Department by both foreign and domestic
         companies with respect to Section 143, Article IX and
         Article XX of the Illinois Insurance Code approved June
         29, 1937, effective July 1, 1937, as amended June 29,
         1951, effective January 1, 1952.

     b)  These rules and regulations will also apply, where
         applicable, to individual and family group policy,
         certificate, endorsement, rider and application forms
         which are filed in accordance with Section 356a of the
         Illinois Insurance Code effective January 1, 1952.

     c)  The filing procedure for accident and health forms as
         required by Section 355 of the Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 2001.20  Rules for Construction of Accident and Health Forms
 
     a)  Section 356a.  Form of Policy.

          1)  Sub-section (2):  The Department will require each
              form of a domestic company which is issued for
              delivery to a person residing in another state, to
              be approved by the Director unless such form shall
              be subject to approval or disapproval by such other
              state.

          2)  Sub-Section (3) is interpreted as follows:

               A)  The insurer may continue to issue during the
                   period, January 1, 1952 to January 1, 1957,
                   any policy form, rider or endorsement which
                   could have been lawfully used or delivered, or
                   issued for delivery to any person in the state
                   immediately before January 1, 1952.

               B)  Until January 1, 1955, the Department will
                   continue to approve any policy form, rider, or
                   endorsement which could lawfully be used or
                   delivered, or issued for delivery to any
                   person in this State immediately before
                   January 1, 1952.

               C)  After January 1, 1955, the Department will
                   approve only those policy forms, riders or
                   endorsements which are drawn to conform with
                   Article XX of the Illinois Insurance Code,
                   approved June 29, 1937, as amended June 29,
                   1951.

               D)  All policy forms, riders and endorsements
                   which are not drawn to conform with Article XX
                   of the Illinois Insurance Code, as amended
                   June 29, 1951, effective January 1, 1952, will
                   become obsolete January 1, 1957, and may no
                   longer be lawfully issued or delivered or
                   issued for delivery to any person in this
                   State after that date.

               E)  Sections 356, 357, 358, 359, 363, 365, and 366
                   of the Illinois Insurance Code, as in effect
                   prior to the effective date of the June 29,
                   1951 amendment, are hereby incorporated into
                   and made a part of this Part I, Rules for
                   Construction of Accident and Health Forms, by
                   express reference and will be applicable to
                   all forms filed in accordance with sub-section
                   (3) of Section 356a.

     b)  Section 357a.  Accident and Health Policy Provisions.

         Sub-Sections (1), (2) and (3):

          1)  In order to expedite departmental action on
              policies submitted for approval, it is requested
              that to the maximum extent possible, companies
              adhere to the statutory wording and order of the
              required provisions.  Policies submitted which
              include variations from the statutory words and
              order must be accompanied by a complete list of all
              variations and a justification of each.  Extensive
              variations, without adequate justification, will
              only result in delay in the processing of such
              policies.  The companies' cooperation in keeping
              such variations to a minimum is essential for
              efficiency and economy in department operation.

          2)  Each provision of sub-sections (1) and (2) must be
              preceded by a caption and if the captions differ in
              any respect from the captions appearing in such
              sub-sections, changes must be clearly indicated and
              justified as explained under (1) above.

          3)  Numbering of the "Required Provisions" will not be
              required.

     c)  Section 359a.  Application.

          1)  Where an Industrial policy is issued upon signed
              application of the person to be insured, such
              application shall conform with provisions of
              Section 359a.

          2)

               A)  Where changes are made on the application for
                   administrative purposes only, such changes
                   must be clearly indicated.

               B)  Where the application is subject to being
                   changed for administrative purposes by the
                   insurer, such application shall clearly
                   indicate that any such changes are not to be
                   ascribed to the applicant.

     d)  Section 361a.  Age Limit.  Any policy form containing an
         "age limit" shall contain in substance a provision
         setting forth the limitations of Section 361a.

     e)  Section 362a.  Non-Application to Certain Policies.
         Clause (3) of this Section does not apply to family
         group accident and health insurance provided for under
         Section 356a, sub-section (1), Clause (c).

     f)  Section 368.  Industrial Accident and Health Insurance.
         The Department will require Industrial Accident and
         Health forms to be of the same form and content as other
         accident and health forms required to be filed in
         accordance with Section 355, except Industrial Policies
         shall be issued on a weekly premium basis and contain
         the words "Industrial Policy" printed on each form.

     g)  All provisions of the Third Edition of the Official
         Guide which are not inconsistent with the statute will
         be required.

     h)

          1)  Accident and Health insurance may only be defined
              as insurance against bodily injury, disablement or
              death by accident and against disablement resulting
              from sickness or old age and every insurance
              appertaining thereto.

          2)  Terms such as "external" and "violent" in
              connection with the definition of accident and
              health insurance are not acceptable.

     i)  The information required in Section 356a, sub-section
         (1), (a) and (b) must  appear in the policy form itself
         or its filing back and cannot be added to the policy by
         rider, endorsement, or supplement.  Although riders,
         endorsements and supplements, when attached to the
         policy form, become a part of the contract, it is
         evident the law intends that the aforementioned
         information be made a part of the policy form itself,
         since this Section specifically refers to the policy and
         distinguishes between the policy forms, riders and
         endorsements.

     j)  Funeral benefits will not be permitted in accident and
         health contracts.  This ruling will not apply to
         contracts issued pursuant to Section 356a, sub-section
         (3).

     k)  There is no general law in the State of Illinois which
         requires that all hospitals be licensed and many
         hospitals in this State are not incorporated.  The words
         "licensed" or "Incorporated" will not be acceptable in
         referring to hospitals in accident and health insurance
         contracts issued in this State.  If hospitals are
         defined in accident and health contracts in forms
         presented for use in this State, then an appropriate
         definition must be used.  A term such as "legally
         operated hospital" or any other definition which is
         definite and applicable in this State, will be accepted.

     l)  Waiting period provisions in accident and health
         insurance contracts which stipulate the contract must be
         maintained in "continuous force" or "in force for
                  months after the effective date of the policy"
         or "in force for          months prior to the date of
         the loss," will not be accepted.  Such provisions do not
         adequately and clearly cover reinstatements and
         therefore, such waiting periods must be based upon the
         loss occurring          months after the effective date
         of the policy and read similar to:  No indemnity will be
         paid for loss which occurs, or commences, prior to
                  months after the effective date of the policy.

     m)  Additional waiting periods for certain designated
         diseases or illnesses based upon inception beyond the
         usual customary 15 to 30 days provided for in the
         Insuring Provisions are not permissible.  If additional
         waiting periods are deemed necessary by the company for
         certain diseases and illnesses, then we require that
         such waiting periods be based upon the loss occurring so
         many months after the effective date of the policy
         rather than being based on the inception of the illness
         or disease.

     n)  "Strict compliance provisions" in accident and health
         insurance contracts will not be acceptable for use in
         this State.

     o)  Any specific requirement for medical attendance by a
         licensed physician  other than that attendance which is
         normally and customarily required for the disease or
         accident resulting in loss for which claim is made, will
         not be acceptable.

     p)  In accident and health insurance contracts which include
         "medical attendance benefits" and "surgical benefits"
         and limits liability to only one, provision must be made
         for the payment of the greater benefit.

     q)  Broad, indefinite, ambiguous and inconsistent language
         must be excluded from all accident and health insurance
         forms.  Examples of such wording are:

          1)  The use of the words "indirectly" and "partly" in
              connection with Exclusions, Limitations and
              Reductions,

          2)  The use of the word "reasonable" when used in
              connection with medical attendance or any other
              condition or requirement included in the policy
              form, unless use of such word results in the
              provision being more favorable to the insured.

          3)  The use of such words as "appendages" "involving",
              "affecting", etc. in connection with specified
              physical conditions.  Medical terms should be
              definite, for instance, various types of hernia
              should be spelled out, or a general statement that
              all types of hernia are meant.

     r)  Surgical Benefit Provisions in accident and health
         insurance contracts must include and provide either:

          1)  That all operations will be covered not to exceed a
              stipulated amount for any operation that may be
              performed, or

          2)  The inclusion of a schedule of operations which
              includes:

               A)  Comparable benefits for operations of
                   comparable severity;

               B)  A provision which requires the company to pay
                   a benefit for any operation not listed in the
                   schedule, based on an amount equivalent to
                   that specified for a listed operation of
                   comparable severity; and

               C)  A provision which requires the company to pay
                   for that operation which provides the largest
                   benefit when the company's liability is
                   limited to one operation where more than one
                   is performed, under named or enumerated
                   conditions.

     s)  Surgical benefit provisions which are contingent upon
         payment of a hospital confinement benefit will not be
         approved.

     t)  Benefits for hospital room which are based upon the
         actual expense incurred, may be made contingent only
         upon a charge being made by the hospital.  Benefits
         payable on a stated or flat rate basis, regardless of
         the amount of expense incurred, may make the benefit
         contingent upon hospital confinement of so many hours.

     u)

          1)  Waiver of Premium Provisions must include a
              statement of coverage and of the insured's rights
              and obligations regarding the resumption of premium
              payments after the period of total disability has
              terminated during which the premium has been
              waived.  This statement must read similarly
              to:  After the termination of the period of total
              disability, during which a premium has been waived,
              the insurance afforded in this contract shall
              continue in full force and effect until the next
              premium due date, at which time the insured shall
              have the right to resume the payment of premiums as
              provided in the contract.

          2)  If a premium is to be charged for the period from
              the expiration of the period of total disability
              during which a premium has been waived and the
              expiration date of the policy, then a statement of
              this fact must be added to the provision together
              with a provision that the insurer will notify the
              insured of the premium due.

          3)  A policy which contains a cancellable provision may
              add at the end of the above provision, "subject to
              the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance
              with the cancellation provision hereof."

          4)  A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to
              refuse any renewal premiums, shall add, "unless not
              less than five days prior to the premium due date
              the insurer has delivered to the insured or has
              mailed to his last address as shown by records of
              the insurer,                     , written notice
              of its intention not to renew this policy beyond
              the period for which the premium has been waived."

          5)  Paragraphs (3) and (4) above, will not apply where
              a contract contains the Grace Period Provision
              provided by Section 357a of the Illinois Insurance
              Code, as that provision incorporates the
              requirements set forth in the above paragraphs (3)
              and (4).

     v)  Requirements for the so-called "franchise insurance" are
         different from those for individual contracts in the
         following respects:  Termination either by cancellation
         or refusal to renew any individual contracts of the
         group is prohibited, unless all like contracts of the
         group are terminated at the expiration of the contracts
         and upon at least ten days' notice in advance.  The only
         other termination conditions which may be included in
         such contracts are those which terminate coverage
         because of nonpayment of premium, discontinuance of
         employment of the insured by the named employer or the
         discontinuance of membership in the designated
         organization or association, and in addition, coverage
         may be automatically terminated at a designated attained
         age.

     w)  Policy forms, which in the opinion of the Department,
         will invite misrepresentations in the advertising and
         sale of the same, due to the restrictive nature of such
         forms as a result of unusual and/or over-lapping
         exclusions, limitations, reductions, or conditions, will
         not be accepted for use in this State.

     x)  Time limitations, when included in benefit provisions,
         must be explained in terms such as hours, days, weeks,
         months or years.  Terms such as "immediately" or
         "reasonably" are not acceptable, unless use of such
         words make the provision more favorable to the insured.

     y)  Policy contracts issued by assessment companies must
         include a provision setting forth the contingent
         liability of the insured and should be based upon the
         regular premium provided in the policy, and in addition
         thereto, such premium payments as may be required by the
         company from time to time.  This provision should be
         placed in the contract with equal prominence to the
         benefit provisions.

     z)  Where a contingent liability provision is included in a
         contract issued by a mutual company as provided for in
         Section 55 of the Illinois Insurance Code, the
         contingent liability of the policyholder must be based
         upon not less than one nor more than ten times the
         amount of the premium expressed in the continuation
         paragraph of the policy.  This provision should be
         placed in the contract with equal prominence to the
         benefit provisions.

     aa) Limited policy contracts will not be approved which, in
         the opinion of the Department, sets forth in a more
         prominent manner the provisions for relatively large
         benefits for specified accidents of rare occurrence than
         provisions for relatively low benefits for accidents of
         more frequent occurrance.  Accumulative indemnities
         benefits are permissible, but schedules showing such
         benefits will not be approved in accident and health
         contracts.

     bb)

          1)  Riders and endorsements which are not complete in
              themselves must be accompanied by the fill in
              material to be used therewith, to be acceptable.

          2)  Exclusion of coverage riders and endorsements,
              executed subsequent to the issuance of the policy,
              must provide for the signed acceptance of the
              insured in addition to a statement to the effect
              that such rider or endorsement is not valid unless
              signed by the insured.

          3)  Riders or endorsements submitted for the purpose of
              amending forms submitted in accordance with Section
              355 of the Code, so that such forms will comply
              with the requirements of the Code or regulations of
              this Department, will not be accepted for approval,
              unless the Department is given an adequate
              justification, in writing, for the use of such
              riders or endorsements.

     cc) Section 359a, Article XX, when applied to family group
         insurance contracts, is interpreted as meaning that the
         person signing the application for the family group
         coverage is the person insured in the family group
         contract against loss incurred by members of the family
         (which members may include the insured) who are listed
         in the application or added subsequently.  The wording
         in the policy forms, riders and endorsements must be
         drawn accordingly.

     dd)

          1)  Questions in an application pertaining to diseases
              or conditions must be broken down so that the
              applicant may insert his answer at least after
              every four or five diseases or conditions listed
              unless questions are grouped as to related diseases
              or conditions.

          2)  Application forms which are drawn for completion by
              one individual for himself and others cannot
              include a certification as to the correctness of
              the answers in the application without some
              qualifications, preferably in the Attestation
              Provision, and should read similar to "to the best
              of your knowledge", or "to the best of your
              knowledge and belief".  The courts have held that
              answers to the questions are given to the best of
              the applicant's belief, and we see no reason  why
              the aforementioned qualification should not be
              contained in the application.

          3)  The receipt and/or application or policy provisions
              may provide that the insurance shall be effective
              upon issuance and the payment of the first premium
              while the insured is in good health.  Provisions
              which provide the insurance shall not be effective
              until delivery of the policy while the insured is
              in good health, will not be acceptable.

     ee) Where the application provides for a written proxy, such
         proxy must be executed over the separate signature of
         the applicant.  The signature required for the
         application in accordance with Section 359a may not be
         used to satisfy the foregoing rule.

     ff) Advertising appearing on an application form or any
         other form that requires the approval of this
         Department, is passed upon by this Department in
         conjunction with the form itself.  This is in conformity
         with Section 143 of the Illinois Insurance Code.

     gg) This Department requires that any form, previously
         approved and subsequently revised, must be submitted
         under a new form number, and be approved in accordance
         with Section 143 of the Illinois Insurance Code.  This
         applies to advertising appearing on applications or
         other forms approved by this division.  The only
         exception to this is advertising which contains
         statistical information, such as the amount of claims
         paid or assets.  For changes of this kind, the insurer
         need not submit a new form number, but only advise the
         Department in writing as to the change in the
         statistical information and the date of change.
         Advertising is not subject to approval but is filed for
         reference purposes only.

 
Section 2001.30  Rules for Filing of Forms
 
     a)  Policy forms, riders and endorsements, drawn to conform
         with Article XX of the Illinois Insurance Code, as
         amended prior to and as of January 1, 1952, must be
         formally filed as follows:

          1)  Two copies of all such forms shall be submitted in
              blank.  If the form does not clearly indicate the
              place for the name of the insured, time the
              insurance becomes effective, and the benefits, it
              will be required that such forms be completed as
              for issuance.

          2)  The application to be used in connection with the
              policy, rider or endorsement must be made a part of
              the filing.  In addition, the approval date must be
              given for application forms previously submitted to
              and approved by this Department.

          3)  Each form must bear an identifying form number in
              the lower left corner of the first page.  No other
              date, except the inclusion of a printing date
              and/or designation of a state, where a special
              edition is required, will be permitted in such
              space.

          4)  It will be necessary for the insurer to submit a
              filing letter containing the following information.

               A)  The name of the form, if any, and identifying
                   form number.

               B)  If the submission is a new form, so state.

               C)  If the form is intended to supersede another,
                   give the form number of the form replaced and
                   the date it was approved by this Department.

               D)  Indication must be given in exact detail as to
                   every difference from the provisions and
                   wording of the statute, as provided in Section
                   357a (1) and (2).

               E)  A clear statement as to how any difference in
                   the provisions and the wording of the statue
                   as provided in Section 357a (1) and (2) are
                   not less favorable in every respect to the
                   insured or the beneficiary.

               F)  A clear statement as to any difference in the
                   provisions and the wording of the statute, or
                   the omission of any provision or part of a
                   provision of the  statute because of
                   inconsistency or inapplicability with the
                   coverage provided in any particular policy
                   form, as provided in Section 357a (3).

               G)  Where provisions are contained in any policy
                   of a foreign or alien insurer, as provided in
                   Section 357a (6) (a), a statement of the laws
                   prescribing or requiring such provision must
                   be given.

               H)  Where provisions are contained in any policy
                   of a domestic insurer, as provided in Section
                   357a (6) (b), a statement of the laws
                   permitting or requiring such provision must be
                   given.

               I)  Where the provisions of sub-sections (1) and
                   (2) of Section 357a do not appear in the order
                   as such sub-sections as provided by
                   sub-section (4) of Section 357a, a clear
                   statement must be made indicating where such
                   provisions may be found in the policies and/or
                   certificates.

     b)  Copies of the forms submitted, as provided above, will
         be retained in the files of this Department.  Under no
         circumstances will copies of forms be returned to the
         company with our stamp of approval thereon.  Notice of
         approval will be given by letter only.

AUTHORITY:  Implementing Article XXVI and Section 149 and

Section 2002.10  Authority
 
This Part is issued by the Director of Insurance pursuant to
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code which empowers the
Director " . . . to make reasonable rules and regulations as may
be necessary for making effective . . ." the insurance laws of
this State.  This Part implements Article XXVI and Section 149 of
the Illinois Insurance Code by establishing minimum standards,
guidelines, and interpretations for the form, content, practice
and method of advertising policies of accident and sickness
insurance offered for sale in Illinois.

 
Section 2002.20  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Part is to assure truthful and adequate
disclosure of all material and relevant information in the
advertising of accident and sickness insurance.  This purpose is
intended to be accomplished by the establishment of, and
adherence to, certain minimum standards and guidelines of conduct
in the advertising of accident and sickness insurance in a manner
which prevents unfair competition among insurers and is conducive
to the accurate presentation and description to the insurance
buying public of a policy of such insurance offered through
various advertising media.  The Guideline for this Section is
found in Appendix A, Illustration A.

 
Section 2002.30  Applicability
 
     a)  This Part shall apply to any accident and sickness
         insurance "advertisement" as that term is hereinafter
         defined in Section 2002.40, unless otherwise specified
         in this Part, intended for presentation, distribution or
         dissemination in this State when such presentation,
         distribution or dissemination is made either directly or
         indirectly by or on behalf of an insurer, agent or
         broker as those terms are defined in the Insurance Code
         of this State and this Part.  The Guideline for this
         paragraph (a) is found in Appendix A, Illustration B.

     b)  Every insurer shall establish and at all times maintain
         a system of control over the content, form and method of
         dissemination of all advertisements of its policies.
         All such advertisements, regardless of by whom written,
         created, designed or presented, shall be the
         responsibility of the insurer whose policies are so
         advertised.  The Guideline for this paragraph (b) is
         found in Appendix A, Illustration C.

 
Section 2002.40  Definitions
 
     a)  An "advertisement," for the purpose of this Part, shall
         include:

          1)  printed and published material, audio-visual
              material, and descriptive literature of an insurer
              used in direct mail, newspapers, magazines, radio
              scripts, TV scripts, billboards and similar
              displays; and

          2)  descriptive literature and sales aids of all kinds
              issued by an insurer, agent or broker for
              presentation to members of the insurance buying
              public, including but not limited to circulars,
              leaflets, booklets, depictions, illustrations, and
              form letters; and

          3)  prepared sales talks, presentations and material
              for use by agents, brokers and solicitors.  The
              Guideline for this paragraph (a) is found in
              Appendix A, Illustration D.

     b)  "Exception," for the purpose of this Part, shall mean
         any provision in a policy whereby coverage for a
         specified hazard is entirely eliminated; it is a
         statement of a risk not assumed under the policy.

     c)  "Institutional Advertisement," for the purpose of this
         Part, shall mean an advertisement having as its sole
         purpose the promotion of the reader's or viewer's
         interest in the concept of accident and sickness
         insurance, or the promotion of the insurer.

     d)  "Insurer," for the purpose of this Part, shall include
         any individual, corporation, association, partnership,
         reciprocal exchange, inter-insurer, Lloyds, fraternal
         benefit society, health maintenance organization, and
         any other legal entity which is defined as an "insurer"
         in the Insurance Code of Illinois and is engaged in the
         advertisement of a policy as "policy" is herein defined.

     e)  "Invitation to Contract," for the purpose of this Part,
         shall mean an advertisement which is neither an
         invitation to inquire nor an institutional
         advertisement.

     f)  "Invitation to Inquire," for the purpose of this Part,
         shall mean an advertisement having as one of its
         objectives, but not necessarily the main objective, the
         creation of a desire to inquire further about the
         product or products and which is limited to a brief
         description of the loss or losses for which the benefit
         is payable, and which may contain:

          1)  The dollar amount of benefit payable; and/or

          2)  The period of time during which the benefit is
              payable, provided the advertisement does not refer
              to cost.

          3)  An ad which is an invitation to inquire and which
              contains a dollar amount of benefit payable; and/or
              the period of time during which a benefit is
              payable shall contain a provision in effect as
              follows:

                   "For costs and further details of the
                   coverage, including exclusions, any reductions
                   or limitations and the terms under which the
                   policy may be continued in force, see your
                   agent or write to the company."

     g)  "Limitation," for the purpose of this Part, shall mean
         any provision which restricts coverage under the policy
         other than an exception or a reduction.

     h)  "Policy," for the purpose of this Part, shall include
         any policy, plan, certificate, contract, agreement,
         statement of coverage, rider or endorsement which
         provides accident or sickness benefits, or medical,
         surgical or hospital expense benefits, whether on an
         indemnity, reimbursement, service or prepaid basis,
         except when issued in connection with another kind of
         insurance other than life, and except disability, waiver
         of premium and double indemnity benefits included in
         life insurance and annuity contracts.  The Guideline for
         this paragraph (h) is found in Appendix A, Illustration
         E.

     i)  "Reduction," for the purpose of this Part, shall mean
         any provision which reduces the amount of the benefit; a
         risk of loss is assumed but payment upon the occurrence
         of such loss is limited to some amount or period less
         than would be otherwise payable had such reduction not
         been used.

 
Section 2002.50  Method of Disclosure of Required Information

All information required to be disclosed by this Part shall be
set out conspicuously and in close conjunction with the
statements to which such information relates or under appropriate
captions of such prominence that it shall not be minimized,
rendered obscure or presented in an ambiguous fashion or
intermingled with the context of the advertisement so as to be
confusing or misleading.  The Guideline for this Section is found
in Appendix A, Illustration F.


Section 2002.60  Form and Content of Advertisements
 
     a)  The format and content of an advertisement of an
         accident or sickness insurance policy shall be
         sufficiently complete and clear to avoid deception or
         the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.  Whether
         an advertisement has a capacity or tendency to mislead
         or deceive shall be determined by the Director of
         Insurance from the overall impression that the
         advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon
         a person of average education or intelligence within the
         segment of the public to which it is directed.  The
         Guideline for this paragraph (a) is found in Appendix A,
         Illustration G.

     b)  Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in
         fact or in implication.  Words or phrases, the meaning
         of which is clear only by implication or by familiarity
         with insurance terminology, shall not be used.  The
         Guideline for this paragraph (b) is found in Appendix A,
         Illustration H.

 
Section 2002.70  Advertisements of Benefits Payable, Losses Covered or Premiums Payable
 
     a)  Deceptive words, phrases or illustrations prohibited.

          1)  No advertisement shall omit information or use
              words, phrases, statements, references or
              illustrations if the omission of such information
              or use of such words, phrases, statements,
              references or illustrations has the capacity,
              tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving
              purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the
              nature or extent of any policy benefit payable,
              loss covered or premium payable.  The fact that the
              policy offered is made available to a prospective
              insured for inspection prior to consummation of the
              sale or an offer is made to refund the premium if
              the purchaser is not satisfied, does not remedy
              misleading statements.  The Guideline for this
              paragraph (a) (1) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration I.

          2)  No advertisement shall contain or use words or
              phrases such as:  "all"; "full"; "complete";
              "comprehensive"; "unlimited"; "up to"; "as high
              as"; "this policy will help pay your hospital and
              surgical bills"; "this policy will help fill some
              of the gaps that Medicare and your present
              insurance leave out"; "this policy will help to
              replace your income" (when used to express loss of
              time benefits); or similar words and phrases, in a
              manner which exaggerates any benefits beyond the
              terms of the policy.  The Guideline for this
              paragraph (a) (2) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration J.

          3)  An advertisement shall not contain descriptions of
              a policy limitation, exception or reduction, worded
              in a positive manner to imply that it is a benefit,
              such as, describing a waiting period as a "benefit
              builder," or stating "even pre-existing conditions
              are covered after two years."  Words and phrases
              used in an advertisement to describe such policy
              limitations, exceptions and reductions shall fairly
              and accurately describe the negative features of
              such limitations, exceptions and reductions of the
              policy offered.  The Guideline for this paragraph
              (a) (3) is found in Appendix A, Illustration K.

          4)  No advertisement of a benefit for which payment is
              conditional upon confinement in a hospital or
              similar facility shall use words or phrases such as
              "tax free"; "extra cash"; "extra income"; "extra
              pay"; or substantially similar words or phrases
              because such words and phrases have the capacity,
              tendency or effect of misleading the public into
              believing that the policy advertised will, in some
              way, enable them to make a profit from being
              hospitalized.  The Guideline for this paragraph (a)
              (4) is found in Appendix A, Illustration L.

          5)  No advertisement of a hospital or other similar
              facility confinement benefit shall advertise that
              the amount of benefit is payable on a monthly or
              weekly basis when, in fact, the amount of the
              benefit payable is based upon a daily pro rata
              basis relating to the number of days of
              confinement.  When the policy contains a limit on
              the number of days of coverage provided, such limit
              must appear in the advertisement.  The Guideline
              for this paragraph (a) (5) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration M.

          6)  No advertisement of a policy covering only one
              disease or a list of specified diseases shall imply
              coverage beyond the terms of the policy.
              Synonymous terms shall not be used to refer to any
              disease so as to imply broader coverage than is the
              fact.

          7)  An advertisement for a policy providing benefits
              for specified illnesses only, such as cancer, or
              for specified accidents only, such as automobile
              accidents, shall clearly and conspicuously in
              prominent type state the limited nature of the
              policy.  The statement shall be worded in language
              identical to, or substantially similar to the
              following:  "THIS IS A LIMITED POLICY"; "THIS IS A
              CANCER ONLY POLICY"; "THIS IS AN AUTOMOBILE
              ACCIDENT ONLY POLICY."

          8)  An advertisement of a direct response insurance
              product shall not imply that because "no insurance
              agent will call and no commissions will be paid to
              agents," that it is "a low cost plan," or use other
              similar words or phrases because the cost of
              advertising and servicing such policies is a
              substantial cost in the marketing of a direct
              response insurance product.  The Guideline for this
              paragraph (a) (8) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration N.

     b)  Exceptions, Reductions and Limitations

          1)  When an advertisement which is an invitation to
              contract refers to either a dollar amount, or a
              period of time for which any benefit is payable, or
              the cost of the policy, or specific policy benefit,
              or the loss for which such benefit is payable, it
              shall also disclose those exceptions, reductions
              and limitations affecting the basic provisions of
              the policy without which the advertisement would
              have the capacity or tendency to mislead or
              deceive.  The Guideline for this paragraph (b) (1)
              is found in Appendix A, Illustration O.

          2)  When a policy contains a waiting, elimination,
              probationary or similar time period between the
              effective date of the policy and the effective date
              of coverage under the policy or a time period
              between the date a loss occurs and the date
              benefits begin to accrue for such loss, an
              advertisement which is subject to the requirements
              of the preceding paragraph shall disclose the
              existence of such periods.  The Guideline for this
              paragraph (b) (2) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration P.

          3)  An advertisement shall not use the words "only";
              "just"; "merely"; minimum"; or similar words or
              phrases to describe the applicability of any
              exceptions and reductions, such as:  "This policy
              is subject to the following minimum exceptions and
              reductions."  The Guideline for this paragraph (b)
              (3) is found in Appendix A, Illustration Q.

     c)  Pre-Existing Conditions

          1)  An advertisement which is subject to the
              requirements of Section 2002.70 (b) shall, in
              negative terms, disclose the extent to which any
              loss is not covered if the cause of such loss is
              traceable to a condition existing prior to the
              effective date of the policy.  The term
              "pre-existing condition" without an appropriate
              definition or description shall not be used.  The
              Guideline for this paragraph (c) (1) is found in
              Appendix A, Illustration R.

          2)  When a policy does not cover losses resulting from
              pre-existing conditions, no advertisement of the
              policy shall state or imply that the applicant's
              physical condition or medical history will not
              affect the issuance of the policy or payment of a
              claim thereunder.  This Part prohibits the use of
              the phrase "no medical examination required" and
              phrases of similar import, but does not prohibit
              explaining "automatic issue."  If an insurer
              requires a medical examination for a specified
              policy, the advertisement, if it is an invitation
              to contract, shall disclose that a medical
              examination is required.  The Guideline for this
              paragraph (c) (2) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration S.

          3)  When an advertisement contains an application form
              to be completed by the applicant and returned by
              mail for a direct response insurance product, such
              application form shall contain a question or
              statement which reflects the pre-existing condition
              provisions of the policy immediately preceding the
              blank space for the applicant's signature.

               A)  For example, such an application form shall
                   contain a question as follows:

                         "Do you understand that this policy will
                         not pay benefits during the first
                                  year(s) after the issue date
                         for a disease or physical condition
                         which you now have or have had in the
                         past?"
                         [] Yes

               B)  Or substantially the following statement:
                         "I understand that the policy applied
                         for will not pay benefits for any loss
                         incurred during the first           
                         year(s) after the issue date on account
                         of disease or physical condition which I
                         now have or have had in the past."

               C)  The Guideline for this paragraph (c) (3) is
                   found in Appendix A, Illustration T.

 
Section 2002.80  Necessity for Disclosing Policy Provisions Relating to Renewability, Cancellability and Termination
 
When an advertisement, which is an invitation to contract, refers
to either a dollar amount or a period of time for which any
benefit is payable, or the cost of the policy, or specific policy
benefit, or the loss for which such benefit is payable, it shall
disclose the provisions relating to renewability, cancellability
and termination and any modification of benefits, losses covered
or premiums because of age or for other reasons, in a manner
which shall not minimize or render obscure the qualifying
conditions.  The Guideline for this Section is found in Appendix
A, Illustration U.

 
Section 2002.90  Testimonials or Endorsements by Third Parties
 
     a)  Testimonials used in advertisements must be genuine,
         represent the current opinion of the author, be
         applicable to the policy advertised and be accurately
         reproduced.  The insurer, in using a testimonial, makes
         as its own all of the statements contained therein, and
         the advertisement, including such statements, is subject
         to all the provisions of this Part.  The Guideline for
         this paragraph (a) is found in Appendix A, Illustration
         V.

     b)  If the person making a testimonial, an endorsement or an
         appraisal has a financial interest in the insurer or a
         related entity as a stockholder, director, officer,
         employee, or otherwise, such fact shall be disclosed in
         the advertisement.  If a person is compensated for
         making a testimonial, endorsement or appraisal, such
         fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement by language
         substantially as follows:  "Paid Endorsement."  This
         Part does not require disclosure of union "scale" wages
         required by union rules if the payment is actually for
         such "scale" for TV or radio performances.  The payment
         of substantial amounts, directly or indirectly, for
         "travel and entertainment" for filming or recording of
         TV or radio advertisements remove the filming or
         recording from the category of an unsolicited
         testimonial and require disclosure of such compensation.
         This subsection does not apply to an institutional
         advertisement which has as its sole purpose the
         promotion of the insurer.  The Guideline for this
         paragraph (b) is found in Appendix A, Illustration W.

     c)  An advertisement shall not state or imply that an
         insurer or a policy has been approved or endorsed by an
         individual, group of individuals, society, association
         or other organizations, unless such is the fact, and
         unless any proprietary relationship between an
         organization and the insurer is disclosed.  If the
         entity making the endorsement or testimonial has been
         formed by the insurer or is owned or controlled by the
         insurer or the person or persons who own or control the
         insurer, such fact shall be disclosed in the
         advertisement.  The Guideline for this paragraph (c) is
         found in Appendix A, Illustration X.

     d)  When a testimonial refers to benefits received under a
         policy, the specific claim data, including claim number,
         date of loss, and other pertinent information shall be
         retained by the insurer for inspection for a period of
         four years or until the filing of the next regular
         report of examination of the insurer, whichever is the
         longer period of time.  The Guideline for this paragraph
         (d) is found in Appendix A, Illustration Y.

 
Section 2002.100  Use of Statistics
 
     a)  An advertisement relating to the dollar amounts of
         claims paid, the number of persons insured, or similar
         statistical information relating to any insurer or
         policy shall not use irrelevant facts, and shall not be
         used unless it accurately reflects all of the relevant
         facts.  Such an advertisement shall not imply that such
         statistics are derived from the policy advertised unless
         such is the fact, and when applicable to other policies
         or plans shall specifically so state.  The Guideline for
         this paragraph (a) is found in Appendix A, Illustration
         Z.

     b)  An advertisement shall not represent or imply that claim
         settlements by the insurer are "liberal" or "generous,"
         or use words of similar import, or that claim
         settlements are or will be beyond the actual terms of
         the contract.  An unusual amount paid for a unique claim
         for the policy advertised is misleading and shall not be
         used.  The Guideline for this paragraph (b) is found in
         Appendix A, Illustration AA.

     c)  The source of any statistics used in an advertisement
         shall be identified in such advertisement.  The
         Guideline for this paragraph (c) is found in Appendix A,
         Illustration BB.

 
Section 2002.110  Identification of Plan or Number of Policies
 
     a)  When a choice of the amount of benefits is referred to,
         an advertisement which is an invitation to contract
         shall disclose that the amount of benefits provided
         depends upon the plan selected and that the premium will
         vary with the amount of the benefits selected.

     b)  When an advertisement which is an invitation to contract
         refers to various benefits which may be contained in two
         or more policies, other than group master policies, the
         advertisement shall disclose that such benefits are
         provided only through a combination of such policies.

     c)  The Guideline for paragraphs (a) and (b) is found in
         Appendix A, Illustration CC.

 
Section 2002.120  Disparaging Comparisons and Statements
 
An advertisement shall not directly or indirectly make unfair or
incomplete comparisons of policies or benefits or comparisons of
non-comparable policies of other insurers, and shall not
disparage competitors, their policies, services or business
methods, and shall not disparage or unfairly minimize competing
methods of marketing insurance.  The Guideline for this Section
is found in Appendix A, Illustration DD.

 
Section 2002.130  Jurisdictional Licensing and Status of Insurer
 
     a)  An advertisement which is intended to be seen or heard
         beyond the limits of the jurisdiction in which the
         insurer is licensed shall not imply licensing beyond
         those limits.  The Guideline for this paragraph (a) is
         found in Appendix A, Illustration EE.

     b)  An advertisement shall not create the impression
         directly or indirectly that the insurer, its financial
         condition or status, or the payment of its claims, or
         the merits, desirability, or advisability of its policy
         forms or kinds or plans of insurance are approved,
         endorsed or accredited by any division or agency of this
         State or the United States Government.  The Guideline
         for this paragraph (b) is found in Appendix A,
         Illustration FF.

 
Section 2002.140  Identity of Insurer
 
     a)  The name of the actual insurer shall be stated in all of
         its advertisements.  The form number or numbers of the
         policy advertised shall be stated in an advertisement
         which is an invitation to contract.  An advertisement
         shall not use a trade name, any insurance group
         designation, name of the parent company of the insurer,
         name of a particular division of the insurer, service
         mark, slogan, symbol or other device which without
         disclosing the name of the actual insurer would have the
         capacity and tendency to mislead or deceive as to the
         true identity of the insurer.

     b)  No advertisement shall use any combination of words,
         symbols or physical materials which by their content,
         phraseology, shape, color or other characteristics are
         so similar to combination of words, symbols or physical
         materials used by agencies of the federal government or
         of this State, or otherwise appear to be of such a
         nature that it tends to confuse or mislead prospective
         insureds into believing that the solicitation is in some
         manner connected with an agency of the municipal, state,
         or federal government.

     c)  The Guideline for paragraphs (a) and (b) is found in
         Appendix A, Illustration GG.
 

Section 2002.150  Group or Quasi-Group Implications
 
An advertisement of a particular policy shall not state or imply
that prospective insureds become group or quasi-group members
covered under a group policy and as such enjoy special rates or
underwriting privileges, unless such is the fact.  The Guideline
for this Section is found in Appendix A, Illustration HH.

 
Section 2002.160  Introductory, Initial or Special Offers
 
     a)  

          1)  An advertisement of an individual policy shall not
              directly or by implication represent that a
              contract or combination of contracts is an
              introductory, initial or special offer, or that
              applicants will receive substantial advantages not
              available at a later date, or that the offer is
              available at a later date, or that the offer is
              available only to a specified group of individuals,
              unless such is the fact.  An advertisement shall
              not contain phrases describing an enrollment period
              as "special," "limited," or similar words or
              phrases when the insurer uses such enrollment
              periods as the usual method of advertising accident
              and sickness insurance.  The Guideline for this
              paragraph (a) (1) is found in Appendix A,
              Illustration II.

          2)  An enrollment period during which a particular
              insurance product may be purchased on an individual
              basis shall not be offered within this State unless
              there has been a lapse of not less than six months
              between the close of the immediately preceding
              enrollment period for the same product and the
              opening of the new enrollment period.  The
              advertisement shall indicate the date by which the
              applicant must mail the application which shall be
              not less than ten days and not more than forty days
              from the date that such enrollment period is
              advertised for the first time.  This Part applies
              to all advertising media:  i.e., mail, newspapers,
              radio, television, magazines and periodicals, by
              any one insurer.  It is inapplicable to
              solicitations of employees or members of a
              particular group or association which otherwise
              would be eligible under specific provisions of the
              Insurance Code for group or blanket insurance.  The
              phrase "any one insurer" includes all the
              affiliated companies of a group of insurance
              companies under common management or control.  The
              Guideline for this paragraph (a) (2) is found in
              Appendix A, Illustration JJ.

          3)  This Part prohibits any statement or implication to
              the effect that only a specific number of policies
              will be sold, or that a time is fixed for the
              discontinuance of the sale of the particular policy
              advertised because of special advantages available
              in the policy, unless such is the fact.

          4)  The phrase "a particular insurance product" in
              paragraph (a) (2) of this Section means an
              insurance policy which provides substantially
              different benefits than those contained in any
              other policy.  Different terms of renewability; an
              increase or decrease in the dollar amounts of
              benefits; an increase or decrease in any
              elimination period or waiting period from those
              available during an enrollment period for another
              policy shall not be sufficient to constitute the
              product being offered as a different product
              eligible for concurrent or overlapping enrollment
              periods.  The Guideline for this paragraph (a) (4)
              is found in Appendix A, Illustration KK.

     b)  An advertisement shall not offer a policy which utilizes
         a reduced initial premium rate in a manner which
         overemphasizes the availability and the amount of the
         initial reduced premium.  When an insurer charges an
         initial premium that differs in amount from the amount
         of the renewal premium payable on the same mode, the
         advertisement shall not display the amount of the
         reduced initial premium either more frequently or more
         prominently than the renewal premium, and both the
         initial reduced premium and the renewal premium must be
         stated in juxtaposition in each portion of the
         advertisement where the initial reduced premium appears.
         The Guideline for this paragraph (b) is found in
         Appendix A, Illustration LL.

     c)  Special awards, such as a "safe drivers' award," shall
         not be used in connection with advertisements of
         accident or accident and sickness insurance.  The
         Guideline for this paragraph (c) is found in Appendix A,
         Illustration MM.

 
Section 2002.170  Statements About an Insurer
 
An advertisement shall not contain statements which are untrue in
fact, or by implication misleading, with respect to the assets,
corporate structure, financial standing, age or relative position
of the insurer in the insurance business.  An advertisement shall
not contain a recommendation by any commercial rating system
unless it clearly indicates the purpose of the recommendations
and the limitations of the scope and extent of the
recommendation.  The Guideline for this Section is found in
Appendix A, Illustration NN.

 
Section 2002.180  Enforcement Procedures
 
     a)  Advertising File.  Each insurer shall maintain at its
         home or principal office a complete file containing
         every printed, published or prepared advertisement of
         its individual policies and typical printed, published
         or prepared advertisements of its blanket, franchise and
         group policies hereafter disseminated in this or any
         other state whether or not licensed in such other state,
         with a notation attached to each such advertisement
         which shall indicate the manner and extent of
         distribution and the form number of any policy
         advertised.  Such file shall be subject to regular and
         periodic inspection by this Department.  All such
         advertisements shall be maintained in said file for a
         period of either four years or until the filing of the
         next regular report of examination of the insurer,
         whichever is the longer period of time.

     b)  Certificate of Compliance.  Each insurer required to
         file an Annual Statement which is now or which hereafter
         becomes subject to the provisions of this Part must file
         with this Department with its Annual Statement a
         Certificate of Compliance executed by an authorized
         officer of the insurer wherein it is stated that to the
         best of his knowledge, information and belief the
         advertisements which were disseminated by the insurer
         during the preceding statement year complied or were
         made to comply in all respects with the provisions of
         this Part and the Insurance Laws of this State as
         implemented and interpreted by this Part.

 
Section 2002.190  Severability Provision
 
If any Section or portion of a Section of this Part or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of the Part, or the
applicability of such provision to other persons or
circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.

 
Section 2002.APPENDIX A  Guidelines
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION A  Guideline to Section 2002.20

Disclosure is one of the principal objectives of this Part and
this Section states specifically that the Part shall assure
"truthful and adequate disclosure of all material and relevant
information."  This Part specifically prohibits some previous
advertising techniques.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION B  Guideline to Section 2002.30 (a)
 
     a)  If an advertisement is circulated in Illinois from a
         medium published in a locality bordering Illinois, which
         has substantial circulation in Illinois, the
         advertisement must either comply with this Part,
         disclaim the availability of the product advertised for
         Illinois residents or the company must decline issue of
         the policy explaining to the applicant that the
         advertisement does not meet Illinois advertising
         standards.

     b)  If an advertisement appears in a regional publication
         which has a substantial amount of its circulation in
         Illinois, the ad will be considered "intended" for use
         in Illinois and it must either comply with this Part,
         disclaim the availability of the product advertised for
         Illinois residents or the company must decline issue of
         the policy explaining to the applicant that the
         advertisement does not meet Illinois advertising
         standards.

     c)  This Part applies to group and blanket as well as
         individual accident and sickness insurance.  Certain
         distinctions, however, are applicable to these
         categories.  Among them is the level of conversance with
         insurance, a factor which is covered by Section 2002.60
         (a) of this Part.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION C  Guideline to Section 2002.30 (b)
 
     a)  This Section holds a company responsible for the actions
         of an agent or employee unless the company can
         demonstrate that it had no prior knowledge of the
         actions and unless the company can demonstrate to the
         satisfaction of the Director of Insurance that it has an
         adequate system of control as described in Section
         2002.30 (b) of this Part.

     b)  It is recognized that there are three kinds of
         advertisements:  

          1)  offer to contract,

          2)  offer to inquire, and

          3)  institutional advertisements.

         These distinctions are made since, historically,
         different provisions in a policy were required or not
         required to be disclosed depending on the kind of
         advertisement; the company's attention is directed to
         Sections 2002.40, 2002.70 (b) (1), and Section 2002.80
         in determining those provisions that must be disclosed.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION D  Guideline to Section 2002.40 (a)
 
     a)  The scope of the term "advertisement" extends to the use
         of all media for communication to the general public
         (Section 2002.40 (a)) and to the use of all media for
         communication by agents, brokers and solicitors.

     b)  The definition of "advertisement" includes advertising
         material included with a policy when the policy is
         delivered and material used in the solicitation of
         renewals and reinstatements.

     c)  The definition of "advertisement" does not include:

          1)  material to be used solely for the training and
              education of an insurer's employees, agents or
              brokers unless such training or educational
              materials are for the presentation to the public of
              accident and health policies;

          2)  material in house organs of insurers;

          3)  communications within an insurer's own organization
              not intended for dissemination to the public;

          4)  individual communications of a personal nature with
              current policyholders other than material urging
              such policyholders to increase or expand coverages;

          5)  court approved material ordered by a court to be
              disseminated to policyholders;

          6)  a general announcement from a group or blanket
              policyholder to eligible individuals on an
              employment or membership list that a contract or
              program has been written or arranged, provided the
              announcement clearly indicates that it is
              preliminary to the issuance of a booklet or
              certificate; or

          7)  correspondence between an insurer and prospective
              group or blanket policyholder which follows the
              initial presentation of a group or blanket policy
              to the prospective policyholder, as long as such
              correspondence relates to the same program as
              initially presented.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION E  Guideline to Section 2002.40 (h)
 
In Section 2002.40 (h), the language "except disability, waiver
of premium and double indemnity benefits included in life
insurance and annuity contracts" means except disability, waiver
of premium and double indemnity benefits included in life
insurance, endowment or annuity contracts or contracts
supplemental thereto which contain only such provisions which:

     a)  provide additional benefits in case of death or
         dismemberment or loss of sight by accident, or as

     b)  operate to safeguard such contracts against lapse or to
         give a special surrender value or special benefit or an
         annuity in the event that the insured or annuitant shall
         become totally and permanently disabled as defined by
         the contract or supplemental contract.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION F  Guideline to Section 2002.50
 
     a)  This Section permits the use of either of the following
         alternative methods of disclosure:

          1)  The first alternative provides for the disclosure
              of exceptions, limitations, reductions and other
              restrictions conspicuously and in close conjunction
              with the statements to which such information
              relates.  This may be accomplished by disclosure in
              the description of the related benefits or in a
              paragraph set out in close conjunction with the
              description of policy benefits.

          2)  The second alternative provides for the disclosure
              of exceptions, limitations, reductions and other
              restrictions not in conjunction with the provisions
              describing policy benefits but under appropriate
              captions of such prominence that the information
              shall not be minimized, rendered obscure or
              otherwise made to appear unimportant.  The phrase
              "under appropriate captions" means that the title
              must be accurately descriptive of the captioned
              material.  Appropriate captions include the
              following:  "Exceptions," "Exclusions," "Conditions
              Not Covered" and "Exceptions and Reduction."  The
              use of captions such as, or similar to, the
              following are not acceptable because they do not
              provide adequate notice of the significance of the
              material:  "Extent of Coverage," "Only these
              Exclusions" or "Minimum Limitations."

     b)  In considering whether an advertisement complies with
         the disclosure requirements of this Section, the Section
         must be applied in conjunction with the form and content
         standards in Section 2002.60.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION G  Guideline to Section 2002.60 (a)
 
     a)  This Section must be applied in conjunction with
         Sections 2002.20 and 2002.50 of this Part.  This Section
         refers specifically to "format and content" of the
         advertisement and the "overall" impression created by
         the advertisement.  This involves factors such as, but
         not limited to, the size, color and prominence of type
         used to describe benefits.  The word "format" means the
         arrangement of the text and captions.

     b)  The Part requires distinctly different advertisements
         for publication in newspapers or magazines of general
         circulation as compared to scholarly, technical or
         business journals or newspapers.  Where an advertisement
         consists of more than one piece of material, each piece
         of material must, independent of all other pieces of
         material, conform to the disclosure requirements
         applicable to the appropriate form of advertisement as
         defined in Section 2002.40 of this Part.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION H  Guideline to Section 2002.60 (b)
 
This Section prohibits the use of incomplete statements and words
or phrases which have the tendency or capacity to mislead or
deceive because of the reader's unfamiliarity with insurance
terminology.  Therefore, words, phrases and illustrations used in
an advertisement must be clear and unambiguous.  If the
advertisement uses insurance terminology, sufficient description
of a word, phrase or illustration shall be provided by definition
or description in the context of the advertisement.  As implied
in Section 2002.60 (a), distinctly different levels of
comprehension may be anticipated of the subscribers of various
publications.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION I  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (a) (1)
 
This Section prohibits words, phrases or illustrations which
create deception to the reader by omission or commission.  The
following examples are illustrations of the prohibitions created
by the Section:

     a)  An advertisement which describes any benefits that vary
         by age must disclose that fact in a manner as described
         in this Part.  (See also ILLUSTRATION O.)

     b)  An advertisement which uses a phrase such as "no age
         limit," if benefits or premiums vary by age or if age is
         an underwriting factor, must disclose that fact in a
         manner as described in this Part.  (See also
         ILLUSTRATION O.)

     c)  "Individualized" advertisements, applications, requests
         for additional information and similar materials are
         unacceptable if they state or imply that the recipient
         has been individually selected to be offered insurance
         or has had his eligibility for such insurance
         individually determined in advance, when the
         advertisement is directed to all persons in a group or
         to all persons whose names appear on a mailing list.

     d)  Advertisements which indicate that a particular coverage
         or policy is exclusively for "preferred risks" or a
         particular segment of the population or that a
         particular segment of the population are acceptable
         risks, when such distinctions are not maintained in the
         issuance of policies, are not acceptable.

     e)  Advertisements for group or franchise plans which
         provide a common benefit or a common combination of
         benefits shall not imply that the insurance coverage is
         tailored or designed specifically for that group, unless
         such is the fact.

     f)  It is unacceptable to use terms such as "enroll" or
         "join" to imply group or blanket insurance coverage when
         such is not the fact.

     g)  Any advertisement which contains statements such as
         "anyone can apply" or "anyone can join" other than with
         respect to a guaranteed issue policy for which
         administrative procedures exist to assure that the
         policy is issued within a reasonable period of time
         after the application is received by the insurer is
         unacceptable.

     h)  An advertisement which states or implies immediate
         coverage or guaranteed issuance of a policy is
         unacceptable unless suitable administrative procedures
         exist so that the policy is issued within a reasonable
         period of time for such immediate coverage or guaranteed
         issuance coverage after the application is received by
         the insurer.

     i)  Any advertisement which uses any phrase or term such as
         "here is all you do to apply," "simply" or "merely" to
         refer to the act of applying for a policy which is not a
         guaranteed issue policy is unacceptable unless it refers
         to the fact that the application is subject to
         acceptance or approval by the insurer.

     j)  Applications, request forms for additional information,
         and similar related materials are unacceptable if they
         resemble paper currency, bonds, stock certificates, etc.

     k)  An advertisement may employ devices which are designed
         to create reasonable concern in the minds of those to
         whom they are directed.  Unacceptable examples of
         devices which may create undue concern are:

          1)  the use of phrases such as "cancer kills somebody
              every two minutes" and "total number of accidents"
              without reference to the total population from
              which such statistics are drawn.  (As an example of
              a permissible device, data prepared by the American
              Cancer Society is acceptable provided the source is
              noted and it is not overemphasized.);

          2)  the use of phrases such as "the finest kind of
              treatment," implying that such treatment would be
              unavailable without insurance;

          3)  the reproduction of newspaper articles, etc.,
              containing irrelevant facts and figures;

          4)  the use of illustrations which unduly emphasize
              automobile accidents, cripples or persons confined
              in beds who are in obvious distress or receiving
              hospital or medical bills or persons being evicted
              from their homes due to their hospital bills;

          5)  the use of phrases such as "financial disaster,"
              "financial distress," "financial shock," or other
              phrases implying that financial ruin is likely
              without the insurance advertised where used in an
              advertisement which comes within Section 2002.70
              (a) (7) relating to policies covering specified
              illnesses or specified accidents only and other
              accident and health insurance designed primarily
              for supplementing an insured's basic insurance
              program.

     l)  An advertisement which uses the word "plan" without
         identifying it as an "insurance plan" is not
         permissible.

     m)  An advertisement which implies in any manner that the
         prospective insured may realize a profit from obtaining
         hospital, medical or surgical insurance coverage is not
         acceptable.

     n)  An advertisement shall not state or imply by word,
         phrase or illustration that the benefits being offered
         will supplement any other insurance policy,
         insurance-type concept, or governmental plan if such is
         not the fact.

     o)  An advertisement of a hospital or other similar facility
         confinement benefit that makes reference to the benefit
         being paid directly to the policyholder is misleading
         unless, in making such a reference, the advertisement
         includes a statement that the benefits may be paid
         directly to the hospital or other health care facility
         if an assignment of benefits is made by the
         policyholder.  An advertisement of medical and surgical
         expense benefits shall comply with this Part in regard
         to the disclosure of assignments of benefits to
         providers of services.  Phrases such as "you collect,"
         "you get paid," "pays you," or other words or phrases of
         similar import are acceptable so long as the
         advertisement indicates that it is payable to the
         insured or someone designated by the insured.

     p)  An advertisement which refers to "hospitalization for
         injury or sickness" omitting the word "covered" when the
         policy excludes certain sicknesses or injuries is
         unacceptable.  Continued reference to "covered injury or
         sickness" is not necessary where this fact has been
         prominently disclosed in the advertisement and where the
         description of sicknesses or injuries not covered are
         prominently set forth.

     q)  An advertisement which refers to "whenever you are
         hospitalized" or "while you are confined in the
         hospital" omitting the phrase "for covered injury or
         sickness," if the policy excludes certain injuries or
         sicknesses, is unacceptable.  Continued reference to
         "covered injury or sickness" is not necessary where this
         fact has been prominently disclosed in the advertisement
         and where the description of sicknesses or injuries not
         covered are prominently set forth.

     r)  Advertisements which state that benefits are provided
         when "you go to the hospital" are unacceptable unless
         the advertisement clearly sets forth the extent of the
         coverage.

     s)  An advertisement which is an invitation to contract and
         which fails to disclose that the definition of
         "hospital" does not include a nursing home, convalescent
         home or extended care facility, as the case may be, is
         unacceptable.

     t)  An advertisement which is an invitation to contract and
         which fails to disclose any waiting or elimination
         periods for specific benefits is unacceptable.

     u)  An advertisement for a limited policy, or a plan of
         insurance which covers only certain causes of loss (such
         as dread disease) or which covers only a certain type of
         loss is unacceptable if:

          1)  the advertisement refers to a total benefit maximum
              limit payable under the policy in a prominent
              manner;

          2)  the advertisement states any total benefit limit
              without stating the periodic benefit payment, if
              any, and the length of time the periodic benefit
              would be payable to reach the total benefit limit;

          3)  the advertisement prominently displays a benefit
              which would not, as a general rule, be payable
              under an average claim.

     v)  Advertisements which utilize total amounts payable under
         hospital room and board, medical or surgical coverage or
         other benefits in a policy, such as benefits for private
         duty nursing, are unacceptable unless the actual amounts
         payable per day for such indemnity or benefits are
         stated.  (See also ILLUSTRATION M.)

     w)  Examples of claims that may be paid under a policy shall
         not disclose only maximum benefits unless such maximum
         benefits are paid for loss from common and probable
         illnesses or accidents rather than exceptional or rare
         illnesses or accidents or periods of confinement for
         such exceptional or rare accidents or illnesses.

     x)  When a range of benefit levels is set forth in an
         advertisement, it must be made clear that the insured
         will receive only the benefit level written or printed
         in the policy selected and issued.  Language which
         implies that the insured may select the benefit level at
         the time of filing claims is unacceptable.

     y)  Language which implies that the amount of benefits
         payable under a loss-of-time policy may be increased at
         the time of claim or disability according to the needs
         of the insured is unacceptable.

     z)  An advertisement for loss-of-time coverage which is an
         invitation to contract which sets forth a range of
         amounts of benefit levels is unacceptable unless it also
         states that eligibility for the benefits is based upon
         condition of health, income, other economic conditions,
         or other underwriting standards of the insurer if such
         is the fact.

     aa) The term "confining sickness" is an abbreviated
         expression and must be explained in an advertisement
         containing the term.  Such an explanation might be as
         follows:

              "Benefits are payable for total disability due to
              confining sickness only so long as the insured is
              necessarily confined and under the care of a
              physician."

         Statements such as "Lifetime Sickness Benefits" or
         "Five-Year Sickness Benefits" are incomplete if such
         benefits are subject to confinement requirements.

     bb) Advertisements for policies whose premiums are modest
         because of their limited coverage or limited amount of
         benefits shall not describe premiums as "low," "low
         cost," "budget" or use qualifying words of similar
         import.  This Part also prohibits the use of words such
         as "only" and "just" in conjunction with statements of
         premium amounts when used to imply a bargain.

     cc) Advertisements which state or imply that premiums will
         not be changed in the future are not acceptable unless
         the advertised policies so provide.

     dd) An advertisement which does not require the premium to
         accompany the application must not overemphasize that
         fact and must make the facts concerning effective date
         of coverage clear.

     ee) An advertisement which exaggerates the effect of
         statutorily mandated benefits or required policy
         provisions or which exaggerates the provisions or
         implies that such provisions are unique to the
         advertised policy, is unacceptable.  For example, the
         phrase, "Money Back Guarantee" is an exaggerated
         description of the ten-day right to examine the policy
         and is not acceptable.

     ff) An advertisement which implies that a common type of
         policy or a combination of common benefits is "new,"
         "unique," "a bonus," "a breakthrough," or is otherwise
         unusual is unacceptable.  Also, the addition of a novel
         method of premium payment to an otherwise common plan of
         insurance does not render it "new."

     gg) An advertisement which is an invitation to contract
         which fails to disclose the amount of any deductible
         and/or the percentage of any co-insurance factor is
         unacceptable.

     hh) An advertisement which fails to state clearly the type
         of insurance coverage being offered is not acceptable.

     ii) Language which states or implies that each member under
         a "family" contract is covered as to the maximum
         benefits advertised, when such is not the fact, is
         unacceptable.

     jj) The importance of diseases rarely or seldom found in the
         class of persons to whom the policy is offered shall not
         be exaggerated in an advertisement.

     kk) An advertisement, regardless of the media used, which is
         designed to produce leads in any manner or subsequent
         advertisement prior to contact must include information
         disclosing that an agent may contact the applicant if
         such is the fact.

     ll) Advertisements for policies designed to supplement
         Medicare or which are otherwise designed for issue to
         the elderly shall not employ devices which are designed
         to create undue anxiety in the minds of such persons.
         Such phrases as "here is where most people over 65 learn
         about the gaps in Medicare," or "Medicare is great,
         but . . ." which otherwise exaggerate the gaps in
         Medicare coverage, are unacceptable.  Phrases or devices
         which unduly excite fear or concern, dependence upon
         relatives or charity are unacceptable.  Phrases or
         devices which imply that long sicknesses or hospital
         stays are common among the elderly are unacceptable.

     mm) An advertisement implying that the coverage is
         supplemental to Medicare may show the extent it
         supplements Medicare, but must not refer to the Medicare
         Program and the proposed coverage to imply that with the
         coverage and Medicare, the patient will have no
         uncovered expenses unless that is in fact true.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION J  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (a) (2)
 
     a)  This Section recognizes that certain words and phrases
         in advertising may have a tendency to mislead the public
         as to the extent of benefits under an advertised policy.
         Consequently, such terms (and those specified in this
         Part do not represent a comprehensive list but only
         examples) must be used with caution to avoid any
         tendency to exaggerate benefits and must not be used
         unless the statement is literally true in every
         instance.  The use of the following phrases based on
         such terms or having the same effect must be similarly
         restricted:  "pays hospital, surgical, etc., bills,"
         "pays dollars to offset the cost of medical care,"
         "safeguards your standard of living," "pays full
         coverage," "pays complete coverage," "pays for financial
         needs," "provides for replacement of your lost
         paycheck," "replaces income" or "emergency paycheck."
         Other phrases may or may not be acceptable depending
         upon the nature of the coverage being advertised.  For
         example, the phrase "this policy will help to replace
         your income" is acceptable in advertising for loss of
         time coverage, but is unacceptable in advertising for
         hospital confinement (including "hospital indemnity")
         coverage.

     b)  This Section also prohibits words or phrases which
         exaggerate the effect of a benefit payment on the
         insured's general well-being, such as "worry-free
         savings plan," "guaranteed savings," "financial peace of
         mind" and "you will never have to worry about hospital
         bills again."

     c)  Advertisements for policies designed to supplement
         Medicare benefits are unacceptable if they fail to
         disclose that no hospital confinement benefits will be
         payable for that portion of a Medicare benefit period
         for which Medicare pays all hospital confinement
         expenses, currently 60 days, other than the initial
         deductible if the policy so provides.  The length of
         said period must be stated in days.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION K  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (a) (3)
 
Explanations must not minimize nor describe restrictive
provisions in a positive manner.  Negative features must be
accurately set forth.  Any limitation on benefits precluding
pre-existing conditions also must be restated under a caption
concerning exclusions or limitations, notwithstanding that the
pre-existing condition exclusion has been disclosed elsewhere in
the advertisement.  (See ILLUSTRATIONS R, S and T for additional
comments on pre-existing conditions.)
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION L  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (a) (4)

     a)  The words, phrases, illustrations and concepts listed
         are illustrations of the words, phrases, illustrations
         and concepts prohibited by the Part which create the
         impression of a profit or gain to be realized by the
         insured when hospitalized.

     b)  Any illustration which depicts paper currency or checks
         showing an amount payable is deceptive and misleading
         and is not permissible.

     c)  A hospital indemnity advertisement shall not include
         language such as "pay for a trip to Florida," "buy a new
         television" or otherwise imply that the insured will
         make a profit on hospitalization.

     d)  An advertisement which uses words such as "extra,"
         "special" or "added" to describe any benefit in the
         policy is unacceptable.

     e)  Although the Part prohibits the use of the phrase "tax
         free," it does not prohibit the use of complete and
         accurate terminology explaining the Internal Revenue
         Service Rules applicable to the taxation of accident and
         sickness benefits.  The IRS Rules provide that the
         premiums paid for the benefits received from hospital
         indemnity policies are subject to the same rules as loss
         of time premiums and benefits and are not afforded the
         same favorable tax treatment as premiums for expense
         incurred hospital, medical and surgical benefit
         coverages.  (Rev. Rul. 68-451 and Rev. Rul. 69-154.)
         Prominence either by caption, lead-in, boldface or large
         type shall not be given in any manner to any statements
         relating to the tax status of such benefits.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION M  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (a) (5)
 
This paragraph requires that benefits payable on a daily basis be
stated as such and not on the basis of weekly or monthly
equivalents.  It also requires disclosure of the time period of
coverage provided by the policy.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION N  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (a) (8)
 
     a)  This Section should be applied in conjunction with
         Section 2002.120.

     b)  Phrases such as "we cut costs to the bone" or "we deal
         direct with you so our costs are lower" shall not be
         used.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION O  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (b) (1)
 
     a)  If an exception, reduction or limitation is important
         enough to use in a policy, it is of sufficient
         importance that its existence in the policy should be
         referred to in the advertisement regardless of whether
         it may also be the subject matter of a provision of the
         Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy
         Provision Law.

     b)  Some advertisements disclose exceptions, reductions and
         limitations as required, but the advertisement is so
         lengthy as to obscure the disclosure.  Where the length
         of an advertisement has this effect, special emphasis
         must be given by changing the format to show the
         restrictions in a manner which does not minimize, render
         obscure or otherwise make them appear unimportant.

     c)  This Section provides that those invitations to contract
         advertisements for a policy with any reduction of
         benefits at a particular age will disclose with the
         display of usual benefits that the reduction is
         applicable.

     d)  This interpretation is primarily aimed toward those
         policies which reduce benefits at a particular attained
         age.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION P  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (b) (2)
 
     a)  This Section imposes the same disclosure standards as
         the preceding paragraph with respect to policy
         provisions providing for waiting, elimination,
         probationary or similar time periods between the
         effective date of the policy and the effective date of
         coverage under the policy or a time period between the
         date a loss occurs and the date benefits begin to accrue
         for such loss.  The comments under Section 2002.70 (b)
         (1) are equally applicable to this Section.  Where a
         policy has waiting, elimination, probationary or other
         such time periods, such provisions must be stated in
         negative terms.

     b)  This Section provides that those advertisements which
         are invitations to contract for a policy with any
         waiting periods for coverage, at any time, will disclose
         such fact in a manner as prescribed by Section 2002.50
         of this Part.

     c)  An advertisement for a policy designed to supplement
         Medicare benefits is unacceptable if it fails to
         disclose prominently that no hospital confinement
         benefits will be payable for that portion of a Medicare
         benefit period, currently 60 days, for which Medicare
         pays all Medicare eligible hospital confinement expenses
         other than the initial deductible, if the policy so
         provides.  The length of said period must be stated in
         days.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION Q  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (b) (3)
 
     a)  This Section is similar to Section 2002.70 (a) (3) and
         requires a fair and accurate description of exceptions,
         limitations and reductions in a manner which does not
         minimize, render obscure or otherwise make them appear
         unimportant.

     b)  Advertisements must state exceptions, limitations and
         reductions in the negative and must not understate any
         exception, limitation or reduction or qualify any
         exception, limitation or reduction to emphasize coverage
         described elsewhere:  e.g., "Does not pay for
                     ; HOWEVER, MEDICARE PAYS THIS" is not
         acceptable, nor is "Does not pay for the first four days
         in HOSPITAL FOR SICKNESS, BUT PAYS FOR ACCIDENT FROM
         FIRST DAY."  (Capitalization indicates the manner in
         which statements are sometimes emphasized.)

     c)  This Section prohibits the use of any term, such as
         "just," "only," "merely," "necessary" or "minimum" to
         describe any exclusion, limitation, reduction or
         exception.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION R  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (c) (1)
 
     a)  This Section imposes the same disclosure standards with
         respect to pre-existing conditions' provisions as noted
         in ILLUSTRATION 0.  The comments under that Illustration
         are equally applicable to this Section of the Part since
         the pre-existing conditions' provision is an exception
         under the Part.

     b)  This Part implements the objective of Section 2002.70
         (a) (3) by requiring in negative terms a description of
         the effect of a pre-existing condition exclusion because
         such an exclusion is a restriction on coverage.  The
         Subdivision also prohibits the use of the phrase
         "pre-existing condition" without an appropriate
         definition or description of the term and prohibits
         stating a reduction in the statutory time limit (such as
         a reduction from two years to one year) as an
         affirmative benefit.  The words "appropriate definition
         or description" mean that the term "pre-existing
         condition" must be defined as it is used by the
         company's claims department.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION S  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (c) (2)
 
     a)  The phrase "no health questions" or words of similar
         import shall not be used if the policy excludes
         pre-existing conditions.

     b)  Use of a phrase such as "guaranteed issue" or "automatic
         issue," if the policy excludes pre-existing conditions
         for a certain period, must be accompanied by a statement
         disclosing that fact in a manner which does not
         minimize, render obscure or otherwise make it appear
         unimportant, and is otherwise consistent with Section
         2002.50.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION T  Guideline to Section 2002.70 (c) (3)
 
The Department requires approval of the application forms even
when the application is not attached to the policy when issued.
This Part does not change such a requirement.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION U  Guideline to Section 2002.80
 
     a)  This Section imposes the same disclosure standards with
         respect to policy provisions relating to renewability,
         cancellability and termination, modification of
         benefits, losses or premiums because of age or otherwise
         as stated in ILLUSTRATION O.  The comments in that
         Illustration are equally applicable to this Section.

     b)  Advertisements of cancellable policies must state that
         the contract is cancellable or renewable at the option
         of the company as the case may be.  For example, the
         following represent illustrations:  A policy which is
         cancellable shall be advertised in a manner similar to
         "This policy can be cancelled by the company at any
         time"; a policy which is renewable at the option of the
         insurance company shall be advertised in a manner
         similar to "This policy is renewable at the option of
         the company" or "The company has the right to refuse
         renewal of this policy" or "Renewable at the option of
         the insurer."  Advertisements of such policies must
         indicate that the insurer has the right to increase
         premium rates.

     c)  With respect to non-cancellable policies and
         guaranteed-renewable policies, the Part requires that a
         summary of the policy provisions with respect to
         renewability must be set forth and defined where
         appropriate.  The disclosure of provisions relating to
         renewability requires the use of language such as
         "non-cancellable," "non-cancellable and guaranteed
         renewable," or "guaranteed renewable."

     d)  The Part also requires a statement of the qualifying
         conditions which constitute limitations of the permanent
         nature of the coverage.  These customarily fall into
         three categories:  age limits, reservation of right to
         increase premiums and the establishment of aggregate
         limits.  For example, "non-cancellable and guaranteed
         renewable" does not fulfill the requirement of the Part
         if the policy contains a terminal age of 65.  In such a
         case, a proper statement would be "non-cancellable and
         guaranteed renewable to age 65."  If a guaranteed
         renewable policy reserves the right to increase
         premiums, the statement must be expanded into language
         similar to "guaranteed renewable to age 65, but the
         company reserves the right to increase premium rates on
         a class basis."  A policy may have one or more of the
         three basic limitations and an advertisement must
         describe each of those which the policy contains.  Most
         new individual policy issues are guaranteed renewable;
         therefor, the fact that a policy is guaranteed renewable
         shall not be exaggerated.

     e)  This Part also requires the disclosure of any
         modification of benefits or losses covered because of
         age or for other reasons.  Provisions for reduction of
         benefits at stated ages must be set forth.  For example,
         a policy may contain a provision which reduces benefits
         50% after age 60 although it is renewable to age 65.
         Such a reduction would have to be set forth.  Also, a
         provision for the elimination of certain hazards at any
         specific ages or after the policy has been in force for
         a specified time would have to be set forth.

     f)  An advertisement for a policy which provides for
         step-rated premium rates based upon the policy year of
         the insured's attained age must disclose such rate
         increases and the times or ages at which such premiums
         increase.

     g)  This Section requires that the qualifying conditions of
         renewability must be disclosed in a manner which does
         not minimize or render obscure the qualifying conditions
         of renewal.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION V  Guideline to Section 2002.90 (a)
 
     a)  This Section requires that all such statements must be
         genuine and not fictitious.  Under this Section, the
         manufacturing, substantive editing or "doctoring-up" of
         a testimonial is clearly prohibited as being false and
         misleading to the insurance buying public.  However,
         language which would be unacceptable under this Part
         must be edited out of a testimonial.

     b)  A testimonial must also represent the current opinion of
         the author.  While an insurer is not required in each
         instance to check with the author each time the
         testimonial is used to ascertain that the views
         expressed have not altered, a testimonial should be
         checked before use in those instances when a change in
         views might be probable or reasonable to assume.  When a
         testimonial is used more than one year after it was
         originally given, a confirmation must be obtained.

     c)  Testimonials or Endorsements by Third Parties.  A
         "testimonial" is defined as a statement from a typical
         policyowner, group policyholder or beneficiary as to
         either benefits received in a claim payment or comments
         relating to the policyowner, group policyholder or
         beneficiary expressions of appreciation relating to
         those usual policyowner, group policyholder or
         beneficiary-company relationships.

     d)  An endorsement differs from a testimonial only through
         the fact that an endorsement includes any comments from
         any person except those of a typical policyowner, group
         policyholder or beneficiary who is commenting only on
         those usual policyowner, group policyholder or
         beneficiary-company relationships.  A typical
         policyowner, group policyholder or beneficiary is not
         any person well known to the general public or who is
         classifiable as a celebrity.

     e)  There are two types of testimonials:  Solicited and
         Unsolicited.

          1)  Solicited Testimonials are those in which the
              company has in any way contacted the policyowner,
              group policyholder or beneficiary requesting
              information about claims handling, policyowners
              service, etc.  A solicited testimonial used in an
              advertisement must be clearly labeled with a
              statement such as, "These comments from
              policyowners, group policyholders or beneficiaries
              were received as a result of our questioning
              policyowners, group policyholders, or beneficiaries
              as to their thoughts about our service," or other
              language which indicates that the testimonial was
              solicited.

          2)  Unsolicited Testimonials are those sent to a
              company without the company contacting the
              policyowner, group policyholder or beneficiary.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION W  Guideline to Section 2002.90 (b)
 
     a)  This Section requires the disclosure of any financial
         interest of a person making a testimonial, endorsement
         or appraisal.  Any payment, direct or indirect, whether
         specifically for the testimonial or endorsement or for
         any other services or relationship, is required to be
         disclosed.  Reimbursement for substantial travel and
         entertainment expenses is also required to be disclosed;
         however, union scale wages required by union rules are
         not required to be disclosed.  Travel away from the home
         of the person giving the testimonial or endorsement to a
         distant location involving transportation expenses,
         lodging expenses or expenses for meals constitutes
         payment and must be reflected as a paid endorsement.
         The requirement of disclosure may be fulfilled by use of
         the phrase "Paid Endorsement" or words of similar import
         in a type style and size that is identical to the
         endorser's name.  In the case of television or radio
         advertising, the paid nature of the advertisement must
         be given prominence.

     b)  The word "person," as used in this subsection, includes
         a human person, body of persons or any legal entity
         recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties.

     c)  A person making an endorsement cannot comment upon his
         evaluation either of the merits of an administrative
         process of a company or of the value of the insurance
         product unless he has adequate experience within the
         area he is evaluating.  In the absence of such
         experience, either the level of expertise of the person
         or the relevant facts forming the basis for such an
         endorsement must be disclosed.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION X  Guideline to Section 2002.90 (c)
 
This Section requires both that approval or endorsement of a
policy by an individual, group of individuals, society,
association or other organization be factual and that any
proprietary relationship between the sponsoring or endorsing
organization and the insurer be disclosed.  For example, if the
dividend under an association group case is payable to the
association, disclosure of that fact is required.  Also, if the
insurer or an officer of the insurer formed or controls the
association, that fact must be disclosed.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION Y  Guideline to Section 2002.90 (d)
 
     a)  This Section provides the Department of Insurance the
         means to verify the authenticity of testimonials used in
         advertising efforts.

     b)  The use of testimonials which do not correctly reflect
         the present practices of the insurer or which are not
         applicable to the policy or benefit being advertised is
         not permissible.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION Z  Guideline to Section 2002.100 (a)
 
     a)  This Section prohibits the use of statistics in a manner
         which is misleading and deceptive.  It requires the
         disclosure of all relevant facts and prohibits the use
         of irrelevant facts.  An advertisement shall
         specifically identify the policy to which statistics
         relate and, where statistics are given which are
         applicable to a different policy, it must be stated
         clearly that the data does not relate to the policy
         being advertised.

     b)  Statistics which describe the insurer, such as assets,
         corporate structure, financial standing, age, product
         lines or relative position in the insurance business,
         may be irrelevant and, if used at all, must be used with
         extreme caution because of their potential for
         misleading the public.  As a specific example, an
         advertisement for a health insurance policy which refers
         to the amount of life insurance which the company has in
         force or the amounts paid out in life insurance benefits
         is not permissible unless the advertisement clearly
         indicates the amount paid out for each line of
         insurance.

     c)  An advertisement which states the dollar amount of
         claims paid must also indicate the period over which
         such claims have been paid.  The total dollar amount of
         claims paid must not be overemphasized.

     d)  If the term "loss ratio" is used, it shall be properly
         explained in the context of the advertisement, and it
         shall be calculated on the basis of premiums earned to
         losses incurred and shall not be on a yearly run-off
         basis.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION AA  Guideline to Section 2002.100 (b)
 
This Section prohibits deceptive or misleading statements in an
advertisement regarding an insurer's claim settlement practices.
It also prohibits the use of an unusual amount paid for a unique
claim or an unusual claim whether actual or hypothetical.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION BB  Guideline to Section 2002.100 (c)
 
This Section requires any advertisement which uses statistics to
cite the source.  The Part does not require that statistics for a
state be used since such statistics as hospital charges and
average stays may vary from state to state.  When nationwide
statistics are used, such fact should be noted as such unless the
statistics on the particular point are substantially the same in
a state to which the advertisement is directed.  Statistics may
be used only if they are credible.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION CC  Guideline to Section 2002.110 (a) and (b)
 
This Section imposes the same disclosure standards as stated in
ILLUSTRATION O.  The comments in that Illustration are equally
applicable to this Section.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION DD  Guideline to Section 2002.120
 
     a)  This Section prohibits unfair or incomplete comparisons
         of products, insurers or business methods.  It
         specifically prohibits comparisons of non-comparable
         policies and provides that advertisements shall not
         unfairly minimize nor disparage competing types of
         insurance coverages or competing methods of marketing
         insurance, including any federal or state program.

     b)  An advertisement should not contain statements such as
         "no red tape" or "here is all you do to receive
         benefits."

     c)  Advertisements which state or imply that competing
         insurance coverages customarily contain certain
         exceptions, reductions or limitations not contained in
         the advertised policies are unacceptable unless such
         exceptions, reductions or limitations are contained in a
         substantial majority of such competing coverages.

     d)  Advertisements which state or imply that an insurer's
         premiums are lower or that its loss ratios are higher
         because its organizational structure differs from that
         of competing insurers are unacceptable.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION EE  Guideline to Section 2002.130 (a)
 
This Section prohibits advertisements which imply that an insurer
is licensed beyond the limits of those jurisdictions where it is
actually licensed.  An advertisement which contains testimonials
from persons who reside in a state in which the insurer is not
licensed or which refers to claims of persons residing in states
in which the insurer is not licensed implies licensing in those
states and, therefore, is in violation of this Part unless the
advertisement states that the insurer is not licensed in those
states.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION FF  Guideline to Section 2002.130 (b)
 
     a)  This Section prohibits advertisements implying that
         approval, endorsement or accreditation of policy forms
         or advertising has been granted by any division or
         agency of the state or federal governments.  "Approval"
         of either policy forms or advertising shall not be used
         by an insurer to imply or state that a governmental
         agency has endorsed or recommended the insurer, its
         policies, advertising or its financial condition.

     b)  This prohibits prominent statements such as "licensed by
         the State of Illinois" or any other statements which
         imply endorsements by a governmental agency.  The
         insurer is not prohibited to disclose the fact that a
         company is licensed in the State of Illinois in the body
         or majority of the advertisement.

     c)  Although the Section permits a reference to an insurer
         being licensed in a state where the advertisement
         appears, it does not allow exaggeration of the fact of
         such licensing nor does it permit the suggestion that
         competing insurers may not be so licensed because, in
         most states, an insurer must be licensed in the state to
         which it directs its advertising.

     d)  Terms such as "official," or words of similar import,
         used to describe any policy or application form are not
         permissible because of the potential for deceiving or
         misleading the public.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION GG  Guideline to Section 2002.140 (a) and (b)
 
     a)  This Section prohibits the use of an advertisement which
         has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to
         the true identity of the insurer.  The Section
         recognizes the existence of holding companies.  The
         requirement that the advertisement refer to the policy
         form number is applicable to advertisements of
         individual and franchise policies only.  However, the
         requirement of the policy form number is not applicable
         to those advertisements for individual and franchise
         policies not required to disclose information under
         Sections 2002.70 (b) (1) and (8).  Subsection (a) and
         subsection (b) prohibit misleading practices of insurers
         in connection with the sale of insurance to supplement
         federal Medicare benefits and confusion by insurers with
         advertising material used by hospital service
         corporations or pre-paid health plans.

     b)  This Section prohibits advertisements, envelopes or
         stationery which employ words, letters, initials,
         symbols or other devices which are so similar to those
         used by governmental agencies or other insurers,
         including hospital service corporations and pre-paid
         health plans, that the public may be confused into
         believing:

          1)  that the advertised coverages are somehow provided
              by or are endorsed by such governmental agencies or
              such other insurers;

          2)  that the advertised coverages are the same as those
              provided by such governmental agencies or such
              other insurers;

          3)  that the advertiser is the same as, is connected
              with or is endorsed by such governmental agencies
              or such other insurers.

     c)  It is unacceptable for an advertisement to use the name
         of a state or a political subdivision thereof in a
         policy name or description.  For example, "XYZ insurance
         company's (name of state) hospital confinement policy"
         is unacceptable.

     d)  This Section prohibits an insurer from using envelopes
         or stationery which have printed thereon any name,
         service mark, slogan or symbol or using any other device
         in such a manner that it implies that the insurer or the
         policy advertised is connected with a governmental
         agency such as the Social Security Administration or the
         Veterans Administration.

     e)  Policies advertised to supplement Medicare benefits are
         unacceptable if they incorporate the word "MEDICARE" in
         the title of the plan or policy being advertised unless,
         wherever it appears, said word is qualified by language
         differentiating it from Medicare.  Such phrases as
         "Medicare Insurance Supplement" or "insurance to
         supplement Medicare" are acceptable.  Such an
         advertisement, however, shall not use the phrase
         "               Medicare Department of the XYZ Insurance
         Company," or language of similar import.

     f)  Advertisements for policies designed to supplement
         Medicare benefits are unacceptable if they fail to
         clearly show that the company or the plan being
         advertised is not endorsed by the U.S. Government or the
         federal Medicare program.

     g)  This Section prohibits an advertisement which implies
         that the reader may lose a right, privilege or benefit
         under federal, state or local law if he fails to respond
         to the advertisement.

     h)  If the use of letters, initials or symbols of the
         corporate name or trademark would have the capacity or
         tendency to mislead or deceive the public as to the true
         identity of the insurer, this Section prohibits the use
         of such letters, initials, or symbols without disclosing
         in close conjunction the true and correct complete name
         of the insurer which will issue the policy.

     i)  This Part prohibits the use of the name of an agency or
         "               Underwriters" or "               Plan"
         in type, size and location so as to have the capacity
         and tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true
         identity of the insurer and also prohibits an insurer
         from using an address so as to mislead or deceive as to
         its true identity, location or licensing status.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION HH  Guideline to Section 2002.150
 
     a)  This Section prohibits the use of representations to any
         segment of the population that a particular policy or
         coverage is available only to that or similar segments
         of the population as preferred risks when actually such
         policy or coverage is available to members of the public
         at large at the same rates.  This Part prohibits an
         advertisement labeled "Now for Readers of X Magazine."

     b)  This Section prohibits the solicitation of a particular
         class, such as governmental employees, by use of
         advertisements which state or imply that their
         occupational status entitles them to reduced rates on a
         group or other basis when, in fact, the policy being
         advertised is sold only on an individual basis at
         regular rates.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION II  Guideline to Section 2002.160 (a) (1)
 
This Section prohibits advertising representing that a product is
offered on an introductory, initial, special offer basis or
otherwise which

     a)  will not be available later; or

     b)  is available only to certain individuals

unless such is the fact.  This Part prohibits the repetitive use
of such advertisements.  Where an insurer uses enrollment periods
in the advertising of its policies, the Part prohibits describing
an enrollment period as a special opportunity or offer for the
applicant.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION JJ  Guideline to Section 2002.160 (a) (2)
 
     a)  This Section restricts the repetitive use of enrollment
         periods.  This Part does not limit just the use of
         enrollment periods.  It requires that a particular
         insurance product offered in an enrollment period
         through any advertising media, including the prepared
         presentations of agents, cannot be offered again in the
         entire state until six months from the close of the
         enrollment periods have expired.  Thus, an insurer must
         choose whether to use enrollment periods or open
         enrollment for a product.

     b)  This Section does not prohibit multiple advertising
         during an enrollment period through any and all media
         published or transmitted within this state as long as
         the enrollment periods for such advertisements have the
         same expiration date.

     c)  The six month limitation applies to the offering of the
         product in any advertising media and the entire State of
         Illinois is considered one geographic area.  For
         example, if an enrollment period was used in the
         solicitation of a product in the Chicago area, it could
         not be offered in any section of Illinois until six
         months expire from the closing date of the enrollment
         period.

 
Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION KK  Guideline to Section 2002.160 (a) (4)
 
     a)  This Section defines the meaning of "a particular
         insurance product" in Section 2002.160 (a) (2) and
         prohibits advertising of products having minor
         variations, such as different elimination periods or
         different amounts of daily hospital indemnity benefits,
         in a succession of enrollment periods.

     b)  To determine if one product is substantially different
         than another, the products must be compared as to
         primary benefits offered.  For example, if one hospital
         indemnity policy has a $30/day benefit and a return of
         premium benefit, it is substantially similar to one
         having a $100/day benefit with no return of premium
         benefit.  A hospital expense policy as compared with a
         hospital indemnity plan is substantially different.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION LL  Guideline to Section 2002.160 (b)
 
This Section prohibits advertising which overemphasizes an
initial reduced premium.  The Part requires the renewal premium
to appear as frequently as, as prominently as, and in
juxtaposition with the initial reduced premium wherever and as
often as it appears.  The term "juxtaposition" means side by side
or immediately above or below.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION MM  Guideline to Section 2002.160 (c)
 
     a)  This subsection prohibits the use in advertisements of
         so-called awards as an inducement to the purchase of
         insurance.

     b)  This subsection prohibits those marketing techniques
         which imply that the person is being offered an
         opportunity to purchase a policy due to a minor
         qualification which has little to do with the
         underwriting requirements for the benefits provided by
         the policy.
 

Section 2002.ILLUSTRATION NN  Guideline to Section 2002.170
 
This Section is closely related to the requirements of Section
2002.100 concerning the use of statistics.  The Part prohibits
insurers which have been organized for only a brief period of
time advertising that they are "old" and also prohibits the use
of illustrations of a "home office" building in a manner which is
misleading with respect to the actual size and magnitude of the
insurer.  Also, the occupations of the persons comprising the
insurer's board of directors or the public's familiarity with
their names or reputations is irrelevant and must not be
emphasized.  The preponderance of a particular occupation or
profession among the board of directors of an insurer does not
justify the advertisement of a plan of insurance offered to the
general public as insurance designed or recommended by members of
that occupation or profession.  For example, it is unacceptable
for an insurance company to advertise a policy offered to the
general public as "the physicians' policy" or "the doctors' plan"
simply because there is a preponderance of physicians or doctors
on the board of directors of the insurer.  The Part prohibits the
use of a recommendation of a commercial rating system unless the
purpose, meaning and limitations of the recommendation are
clearly indicated.

Section 2003.10  Authority
 
This Part is issued by the Director of Insurance pursuant to
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code, and it implements
Sections 143, 149 and 357.5 of the Illinois Insurance Code by
establishing definitions of the terms "noncancellable",
"noncancellable and guaranteed renewable", and "guaranteed
renewable", as recommended by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners, when such terms are used in individual
and family accident and health insurance policies and in the
advertising thereof.

 
Section 2003.20  Applicability
 
This Part shall apply to all companies transacting in this state
the kinds of business enumerated in clause (b) of Class 1 and
clause (a) of Class 2 of Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance Code
(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 616) and to all other
"persons" as defined in Section 422 of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.
1981, ch. 73, par. 1029) who are engaging in an accident and
health insurance business in this state.

 
Section 2003.30  Definitions of Noncancellable, etc.
 
The terms "noncancellable" or "noncancellable and guaranteed
renewable" may be used only in a policy which the insured has the
right to continue in force by the timely payment of premiums set
forth in the policy
 
     a)  until at least age 50, or

     b)  in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at
         least five years from its date of issue, during which
         period the company has no right to make unilaterally any
         change in any provision of the policy while the policy
         is in force.

 
Section 2003.40  Definition of Guaranteed Renewable
 
Except as provided above, the term "guaranteed renewable" may be
used only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue
in force by the timely payment of premiums

     a)  until at least age 50, or

     b)  in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at
         least five years from its date of issue, during which
         period the company has no right to make unilaterally any
         change in any provision of the policy while the policy
         is in force, except that the company may make changes in
         premium rates by classes.  Any such change in rates
         shall be filed with the Director pursuant to Section 355
         (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 967).

 
Section 2003.50  Synonyms
 
The foregoing limitation on use of the term "noncancellable"
shall also apply to any synonymous term such as "not cancellable"
and the limitation on use of the term "guaranteed renewable"
shall apply to any synonymous term such as "guaranteed
continuable".

 
Section 2003.60  Medicare Exception
 
The definitions in Sections 2003.30 and 2003.40 of this Part are
not intended to preclude the issuance of hospital, surgical and
medical coverages which may be classified as "noncancellable",
"noncancellable and guaranteed renewable" or "guaranteed
renewable" to the date of eligibility for benefits under Title
XVIII of the Social Security Act, Health Insurance for the Aged
Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), commonly known as Medicare,
provided the policy contains a definition of such date of
eligibility, such as:  "the day before the date of eligibility
for any coverage under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act as
amended" or similar language.  Where loss-of-time and
hospital-medical-surgical coverages are issued in a  combination
policy, the hospital-medical-surgical coverages may be classified
as "noncancellable", "noncancellable and guaranteed renewable" or
"guaranteed renewable" to the date of eligibility for benefits
under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act without so limiting
the loss-of-time coverage in the same policy.

 
Section 2003.70  Other Guarantees
 
Nothing herein contained is intended to restrict the development
of policies having other guarantees of renewability, or to
prevent the accurate description of their terms of renewability
or the classification of such policies as guaranteed renewable or
noncancellable for any period during which they may actually be
such, provided the terms used to describe them in policy
contracts and advertising are not such as may readily be confused
with the above terms.

 
Section 2003.80  Effective Date
 
This Part shall be effective and apply to all individual and
family accident and health insurance policies issued or issued
for delivery in this state and the advertising thereof on and
after December 28, 1965.

Section 2004.5  Authority
 
The following Part is promulgated and adopted pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 401 of the Illinois
Insurance Code in order to implement Section 353(a) thereof.

 
Section 2004.10  Application and Effective Date
 
This Part applies to all companies transacting in this state the
kinds of business enumerated in clause (b) of Class 1 and clause
(a) of Class 2 of Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance Code, (Ill.
Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 616) and it applies to all accident
and health policies for which reserve standards are prescribed
under Section 353(a) of the Code.  It shall become effective
December 28, 1965.

 
Section 2004.20  Active Life Reserves - Individual Policies
 
     a)  General Provisions

         Active life reserves are required for all in force
         policies and are in addition to any reserves required in
         connection with claims.  For policy types in Section
         2004.20(b)(1-3) described below, the minimum reserve
         shall be determined as specified herein.  It should be
         emphasized, however, that these are minimum standards
         and higher, adequate reserves shall be established by
         the company in any case where experience indicates that
         these minimum standards do not place a sound value on
         the liabilities under the policy.  For policy type in
         Section 2004.20(b)(4), the minimum reserve shall be the
         gross pro rata unearned premium.

     b)  Types of individual accident and health insurance
         policies

          1)  Policies which are noncancellable or noncancellable
              and guaranteed renewable for life or to a specified
              age, such as 60 or 65.

          2)  Policies which are guaranteed renewable for life or
              to a specified age, such as 60 or 65, but under
              which the company reserves the right to change the
              scale of premiums.

          3)  Policies in which the company has reserved the
              right to cancel or refuse renewal for one or more
              reasons, but has agreed implicitly or explicitly
              that, prior to a specified time or age, it will not
              cancel or decline renewal solely because of
              deterioration of health after issue; however,
              policies shall not be considered of this type if
              the company has reserved the right to refuse
              renewal provided the right is to be exercised at
              the same time for all policies in the same
              category, unless premiums are based on the level
              premium principle.

          4)  All other individual policies.

          5)  Notices:

               A)  The above does not classify "franchise" as a
                   type of policy.  Such policies are frequently
                   written under an agreement limiting the
                   company's right to  cancel or refuse renewal.
                   Usually the right is reserved to refuse
                   renewal of all policies in the group or other
                   categories such as those ceasing to be members
                   of the association, and this would place such
                   policies in Section 2004.20(b)(4) in
                   accordance with the last clause under Section
                   2004.20(b)(3) above.  However, if premiums are
                   based on the level premium principle or if the
                   renewal privilege granted to the individual
                   insured meets the requirements for policies in
                   Section 2004.20(b)(1-3), the franchise policy
                   shall be so classified for reserve purposes.

               B)  "Family group accident and health insurance
                   policies", as defined in Section 367(4) of the
                   Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981,
                   ch. 713, par. 979(4)), should have active life
                   reserves determined under Section 2004.20 of
                   this Part.

               C)  A policy may have guarantees qualifying it as
                   a policy listed in Section 2004.20(b)(1-3)
                   until a specified age or duration after which
                   the guarantees, or lack of guarantees, may
                   qualify it as a policy such as listed in
                   Section 2004.20(b)(1-4).  In such case, the
                   policy in each period shall be considered for
                   reserve purposes according to the type to
                   which it then belongs.

               D)  Where all of the benefits of a policy, as
                   provided by rider or otherwise, are not of the
                   same type as listed in Section 2004.20(b),
                   each benefit shall be considered for reserve
                   purposes according to the type to which it
                   belongs.

     c)  Reserve standards for policies in Section
         2004.20(b)(1-3).

          1)  Interest.  The maximum interest rate for reserves
              shall be 3 1/2% compounded annually.

          2)  Mortality:

               A)  1941 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Table, or

               B)  1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Table, or

               C)  1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table, or

               D)  Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial
                   Mortality Table, or

               E)  Such other table as may be approved by the
                   Director.

          3)  Morbidity or other contingency:

               A)  Total disability due to accident or sickness.
                   The minimum standard shall be the 1964
                   Commissioners Disability Table.

               B)  Hospital Expense Benefits.  The minimum
                   standard shall be the 1956 Inter-company
                   Hospital Table.

               C)  Surgical Expense Benefits.  The minimum
                   standard shall be the 1956 Inter-company
                   Surgical Table.

               D)  Accidental Death Benefits.  The minimum
                   standard shall be the 1959 Accidental Death
                   Benefits Table.

               E)  All other benefits.  The company shall adopt
                   standards to produce reserves which place a
                   sound value on the liabilities under such
                   benefit.

          4)  Negative Reserves.  Negative reserves on any
              benefit may be offset against positive reserves for
              other benefits in the same policy, but the mean
              reserve on any policy shall never be taken as less
              than one-half the valuation net premium.

          5)  Preliminary Term.  The minimum reserve shall be on
              the basis of a two-year preliminary term.

          6)  Reserve Method.  Mean reserves diminished by
              appropriate credit for valuation net deferred
              premiums; or, mid-terminal reserves plus gross or
              net pro rata unearned premium reserves.  In no
              event, however, may the aggregate reserve for all
              policies be less than the gross pro rata unearned
              premium under such policies.

          7)  Alternative Valuation Procedures and Assumptions.
              Provided the reserve on all policies to which the
              method or basis is applied is not less in the
              aggregate than the amount determined according to
              the applicable standards specified above, the
              company may use any reasonable assumptions as to
              the interest rate, mortality rates, or the rates of
              morbidity or other contingency, and may introduce
              an assumption as to the voluntary termination of
              policies.  Also, subject to the preceding
              condition, the company may employ methods other
              than the methods stated above in determining a
              sound value of its liabilities under such policies,
              including but not limited to the following:

               A)  Optional use of either the level premium, the
                   one-year preliminary term, or the two-year
                   preliminary term method

               B)  Prospective valuation on the basis of actual
                   gross premiums with reasonable allowance for
                   future expenses.

               C)  The use of approximations such as those
                   involving age groupings, groupings of several
                   years of issue or average amounts of indemnity

               D)  The computation of the reserve for one policy
                   benefit as a percentage of, or by other
                   relation to, the aggregate policy reserves,
                   exclusive of the benefit or benefits so valued

               E)  The use of a composite annual claim cost for
                   all or any combination of the benefits
                   included in the policies valued.

          8)  For statement purposes the net reserve liability
              may be shown as the excess of the mean reserve over
              the amount of net unpaid and deferred premiums, or,
              regardless of the underlying method of calculation,
              it may be divided between the gross pro rata
              unearned premium reserve and a balancing item for
              the "additional reserve".

 
Section 2004.30  Active Life Reserves - Group Policies
 
     a)  This Section applies to accident and health insurance as
         defined in Section 367 (excluding subsection (4)
         thereof) and Section 367(a) of the Illinois Insurance
         Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, pars. 979 and
         979(a)).

     b)  The minimum reserve for active lives on all group
         accident and health policies shall be the pro rata gross
         unearned premium.

     c)  If a group policy contains a conversion option for
         terminated employees and such employees, under this
         provision, may receive an individual policy without
         evidence of insurability, the company shall establish a
         reserve for the morbidity cost expected in excess of
         such costs assumed by the premium, if any, which is then
         payable by or on behalf of such terminated employee.
         The group account shall be charged with an amount
         (conversion charge) to establish this reserve and
         thereafter such reserve shall be maintained as an
         individual policy active life reserve.

 
Section 2004.40  Claim Reserves - Present Value of Amounts Not Yet Due on Claims
 
     a)  General (Also called "Disabled Life Reserves" in the
         case of insurance providing loss-of-time benefits for
         disability due to accident or sickness) Reserves are
         required for claims on all health insurance policies,
         group and individual in Section 2004.20(b) providing
         benefits for continuing loss, such as loss-of-time or
         hospitalization.

     b)  Claim reserve standards for total disability due to
         accident or sickness

          1)  Interest.  The maximum interest rate for reserves
              shall be 3 1/2% compounded annually.

          2)  Morbidity.  The reserve shall be established in
              accordance with the 1964 Commissioners Disability
              Table, except that for unreported claims and
              resisted claims and, at the option of the company,
              claims with a duration of disablement of less than
              two years, reserves may be based on the individual
              company's experience or other assumptions designed
              to place a sound value on the liabilities.
              Reserves based on such experience or assumptions
              shall be verified by the development of each year's
              claims over a period of years.

          3)  For policies with an elimination period, the
              duration of disablement shall be considered as
              dating from the time that benefits would have begun
              to accrue had there been no elimination period.

          4)  A new disability connected with a previous
              disability which had a duration of at least one
              year and terminated within six months of the new
              disability shall be considered a continuation of
              the previous disability.

     c)  Reserve standards for all other claim reserves

          1)  Interest.  The maximum interest rate for reserves
              shall be 3 1/2% compounded annually.

          2)  Morbidity or other contingency.  The reserve shall
              be based on the individual company's experience or
              other assumptions designed to place a sound value
              on the liabilities.  The results shall be verified
              by the development of each year's claims over a
              period of years.

     d)  Valuation procedures

         The company may employ suitable approximations and
         estimates, including but not limited to groupings and
         averages, in computing claim reserves.

 
Section 2004.50  Policies Issued Prior to Operative Date of Section 353(a)
 
Any company may elect to establish and maintain reserves for
policies issued prior to the operative date of Section 353(a) of
the Illinois Insurance Code in accordance with the standards
prescribed by Section 353(a) of the Illinois Insurance Code.  In
making such election a company may elect to revalue all previous
issues or at its option may revalue only certain blocks of issues
as determined by issue date or plan of coverage.  Claim reserves
may be revalued independent of active life reserves.  Such
election shall be made by filing written notice with the
Director, stating the effective date of election and identifying
the reserves or issues of policies to be revalued.

<P>
SOURCE:  Filed October 16, 1974, effective October 30, 1974;

<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 2005.10  Authority

This Rule is issued by the Director of Insurance pursuant to
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code and it implements
especially Sections 143, 359a and 154 of the Illinois Insurance
Code by establishing minimum standards for the terms
"pre-existing illness" or "pre-existing conditions" as
constructed by definition of sickness and the provisions for Time
Limit on Certain Defenses used in accident and health insurance
policies.

 
Section 2005.20  Applicability
 
This Rule shall apply to all companies transacting in this State
the kinds of business enumerated in Clause (b) of Class 1 and
Clause (a) of Class 2 of Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance Code
(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 616) and to all other
"persons" as defined in Section 422 of the Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.
1981, ch. 73, par. 1029) who are engaging in accident and health
insurance business in this State.
 
Section 2005.30  The Minimum Definition of Pre-existing Illness or Pre-existing Condition
 
     a)  A "pre-existing illness" or "pre-existing condition" as
         constructed by the definition of sickness and the
         provisions for Time Limit on Certain Defenses in an
         accident and health insurance policy issued after the
         effective date of this Part shall mean any disease,
         illness, sickness, malady or condition which was:

          1)  diagnosed or treated by a legally qualified
              physician prior to the effective date of coverage
              for the insured with consultation, advice or
              treatment by a legally qualified physician
              occurring within 24 months prior to the effective
              date of  coverage for the insured; or

          2)  diagnosed or treated by a legally qualified
              physician prior to the effective date of coverage
              for the insured, but a legally qualified physician
              demonstrates that there is a reasonable medical
              question that the disease, illness, sickness,
              malady or condition involved did continue within 24
              months prior to the effective date of coverage for
              the insured without the necessity of consultation,
              advice or treatment by a legally qualified
              physician; or

          3)  evident because there was a clear, distinct symptom
              or symptoms of the disease, illness, sickness,
              malady or condition demonstrable prior to the
              effective date of coverage for the insured with the
              occurrence of such symptoms being evident within 12
              months prior to the effective date of coverage for
              the insured and in which, in the opinion of a
              legally qualified physician, would;

               A)  indicate that the diseases, illness, sickness,
                   malady or condition probably began and
                   manifested itself before the effective date of
                   the coverage for the insured, and

               B)  would cause an ordinarily prudent person to
                   seek diagnosis, care or treatment.

     b)  The above definition is the minimum required.  Any
         definition more favorable to the insured may be used.
         The time limitations in this Section do not apply to the
         company's underwriting standards such as the
         investigation of an applicant's health history.

     (Source:  Amended at 14 Ill. Reg. 19892, effective December
         4, 1990) 

 
Section 2005.40  Application of the Definition
 
     a)  In applying this definition to determine if an insured
         received consultation, advice or treatment from a
         physician for a disease, illness, sickness, malady or
         condition, such consultation, advice or treatment must
         be clearly indicated in the insured's medical records or
         from the statements of the insured's  legally qualified
         physician or other relevant evidence.

     b)

          1)  If an application contains conflicting answers, or
              if an answer is clearly incomplete, the insurer has
              an obligation to investigate further.  For example,
              if a question about medical history is answered
              with the name of a physician but there is no
              statement concerning the condition treated or the
              reason for the visit, the insurer has an obligation
              to investigate further, an insurer failing to make
              such an investigation and then taking appropriate
              action would be estopped from using a "pre-existing
              condition" or "pre-existing illness" as a grounds
              for denying the claim or rescinding the policy for
              the particular disease, illness, sickness, malady
              or condition.

          2)  If a particular disease, illness, malady or
              condition was not diagnosed by a legally qualified
              physician before the effective date of the coverage
              for the insured, but symptomatology was evident
              regardless of consultation, advice or treatment by
              a legally qualified physician, the disease or
              condition will not be considered pre-existing if
              there were interrogatories appropriate to such
              symptoms on the application for insurance and if
              the symptoms were disclosed on the application for
              insurance and the insurer did not make an
              investigation and take appropriate action.

          3)  If there was no application or the interrogatories
              on any application were not appropriate to such
              symptoms, a legally qualified physician must decide
              if the symptomatology was sufficient prior to the
              effective date of the policy to make a diagnosis
              and demonstrate manifestation of the disease,
              illness, sickness, malady or condition.

          4)  In the administration of the Rule if the Medical
              Director, similar employee or other physician
              retained by the insurer who qualifies as a legally
              qualified physician decides the medical questions
              of Sections 2005.30(a)(2) or 2005.30(a)(3) then
              said physician shall notify either the insured or
              his attending physician or other legally qualified
              physician of the insured of all of the relevant
              facts supporting the decision.  If the attending
              physician or other legally qualified physician of
              the insured offers facts which demonstrate there is
              good reason that the disease, illness, sickness,
              malady or condition did not exist prior to the
              effective date of coverage for the insured, the
              definition of a pre-existing illness must be
              construed favorably for the insured.

     c)  A legally qualified physician is a physician as defined
         and licensed under the Medical Practices Act (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1981, ch. 111, par. 4401 et seq.).

     d)  The insurer may rescind a policy only if it can
         demonstrate the insured has withheld material
         information or answered material questions incorrectly
         on an application which would have resulted in the
         insurer, at the time of original application:

          1)  denying coverage, or

          2)  restricting the level or coverage as applied for,
              or

          3)  rating up the premium normally charged for the
              coverage as applied for.

     e)  No answers to questions in an application for insurance
         such as "Are you in good health?" or "Are you free from
         disease or impairment?" shall be used alone to rescind
         the policy unless the false answers to such questions,
         along with the other evidence, clearly demonstrates
         justification for recision of the policy.

     f)  After the coverage for the insured has been in effect
         for two years, the coverage may not be rescinded except
         for fraud.  To establish fraud, the insurer must meet
         the requirements of Illinois law in this regard.

 
Section 2005.50  Policy Form Requirements
 
All policies which exclude the payment of a claim due to a
"Pre-existing Illness" or "Pre-existing Condition" as constructed
by terms used in the definition of illness or insuring clause of
a policy such as "manifests", "beings", "commences", etc., shall
contain a definition of these terms within any policy or contain
a provision defining the terms "Pre-existing Illness" or
"Pre-existing Conditions" within any policy approved by the
Department of Insurance on or after the effective date of this
Rule.

 
Section 2005.60  Effective Date
 
     a)  This Part shall be effective October 30, 1974.

     b)  For all policies which were approved by the Director of
         Insurance before the effective date of this Part shall,
         for all such policies issued or delivered in this State
         after the effective date of this Part, administer the
         term "pre-existing illness" or other such terms in
         accordance with the requirements of this Part.

    b)   All forms and contracts required to be revised and resubmitted by

Section 2007.50  Definitions

Except as provided hereafter, no individual accident or health insurance policy
delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
definitions respecting the matters set forth below unless such definitions
comply with the requirements of this Section.

    Accident and Accidental Injury shall be defined to employ "result"
    language and shall not include words which establish an accidental means
    test or use words such as "external," "violent," "visible" or similar
    words of description or characterization.  The definition shall not be
    more restrictive than the following: "Injury or injuries, for which
    benefits are provided, means accidental bodily injuries sustained by the
    insured person which are the direct cause of loss, independent of disease
    cause of loss, independent of disease or bodily infirmity and occurring
    while the insurance is in force."

              (AGENCY NOTE: The fact that the injury combined with other
              factors to produce the loss does not necessarily relieve the
              insurer of liability.  Each claim must be judged on the basis
              of its particular facts and in light of the court decisions,
              to determine whether the injury is to be considered as the
              cause of the loss.)

         Such definition may provide that injuries shall not include
         injuries for which benefits are provided under any workers'
         compensation, employer's liability or similar law, motor vehicle

         Nursing Facility shall be defined in relation to its status,
         facilities and available services.

         A definition of such home or facility shall not be more restrictive
         than one requiring that it:

         be operated pursuant to law;

         be approved for payment of Medicare benefits or be qualified to
         receive such approval, if so requested;

         a home or facility for the aged or for the care of drug addicts or
         alcoholics; or

         a home or facility primarily used for the care and treatment of
         mental diseases or disorders, or custodial or educational care.

         It maintains clinical records on all patients; and

         It has a full time administrator.

    Home Health Care shall not be defined more restrictively than skilled
    nursing care or services provided to a person at a residence according to
    a plan of treatment for illness or infirmity prescribed by a physician. 
    Such services shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

         Part time and intermittent skilled nursing services - Services
         given to a patient at least once every 60 days or as frequently as

         laboratory services to the extent such charges or costs would have
         been covered under the policy if the insured person had remained in
         the hospital.

    Hospital may be defined i@-1 relation to its status, facilities and
    available .services or to reflect its accreditation by the Join-:
    Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.

         The definition of the term "hospital" shall not be more restrictive
         than one requiring that the hospital:

              be an institution operated pursuant to the law; and

              be primarily and continuously engaged in providing or
              operating medical and diagnostic facilities, with major
              surgical facilities either on its premises or in facilities
              available to the hospital on a prearranged basis, under the
              supervision of a staff of duly licensed physicians, for the
              medical care and treatment of sick. or injured persons on an
              in-patient basis for which a charge is made; and

              provide 24 hours nursing service by or under the supervision
              of registered graduate professional nurses (R.N.'s).

         The definition of the term "hospital" may state that such term
         shall not be inclusive of:

              convalescent, rest, or nursing homes or facilities;

              facilities for the aged, mentally ill, drug addicts or

              treatment of drug addicts or alcoholics or the mentally ill);
              or

              any military or veterans hospital or soldiers home or any
              hospital contracted for or operated by any national
              government or agency thereof for the treatment of members or
              ex-members of the armed forces, except for services rendered
              on an emergency basis where a legal liability exists for
              charges made to the individual for such services.

    Medicare shall be defined in any hospital, surgical or medical expense
    policy which relates its coverage to eligibility for Medicare or Medicare
    benefits.  Medicare may be substantially defined as "The Health Insurance
    for the Aged Act, Subchapter XVIII of the Social Security Amendments of
    1965 as then constituted or later amended (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.)," or
    "Title I, Part I of Public Laws 89-97, as Enacted by the Eighty ninth
    Congress of the United States of America and popularly known as the
    Health Insurance for the Aged Act (42 U.S.C. 395 et seq.), as then
    constituted and any later amendments or substitutes thereof" or words of
    similar import.

    Mental or Nervous Disorders shall not be defined more restrictively than
    a definition including neurosis, psychoneurosis, psychopathy, psychosis,
    or mental or emotional disease or disorder of any kind.

    Nurses may be defined so that the description of nurse is restricted to a
    type of nurse, such as registered graduate professional nurse (R.N.), a
    licensed practical nurse (L.P.N.), or a licensed vocational nurse
    (L.V.N.). If the words "nurse," "trained nurse" or "registered nurse" are
    used without specific instruction, then the use of such terms requires
    the insurer to recognize the services of any individual who qualifies
    under such terminology in accordance with the applicable statutes or
    administrative rules of the licensing or registry board of the state.

    One period of confinement or continuous hospital confinement means
    consecutive days of in-hospital service received as an in-patient, or
    successive confinements when discharge from and readmission to the
    hospital occurs within a period of time not more than 90 days or three
    times the maximum number of days of in-hospital coverage provided by the
    policy to a maximum of 180 days, whichever is greater.

    Partial Disability shall be defined in relation of the individual's
    inability to perform one or more, but not all, of the "major,"
    "important," or "essential,, duties of employment or occupation or may be
    related to a percentage of time worked, to a specified number of hours or
    to compensation.  Where a policy provides total disability benefits and
    partial disability benefits, only one elimination period may be required.

    Physician may be defined by including words such as "duly qualified
    physician" or "duly licensed physician." The use of such terms requires
    an insurer to recognize and to accept, to the extent of its obligation
    under the contract, all providers of medical care and treatment when such
    services are within the scope of the provider's licensed authority and
    are provided pursuant to applicable laws dealing with physician
    licensure.

    Residual Disability shall be defined in relation to the individual's
    reduction in earnings and may be related either to the inability to
    perform some part of the "major," "important," or essential duties of
    employment or occupation, or to the inability to perform all usual
    business for as long as is usually required.  A policy which provides for
    residual disability benefits may require a qualification period, during
    which the insured must be continuously totally disabled before residual
    disability benefits are payable.  The qualification period for residual
    benefits may be longer than the elimination period for total disability. 
    In lieu of the term "residual disability," the insurer may use
    "proportionate disability" or other term of similar import which in the
    opinion of the Director adequately and fairly describes the benefit.

    Sickness shall not be defined to be more restrictive than the following:
    "Sickness means sickness or disease of an insured person which first
    manifests itself after the effective date of insurance and while the
    insurance is in force." A definition of sickness may provide for a
    probationary period which will not exceed thirty (30) days from the
    effective date of the coverage of the insured person.  The definition may
    be further modified to exclude sickness or disease for which benefits are
    provided under any workers' compensation, occupational disease,
    employer's liability or similar law.

    Total Disability

         A general definition of total disability cannot be more restrictive
         than one requiring the individual to be totally disabled from
         engaging in any such employment or occupation which he could,
         giving due consideration of his education, training or experience
         be reasonably expected to engage in and is not in fact engaged in
         any employment or occupation for wage or profit.

         Total disability may be defined in relation to the inability of the
         person to perform duties but may not be based solely upon an
         individual's inability to:

         Perform "any occupation whatsoever," "any occupational duty," or
         "any and every duty of his occupation,"

 
         Engage in any training or rehabilitation program.

    An insurer may specify the requirement of the complete inability of the
    person to perform all of the substantial and material duties of his
    regular occupation or words of similar import.  An insurer may require
    care by a physician other than the insured or a member of the insured's
    immediate family.

    When through a specific provision of a policy, disability coverage is
    provided to a retired person, such definition shall not require more than
    the insured be completely unable to engage in the normal activities of a
    retired person of like age and good health.

         policy shall contain provisions establishing a probationary or
         waiting period during which no coverage is provided under the
         policy subject to the further exception that a policy may specify a
         probationary or waiting period not to exceed six (6) months for
         specified diseases or conditions and losses resulting therefrom for
         hernia, varicose veins, adenoids, appendix and tonsils.  However,
         the permissible six (6) months exception shall not be applicable
         where such specified diseases or conditions are treated on an
         emergency basis.  Accident policies shall not contain a
         probationary or waiting period.

    b)   No policy or rider for additional coverage may be issued as a
         dividend unless an equivalent cash payment is offered to the
         policyholder as an alternative to such dividend policy or rider. 
         No such dividend policy, or rider shall be issued for an initial
         term of less than six (6) months.

    c)   A disability policy, hospital confinement indemnity policy or
         specified disease policy may contain a "return of premium" or "cash

         1)   The policy provides for a return of 100% of all premiums paid
              less the claims incurred by the time the insured attains age
              65.  A percentage of less than 100%, but greater than 50%, is
              permissible if the "return of premium" or "cash value
              benefit" has been in force for 10 years or less;

         2)   The policy contains a reasonable nonforfeiture benefit and
              provides for the value to be paid automatically upon lapse or
              death;

         3)   The surrender value percentages are not less than those
              calculated assuming 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary
              Mortality, 5% interest and 5 year preliminary term;

         4)   An acceptable method of reserving is approved by the Director
              concurrent with approval of the policy. Reserves should
              exceed or equal the cash value at all durations;

         5)   The surrender value percentages are calculated assuming a
              zero percent future claim offset;

         6)   The surrender value percentages are defined for all policy
         years (surrender value percentages may be shown only for the first
         twenty policy years, but under these conditions the contract shall
         define the method used to determine the surrender value percentages
         after the twentieth contract year);

         7)   The interim surrender value percentages are defined when
         premiums are paid within a contract year;

         8)   The policy does not tie the return of premium to anything
         less than 100% of the premiums paid less claims paid.

    d)   Accident and Health policies shall not contain provisions excluding
         coverage for:

         1)   Confinement in a hospital operated by a Federal, State or
              Local Government;

         2)   Charges for medical services provided by a Federal, State or
              Local Government;

         where a liability exists for charges made to or on behalf of the
         insured or covered dependents.

    e)   No policy shall limit or exclude coverage by the type of illness,
         accident, treatment or medical condition, except as follows:

         1)   Preexisting conditions or diseases;

         2)   Mental or emotional disorders, alcoholism, intoxication and
              drug addiction (policies which exclude benefits for
              alcoholism or intoxication shall provide the following
              definition: "That which is defined and determined by the laws
              of the state where the loss or cause of the loss was
              incurred");

         3)   Pregnancy, except for complications of pregnancy;

         4)   Rehabilitative care, except that where benefits, in whole or
              in part, would be payable for such care under the terms of
              coverage, those benefits shall not be denied on the basis
              that such care or treatment was provided, in whole or in
              part, in a rehabilitation institution, if such institution
              was a fully accredited hospital as defined in Section 2007.50
              of this Part at the time care or treatment was provided;

         5)   Injury, illness, treatment or medical condition arising out

              D)   with respect to short-term nonrenewable policies,
                   interscholastic sports;

         6)   Cosmetic surgery, except that "cosmetic surgery" shall not
              include reconstructive surgery when such service is
              incidental to or follows surgery resulting from trauma,
              infection or other diseases of the involved part;

         8)   Benefits provided under Medicare, any state or federal
              worker's compensation, employer's liability or occupational
              disease law, or any motor vehicle no-fault law; services
              rendered by employees of hospitals, laboratories or other

    f)   No provision of this Part shall prohibit the use of any policy
         provision which is required or permitted by statute.  Other

         waivers to exclude, limit or reduce coverage or benefits for
         specifically named or described preexisting diseases, physical
         condition or extra hazardous activity.  Where waivers are required
         as a condition of issuance, renewal or reinstatement, signed
         acceptance by the insured is required unless on initial issuance
         the full text of the waiver is contained either on the first page
         or specification page of the policy, or unless notice of the waiver
         appears on the first page or specification page.

    g)   No policy, rider or endorsement providing benefits for loss due to
         an accident or accidental injury shall contain a provision or
         clause limiting, reducing or excluding liability for a loss
         resulting from purely accidental circumstances (e.g., involuntary
         or unintentional ingestion of poison or inhalation of poisonous
         gases or fumes).  This restriction shall not preclude the exclusion
         of loss due to suicide or attempted suicide by properly drawn
         language nor shall it preclude approval of a benefit for loss from
         defined accidents, such as travel, sport and student accident
         insurance.

    h)   No policy, rider or endorsement shall limit or exclude coverage for
         illness, accident, treatment or medical condition by using a
         general exclusion for complications arising from a covered
         condition or the treatment of a covered condition.  This
         restriction shall not preclude the exclusion of loss due to such
         complications which are specifically named.

    i)   Policy provisions precluded in this Section shall not be construed
         as a limitation on the authority of the Director to disapprove
         other policy provisions in accordance with Section 143(l) of the
         Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/143(l)), which, in the opinion
         of the Director, are unjust, unfair or unfairly discriminatory to
         the policyholder, beneficiary, or any person insured under the
         policy.

     1995)


Section 2007.70 Accident and Health Minimum Standards for Benefits

    a)   The following minimum standards for benefits are prescribed for the
         categories of coverage noted in the following subsection.  No
         individual policy of accident and health insurance shall be
         delivered or issued for delivery in this State which does not meet
         the required minimum standards for the specified categories unless
         the Director finds that such policies are Limited Benefit Health
         Insurance in which case the Outline of Coverage shall comply with
         Section 2007.80(c) of this Part.

    b)   Nothing in this Section shall preclude the issuance of any policy
         combining two or more categories of coverage as set forth in
         Section 355a(4) of the Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS
         5/355(a)(4)].

         1)    General Rules

              A)   A "noncancellable," "guaranteed renewable," or
                   noncancellable and guaranteed renewable" policy shall
                   not provide for termination of coverage of the spouse
                   solely because of the occurrence of an event specified
                   for termination of coverage of the insured, other than
                   nonpayment of premium.  The policy shall provide that
                   in the event of the insured's death the spouse of the

                   benefits beyond the period the policy was in force may
                   be predicated upon the continuous total disability of

                   person by this policy and any attached riders will be

                   policy and rider provisions, exclusions, exceptions and

                        a pathological diagnosis is medically
                        inappropriate, a clinical diagnosis will be
                        accepted in lieu thereof.

                        provision of this regulation, any restriction or
                        limitation applied to the benefits in the above
                        requirements, whether by definition or otherwise,

                   policy which provides coverage for a specifically

              "Limited Benefit Heal,:h Insurance Coverage" is any policy or
              policies other than a policy or contract covering only a

              less than the minimum standards for benefits required under
              Section 2007.50(b)(2) through (7) of this Part.  Such
              policies or contracts may be delivered or issued for delivery
              in this state only if the outline of coverage required by
              Section 2007.80(k) of this Part is completed and delivered as
              required by Section 2007.80(b) of this Part.

         10)  Non-Conventional Coverage

              Nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall prohibit the
              issuance of a policy that does not fall within subparagraphs
              2007.70(b)(1) through (9) above if such policy is
              experimental in nature and is appropriately and prominently
              described in the outline of coverage required by Section
              2007.80(l) of this Part.

         11)   The requirements of this Section do not apply to policies

Section 2007.80  Required Disclosure Provisions

    a)    General Rules

         1)   Each individual policy of accident and health insurance shall
              include a renewal, continuation, or nonrenewal provision. 
              The language or specifications of such provision must be
              consistent with the type of policy to be issued.  Such
              provision shall be appropriately captioned, shall appear on
              the first page of the policy, and shall clearly state the
              duration, where limited, of renewability and the duration of
              the term of coverage for which the policy is issued and for
              which it may be renewed.

         2)   Except for riders or endorsements by which the insurer
              effectuates a request made in writing by the policyholder or
              exercises a specifically reserved right under the policy, all
              riders or endorsements added to a policy after date of issue
              or at reinstatement or renewal which reduce or eliminate
              benefits or coverage in the policy shall require signed
              acceptance by the policyholder.  After date of policy issue,
              any rider or endorsement which increases benefits or coverage
              with a concomitant increase in premium during the policy term
              must be agreed to by the insured, except if the increased
              benefits or coverage are required by law.

         3)   Where a separate additional premium is charged for benefits
              provided in connection with riders or endorsements, such
              premium charge shall be set forth in the policy.

         4)   A policy which provides for the payment of benefits based on
              standards described as "usual and customary," "reasonable and
              customary," or words of similar import shall include a
              definition of such terms and an explanation of such terms in
              its accompanying outline of coverage.

         5)   If a policy contains any limitations with respect to
              preexisting conditions, such limitations must appear as a
              separate paragraph of the policy and be labeled as
              "Preexisting Condition Limitations.,'

         6)   All accident only policies shall contain a prominent
              statement on the first page of the policy or attached thereto
              in either contrasting color or in boldface type at least
              equal-to the size of type used for policy captions, a
              prominent statement as follows:

              "This is an accident only policy and it does not pay benefits
              for loss from sickness."

         7)   All policies, except single premium nonrenewal policies,
              shall have a notice prominently printed on the first page of
              the policy or attached thereto stating in substance, that the
              policyholder shall have the right to return the policy within
              ten (10) days of its delivery and to have the premium re-
              funded if after examination of the policy the policyholder is
              not satisfied for any reason.

         8)   If age is to be used as a determining factor for reducing the
              maximum aggregate benefits made available in the policy as
              originally issued, such fact must be prominently set forth in
              the outline of coverage.

         9)   If a policy contains a conversion privilege, it shall comply,
              in substance, with the following: the caption of the
              provision shall be "Conversion Privilege," or words of
              similar import.  The provision shall indicate the persons
              eligible for conversion, the circumstances applicable to the
              conversion privilege, including any limitations on the
              conversion, and the person by whom the conversion privilege
              may be exercised.  The provision shall specify the benefits
              to be provided on conversion or may state that the converted
              coverage will be as provided on a policy form then being used

Section 2007.90  Requirements for Replacement

    a)   Application forms shall include a question designed to elicit
         information as to whether the insurance to be issued is intended to
         replace any other accident and health insurance presently in force. 
         A supplementary application or other form to be signed by the
         applicant containing such a question may be used.

    b)   upon determining that a sale will involve replacement, an insurer,
         other than a direct response insurer, or its agent shall furnish
         the applicant, prior to issuance or delivery of the policy, the
         notice described in subsection (d) below.  One (1) copy of such
         notice shall be retained by the applicant and an additional copy
         signed by the applicant shall be retained by the insurer.  A direct
         response insurer shall deliver to the applicant upon issuance of
         the policy, the notice described in subsection (e) below.

    c)   In no event, however, will such a notice be required in the
         solicitation of the following types of policies: accident only and
         single premium nonrenewable policies.

    d)   The notice required by subsection (b) above for an insurer, other
         than a direct response insurer, shall provide, in substantially the
         following form:

            NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT
                OF ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE

         According to (your application) (information you have furnished),
         you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing accident and
         health insurance and replace it with a policy to be issued by
         (Company Name) Insurance Company.  For your own information and
         protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain
         factors which may affect the insurance protection available to you
         under the new policy.

         1)   Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting
              conditions) may not be immediately or fully covered under the
              new policy.  This could result in denial or delay of a claim
              for benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim
              might have been payable under your present policy.

         2)   You may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or
              its agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present
              policy. -This is not only your right, but it is also in your
              best interests to make sure you understand all the relevant
              factors involved in replacing your present coverage.

         3)   If, after due consideration, you still wish to terminate your
              present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain
              to truthfully and completely answer all questions on the
              application concerning your medical/health history.  Failure
              to include all material medical information on an application
              may provide a basis for the Company to deny any future claims
              and to refund your premium as though your policy had never
              been in force.  After the application has been completed and
              before you sign it, re-read it carefully to be certain that
              all information t,.as been properly recorded.

         The above "Notice to Applicant" was delivered to me on:

                                          Applicant's Signature
    e)   The notice required by subsection (b) above for a direct response
         insurer shall be as follows:

         According to (your application) (information you have furnished)
         you intend to .:-apse or otherwise terminate existing accident and
         health insurance and replace it with the policy delivered herewith
         issued by (Company Name) Insurance Company.  Your new policy
         provides 10 days within which you may decide without cost whether
         you desire to keep the policy.  For your own information and
         protection you should be aware of and seriously consider certain
         factors which may affect the insurance protection available to you
         under the new policy.

         1)   Health conditions which you may presently have, (preexisting
              conditions) may not be immediately or fully covered under the
              new policy.  This could result in denial or delay of a claim
              for benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim
              might have been payable under your present policy.

         2)   You may wish to secure the advice-of your present insurer or
              its agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present
              policy.  This is not only your right, but it is also in your
              best interests to make sure you understand all the relevant
              factors involved in replacing your present coverage.

         3)   (To be included only if the application is attached to the
              policy.) If, after due consideration, you still wish to
              terminate your present policy and replace it with new
              coverage, read the copy of the application attached to your
              new policy and be sure that all questions are answered fully
              and correctly. omissions or misstatements in the application
              could cause an otherwise valid claim to be denied.  Carefully
              check the application and write to (Company Name and Address)
              within 10 days if any information is not correct and
              complete, or if any past medical history has been left out of
              the application.

         The following standards apply to Medicare supplement policies and
         certificates and are in addition to all other requirements of this
         Part.

         1)   A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not exclude
              or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six (6) months
              from the effective date of coverage because the losses involved

              define a preexisting condition more restrictively than as a
              condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was
              recommended by or received from a physician within six (6)
              months before the effective date of coverage.

         2)   A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not indemnify
              against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis
              than losses resulting from accidents.

         3)   A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that
              benefits designed to cover cost sharing amounts under Medicare

              the applicable Medicare deductible amount and copayment per-
              centage factors.  Premiums may be modified to correspond with
              such changes.

         4)   A "noncancellable," "guaranteed renewable," or noncancellable
              and guaranteed renewable" Medicare supplement policy shall not:

              A)   Provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely
                   because of the occurrence of an event specified for
                   termination of coverage of the insured, other than the
                   nonpayment of premium, or

              B)   Be canceled or nonrenewed by the issuer solely on the
                   grounds of deterioration of  health.

         5)    An insurer shall:

              A)   Except as authorized by the Director of Insurance for
                   this State, an issuer shall neither cancel nor nonrenew
                   a Medicare supplement policy or certificate for any
                   reason other than nonpayment of premium or material
                   misrepresentation.

              B)   If a group Medicare supplement insurance policy is
                   terminated by the group policyholder and not replaced
                   as provided in subsection (5)(D) below, the issuer
                   shall offer certificateholders an individual Medicare
                   supplement policy.  The issuer shall offer the certifi-
                   cateholder at least the following choices:

                   i)   an individual Medicare supplement policy currently
                        offered by the issuer having comparable benefits to
                        those contained in the terminated group Medicare
                        supplement policy; and

                   ii)  an individual Medicare supplement policy which
                        provides only such benefits as are required to meet
                        the minimum standards as defined in Section
                        2008.71(b) of this Part.

              C)   If a membership in a group is terminated, the issuer
                   shall:

                   i)   offer the certificateholder such conversion
                        opportunities as are described in subsection
                        (a)(5)(B) above; or

                   ii)  at the option of the group policyholder, offer
                        the certificateholder continuation of coverage
                        under the group policy.

              D)   If a group Medicare supplement policy is replaced by
                   another group Medicare supplement policy purchased by
                   the same policyholder, the issuer of the replacement
                   policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered
                   under the old group policy on its date of termination. 
                   Coverage under the new group policy shall not result in
                   any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would
                   have been covered under the group policy being
                   replaced.

         6)   Termination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate
              shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss which
              commenced while the policy was in force, but the extension of
              benefits beyond the period during which the policy was in
              force may be predicated upon the continuous total disability
              of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit
              period, if any, or to payment of the maximum benefits.

    b)   Minimum Benefit Standards.

         1)   Coverage of Part A Medicare eligible expenses for
              hospitalization to the extent not covered by Medicare from
              the 61st day through the 90th day in any Medicare benefit
              period;

         2)   Coverage for either all or none of the Medicare Part A
              inpatient hospital deductible amount;

              hospitalization not covered by Medicare subject to a lifetime
              maximum benefit of an additional 365 days;

         5)   Coverage under Medicare Part A for the reasonable cost of the
              first three (3) pints of blood (or equivalent quantities of
              packed red blood cells, as defined under federal regulations)
              unless replaced in accordance with federal regulations or

              or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six (6)
              months from the effective date of coverage because the losses
              involved a preexisting condition.  The policy or certificate
              may not define a preexisting condition more restrictively
              than as a condition for which medical advice was given or
              treatment was recommended by or received from a physician
              within six (6) months before the effective date of coverage.

         2)   A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not
              indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a
              different basis than losses resulting from accidents.

         3)   A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide
              that benefits designed to cover cost sharing amounts under
              Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any

              copayment percentage factors.  Premiums may be modified to
              correspond with such changes.

         4)   No Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide
              for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the
              occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage
              of the insured, other than the nonpayment of premium.

         5)   Each Medicare supplement policy shall be guaranteed renewable
              and:

              A)   The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy
                   'solely on the ground of health status of the
                   individual;

              B)   The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy for
                   any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material
                   misrepresentation;

              C)   If the Medicare supplement policy is terminated by the
                   group policyholder and is not replaced as provided
                   under Section 2008.71(a)(5)(E), the issuer shall offer
                   certificateholders an individual Medicare supplement
                   policy which (at the option of the certificateholder):

                   i)   Provides for continuation of the benefits
                        contained in the group policy, or

                   ii)  Provides for such benefits as otherwise meet the
                        requirements of this subsection;

              D)   If an individual is a certificateholder in a group
                   Medicare supplement policy and the individual
                   terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall:

                   i)   Offer the certificateholder the conversion
                        opportunity described in Section
                        2008.71(a)(5)(C), or

                   ii)  At the option of the group policyholder, offer
                        the certificateholder continuation of coverage
                        under the group policy; and

              E)   If a group Medicare supplement policy is replaced by
                   another group Medicare supplement policy purchased by
                   the same policyholder, the issuer of the replacement
                   policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered
                   under the old policy on its date of termination. 
                   Coverage under the new policy shall not result in any
                   exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have
                   been covered under the group policy being replaced.

         6)   Termination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate
              shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss which
              commenced while the policy was in force, but the extension of
              benefits beyond the period during which the policy was in
              force may be conditioned upon the continuous total disability
              of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit
              period, if any, or payment of the maximum benefits.

         7)   A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide:

              A)   That benefits and premiums under the policy or
                   certificate shall be suspended at the request of the
                   policyholder or certificateholder for the period (not
                   to exceed twenty-four (24) months) in which the
                   policyholder or certificateholder has applied for and
                   is determined to be entitled to medical assistance
                   under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, but only if
                   the policyholder or certificateholder notifies the

              refunds or credits) provided under the policy form or

              which are issued prior to November 5, 1991, the issuer shall
              make the refund or credit calculation separately for all
              individual policies (including all group policies subject to
              an individual loss ratio standard when issued) combined and
              all other group policies combined for experience after April
              28, 1996.  The first such report shall be due by May 31,
              1998.

         4)   A refund or credit shall be made only when the benchmark loss
              ratio exceeds the adjusted experience loss ratio and the
              amount to be refunded or credited exceeds a de minimis level. 
              Such refund shall include interest from the end of the
              calendar year to the date of the refund or credit at a rate
              specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, but
              in no event shall it be less than the average rate of
              interest for 13-week Treasury notes.  A refund or credit
              against premiums due shall be made by September 30 following
              the experience year upon which the refund or credit is based.

    c)   Annual Filing of Premium Rates

         An issuer of Medicare supplement policies and certificates issued
         in this State before or after the effective date of this Part shall
         file annually its rates, rating schedule and supporting
         documentation including ratios of incurred losses to earned
         premiums by policy duration for approval by the Director in
         accordance with the filing requirements and procedures prescribed
         by the Director.  The supporting documentation shall also
         demonstrate, in accordance with actuarial standards of practice
         using reasonable assumptions, that the appropriate loss ratio
         standards can be expected to be met over the entire period for
         which rates are computed.  Such demonstration shall exclude active
         life reserves.  An expected third-year loss ratio which is greater
         than or equal to the applicable percentage shall be demonstrated
         for Policies or certificates in force less than three (3) years.

    d)   As soon as Practicable, but prior to the effective date of
         enhancements in Medicare benefits every issuer of Medicare
         supplement Policies or certificates in this State shall file with
         the Department:

         1)   Appropriate premium adjustments necessary to produce loss
              ratios as anticipated for the current premium for the
              applicable Policies or certificates.  Such supporting
              documents as are necessary to justify the adjustment shall
              accompany the filing.

         2)   An issuer shall make such premium adjustments as are
              necessary to produce an expected loss ratio under such policy
              or certificate as will conform with minimum loss ratio
              standards for Medicare supplement policies and which are
              expected to result in a loss ratio at least as great as that
              originally 'anticipated in the rates used to produce current
              premiums by the issuer for such Medicare supplement policies
              or certificates.  No premium adjustment which would modify
              the loss ratio experience under the policy other than the
              adjustments described herein shall be made with respect to a
              policy at any time other than upon its renewal date or
              anniversary date.

         3)   If an issuer fails to make premium adjustments acceptable to
              the Director, the Director may order premium adjustments,
              refunds or premium credits deemed necessary to achieve the
              loss ratio required by this section.

         4)   Any appropriate riders, endorsements or policy forms needed
              to accomplish the Medicare supplement policy or certificate
              modifications necessary to eliminate benefit duplications
              with Medicare.  Such riders, endorsements or policy forms
              shall provide a clear description of the Medicare supplement
              benefits provided by the policy or certificate.

    e)   Public Hearings

         The Director may conduct a public hearing to gather information
         concerning a request by an issuer for an increase in a rate for a
         policy form or certificate form issued before or after the
         effective date of this Part if the experience of the form for the
         previous reporting period is not in compliance with the applicable
         loss ratio standard.  The determination of compliance is made
         without consideration of any refund or credit for such reporting
         period.

    c)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(1) below, an issuer shall not

              four additional policy forms or certificate forms of the same
              type for the same standard Medicare supplement benefit plan,
              one for each of the following cases:

              A)   The inclusion of new or innovative benefits;

              B)   The addition of either direct response ro producer
                   marketing methods;

         2)   For the purposes of this Section, a "type" means an
              individual policy, a group policy, an individual Medicare
              Select policy, or a group Medicare Select policy.

    d)   Except as provided in subsection (d)(1) below, an issuer shall
         continue to make available for purchase any policy form or
         certificate form issued after the effective date of this Part that
         has been approved by the Director.  A policy form or certificate
         form shall not be considered to be available for purchase unless
         the issuer has actively offered it for sale in the previous twelve
         months.

         1)   An issuer may discontinue the availability of a policy form
              or certificate form if the issuer provides to the Director in
              writing its decision at least 30 days prior to discontinuing
              the availability of the form of the policy or certificate. 
              After receipt of the notice by the Director, the issuer shall
              no longer offer for sale the policy form or certificate form
              in this State.

         2)   An issuer that discontinues the availability of a policy form
              or certificate form pursuant to subsection (d)(1) above shall
              not file for approval a new policy form or certificate form
              of the same type for the same standard Medicare supplement
              benefit plan as the discontinued form for a period of five
              years after the issuer provides notice to the Director of the
              discontinuance.  The period of discontinuance may be reduced
              if the Director determines that a shorter period is
              appropriate.

         3)   The sale or other transfer of Medicare supplement business to
              another issuer shall be considered a discontinuance for the
              purposes of subsection (d).

         4)   A change in the rating structure or methodology shall be
              considered a discontinuance under subsections (d)(1) and (2)

              requirements:

              A)   The issuer provides an actuarial memorandum, in a form
                   and manner prescribed by the Director, describing the
                   manner in which the revised rating methodology and
                   resultant rates differ from the existing rating
                   methodology and existing rates.

              B)   The issuer does not subsequently put into effect a
                   change of rates or rating factors that would cause the
                   percentage differential between the discontinued and
                   subsequent rates as described in the actuarial
                   memorandum to change.  The Director may approve a
                   change to the differential which is in the public
                   interest.


    e)   Except as provided herein, the experience of all policy forms or
         certificate forms of the same type in a standard Medicare
         supplement benefit plan shall be combined for purposes of the
         refund or credit calculation prescribed in Section 2008.80 of this
         Part.  Forms assumed under an assumption reinsurance agreement
         shall not be combined with the experience of other forms for

    a)    General Rules

         1)   Medicare supplement policies and certificates shall include a
              renewal or continuation provision.  The language or
              specifications Of such provision must be consistent with the
              type of contract issued.  Such provision shall be
              appropriately captioned and shall appear on the first page of
              the policy and shall include any reservation by the issuer of
              the right to change premiums and any automatic renewal
              premium increases based on the policyholder's age.

         2)   Except for riders or endorsements by which the issuer
              effectuates a request made in writing by the insured or
              exercises a specifically reserved right under a Medicare
              supplement policy, or is required to reduce or eliminate
              benefits to avoid duplication of Medicare benefits, all
              riders or endorsements added to a Medicare supplement policy
              after date of issue or at reinstatement or renewal which
              reduce or eliminate benefits or coverage in the policy shall
              require signed acceptance by the insured.  After the date of
              policy or certificate issue, any rider or endorsement which
              increases benefits or coverage with an accompanying increase
              in premium during the policy term shall be agreed to in
              writing and signed by the insured, unless the benefits are
              required by the minimum standards for Medicare supplement
              policies, except if the increased benefits or coverage is
              required by law.  Where a separate additional premium is
              charged for benefits provided in connection with riders or
              endorsements, such premium charge shall be set forth in the
              policy.

         3)   Medicare supplement policies or certificates shall not
              provide for the payment of benefits based on standards
              described as "usual and customary," '.reasonable and
              customary," or words of similar import.

         4)   If a Medicare supplement policy or certificate contains any
              limitations with respect to preexisting conditions, such
              limitations shall appear as a separate paragraph of the
              policy and be labeled as "Preexisting Condition Limitations."

         5)   Medicare supplement policies and certificates shall have a
              notice prominently printed on the first page of the policy or
              certificate or attached thereto stating in substance that the
              policyholder or certificateholder shall have the right to
              return the policy or certificate within thirty (30) days of
              its delivery and to have the premium refunded directly to him
              or her in a timely manner if, after examination of the policy

              reason.

         6)   Issuers of accident and sickness policies or certificates
              which provide hospital or medical expense coverage on an
              expense incurred or indemnity basis to a person(s) eligible
              for Medicare shall provide to those applicants a Guide to
              Health Insurance for People with Medicare approved by the
              Director of Insurance and in type size no smaller than 12
              point type.  Delivery of the Guide shall be made whether or
              not such policies or certificates are advertised, solicited
              or issued as Medicare supplement policies or certificates as
              defined in this Part.  Except in the case of direct response
              issuers, delivery of the Guide shall be made to the applicant

              the Guide shall be obtained by the issuer.  Direct response
              issuers shall deliver the Guide to the applicant upon request
              but not later than at the time the policy is delivered.

    b)   Policy Checklist

         1)   In order to determine what policy is appropriate and
              nonduplicative, a policy checklist must be completed in the
              presence of the applicant at the point of sale.  Copies of
              the checklist, completed and duly signed are to be provided
              to the applicant and the issuer.  This requirement does not
              apply to direct response solicitations.

         2)   The checklist required by subsection (b)(1) above shall
              provide substantially the form prescribed in Appendix A of
              this Part.

         3)   Issuers issuing Medicare supplement policies for delivery in

              provided.

    c)   Notice Requirements

         1)   As soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30)  days
              prior to the annual effective date of Medicare benefit
              changes, an insurer shall notify its policyholders and
              certificateholders of modifications it has made to Medicare
              supplement insurance policies or certificates in the format
              prescribed in Appendix 0 of this Part.  Such notice shall:

              A)   Include a description of revisions to the Medicare
                   program and a description of each modification made to

         3)   Such notices shall not contain or be accompanied by any
              solicitation.

    d)   Outline of Coverage Requirements for Medicare Supplement Policies

         1)   Issuers shall provide an outline of coverage to all
              applicants at the time the application is presented to the

              policies, shall obtain an acknowledgment of receipt of such
              outline from the applicant.

         2)   If an outline of coverage is provided at the time of
              application and the Medicare supplement policy or certificate
              is issued on a basis which would require revision of the
              outline, a substitute outline of coverage properly describing
              the policy or certificate shall accompany such policy or
              certificate when it is delivered and contain the following
              statement, in no less than twelve (12) point type,
              immediately above the company name:

                   not identical to the outline of coverage provided upon
                   application, and the coverage originally applied for
                   has not been issued.

         3)   In addition to the statement required by subsection (d)(2) of
              this Section, each revised outline of coverage accompanying a
              policy or certificate issued on a basis other than that
              originally applied for, shall contain the following notice
              appearing in no less than twelve (12) point type:

                   WARNING: The (policy or certificate) you have received
                   is not the same as the one for which you made
                   application.

         4)   The outline of coverage provided to applicants pursuant to
              this subsection shall consist of four parts: a cover page,
              premium information, disclosure pages, and charts displaying
              the features of each benefit plan offered by the issuer. 
              Please see Appendix B of this Part.  The outline of coverage
              shall be in the language and format prescribed in Appendix B

              shall be shown on the cover page, and the plan(s) that are
              offered by the issuer shall be prominently identified.

              be stated for all plans that are offered to the prospective
              applicant.  All possible premiums for the prospective
              applicant shall be illustrated.

         5)   The outline of coverage shall follow the format in Appendix B
              of this Part.  The term "certificate" should be substituted
              for the word "policy" throughout the outline of coverage
              where appropriate.

    e)   Notice Regarding Policies or Certificates Which are Not Medicare
         Supplement Policies

         1)   Any accident and sickness insurance policy or certificate,
              other than a Medicare supplement policy, a policy issued
              pursuant to a contract under Section 1876 of the Federal
              Social Security Act (42 U.S.C., Section 1395 et seq.),

              State to persons eligible for Medicare, shall notify insureds
              under the policy that the policy is not a Medicare supplement

         the application or together with the application.  The disclosure
         statement may not vary from those found in Appendix Q of this Part
         in terms of language or format (type size, type proportional
         spacing, bold character, line spacing, and usage of boxes around
         text).

    c)   State and Federal law prohibits insurers from selling a Medicare
         supplement policy to a person that already has a Medicare
         supplement policy except as a replacement.

    d)   Property/casualty and Life insurance policies are not considered
         health insurance.

    e)   Disability income policies are not considered to provide benefits
         that duplicate Medicare.

         elicit information as to whether, as of the date of the
         application, the applicant has another Medicare supplement or other
         health insurance policy or certificate in force or whether a
         Medicare supplement policy or certificate is intended to replace
         any other accident and sickness policy or certificate presently in
         force.  A supplementary application or other form to be signed by
         the applicant and insurance producer containing such questions and
         statements may be used.

         1)   You do not need more than one Medicare supplement policy.

         2)   If you purchase this policy, you may want to evaluate your
              existing health coverage and decide if you need multiple
              coverages.

         3)   You may be eligible for benefits under Medicaid and may not
              need a Medicare supplement policy.

              policy can be suspended, if requested, during your
              entitlement to benefits under Medicaid for 24 months.  You
              must request this suspension within 90 days after becoming
              eligible for Medicaid.  If you are no longer entitled to
              Medicaid, your policy will be reinstituted if requested
              within 90 days after losing Medicaid eligibility.

         5)   Counseling services may be available in this State to provide
              advice concerning your purchase of Medicare supplement
              insurance and concerning medical assistance through the State

              all of your medical expenses.,'

         4)   Inquire and otherwise make every reasonable effort to

         will be deemed to make reasonable efforts to determine the

         with the standards set forth in Sections 363a(5) and (6) of the Code.

    b)   Any sale of Medicare supplement coverage that will provide an
         individual more than one Medicare supplement policy or certificate is

Section 2008.APPENDIX M Notice to Applicant Regarding Replacement of Accident and
Sickness Insurance

                   Insurance company's name and address

SAVE THIS NOTICE! IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU IN THE FUTURE

According to (your application) (information you have furnished) you intend to
terminate existing accident and sickness insurance and replace it with a policy to be
issued by (Company Name) Insurance Company.  Your new policy will provide thirty (30)
days within which you may decide without cost whether you desire to keep the policy.

You should review this new coverage carefully.  Compare it with all accident and
sickness coverage you now have.  If, after due consideration, you find that purchase of
this Medicare supplement coverage is a wise decision, you should terminate your present
Medicare supplement coverage.  You should evaluate the need for other accident and
sickness coverage you have that may duplicate this policy.

STATEMENT TO APPLICANT BY INSURANCE PRODUCER:

I have reviewed your current medical or health insurance coverage.  To the best of my
knowledge this Medicare supplement policy will not duplicate your existing Medicare
supplement coverage because you intend to terminate your existing Medicare supplement
coverage.  The replacement policy is being purchased for the following reason(s) (Check
one):

      ______  Additional benefits.
      ______  No change in benefits, but lower premiums.
      ______  Fewer benefits and lower premiums.
      ______  Other. (please specify) _____________________________________
              _____________________________________________________________
              _____________________________________________________________


    1)   Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting conditions) may
         not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy.  This could
         result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new policy,
         whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy.

    2)   Section 363(7)(b) of the Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/363(7)(b)]
         provides that your replacement policy or certificate may not contain new
         preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods or proba-
         tionary periods.  The issuer will waive any time periods applicable to
         preexisting conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, or
         probationary periods in the new policy (or coverage) for similar benefits
         to the extent such time was spent (depleted) under the original policy.

    3)   If you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new
         coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer all questions on
         the application concerning your medical and health history.  Failure to
         include all material medical information on an application may provide a
         basis for the company to deny any future claims and to refund your premium
         as though your policy had never been in force.  After the application has
         been completed and before you sign it, review it carefully to be certain
         that all information has been properly recorded. [If the policy or
         certificate is guaranteed issue, this paragraph need not appear.]

         Do not cancel your present policy until you have received your new policy
         and are sure that you want to keep it.

Section 2008.APPENDIX Q Disclosure Statements

All types of health insurance policies that duplicate Medicare shall include one of the
following disclosure statements according to the particular policy type involved, on
the application or together with the application.  The disclosure statement language
and format may not vary in type size, type proportional spacing, bold character, line
spacing or usage of boxes around text from those presented below.

    a)   For policies that provide benefits for expenses in-
         curred for an accidental injury only:



                 IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PERSONS ON MEDICARE
             THIS INSURANCE DUPLICATES SOME MEDICARE BENEFITS


                This is not Medicare Supplement Insurance

    This insurance provides limited benefits, if you meet the policy conditions, for
    hospital or medical expenses that result from accidental injury.   It does not
    pay your Medicare deductibles or coinsurance and is not a substitute for Medicare
    Supplement insurance.

    This insurance duplicates Medicare benefits when it pays hospital medical
    expenses up to the maximum stated in the policy.

    Medicare generally pays for most or all of these expenses.

    Medicare pays extensive benefits for medically necessary services regardless of
    the reason you need them.  These include:

         -    hospitalization,
         -    physician services,
         -    other approved items and services.


                      Before You Buy This Insurance

         -    Check the coverage in all health insurance policies you already have.

         -    For more information about Medicare and Medicare Supplement
              insurance, review the Guide to Health Insurance for People with
              Medicare, available from the insurance company.

         -    For help in understanding your health insurance, contact your state
              insurance department or state senior insurance counseling program.

    b)   For policies that provide benefits for specified limited services:

<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 2009.10  Purpose and Applicability
 
     a)  The purpose of this regulation is to:

          1)  Permit, but not require, plans to include a
              coordination of benefits (COB) provision;

          2)  Establish an order in which plans pay their claims;

          3)  Provide the authority for the orderly transfer of
              information needed to pay claims promptly;

          4)  Reduce duplication of benefits by permitting a
              reduction of the benefits paid by a plan when the
              plan, pursuant to rules established by this Part,
              does not have to pay its benefits first;

          5)  Reduce claims payment delays; and

          6)  Make all contracts that contain a COB provision
              consistent with this Part.

     b)  This Part shall apply to all group accident and health
         insurance policies or contracts, and group subscriber
         certificates or contracts issued thereunder, which are
         issued, delivered, amended or renewed in this State on
         or after the effective date of this Part.

     c)  Any group policy subject to this Part which was issued
         before the effective date of this Part shall be brought
         into compliance with this Part by the later of:

          1)  The next anniversary date or renewal date of the
              group policy; or

          2)  The expiration of any applicable collectively
              bargained contract pursuant to which it was
              written.

 
Section 2009.20  Definitions
 
The following words and terms, when used in this Part, shall have
the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise:

     a)  Allowable Expenses

          1)  "Allowable Expense" means the necessary,
              reasonable, and customary item of expense for
              health care when the item of expense is covered at
              least in part under any of the plans involved.
              Necessary, reasonable, and customary item of
              expense for health care shall be defined in the
              policy.

          2)  Notwithstanding the above definition, items of
              expense under coverages such as dental care, vision
              care, prescription drug or hearing aid programs may
              be excluded from the definition of Allowable
              Expense.  A plan which provides benefits only for
              any such items of expense may limit its definition
              of Allowable Expenses to like items of expense.

          3)  When a plan provides benefits in the form of
              service, the reasonable cash value as determined by
              the insurer based on the value placed on such
              service in the geographic area of each service will
              be considered as both an Allowable Expense and a
              benefit paid.

          4)  The difference between the cost of a private
              hospital room and the cost of a semi-private
              hospital room is not considered an Allowable
              Expense under the above definition unless the
              patient's stay in a private hospital room is
              medically necessary as determined by the physicians
              of record.

          5)  When COB is restricted in its use to specific
              coverage in a contract (for example, major medical
              or dental), the definition of "Allowable Expense"
              must include the corresponding expenses or services
              to which COB applies.

          6)  When benefits are reduced under a Primary Plan
              because a covered person does not comply with the
              plan provisions, the amount of such reduction shall
              not be considered an Allowable Expense.  Examples
              of such provisions are those related to second
              surgical opinions, precertification of admissions
              or services, and preferred provider arrangements.

               A)  Only benefit reductions based upon provisions
                   similar in purpose to those described above
                   and which are contained in the Primary Plan
                   may be excluded from Allowable Expenses.

               B)  This provision shall not be used by a Second
                   Plan to refuse to pay benefits because an HMO
                   member has elected to have health care
                   services provided by a non-HMO provider and
                   the HMO, pursuant to its contract, is not
                   obligated to pay for providing those services.

     b)  Claim

         A request that benefits of a plan be provided or paid is
         a "claim".  The benefits claimed may be in the form of:

          1)  Services (including supplies);

          2)  Payment for all or a portion of the expenses
              incurred;

          3)  A combination of subsections (1) and (2) above; or

          4)  An indemnification.

     c)  Claim Determination Period

          1)  "Claim Determination Period" means the period of
              time, which must not be less than 12 consecutive
              months, over which Allowable Expenses are compared
              with total benefits payable in the absence of COB,
              to determine whether overinsurance exists and how
              much a plan will pay or provide.

          2)  The Claim Determination Period is usually a
              calendar year, but a plan may use some other period
              of time that fits the coverage of the group
              contract.  A person may be covered by a plan during
              a portion of a Claim Determination Period if that
              person's coverage starts or ends during the Claim
              Determination Period.

          3)  As each claim is submitted, each plan is to
              determine its liability and pay or provide benefits
              based upon Allowable Expenses incurred to that
              point in the Claim Determination Period.  But that
              determination is subject to adjustment as later
              Allowable Expenses are incurred in the same Claim
              Determination Period.

     d)  Coordination of Benefits

         This is a provision establishing an order in which plans
         pay their claims.

     e)  Hospital Indemnity Benefits.
         These are benefits not related to expenses incurred.
         The term does not include reimbursement-type benefits
         even if they are designed or administered to give the
         insured the right to elect indemnity-type benefits at
         the time of claim.

     f)  Plan

          1)  "Plan" means a form of coverage with which
              coordination is allowed.  The definition of plan in
              the group contract must state the types of coverage
              which will be considered in applying the COB
              provision of that contract.  The right to include a
              type of coverage is limited by the rest of this
              definition.

          2)  The definition shown in the Model COB Provision,
              attached to this Part as Exhibit A, is an example
              of what may be used.  Any definition that satisfies
              this subsection may be used.  (The Department will
              determine compliance with this subsection pursuant
              to its authority under Section 143 of the Illinois
              Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par.
              755)).

          3)  This Part uses the term "plan."  However, a group
              contract may, instead, use "program" or some other
              term.

          4)  Plan may include:

               A)  Group insurance and group subscriber
                   contracts;

               B)  Uninsured arrangements of group or group-type
                   coverage;

               C)  Group or group-type coverage through HMOs and
                   other prepayment, group practice and
                   individual practice plans;

               D)  Group-type contracts.  Group-type contracts
                   are contracts which are not available to the
                   general public and can be obtained and
                   maintained only because of membership in or
                   connection with a particular organization or
                   group.  Group-type contracts answering this
                   description may be included in the definition
                   of plan, at the option of the insurer or the
                   service provider and the contract client,
                   whether or not uninsured arrangements are used
                   and regardless of how the group-type coverage
                   is designated.  Individually underwritten and
                   issued guaranteed renewable policies would not
                   be considered "group-type" even though
                   purchased through payroll deduction at a
                   premium savings to the insured since the
                   insured would have the right to maintain or
                   renew the policy independently of continued
                   employment with the employer;

               E)  The amount by which group or group-type
                   hospital indemnity benefits exceed $100 per
                   day; and

               F)  The medical benefits coverage in group
                   automobile contracts, in group or individual
                   automobile "no fault" contracts, and in
                   traditional automobile "fault" type contracts
                   to the extent that such contracts are Primary
                   Plans; and

               G)  Medicare or other governmental benefits,
                   except as provided in subsection (5)(G) below.
                   That part of the definition of plan may be
                   limited to the hospital, medical and surgical
                   benefits of the governmental program.

          5)  Plan shall not include:

               A)  Individual or family insurance contracts;

               B)  Individual or family subscriber contracts;

               C)  Individual or family coverage through Health
                   Maintenance Organizations (HMOs);

               D)  Individual or family coverage under other
                   prepayment, group practice and individual
                   practice plans;

               E)  Group or group-type hospital indemnity
                   benefits of $100.00 per day or less;

               F)  School accident-type coverages.  These
                   contracts cover grammar, high school and
                   college students for accidents only, including
                   athletic injuries, either on a 24-hour basis
                   or on a "to and from school" basis; and

               G)  A state plan under Medicaid, and shall not
                   include a law or plan when, by law, its
                   benefits are in excess of those of any private
                   insurance plan or other non-government plan.

     g)  Primary Plan

         A Primary Plan is a plan whose benefits for a person's
         health care coverage must be determined without taking
         the existence of any other plan into consideration.  A
         plan is a Primary Plan if either of the following
         conditions is true:

          1)  The plan either has no order of benefit
              determination rules, or it has rules which differ
              from those permitted by this subchapter.  There may
              be more than one Primary Plan; or

          2)  All plans which cover the person use the order of
              benefit determination rules required by this
              regulation, and under those rules the plan
              determines its benefits first.

     h)  Secondary Plan

         A Secondary Plan is a plan which is not a Primary Plan.
         If a person is covered by more than one Secondary Plan,
         the order of benefit determination rules of this Part
         decide the order in which their benefits are determined
         in relation to each other.  The benefits of each
         Secondary Plan may take into consideration the benefits
         of the Primary Plan or plans and the benefits of any
         other plan which, under the rules of this regulation,
         has its benefits determined before those of that
         Secondary Plan.

     i)  This Plan

         In a COB provision, this term refers to the part of the
         group contract providing the health care benefits to
         which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced
         because of the benefits of other plans.  Any other part
         of the group contract providing health care benefits is
         separate from "This Plan."  A group contract may apply
         one COB provision to certain of its benefits (such as
         dental benefits), coordinating only with like benefits,
         and may apply other separate COB provisions to
         coordinate other benefits.

         7, 1991) 

 
Section 2009.30  Model COB Contract Provision
 
     a)  Exhibit A contains a model COB provision for use in
         group contracts.  That use is subject to subjections (b)
         and (c) below and the provisions of Section 2009.40 of
         this Part.

     b)  A group contract's COB provision does not have to use
         the words and format shown at Exhibit A.  Changes may be
         made to fit the language and style of the rest of the
         group contract or to reflect the difference among plans
         which provide services; which pay benefits for expenses
         incurred; and which indemnify.  No other substantive
         changes are allowed.  (The Department will determine
         compliance with this subsection pursuant to its
         authority under Section 143 of the Illinois Insurance
         Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par. 755)).

     c)  Prohibited Coordination and Benefit Design

          1)  A group contract may not reduce benefits on the
              basis that:

               A)  Another plan exists;

               B)  A person is or could have been covered under
                   another plan, except with respect to Part B of
                   Medicare; or

               C)  A person has elected an option under another
                   plan providing a lower level of benefits than
                   another option which could have been elected.

          2)  No contract may contain a provision that its
              benefits are "excess" or "always secondary" to any
              plan as defined in this regulation, except in
              accord with the rules permitted by this regulation.

     (Source:  Amended at 15 Ill. Reg. 15061, effective October
         7, 1991) 

 
Section 2009.40  Standards for Coordination of Benefits
 
     a)  General

         The general order of benefits is as follows:

          1)  The Primary Plan must pay or provide its benefits
              as if the Secondary Plan or Plans did not exist.  A
              Plan that does not include a coordination of
              benefits provision may not take the benefits of
              another Plan into account when it determines its
              benefits.  There is one exception:  a contract
              holder's coverage that is designed to supplement a
              part of a basic package of benefits may provide
              that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to
              any other parts of the plan provided by the
              contract holder.

          2)  A Secondary Plan may take the benefits of another
              plan into account only when, under these standards,
              it is Secondary to that other plan.

          3)  The benefits of the plan which covers the person as
              an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other
              than as a dependent) are determined before those of
              the plan which covers the person as a dependent;
              except that:  if the person is also a Medicare
              beneficiary, Medicare is

               A)  Secondary to the plan covering the person as a
                   dependent; and

               B)  Primary to the plan covering the person as
                   other than a dependent, for example a retired
                   employee.

     b)  Dependent Child/Parents not Separated or Divorced
         The standards for the order of benefits for a dependent
         child when the parents are not separated or divorced are
         as follows:

          1)  The benefits of the plan of the parent whose
              birthday falls earlier in a year are determined
              before those of the plan of the parent whose
              birthday falls later in that year;

          2)  If both parents have the same birthday, the
              benefits of the plan which covered the parent
              longer are determined before those of the plan
              which covered the other parent for a shorter period
              of time;

          3)  The word "birthday" refers only to month and day in
              a calendar year, not the year in which the person
              was born;

          4)  A group contract which includes COB and which is
              issued or renewed, or which has an anniversary date
              on or after 60 days after the effective date of
              this Part shall include the substance of the
              provision in subsections (b)(1),(2) and (3) above.

          5)  If the other plan does not contain the standards
              described in subsections (b)(1), (2) and (3) above,
              but instead has a standard based upon the gender of
              the parent; and if, as a result, the plans do not
              agree on the order of benefits, the standard based
              upon the gender of the parent will determine the
              order of benefits.

     c)  Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced Parents
         If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child
         of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child
         are determined in this order:

          1)  First, the plan of the parent with custody of the
              child;

          2)  Then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with the
              custody of the child; and

          3)  Finally, the plan of the parent not having custody
              of the child.

          4)  If the specific terms of a court decree state that
              one of the parents is responsible for the health
              care expenses of the child, and the entity
              obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the
              plan of that parent has been informed of those
              terms, the benefits of that plan are determined
              first.  The plan of the other parent shall be the
              Secondary Plan.  This subsection does not apply
              with respect to any Claim Determination Period or
              Period or plan year during which any benefits are
              actually paid or provided before the entity has
              that actual knowledge.

     d)  Dependent Child/Joint Custody.

         If the specific terms of a court decree state that the
         parents shall share joint custody, without stating that
         one of the parents is responsible for the health care
         expenses of the child, the plan covering the child shall
         follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined
         in subsection (b) above.

     e)  Active/Inactive Employees

         The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an
         employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that
         employee's dependent) are determined before those of a
         plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired
         employee (or as that employee's dependent).  If the
         other plan does not have this standard; and if, as a
         result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits,
         this standard is ignored.

     f)  Continuation Coverage

          1)  If a person whose coverage is provided under a
              right of continuation, pursuant to federal or state
              law, also is covered under another plan, the
              following shall be the order of benefit
              determination:

               A)  First, the benefits of a plan covering the
                   person as an employee, member or subscriber
                   (or as that person's dependent);

               B)  Second, the benefits under the continuation
                   coverage.

          2)  If the other plan does not contain the order of
              benefits determination described within this
              subsection, and if, as a result, the plans do not
              agree on the order of benefits, this requirement
              shall be ignored.

     g)  Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage

         If none of the above standards determines the order of
         benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered an
         employee, member or subscriber longer are determined
         before those of the plan which covered that person for
         the shorter term.

          1)  To determine the length of time a person has been
              covered under a plan, two plans shall be treated as
              one if the claimant was eligible under the second
              within 24 hours after the first ended.

          2)  The start of a new plan does not include:

               A)  A change in the amount of scope of a plan's
                   benefits;

               B)  A change in the entity which pays, provides or
                   administers the plan's benefits; or

               C)  A change from one type of plan to another
                   (such as, from a single employer plan to that
                   of a multiple employer plan).

          3)  The claimant's length of time covered under a plan
              is measured from the claimant's first date of
              coverage under that plan.  If that date is not
              readily available, the date the claimant first
              became a member of the group shall be used as the
              date from which to determine the length of time the
              claimant's coverage under the present plan has been
              in force.

         7, 1991) 

 
Section 2009.50  Procedure to be followed by Secondary Plan
 
     a)  When it is determined, pursuant to Section 2009.40, that
         this Plan is a Secondary Plan, it may reduce its
         benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by
         all plans during a Claim Determination Period are not
         more than total Allowable Expenses.  The amount by which
         the Secondary Plan's benefits have been reduced shall be
         used by the Secondary Plan to pay Allowable Expenses,
         not otherwise paid, which were incurred during the Claim

         Determination Period by the person for whom the claims
         is made.  As each claim is submitted, the Secondary Plan
         determines its obligation to pay for Allowable Expenses
         based on all claims which were submitted up to that
         point in time during the Claim Determination Period.

     b)  The benefits of the Secondary Plan will be reduced when
         the sum of the benefits that would be payable for the
         Allowable Expenses under the Secondary Plan in the
         absence of this COB provision and the benefits that
         would be payable for the Allowable Expenses under the
         other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose
         like that of this COB provision, whether or not claim is
         made, exceeds those Allowable Expenses in a Claim
         Determination Period.  In that case, the benefits of the
         Secondary Plan will be reduced so that they and the
         benefits payable under the other plans do not total more
         than those Allowable Expenses.

          1)  When the benefits of this Plan are reduced as
              described above, each benefit is reduced in
              proportion.  It is then charged against any
              applicable benefit limit of this Plan.

          2)  Subsection (b)(1) above may be omitted if the plan
              provides only one benefit (i.e. dental only), or
              may be altered to suit the coverage provided.

 
Section 2009.60  Miscellaneous Provisions
 
     a)  Reasonable Cash Values of Services

         A Secondary Plan which provides benefits in the form of
         services may recover the reasonable cash value of
         providing the services from the Primary Plan, to the
         extent that benefits for the services are covered by the
         Primary Plan and have not already been paid or provided
         by the Primary Plan. Nothing in this provision shall be
         interpreted to require a plan to reimburse a covered
         person in cash for the value of services provided by a
         plan which provides benefits in the form of services.

     b)  Excess and Other Nonconforming Provisions

          1)  Some plans have order of benefit determination
              standards not consistent with this Part which
              declare that the plan's coverage is "excess" to all
              others, or "always secondary."  This occurs because
              certain plans may not be subject to insurance
              regulation, or because some group contracts have
              not yet been conformed with this Part pursuant to
              Section 2009.20.

          2)  A plan with order of benefit determination
              standards which comply with this Part (Complying
              Plan) may coordinate its benefits with a plan which
              is "excess" or "always secondary" or which uses
              order of benefit determination standards which are
              inconsistent with those contained in this Part
              (Noncomplying Plan) on the following basis:

               A)  If the Complying Plan is the Primary Plan, it
                   shall pay or provide its benefits on a primary
                   basis;

               B)  If the Complying Plan is the Secondary Plan,
                   it shall, nevertheless, pay or provide its
                   benefits first, but the amount of the benefits
                   payable shall be determined as if the
                   Complying Plan were the Secondary Plan.  In
                   such a situation, such payment shall be the
                   limit of the Complying Plan's liability; and

               C)  If the Noncomplying Plan does not provide the
                   information needed by the Complying Plan to
                   determine its benefits within (sixty) 60 days
                   after it is requested to do so, the Complying
                   Plan shall assume that the benefits of the
                   Noncomplying Plan are identical to its own,
                   and shall pay its benefits accordingly.
                   However, the Complying Plan must adjust any
                   payments it makes based on such assumption
                   whenever information becomes available as to
                   the actual benefits of the Noncomplying Plan.

               D)  If the Noncomplying Plan reduces its benefits
                   so that the employee, subscriber, or member
                   receives less in benefits than he or she would
                   have received had the Complying Plan paid or
                   provided its benefits as the Secondary Plan
                   and the Noncomplying Plan paid or provided its
                   benefits as the Primary Plan, and governing
                   state law allows the right of subrogation set
                   forth below, then the Complying Plan shall
                   advance to or on behalf of the employee,
                   subscriber or member an amount equal to such
                   difference. However, in no event shall the
                   Complying Plan advance more than the Complying
                   Plan would have paid had it been the Primary
                   Plan less any amount it previously paid.  In
                   consideration of such advance, the Complying
                   Plan shall be subrogated to all rights of the
                   employee, subscriber or member against the
                   Noncomplying Plan.  Such advance by the
                   Complying Plan shall also be without prejudice
                   to any claim it may have against the
                   Noncomplying Plan in the absence of such
                   subrogation.

     c)  Allowable Expense.  A term such as "usual and
         customary," "usual and prevailing," or "reasonable and
         customary," may be substituted for the term "necessary,
         reasonable and customary."  Terms such as "medical care"
         or "dental care" may be substituted for "health care" to
         describe the coverages to which the COB provisions
         apply.

     d)  Subrogation.  The COB concept clearly differs from that
         of traditional subrogation.  Provisions for one may be
         included in health care benefits contracts without
         compelling the inclusion or exclusion of the other.

Section 2009.EXHIBIT A  Model COB Provisions
 
COORDINATION OF THE GROUP CONTRACT'S BENEFITS WITH OTHER BENEFITS

     I.  APPLICABILITY

          A.  This Coordination of Benefits ("COB") provision
              applies to This Plan when an employee or the
              employee's covered dependent has health care
              coverage under more than one Plan.  "Plan" and
              "This Plan" are defined below.

          B.  If this COB provision applies, the order of benefit
              determination rules should be looked at first.
              Those rules determine whether the benefits of This
              Plan are determined before of after those of
              another plan. The benefits of This Plan:

               (1) Shall not be reduced when, under the order of
                   benefit determination rules, This Plan
                   determines its benefits before another plan;
                   but

               (2) May be reduced when, under the order of
                   benefits determination rules, another plan
                   determines its benefits first.  The above
                   reduction is described in Section IV "Effect
                   on the Benefits of This Plan."

     II. DEFINITIONS

          A.  "Plan" is any of these which provides benefits or
              services for, or because of, medical or dental care
              or treatment:

               (1) Group insurance or group-type coverage,
                   whether insured or uninsured. This includes
                   prepayment, group practice or individual
                   practice coverage.  It also includes coverage
                   other than school accident-type coverage.

               (2) Coverage under a governmental plan, or
                   coverage required or provided by law.  This
                   does not include a state plan under Medicaid
                   (Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical
                   Assistance Programs, of the United States
                   Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A. 301 et seq.),
                   as amended from time to time).

                   Each contract or other arrangement for
                   coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate plan.
                   Also, if an arrangement has two parts and COB
                   rules apply only to one of the two, each of
                   the parts is a separate plan.

          B.  "This Plan" is the part of the group contract that
              provides benefits for health care expenses.

          C.  "Primary Plan/Secondary Plan:"  The order of
              benefit determination rules state whether This Plan
              is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another
              plan covering the person.

              When This Plan is a Primary Plan, its benefits are
              determined before those of the other plan and
              without considering the other plan's benefits.

              When This Plan is a Secondary Plan, its benefits
              are determined after those of the other plan and
              may be reduced because of the other plan's
              benefits.

              When there are more than two plans covering the
              person, This Plan may be a Primary Plan as to one
              or more other plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as
              to a different plan or plans.

          D.  "Allowable Expense" means a necessary, reasonable
              and customary item of expense for health care; when
              the item of expense is covered at least in part by
              one or more plans covering the person for whom the
              claim is made.

              The difference between the cost of a private
              hospital room and the cost of a semi-private
              hospital room is not considered an Allowable
              Expense under the above definition unless the
              patient's stay in a private hospital room is
              medically necessary either in terms of generally
              accepted medical practice, or as specifically
              defined in the plan.

              When a plan provides benefits in the form of
              services, the reasonable cash value of each service
              rendered will be considered both an Allowable
              Expense and a benefit paid.

          E.  "Claim Determination Period" means a calendar year.
              However, it does not include any part of a year
              during which a person has no coverage under This
              Plan, or any part of a year before the date this
              COB provision or a similar provision takes effect.

     III. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES

          A.  General.  When there is a basis for a claim under
              This Plan and another plan, This Plan is a
              Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined
              after those of the other plan, unless;

               (1) The other plan has rules coordinating its
                   benefits with those of This Plan; and

               (2) Both those rules and This Plan's rules,
                   insubsection (B) below, require that This
                   Plan's benefits be determined before those of
                   the other plan.

          B.  Rules.  This Plan determines its order of benefits
              using the first of the following rules which
              applies:

               (1) Non-Dependent/Dependent.  The benefits of the
                   plan which covers the person as an employee,
                   member or subscriber (that is, other than as a
                   dependent) are determined before those of the
                   plan which covers the person as a dependent;
                   except that:  if the person is also a Medicare
                   beneficiary, Medicare is

                    (a)  Secondary to the plan covering the
                         person as a dependent; and

                    (b)  Primary to the plan covering the person
                         as other than a dependent, for example a
                         retired employee.

               (2) Dependent Child/Parents not Separated or
                   Divorced.  Except as stated in Subsection
                   (B)(3) below, when This Plan and another plan
                   cover the same child as a dependent of
                   different person, called "parents:"

                    (a)  The benefits of the plan of the parent
                         whose birthday falls earlier in a year
                         are determined before those of the plan
                         of the parent whose birthday falls later
                         in that year; but

                    (b)  If both parents have the same birthday,
                         the benefits of the plan which covered
                         the parents longer are determined before
                         those of the plan which covered the
                         other parent for a shorter period of
                         time.

                         However, if the other plan does not have
                         the rule described in Subsection (2)(a)
                         immediately above, but instead has a
                         rule based upon the gender of the
                         parent, and if, as a result, the plans
                         do not agree on the order of benefits,
                         the rule in the other plan will
                         determine the order of benefits.

               (3) Dependent Child/Separated or Divorced.  If two
                   or more plans cover a person as a dependent
                   child of divorced or separated parents,
                   benefits for the child are determined in this
                   order:

                    (a)  First, the plan of the parent with
                         custody of the child;

                    (b)  Then, the plan of the spouse of the
                         parent with the custody of the child;
                         and

                    (c)  Finally, the plan of the parent not
                         having custody of the child.

                   However, if the specific terms of a court
                   decree state that one of the parents is
                   responsible for the health care expense of the
                   child, and the entity obligated to pay or
                   provide the benefits of the plan of that
                   parent has actual knowledge of those terms,
                   the benefits of that plan are determined
                   first.  The plan of the other parent shall be
                   the Secondary Plan.  This paragraph does not
                   apply with respect to any Claim Determination
                   Period or Plan year during  which any benefits
                   are actually paid or provided before the
                   entity has that actual knowledge.

               (4) Dependent Child/Joint Custody.  If the
                   specific terms of a court decree state that
                   the parents shall share joint custody, without
                   stating that one of the parents is responsible
                   for the health care expenses of the child, the
                   plans covering the child shall follow the
                   order of benefit determination rules outlined
                   in Paragraph III subsection B(2) above.

               (5) Active/Inactive Employee.  The benefits of a
                   plan which covers a person as an employee who
                   is neither laid off nor retired (or as that
                   employee's dependent) are determined before
                   those of a plan which covers that person as a
                   laid off or retired employee (or as that
                   employee's dependent).  If the other plan does
                   not have this rule, and if, as a result, the
                   plans do not agree on the order of benefits,
                   this Rule (4) is ignored.

               (6) Continuation coverage.  If a person whose
                   coverage is provided under a right of
                   continuation pursuant to federal or state law
                   also is covered under another plan, the
                   following shall be the order of benefit
                   determination:

                    (a)  First, the benefits of a plan covering
                         the person as an employee, member or
                         subscriber (or as that person's
                         dependent);

                    (b)  Second, the benefits under the
                         continuation coverage.

                   If the other plan does not contain the order
                   of benefits determination described within
                   this subsection, and if, as a result, the
                   plans do not agree on the order of benefits,
                   this requirement shall be ignored.

               (7) Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage.  If none of
                   the above rules determines the order of
                   benefits, the benefits of the plan which
                   covered an employee, member or subscriber
                   longer are determined before those of the Plan
                   which covered that person for the shorter
                   term.

     IV. EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN

          A.  When This Section Applies.  This Section IV applies
              when, in accordance with Section III "Order of
              Benefit Determination Rules," This Plan is a
              Secondary Plan as to one or more other plans.  In
              that event the benefits of This Plan may be reduced
              under this section.  Such other plan or plans are
              referred to as "the other plans" in (B) immediately
              below.

          B.  Reduction in this Plan's Benefits.  The benefits of
              This Plan will be reduced when the sum of:

               (1) The benefits that would be payable for the
                   Allowable Expense under This Plan in the
                   absence of this COB provision; and

               (2) The benefits that would be payable for the
                   Allowable Expenses under the other plans, in
                   the absence of provisions with a purpose like
                   that of this COB provision, whether or not
                   claim is made; exceeds those Allowable
                   Expenses in a Claim Determination Period.  In
                   that case, the benefits of This Plan will be
                   reduced so that they and the benefits payable
                   under the other plans do not total more than
                   those Allowable Expenses.

                   When the benefits of This Plan are reduced as
                   described above, each benefit is reduced in
                   proportion.  It is then charged against any
                   applicable benefit limit of This Plan.

     V.  RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION

         Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules.
         [Insurer] has the right to decide which facts it needs.
         It may get needed facts from or give them to any other
         organization or person.  [Insurer] need not tell, or get
         the consent of, any person to do this.  Each person
         claiming benefits under This Plan must give [insurer]
         any facts it needs to pay the claim.

     VI. FACILITY OF PAYMENT

         A payment made under another plan may include an amount
         which should have been paid under This Plan.  If it
         does, [insurer] may pay that amount to the organization
         which made that payment.  That amount will then be
         treated as though it were a benefit paid under This
         Plan.  [Insurer] will not have to pay that amount again.
         The term "payment made" includes providing benefits in
         the form of services, in which case "payment made" means
         reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the
         form of services.

     VII. RIGHT OF RECOVERY

         If the amount of the payments made by [insurer] is more
         than it should have paid under this COB provision, it
         may recover the excess from one or more of:

               A.  The persons it has paid or for whom it has
                   paid;

               B.  Insurance companies; or

               C.  Other organizations.

The "amount of the payments made" includes the reasonable cash
value of any benefits provided in the form of services.

Section 2010.10  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Part is to provide prospective purchasers
with clear and unambiguous statements in the advertisement of
Medicare supplement insurance; to assure the clear and truthful
disclosure of the benefits, limitations and exclusions of
policies sold as Medicare supplement insurance.  This purpose is
intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines
and permissible and impermissable standards of conduct in the
advertising of Medicare supplement insurance in a manner which
prevents unfair, deceptive and misleading advertising and is
conducive to accurate presentation and description to the
insurance-buying public through the advertising media and
material used by insurance agents and companies.

 
Section 2010.20  Applicability
 
     a)  This Part shall apply to any "advertisement" of Medicare
         supplement insurance as that term is defined herein,
         unless otherwise specified in this Part, which the
         insurer knows or reasonably should know is intended for
         presentation, distribution or dissemination in this
         State when such presentation, distribution or
         dissemination is made either directly or indirectly by
         or on behalf of an insurer or producer of this State.

     b)  Every insurer shall establish and at all times maintain
         a system of control as required by this Part over the
         content, form and method of dissemination of all of its
         Medicare supplement insurance advertisements.  All such
         advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created,
         designed or presented, shall be the responsibility of
         the insurers benefiting directly or indirectly from
         their dissemination.

     c)  Advertising materials which are reproduced in a quantity
         of 50 or more copies shall be identified by form
         numbers.  Such identification shall distinguish an
         advertisement from any other advertising materials,
         policies, applications or other materials used by the
         insurer.

 
Section 2010.30  Definitions

                   newspapers, magazines, radio scripts,
                   television scripts, billboards and similar
                   displays;

               B)  descriptive literature and sales aids of all

                   491.1 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill.
                   Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par. 1065.38-1), for
                   presentation to members of the
                   insurance-buying public; including, but not
                   limited to, circulars, leaflets, booklets,
                   depictions, illustrations, form letters and
                   lead generating devices of all kinds as herein
                   defined; and

               C)  prepared sales talks, presentations and
                   material for use by the insurer or the

                   reinstatements.

          2)  The definition of "advertisement" does not include:

               A)  material to be used solely for the training
                   and education of an insurer's employees or
                   producers;

               B)  material used in-house by insurers;

               C)  communications within an insurer's own

                   expand coverages;

               E)  correspondence between a prospective group or
                   blanket policyholder and an insurer in the
                   course of negotiating a group or blanket
                   contract;

               F)  court approved material ordered by a court to

                   policyholder to eligible individuals on an
                   employment or membership list that a contract
                   or program has been written or arranged;
                   provided the announcement must clearly
                   indicate that it is preliminary to the
                   issuance of a booklet.

     b)  "Medicare Supplement Insurance" means a group or
         individual policy of accident and health insurance as

         similar organization which is advertised, marketed or
         designed primarily as a supplement to reimbursements
         under Medicare for the hospital, medical or surgical

         insurance.

     e)  "Exception" means any provision in a policy whereby
         coverage for a specified hazard is entirely eliminated;

         policy.

     f)  "Reduction" means any provision which reduces the amount

All information required to be disclosed by this Part shall be
set out conspicuously and in close conjunction with the
statements to which such information relates or under appropriate
captions of such prominence that it shall not be minimized,
rendered obscure or presented in an ambiguous manner or fashion
or intermingled with the context of the advertisement so as to be
confusing or misleading.

 
Section 2010.50  Form and Content of Advertisements
 
     a)  The format and content of a Medicare supplement
         insurance advertisement shall avoid deception or the
         capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive.  Whether an
         advertisement has a capacity or tendency to mislead or
         deceive shall be determined by the Director from the
         overall impression that the advertisement may be
         reasonably expected to create upon a person of average
         education or intelligence, within the segment of the
         public to which it is directed.

     b)  Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in
         fact or in implication.  Words or phrases whose meanings
         are clear only by implication or by the consumer's
         familiarity with insurance terminology shall not be
         used.

     c)  An insurer must clearly identify its Medicare supplement
         insurance policy as an insurance policy.  A policy trade
         name must be followed by the words. . ."Insurance
         Policy" or similiar words clearly identifying the fact
         that an insurance policy or health benefits product (in
         the case of health maintenance organizations, prepaid
         health plans and other direct service organizations) is
         being offered.

     d)  No insurer, producer or other person shall solicit a
         resident of this State for the purchase of Medicare
         supplement insurance in connection with or as the result
         of the use of any advertisement by such person or any
         other person, where the advertisement:

          1)  Contains any misleading representations or
              misrepresentations, or is otherwise untrue,
              deceptive or misleading with regard to the
              information imparted, the status, character or
              representative capacity of such person or the true
              purpose of the advertisement; or

          2)  Otherwise violates the provisions of this Part.

     e)  No insurer, producer or other person shall solicit
         residents of this State for the purchase of Medicare
         supplement insurance through the use of a true or
         fictious name which is deceptive or misleading with
         regard to the status, character, or proprietary or
         representative capacity of such person or the true
         purpose of the advertisement.

 
Section 2010.60  Advertisements of Benefits, Losses Covered or Premiums Payable
 
     a)  Deceptive Words, Phrases or Illustrations Prohibited

          1)  No advertisement shall omit information or use
              words, phrases, statements, references or
              illustrations if the omission of such information
              or use of such words, phrases, statements,
              references or illustrations has the capacity,
              tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving
              purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the
              nature or extent of any policy benefit payable,
              loss covered or premium payable.  The fact that the
              policy offered is made available to a prospective
              insured for inspection prior to consummation of the
              sale or an offer is made to refund the premium if
              the purchaser is not satisfied, does not remedy
              misleading statements.

          2)  No advertisement shall contain or use words or
              phrases such as "all," "full," "complete,"
              "comprehensive," "unlimited," "up to," "as high
              as," "this policy will help fill some of the gaps
              that Medicare and your present insurance leave
              out," "this policy pays all that Medicare doesn't"
              or similar words and phrases, in a manner which
              exaggerates any benefit beyond the terms of the
              policy.

          3)  An advertisement which also is an invitation to
              join an association, trust or discretionary group
              must solicit insurance coverage on a separate and
              distinct application which requires separate
              signatures for each application.  The insurance
              program must be presented so as not to mislead or
              deceive the prospective members that they are
              purchasing insurance as well as applying for
              membership, if that is the case.

          4)  An advertisement shall not contain descriptions of
              policy limitations, exceptions or reductions,
              worded in a positive manner to imply that it is a
              benefit, such as describing a waiting period as a
              "benefit builder" or stating "even preexisting
              conditions are covered after 6 months."  Words and
              phrases used in an advertisement to describe such
              policy limitations, exceptions and reductions shall
              fairly and accurately describe the negative
              features of such limitations, exceptions and
              reductions of the policy offered.

          5)  An advertisement of Medicare supplement insurance
              sold by direct response shall not state or imply
              that "because no insurance agent will call and no
              commissions will be paid to 'agents' that it is a
              low cost plan" or use other similar words or
              phrases because the cost of a advertising and
              servicing such policies is a substantial cost in
              marketing by direct response.

     b)  Exceptions, Reductions and Limitations

          1)  An advertisement which is an invitation to contract
              shall disclose those exceptions, reductions and
              limitations affecting benefits provided by the
              policy.

          2)  When a policy contains a waiting, elimination,
              probationary or similar time period between the
              effective date of the policy and the effective date
              of coverage under the policy or a time period
              between the date a loss occurs and the date
              benefits begin to accrue for such loss, an
              advertisement which is subject to the requirements
              of subsection (b)(1) shall disclose the existence
              of such periods.

          3)  An advertisement shall not use the words "only,"
              "just," "merely," "minimum," or similar words or
              phrases to describe the applicability of any
              exceptions and reductions, such as:  "This policy
              is subject to the following minimum exceptions and
              reductions."

     c)  Preexisting Conditions

          1)  An advertisement which is an invitation to contract
              shall, in negative terms, disclose the extent to
              which any loss is not covered if the cause of such
              loss is traceable to a condition existing prior to
              the effective date of the policy.  The use of the
              term "preexisting condition" without an appropriate
              definition or description shall not be used.

          2)  When a Medicare supplement insurance policy does
              not cover losses resulting from preexisting
              conditions, no advertisement of the policy shall
              state or imply that the applicant's physical
              condition or medical history will not affect the
              issuance of the policy or payment of a claim
              thereunder.  This subsection prohibits the use of
              the phrase "no medical examination required" and
              phrases of similar import, but does not prohibit
              explaining "automatic issue."  If an insurer
              requires a medical examination for a specified
              policy, the advertisement shall disclose that a
              medical examination is required.

          3)  When an advertisement contains an application form
              to be completed by the applicant and returned by
              mail, such application form shall contain a
              question or statement which reflects the
              preexisting condition provisions of the policy
              immediately preceding the blank space for the
              applicant's signature.  For example, such an
              application form shall contain a question or
              statement substantially as follows:

               A)  Do you understand that this policy will not
                   pay benefits during the first six (6) months
                   after the issue date for a disease or physical
                   condition for which medical advice was given
                   or treatment was recommended by or received
                   from a physician within six (6) months before
                   the policy issue date?  YES

               B)  Or substantially the following statement:  I
                   understand that the policy applied for will
                   not pay benefits for any loss incurred during
                   the first six (6) months after the issue date
                   due to a disease or physical condition for
                   which I received medical advice or for which
                   treatment was recommended by or received from
                   a physician within six (6) months before the
                   issue date.

 
Section 2010.70  Necessity for Disclosing Policy Provisions Relating to Renewability, Cancellability and Termination
 
An advertisement which is an invitation to contract shall
disclose the provisions relating to renewability, cancellability
and termination and any modification of benefits, losses covered
or premiums because of age or for other reasons, in a manner
which complies with the standards for disclosure set forth in
Section 2010.40 of this Part.

 
Section 2010.80  Testimonials or Endorsements by Third Parties
 
     a)  Testimonials and endorsements used in advertisements
         must be genuine, represent the current opinion of the
         author, be applicable to the policy advertised and be
         accurately reproduced.  The insurer, in using a
         testimonial or endorsement, makes as its own all of the
         statements contained therein, and the advertisement,
         including such statements, is subject to all the
         provisions of this Part.  When a testimonial or
         endorsement is used more than one year after it was
         originally given, a current written confirmation from
         the author of such testimonial or endorsement must be
         obtained and maintained for three years in the insurer's
         advertising file.

     b)  A person shall be deemed a "spokesperson" if the person
         making the testimonial or endorsement:

          1)  Has a financial interest in the insurer or an
              affiliate as that term is defined in Section 131.1
              of the Illinois Insurance Code  as a stockholder,
              director, officer, employee or otherwise; or

          2)  Has any person in a policy-making position who is
              affiliated with the insurer in any of the above
              described capacities; or

          3)  Has been formed by the insurer, is owned or
              controlled by the insurer, its employees, or the
              person or persons who own or control the insurer;
              or

          4)  Is in any way directly or indirectly compensated
              for making a testimonial or endorsement.

     c)  The fact of a financial interest or the proprietary or
         representative capacity of a spokesperson shall be
         disclosed in an advertisement and shall be accomplished
         in the introductory portion of the testimonial or
         endorsement in the same form and with equal prominence
         thereto.  If a spokesperson is directly or indirectly
         compensated for making a testimonial or endorsement,
         such fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement by
         language substantially as follows:  "Paid Endorsement".
         The requirement of this disclosure may be fulfilled by
         use of the phrase "Paid Endorsement" or words of similar
         import in a type style and size at least equal to that
         used for the spokesperson's name or the body of the
         testimonial or endorsement; whichever is larger.  In the
         case of television or radio advertising, the required
         disclosure must be accomplished in the introductory
         portion of the advertisement and must be given
         prominence.

     d)  The disclosure requirements of this Part shall not apply
         where the sole financial interest or compensation of a
         spokesperson, for all testimonials or endorsements made
         on behalf of the insurer, consists of the payment of
         union "scale" wages required by union rules, and if the
         payment is actually for such "scale" for TV or radio
         performances.

     e)  An advertisement shall not state or imply that an
         insurer or a Medicare supplement insurance policy has
         been approved or endorsed by any individual, group of
         individuals, society, association or other organization,
         unless such is the fact, and unless any proprietary
         relationship between an organization and the insurer is
         disclosed.  If the entity making the endorsement or
         testimonial has been formed by the insurer or is owned
         or controlled by the insurer or the person or persons
         who own or control the insurer, such fact shall be
         disclosed in the advertisement.  If the insurer or an
         officer of the insurer formed or controls the
         association, or holds any policy-making position in the
         association, that fact must be disclosed.

     f)  When a testimonial refers to benefits received under a
         Medicare supplement insurance policy, the specific claim
         data, including claim number, date of loss, and other
         pertinent information shall be retained by the insurer
         for inspection for a period of four years or until the
         filing of the next regular report of examination of the
         insurer, whichever is the longer period of time.  The
         use of testimonials which do not correctly reflect the
         present practices of the insurer or which are not
         applicable to the policy or benefit being advertised is
         not permissable.

 
Section 2010.90  Use of Statistics
 
     a)  An advertisement relating to the dollar amounts of
         claims paid, the number of persons insured, or similar
         statistical information relating to any insurer or
         policy shall not use such statistical information unless
         it pertains to the insurer's Medicare supplement
         insurance business.  Such an advertisement shall not
         imply that such statistics are derived from a policy
         advertised unless such is the fact, and when applicable
         to other policies or plans shall specifically so state.

          1)  An advertisement shall specifically identify the
              Medicare supplement insurance policy to which
              statistics relate and, where statistics are given
              which are applicable to a different policy, it must
              be stated clearly that the data do not relate to
              the policy being advertised.

          2)  An advertisement using statistics which describe an
              insurer, such as assets, corporate structure,
              financial standing, age, product lines or relative
              position in the insurance business, may be
              irrelevant and, if used at all, must be used with
              extreme caution because of the potential for
              misleading the public.  As a specific example, an
              advertisement for Medicare supplement insurance
              which refers to the amount of life insurance which
              the company has in force or the amounts paid out in
              life insurance benefits is not permissable unless
              the advertisement clearly indicates the amount paid
              out for each line of business.

     b)  An advertisement shall not represent or imply that claim
         settlements by the insurer are "liberal" or "generous,"
         or use words of similar import, or state or imply that
         claim settlements are or will be beyond the actual terms
         of the contract.  An unusual amount paid for a unique
         claim for the policy advertised is misleading and shall
         not be used.

     c)  The source of any statistics used in an advertisement
         shall be identified in such advertisement.

 
Section 2010.100  Disparaging Comparisons and Statements
 
An advertisement shall not directly or indirectly make unfair or
incomplete comparisons of policies or benefits or comparisons of
non-comparable policies of other insurers, and shall not
disparage competitors, their policies, services or business
methods, and shall not disparage or unfairly minimize competing
methods of marketing insurance.

     a)  An advertisement shall not contain statements such as
         "no red tape" or "here is all you do to receive
         benefits."

     b)  Advertisements which state or imply that competing
         insurance coverages customarily contain certain
         exceptions, reductions or limitations not contained in
         the advertised policies are unacceptable unless such
         exceptions, reductions or limitations are contained in
         not less than 50 percent of such competing coverages.

     c)  Advertisements which state or imply that an insurer's
         premiums are lower or that its loss ratios are higher
         because its organizational structure differs from that
         of competing insurers are unacceptable.

 
Section 2010.110  Jurisdictional Licensing and Status of Insurer
 
     a)  An advertisement which is intended to be seen or heard
         beyond the limits of the jurisdiction in which the
         insurer is licensed shall not imply licensing beyond
         those limits.

     b)  An advertisement shall not create the impression
         directly or indirectly that the insurer, its financial
         condition or status; or the payment of its claims; or
         the merits, desirability or advisability of its policy
         forms or kinds of plans of insurance are approved,
         endorsed or accredited by any division or agency of this
         State or the United States Government.

     c)  An advertisement shall not imply that approval,
         endorsement or accreditation of policy forms or
         advertising has been granted by any division or agency
         of the state or federal government.  "Approval" of
         either policy forms or advertising shall not be used by
         an insurer to imply or state that a governmental agency
         has endorsed or recommended the insurer, its policies,
         advertising or its financial conditions.

 
Section 2010.120  Identity of Insurer
 
     a)  The name of the actual insurer shall be stated in all of
         its advertisements.  The form number or numbers of the
         policy advertised shall be stated in an advertisement
         which is an invitation to contract.  An advertisement
         shall not use a trade name, any insurance group
         destination, name of the parent company of the insurer,
         name of a particular division of the insurer, service
         mark, slogan, symbol or other device which with or
         without disclosing the name of the actual insurer would
         have the capacity and tendency to mislead or deceive as
         to the true identity of the insurer.

     b)  No advertisement shall use any combination of words,
         symbols or physical materials which by their content,
         phraseology, shape, color or other characteristics are
         so similar to combination of words, symbols or physical
         materials used by agencies of the federal government or
         of this State, or otherwise appear to be of such a
         nature that it tends to confuse or mislead prospective
         insureds into believing that the solicitation is in some
         manner connected with an agency of the municipal, state
         or federal government.

     c)  Advertisements, envelopes or stationery which employ
         words, letters, initials, symbols or other devices which
         are so similar to those used by governmental agencies or
         other insurers are not permitted if they may lead the
         public to believe:

          1)  that the advertised coverages are somehow provided
              by or are endorsed by such governmental agencies or
              such other insurers;

          2)  that the advertiser is the same as, is connected
              with or is endorsed by such governmental agencies
              or such other insurers.

     d)  No advertisement shall use the name of a state or
         political subdivision thereof in a policy name or
         description.

     e)  No advertisement in the form of envelopes or stationery
         of any kind may use any name, service mark, slogan,
         symbol or any device in such a manner that implies that
         the insurer or the policy advertised, or that any agent
         who may call upon the consumer in response to the
         advertisement is connected with a governmental agency,
         such as the Social Security Administration.

     f)  No advertisement may incorporate the word "Medicare" in
         the title of the plan or policy being advertised unless,
         wherever it appears, said word is qualfied by language
         differentiating it from Medicare.  Such an
         advertisement, however, shall not use the phrase
         "            Medicare Department of the
                       Insurance Company," or language of similar
         import.

     g)  No advertisement shall be used that fails to include the
         disclaimer to the effect of "Not Connected with or
         endorsed by the U.S. Government or the Federal Medicare
         program."

     h)  No advertisement may imply that the reader may lose a
         right or privilege or benefit under federal, state or
         local law if he fails to respond to the advertisement.

     i)  The use of letter, initials, or symbols of the corporate
         name or trademark that would have the tendency or
         capacity to mislead or deceive the public as to the true
         identity of the insurer is prohibited unless the true,
         correct and complete name of the insurer is in close
         conjunction and in the same size type as the letter,
         initials or symbols of the corporate name or trademark.

     j)  The use of the name of an agency or "          
         Underwriters" or "           Plan" in type, size and
         location so as to have the capacity and tendency to
         mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the
         insurer is prohibited.

     k)  The use of an address so as to mislead or deceive as to
         true identity of the insurer, its location or licensing
         status is prohibited.

     l)  No insurer may use, in the trade name of its insurance
         policy, any terminology or words so similar to the name
         of a governmental agency or governmental program as to
         have the tendency to confuse, deceive or mislead the
         prospective purchaser.

     m)  All advertisements used by producers of an insurer must
         have prior written approval of the insurer before they
         may be used.

     n)  A producer who makes contact with a consumer, as a
         result of acquiring that consumer's name from a lead
         generating device, must disclose such fact in the
         initial contact with its consumer.

 
Section 2010.130  Group or Quasi-Group Implications
 
     a)  An advertisement of a particular policy shall not state
         or imply that prospective insureds become group or
         quasi-group members covered under a group policy and as
         such enjoy special rates or underwriting privileges,
         unless such is the fact.

     b)  This Section prohibits the solicitation of a particular
         class, such as governmental employees, by use of
         advertisements which state or imply that their
         occupational status entitles them to reduced rates on a
         group or other basis when, in fact, the policy being
         advertised is sold only on an individual basis at
         regular rates.
 
Section 2010.140  Introductory, Initial or Special Offers
 
     a)  An advertisement of an individual policy shall not
         directly or by implication represent that a contract or
         combination of contracts is an introductory, initial or
         special offer, or that applicants will receive
         substantial advantages not available at a later date, or
         that the offer is available only to a specified group of
         individuals, unless such is the fact.  An advertisement
         shall not contain phrases describing an enrollment
         period as "special," "limited," or similar words or
         phrases when the insurer uses such enrollment periods as
         the usual method of advertising Medicare supplement
         insurance.

     b)  An enrollment period during which a particular insurance
         product may be purchased on an individual basis shall
         not be offered within this State unless there has been a
         lapse of not less than 6 months between the close of the
         immediately preceding enrollment period for the same
         product and the opening of the new enrollment period.
         The advertisement shall indicate the date by which the
         applicant must mail the application, which shall be not
         less than ten days and not more than forty days from the
         date that such enrollment period is advertised for the
         first time.  This requirement applies to all advertising
         media, i.e., mail, newspapers, radio, television,
         magazines and periodicals, by any one insurer.  It is
         not applicable to solicitations of employees or members
         of a particular group or association which otherwise
         would be eligible under Sections 367 and 367a of the
         Illinois Insurance Code for group, blanket or franchise
         insurance.  The phrase "any one insurer" includes all
         the affiliated companies of a group of insurance
         companies under common management or control.

     c)  No advertisement shall make any statement or implication
         to the effect that only a specific number of policies
         will be sold, or that a time is fixed for the
         discontinuance of the sale of the particular policy
         advertised because of special advantages available in
         the policy, unless such is the fact.

     d)  The phrase "a particular insurance product" in
         subsection (b) of this Section means an insurance policy
         which provides substantially different benefits than
         those contained in any other policy.  Different terms of
         renewability; an increase or decrease in the dollar
         amounts of benefits; an increase or decrease in any
         elimination period or waiting period from those
         available during an enrollment period for another policy
         shall not be sufficient to constitute the product being
         offered as a different product eligible for concurrent
         or overlapping enrollment periods.

     e)  An advertisement shall not offer a policy which utilizes
         a reduced initial premium rate in a manner which
         overemphasizes the availability and the amount of the
         initial reduced premium.  When an insurer charges an
         initial premium that differs in amount from the amount
         of the renewal premium payable on the same mode, the
         advertisement shall not display the amount of the
         reduced initial premium either more frequently or more
         prominently than the renewal premium, and both the
         initial reduced premium and the renewal premium must be
         stated in juxtaposition in each portion of the
         advertisement where the initial reduced premium appears.
         The term "juxtaposition" means side by side or
         immediately above or below.

     f)  Special awards, such as a "safe driver's award" shall
         not be used in connection with advertisements of
         Medicare Supplement insurance.

 
Section 2010.150  Statements About an Insurer
 
An advertisement shall not contain statements which are untrue in
fact, or by implication misleading, with respect to the assets,
corporate structure, financial standing, age or relative position
of the insurer in the insurance business.  An advertisement shall
not contain a recommendation by any commercial rating system
unless it clearly indicates the purpose of the recommendation and
the limitations of the scope and extent of the recommendation.

 
Section 2010.160  Enforcement Procedures
 
     a)  Advertising File:  Each insurer shall maintain at its
         home or principal office a complete file containing
         every printed, published or prepared advertisement of
         its individual policies and typical printed, published
         or prepared advertisements of its blanket, franchise and
         group policies hereafter disseminated in this or any
         other state, whether or not licensed in such other
         state, with a notation attached to each such
         advertisement which shall indicate the manner and extent
         of distribution and the form number of any policy
         advertised.  Such file shall be available for inspection
         by this Department.  All such advertisements shall be
         maintained in said file for a period of either four
         years or until the filing of the next regular report of
         examination of the insurer, whichever is the longer
         period of time.

     b)  Certificate of Compliance:  Each insurer which is
         required to file an Annual Statement with this
         Department and which is now or hereafter becomes subject
         to the provisions of this Part must file with this
         Department, with its Annual Statement, a Certificate of
         Compliance executed by an authorized officer of the
         insurer wherein it is stated that, to the best of his
         knowledge, information and belief, the advertisements
         which were disseminated by the insurer during the
         preceding statement year complied or were made to comply
         in all respects with the provisions of this Part and the
         Insurance Laws of this State.

     c)  If the Director or Insurance finds that any
         advertisement subject to this Part has materially failed
         to comply with the provisions of this Part, the Director
         may, by order, require the insurer responsible for such
         non-compliance to publish in the same or similar medium,
         an approved correction or retraction of any untrue,
         misleading, or deceptive statement contained in the
         advertising and may prohibit such insurer from
         publishing or distributing, or allowing to be published
         or distributed on its behalf such advertisement or any
         new materially revised advertisement without first
         having filed a copy thereof with the Director 30 days
         prior to the publication or distribution thereof, or any
         shorter period specified in such order.

 
Section 2010.170  Filing Requirements for Advertising
 
Every insurer shall provide a copy of any Medicare supplement
advertisement intended for use in this State whether through
written, radio or television medium to the Director of Insurance
of this State.  Such advertisement shall comply with Sections 149
and 363a of the Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 2010.APPENDIX A  Interpretive Guidelines
 

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION A  Guideline to Section 2010.30
 
This Part applies to any "advertisement" as that term is defined
in Section 2010.30(a), (h), (i), and (j) unless otherwise
specified in this Part.  This Part applies to group, blanket and
individual Medicare supplement insurance advertisements.  Certain
distinctions, however, are applicable to these categories.  Among
them is the level of conversance with insurance, a factor which
is covered by Section 2010.50(a).

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION B  Guideline to Section 2010.30(a)(1)

The scope of the term "advertisement" extends to the use of all
media for communications to the general public, to the use of all
media for communications to specific members of the general
public, and to use of all media for communications by producers.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION C  Guideline to Section 2010.30(i)
 
A "brief description of coverage" in an invitation to inquire may
consist of an explanation of Medicare benefits, minimum benefits,
standards for Medicare supplement policies, the manner in which
the advertised Medicare supplement insurance policy supplements
the benefits of Medicare and meets or exceeds the minimum benefit
requirements.  An invitation to inquire shall not refer to cost
or the maximum dollar amount of benefits payable.
As with all Medicare supplement insurance advertisements, an
invitation to inquire must not:

          1)  Employ devices which are designed to create undue
              anxiety in the minds of the elderly or excite fear
              of dependence upon relatives or charity;

          2)  Exaggerate the gaps on Medicare coverage;

          3)  Exaggerate the value of the benefits available
              under the advertised policy.

          4)  Otherwise violate the provisions of this Part.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION D  Guideline to Section 2010.40
 
This Section permits the use of either of the following
alternative methods of disclosure:

     a)  The first alternative provides for the disclosure of
         exceptions, limitations, reductions and other
         restrictions conspicuously and in close conjunction with
         the statements to which such information relates.  This
         may be accomplished by disclosure in the description of
         the related benefits or in a paragraph set out in close
         conjunction with the description of policy benefits.

     b)  The second alternative provides for the disclosure of
         exceptions, limitations, reductions and other
         restrictions not in conjunction with the provisions
         describing policy benefits but under appropriate
         captions of such prominence that the information shall
         not be minimized, rendered obscure or otherwise made to
         appear unimportant.  The phrase "under appopriate
         captions" means that the title must be accurately
         descriptive of the captioned material.  Appropriate
         captions include the following:  "Exceptions,"
         "Exclusions," "Conditions Not Covered," and "Exceptions
         and Reductions."  The use of captions such as, or
         similar to, the following are not acceptable because
         they do not provide adequate notice of the significance
         of the material:  "Extent of Coverage," "Only these
         Exclusions," or "Minimum Limitations."

In considering whether an advertisement complies with the
disclosure requirements of this Section, the requirements of this
Section must be applied in conjunction with the form and content
standards contained in Section 2010.50.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION E  Guideline to Section 2010.50(a)
 
The requirements of Section 2010.50(a) must be applied in
conjunction with Sections 2010.10 and 2010.40.  This Section
refers specifically to "format and content" of the advertisement
and the "overall" impression created by the advertisement.  This
involves factors such as, but not limited to, the size, color and
prominence of type used to describe benefits.  The word "format"
means the arrangement of the text and the captions.
This Section requires distinctly different advertisements for
publication in newspapers or magazines of general circulation, as
compared to scholarly, technical or business journals and
newspapers.  Where an advertisement consists of more than on
piece of material, each piece of material must, independent of
all other pieces of material, conform to the disclosure
requirements of this Section.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION F  Guideline to Section 2010.50(b)
 
This Section prohibits the use of incomplete statements and words
or phrases which have the tendency or capacity to mislead or
deceive because of the reader's unfamiliarity with insurance
terminology.  Therefore, words, phrases and illustrations used in
an advertisement must be clear and unambiguous.  If the
advertisement uses insurance terminology, sufficient description
of a word, phrase or illustration shall be provided by definition
or description in the context of the advertisement.  As implied
in Illustration E, distinctly different levels of comprehension
of the subscribers of various publications may be anticipated.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION G  Guideline to Section 2010.60(a)(1)
 
This Section prohibits the use of incomplete statements and words
or phrases which create deception by omission or commission.  The
following examples are illustrations of the prohibitions created
by this Section:

     a)  An advertisement which describes any benefits that vary
         by age must disclose the fact.

     b)  An advertisement that uses a phrase such as "no age
         limit" must disclose that premiums may vary be age or
         that benefits may vary by age if such is the case.

     c)  Advertisements, applications, requests for additional
         information and similar materials are unacceptable if
         they state or imply that the recipient has been
         individually selected to be offered insurance, or has
         had his eligibility for such insurance individually
         determined in advance, when in fact the advertisement is
         directed to all persons in a group or to all persons
         whose names appear on a mailing list.

     d)  Advertisements for group or franchise group plans which
         provide a common benefit or a common combination of
         benefits shall not imply that the insurance coverage is
         tailored or designed specifically for that group, unless
         such is the fact.

     e)  It is unacceptable to use terms such as "enroll" or
         "join" with reference to group or blanket insurance
         coverage when such is not the case.

     f)  An advertisement, which states or implies immediate
         coverage is provided, is unacceptable unless suitable
         administrative procedures exist so that the policy is
         issued within fifteen working days after the application
         is received by the insurer.

     g)  Applications, request forms for additional information,
         and similar related materials are unacceptable if they
         resemble paper currency, bonds or stock certificates; or
         use any name, service mark, slogan, symbol or any device
         in such a manner that implies that the insurer or the
         policy advertised is connected with a government agency,
         such as the Social Security Administration or the
         Department of Health and Human Services.

     h)  An advertisement which uses the word "plan" without
         identifying it as a Medicare supplement insurance policy
         is not permissable.

     i)  An advertisement which implies in any manner that the
         prospective insured may realize a profit from obtaining
         Medicare supplement insurance is not permissable.

     j)  An advertisement which fails to disclose any waiting or
         elimination periods is unacceptable.

     k)  Examples of benefits payable under a policy shall not
         disclose only maximum benefits unless such maximum
         benefits are paid for loss from common or probable
         illnesses or accidents, rather than exceptional or rare
         illnesses or accidents or periods of confinement for
         such exceptional or rare accidents or illnesses.

     l)  When a range of benefit levels is set forth in an
         advertisement, it must be made clear that the insured
         will receive only the benefit level written or printed
         in the policy selected and issued.

     m)  Advertisements for policies whose premiums are modest
         because of their limited amount of benefits shall not
         describe premiums as "low," "low-cost," "budget" or use
         qualifying words of similar import.  This Section also
         prohibits the use of words such as "only" and "just" in
         conjunction with statements of premium amounts when used
         to imply a bargain.

     n)  An advertisement which exaggerates the effects of
         statutorily mandated benefits or required policy
         provisions or which implies that such provisions are
         unique to the advertised policy is unacceptable.  For
         example, the phrase, "Money Back Guarantee," is an
         exaggerated description of the thirty-day right to
         examine the policy and is not acceptable.

     o)  An advertisement which implies that a common type of
         policy or a combination of common benefits is "new,"
         "unique," "a bonus," "a breakthrough," or is otherwise
         unusual is unacceptable.  Also, the addition of a novel
         method of premium payment to an otherwise common plan of
         insurance does not render it "new."

     p)  An advertisement may not omit the word "covered" when
         referring to benefits payable under its policy.
         Continued reference to "covered" is not necessary where
         this fact has been prominently disclosed in the
         advertisement.

     q)  An advertisement must state that benefits payable under
         the policy are based upon Medicare eligible expenses, if
         such is the case.

     r)  An advertisement which fails to disclose that the
         definition of "hospital" does not include a nursing
         home, convalescent home or extended care facility, as
         the case may be, is unacceptable.

     s)  A television, radio, mail or newspaper advertisement, or
         lead generating device which is designed to produce
         leads either by use of a coupon, a request to write or
         to call the company, or a subsequent advertisement prior
         to contact must include information disclosing that an
         insurance agent may contact the applicant if such is the
         fact.

     t)  Advertisements for policies designed to supplement
         Medicare shall not employ devices which are designed to
         create undue anxiety in the minds of the elderly.  Such
         phrases as "here is where most people over 65 learn
         about the gaps in Medicare," or "Medicare is great, but
         ..." or which otherwise exaggerate the gaps in Medicare
         coverage are unacceptable.  Phrases or devices which
         unduly excite fear of dependence upon relatives or
         charity are unacceptable. Phrases or devices which imply
         that long sicknesses or hospital stays are common among
         the elderly are unacceptable.

     u)  An advertisement which is an invitation to contract
         implying that the coverage is supplemental to Medicare,
         if it does not explain the manner in which it is
         supplemental to Medicare coverage, is not acceptable.

     v)  An advertisement which is an invitation to contract for
         Medicare supplement insurance is unacceptable if the
         advertisement:

          1)  Fails to disclose in clear language which of the
              Medicare benefits the policy is not designed to
              supplement or if it otherwise implies that Medicare
              provides only those benefits which the policy is
              designed to supplement;

          2)  Describes the in-patient hospital coverage of
              Medicare as "Medicare hospital," or "Medicare Part
              A" when the policy does not supplement the
              non-hospital or the psychiatric hospital benefits
              of Medicare Part A;

          3)  Fails to describe clearly the operation of the Part
              or Parts of Medicare which the policy is designed
              to supplement; or

          4)  Describes those Medicare benfits not supplemented
              by the policy in such a way as to minimize their
              importance relative to the Medicare benefits which
              are supplemented.

     w)  Advertisements which indicate that a particular coverage
         or policy is exclusively for "preferred risks" or a
         particular segment of the population, or that particular
         segments of the population are acceptable risks, when
         such distinctions are not maintained in the issuance of
         policies, are not acceptable.

     x)  Any advertisement which contains statements such as
         "anyone can apply," or "anyone can join," other than
         with respect to a guaranteed issue policy for which
         administrative procedures exist to assure that the
         policy is issued within a reasonable period of time
         after the application is received by the insurer, is
         unacceptable.

     y)  Any advertisement which uses any phrase or term such as
         "here is all you do to apply," "simply," or "merely" to
         refer to the act of applying for a policy which is not a
         quaranteed issue policy is unacceptable unless it refers
         to the fact that the application is subject to
         acceptance or approval by the insurer.

     z)  Advertisements which state or imply that premiums will
         not be changed in the future are not acceptable unless
         the advertised policies so provide.

     aa) An advertisement which does not require the premium to
         accompany the application must not overemphasize that
         fact and must make the effective date of the coverage
         clear.

     bb) An advertisement which is an invitation to contract
         which fails to disclose the amount of any deductible
         and/or the percentage of any co-insurance factor is not
         acceptable.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION H  Guideline to Section 2010.60(a)(2)
 
This Section recognizes that certain words and phrases in
advertising may have a tendency to mislead the public as to the
extent of benefits under an advertised policy.  Consequently,
such terms (and those specified in this Part do not represent a
comprehensive list but only examples) must be used with caution
to avoid any tendency to exaggerate benefits and must not be used
unless the statement is literally true in every instance.  The
use of the following phrases based on such terms or having the
same effect must be similarly restricted:  "pays hospital,
surgical, etc., bills," "pays dollars to offset the cost of
medical care," "safeguards your standard of living," "pays full
coverage," "pays complete coverage," or "pays for financial
needs."  Other phrases may or may not be acceptable depending
upon the nature of the coverage being advertised.
This Section also prohibits words or phrases which exaggerate the
effect of benefit payment on the insured's general well-being,
such as "worry-free savings plan," "guaranteed savings,"
"financial peace of mind," and "you will never have to worry
about hospital bills again."

Advertisements which are an invitation to contract for policies
designed to supplement Medicare benefits are unacceptable if they
fail to disclose that no hospital confinement benefits will be
payable for that portion of a Medicare benefit period for which
Medicare pays all hospital confinement expenses (currently sixty
days) other than the initial deductible if the policy so
provides.  The length of said period must be stated in days.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION I  Guideline to Section 2010.60(a)(4)
 
Explanations must not minimize nor describe restrictive
provisions in a positive manner.  Negative features must be
accurately set forth.  Any limitation on benefits precluding
preexisting conditions must also be restated under a caption
concerning exclusions or limitations, notwithstanding that the
preexisting condition exclusion has been disclosed elsewhere in
the advertisement.  (See Illustration L for additional comments
on preexisting conditions.)

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION J  Guideline to Section 2010.60(a)(5)
 
This Section should be applied in conjunction with Section
2010.110.  Phrases such as "we cut cost to the bone" or "we deal
direct with you so our costs are lower" shall not be used.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION K  Guideline to Section 2010.60(b)(1)
 
An advertisement which is an invitation to contract as defined in
Section 2010.30(j) must recite the exceptions, reductions and
limitations as required by this Section and in a manner consisten
with Section 2010.40.

If an exception, reduction or limitation is important enough to
use in a policy, it is of sufficient importance that its
existence in the policy must be referred to in the advertisement.

Some advertisements disclose exceptions, reductions and
limitations as required, but the advertisement is so lengthy that
it obscures the disclosure.  Where the length of an advertisement
has this effect, special emphasis must be given by changing the
format to show the restrictions in a manner which does not
minimize, render obscure or otherwise make them appear
unimportant.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION L  Guideline to Section 2010.60(c)(1)
 
This Section implements the objective of Section 2010.60(a)(4) by
requiring in negative terms a description of the effect of a
preexisting condition exclusion because such a exclusion is a
restriction on coverage.  The Section also prohibits the use of
the phrase "preexisting condition" without an appropriate
definition or description of the term and prohibits stating a
reduction in the statutory time limit as an affirmative benefit.
The words "appropriate definition or description" means that the
term "preexisting condition" must be defined as it is used by the
company's claims department.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION M  Guideline to Section 2010.60(c)(2)
 
The phrase "no health questions" or words of similar import shall
not be used if the policy excludes preexisting conditions.

Use of a phrase such as "guaranteed issue," or " automatic
issues," if the policy excludes preexisting conditions for a
certain period, must be accompanied by a statement disclosing
that fact in a manner which does not minimize, render obscure or
otherwise make it appear unimportant and is otherwise consistent
with Section 2010.40.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION N  Guideline to Section 2010.70
 
Advertisements of cancellable Medicare supplement policies must
state that the contract is concellable or renewable at the option
of the company as the case may be.  With respect to
noncancellable policies and guaranteed renewable policies, the
policy provisions, with respect to renewability, must be set
forth and defined where appropriate.

This Section also requires a statement of the qualifying
conditions which constitute limitations on the permanent nature
of the coverage.  These customarily fall into three
categories:  1) age limits, 2) reservation of a right to increase
premiums, and 3) the establishment of aggregate limits.  For
example, "noncancellable and guaranteed renewable" does not
fulfill the requirements of this Section if the policy contains a
terminal age.  In such a case, a proper statement would be
"Noncancellable and guaranteed renewable to age         ."  If a
guaranteed renewable policy reserves the right to increase
premiums, the statement must be expanded into language similar to
"guaranteed renewable to age         , but the company reserves
the right to increase premium rates on a class basis."  If the
contract contains an aggregate limit after which no further
benefits are payable, the above statement must be amplified with
the phrase "subject to a maximum aggregate amount of $50,000" or
similar language.  A Medicare supplement insurance policy may
have one or more of the three basic limitations and an
advertisement must describe each of those which the policy
contains.  Over fifty percent of new individual policy issues are
guaranteed renewable; therefor, the fact that a policy is
guaranteed renewable shall not be exaggerated.

An advertisement for a Medicare supplement insurance policy which
provides for age step-rated premium rates based upon the policy
year or the insured's attained age must disclose such rate
increases and the times or ages at which such premium increases.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION O  Guideline to Section 2010.80
 
This Section must be applied in conjunction with Section 2010.90
and requires that all such statements must be genuine and not
fictitious.  The manufacturing, substantive editing or "doctoring
up" of a testimonial is clearly prohibited as being false and
misleading to the insurance-buying public.  However, language
which would be unacceptable under this Part must be edited out of
a testimonial.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION P  Guideline to Section 2010.80(c)
 
The rule requires that both approval or endorsement of a policy
by an individual, group of individuals, society, association, or
other organization be factual and that any proprietary
relationship between the sponsoring or endorsing organization and
the insurer be disclosed.  For example, if the dividend under an
association group case is payable to the association, disclosure
of that fact is required.  Also, if the insurer or an officer of
the insurer formed or controls the association, that fact must be
disclosed.  This guideline also applies to Section 2010.80(e).
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION Q  Guideline to Section 2010.90(a)
 
An advertisement shall specifically identify the Medicare
supplement insurance policy to which statistics relate and, where
statistics are given which are applicable to a different policy,
it must be stated clearly that the data does not relate to the
policy being advertised.

An advertisement which states the dollar amount of claims paid
must also indicate the period over which such claims have been
paid.

If the term "loss ratio" is used, it shall be properly explained
in the context of the advertisement and, unless the state has
issued a regulation otherwise defining the term, it shall be
calculated on the basis of premium earned to losses incurred and
shall not be on a yearly run-off basis.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION R  Guideline to Section 2010.90(c)
 
This Section does not require the statistics for this State be
used since such statistics as hospital charges and average stays
may vary from state to state.  When nationwide statistics are
used, such fact should be noted, unless the statistics on the
particular point are substantially the same in a state to which
the advertisement is directed.  Statistics may only be used if
they are current and credible.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION S  Guideline to Section 2010.100
 
This Section prohibits disaraging, unfair or incomplete
comparisons of policies or benefits which would have a tendency
to deceive or mislead the public.  The Section does not preclude
the use of comparisons by health maintenance organizations,
prepaid health plans and other direct service organizations which
describe the difference between their prepaid health benefits
coverage and indemnity insurance coverage.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION T  Guideline to Section 2010.110(a)
 
This Section prohibits advertisements which imply that an insurer
is licensed beyond the limits of those jurisdictions where it is
actually licensed.  An advertisement which contains testimonials
from persons who reside in a state in which the insurer is not
licensed or which referes to claims of persons residing in states
in which the insurer is not licensed implies licensing in those
states; and, therefore, is in violation of this Section unless
the advertisement states that the insurer is not licensed in
those states.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION U  Guideline to Section 2010.110(b)

Although this Section permits a reference to an insurer being
licensed in a state where the advertisement appears, it does not
allow exaggeration of the fact of such licensing nor does it
permit the suggestion that competing insurers may not be so
licensed because, in most states, an insurer must be licensed in
in the state to which it directs its advertisting.

Terms such as "official," or words of similar import, used to
describe any policy or application form are not permissible
because of the potential for deceiving or misleading the public.
This guideline also applies to Section 2010.110(c).
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION V  Guideline to Section 2010.140(a)
 
This Section prohibits advertising representing that a product is
offered on an introductory, initial or special offer basis or
otherwise which will not be available later; or is available only
to certain individuals, unless such is the fact.  This Section
prohibits the repetitive use of such advertisements.  Where an
insurer uses enrollment periods as the usual method of
advertising these policies, this Section prohibits describing an
enrollment period as a special opportunity or offer for the
applicant.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION W  Guideline to Section 2010.140(b)

This Section restricts the repetitive use of enrollment periods.
The requirement of reasonable closing dates and waiting periods
between enrollment periods was adopted to eliminate the abuses
which formerly existed.  This Section does not limit just the use
of enrollment periods.  It requires that a particular insurance
product offered in an enrollment period through any advertising
media, including the prepared presentations of agents, cannot be
offered again in the State until 6 months from the close of the
enrollment period.  Thus, an insurer must choose whether to use
enrollment periods or open enrollment for a product.  (See
Section 2010.140(d) for the definition of "a particular insurane
product.")

This Section does not prohibit multiple advertising during an
enrollment period through any and all media published or
transmitted within this State as long as the enrollment periods
for all such advertisements have the same expiration date.

This Section does not prohibit the solicitation of members of a
group or association for the same product even though there has
not been a lapse of 6 months since the close of a preceding
enrollment period which was open to the general public for the
same product.

This Section does not require separation by 6 months of
enrollment periods for the same insurance product in this State
if the advertising material is directed by an admitted insurer to
persons by direct mail on the basis that a common relationship
exists with an entity.  Examples of such would be a bank and its
depositors, a department store to its charge account customers,
or an oil company to its credit card holders, and more than one
of such insurance product at different times if providing such
insurance under such a method is not otherwise prohibited by law.
However, the 6 month rule does apply to one specific sponsor to
the same persons in this State on the basis of their status as
customers of that one specific entity only.

 
Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION X  Guideline to Section 2010.140(d)
 
This Section defines the meaning of "a particular insurance
product" in Section 2010.140(b) and probhibits advertising of
products having minor variances such as different periods or
different amounts of daily hospital indemnity benefits, in a
succession of enrollment periods.
 

Section 2010.ILLUSTRATION Y  Guideline to Section 2010.150
 
This Section is closely related to the requirements of Section
2010.90 concerning the use of statistics.  This Section prohibits
insurers which have been organized for only a brief period of
time advertising that they are "old" and also prohibits
emphasizing the size and magnitude of the insurer.  Also, the
occupations of the persons comprising the insurer's board of
directors or the public's familiarity with their names or
reputations is irrelevant and must not be emphasized.  The
preponderance of a particular occupation or profession among the
board of directors of an insurer does not justify the
advertisement of a plan of insurance offered to the general
public as insurance designed or recommended by members of that
occupation or profession.  For example, it is unacceptable for an
insurance company to advertise a policy offered to the general
public as "the physicians' policy" or "the doctors' plan" simply
because there is a preponderance of physicians or doctors on the
board of directors of the insurer.  This Section prohibits the
use of recommendation of a commercial rating system unless the
purpose, meaning and limitations of the recommendation are
clearly indicated.

Section 2011.10  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Part is to assure the orderly implementation
and conversion of medicare supplement insurance benefits and
premiums due to changes in the federal Medicare program; to
provide for the reasonable standardization of the coverage, terms
and benefits of medicare supplement policies or contracts; to
facilitate public understanding of such policies or contracts; to
eliminate provisions contained in such policies or contracts
which may be misleading or confusing in connection with the
purchase of such policies or contracts; to eliminate policy or
contract provisions which may duplicate Medicare benefits; to
provide for adjustment of required minimum benefits for Medicare
supplement policies; to provide notice to former policyholders to
offer to reinstitute coverage; to provide full disclosure of
policy or contract benefits and benefit changes; and to provide
for refunds of premiums associated with benefits duplicating
Medicare program benefits.

         6, 1995) 

 
Section 2011.20  Applicability and Scope
 
This Part shall take precedence over other rules and requirements
relating to medicare supplement policies (50 Ill. Adm. Code 2008)
only to the extent necessary to assure that benefits are not
duplicated and to adjust minimum required benefits to changes in
Medicare benefits, that applicants receive adequate notice and
disclosure of changes in medicare supplement policies and
contracts, that appropriate premium adjustments are made in a
timely manner, and that premiums are reasonable in relation to
benefits.  Except as otherwise provided, this Part shall apply
to:

     a)  All medicare supplement policies delivered, or issued
         for delivery, or which are otherwise subject to the
         jurisdiction of this state on or after the effective

     b)  All certificates issued under group medicare supplement
         policies as provided in subsection (a) above.

          4)  Upon exhaustion of all Medicare hospital inpatient
              coverage including the lifetime reserve days,
              coverage of ninety percent of all Medicare Part A
              eligible expenses for hospitalization not covered
              by Medicare subject to a lifetime maximum benefit
              of an additional 365 days;

          5)  Coverage under Medicare Part A (see 42 CFR
              409.87(b), 1989, no subsequent dates or editions)
              for the reasonable cost of the first three (3)
              pints of blood (or equivalent quantities of packed
              red blood cells, as defined under federal
              regulations (see 42 CFR 409.87(a), 1989, no
              subsequent dates or editions,) unless replaced in

              regulations (see 42 CFR 409.87(b), 1989, no
              subsequent dates or editions) or already paid for
              under Part A, subject to the Medicare deductible
              amounts.

     d)  General Requirements

          1)  Notification

               A)  No later than January 31, 1990, every insurer
                   providing Medicare supplement insurance or
                   benefits to a resident of this State shall
                   notify its policyholders, contract holders and
                   certificateholders of modifications it has
                   made to Medicare supplement insurance policies
                   or contracts. Such notice shall be in the
                   format shown in 2011. Appendix A.

               B)  Such notice shall include a description of
                   revisions to the medicare program and a
                   description of each modification to the
                   coverage provided under the medicare supplement
                   insurance policy.

               C)  The notice shall inform each covered person as
                   to when any premium adjustment due to changes
                   in Medicare benefits will be made.

               D)  Such notice shall not contain or be
                   accompanied by any solicitation.

          2)  No modifications to an existing medicare supplement
              contract or policy shall be made at the time of or
              in connection with the notice requirements of this
              regulation except to the extent necessary to
              eliminate duplication of medicare benefits and any
              modifications necessary under the policy to provide
              for automatic changes in the annual Part A Medicare
              deductible amounts.

          3)  As soon as practicable, but no longer than
              forty-five (45) days after the effective date of
              the Medicare benefit changes and prior to use,
              every insurer providing Medicare supplement
              insurance or contracts in this State shall file
              with the Department, in accordance with the
              applicable filing procedures of this State (see 50
              Ill. Adm. Code 916):

               A)  Appropriate premium adjustments necessary to
                   produce loss ratios as originally anticipated
                   for the applicable policies or contracts. Such
                   supporting documents as necessary to justify
                   the adjustment shall accompany the filing.
                   Such supporting documents shall include
                   incurred claims and earned premium data as set
                   out in Section 363a of the Illinois Insurance
                   Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par. 975a)
                   and 50 Ill. Adm. Code 2008.80, and any other
                   information deemed relevant by the insurer.

                   Agency Note:  This subsection is not intended
                   to require a return of premium in cases in
                   which a higher loss ratio is actually achieved
                   than was originally anticipated. It is only
                   intended that premium adjustments shall be
                   made based on an anticipated loss ratio which
                   falls below that which was originally filed.
                   Adjustments should be sufficient to generate
                   an anticipated loss ratio as originally filed.

               B)  Any riders, endorsements or policy forms
                   needed to accomplish the Medicare supplement
                   insurance modifications necessary to eliminate
                   benefit duplications with Medicare and to
                   provide the benefits required by Section
                   2008.40. Any such riders, endorsements or
                   policy forms shall provide a clear description
                   of the medicare supplement benefits provided
                   by the policy or contract.

          4)  Upon satisfying the filing and approval
              requirements of this state, every insurer providing
              Medicare supplement insurance in this State, shall
              provide each covered person with any rider,
              endorsement or policy form necessary to make the
              adjustments outlined in Section 2011.40(d).

          5)  Any premium adjustments shall produce an expected
              loss ratio under such policy or contract as will
              conform with minimum loss ratio standards for
              Medicare supplement policies and shall result in an
              expected loss ratio at least as great as that
              originally anticipated by the insurer for such
              Medicare supplement insurance policies (see 50 Ill.

                   which terms are at least as favorable to the
                   policyholder or certificate holder as the
                   premium classification terms that would have
                   applied to the policyholder or certificate
                   holder had the coverage never terminated.

     b)  An insurer is not required to make the offer under

                         except for credit unions, the association or
                         associations collect dues or solicit contributions
                         from members; and

                         the members have voting privileges and
                         representation on the governing board and
                         committees.

                   Thirty days after such filing the association or
                   associations will be deemed to satisfy such
                   organizational requirements, unless the Director makes a
                   finding that the association or associations do not
                   satisfy those organizational requirements.

                   A group other than as described in subparagraphs under
                   the definition of Group Long-Term Care Insurance,
                   subject to a finding by the Director that:

                         The issuance of the group policy is not contrary
                         to the best interest of the public;

                         The issuance of the group policy would result in
                         economies of acquisition or administration; and

                         The benefits are reasonable in relation to the
                         premiums charged.

                   The standards to be used by the Director for determining
                   whether a group is eligible shall include, but not be
                   limited to:  the policy shall not contain broad or
                   misleading exclusions; premiums for group policies are
                   less than premiums for individual policies; and the loss
                   ratio complies with the requirements of Section
                   2012.110.

         nonprofit health, hospital, and medical service corporations;
         prepaid health plans; health maintenance organizations or any
         similar organization.

         Policy as defined in Section 351A-1 of the Illinois Insurance Code
         (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 963A-1) [215 ILCS 5/351A-1]
         means any policy, contract, subscriber agreement, rider or

         insurer, fraternal benefit society, non-profit health, hospital,
         or medical service corporation, prepaid health plan, health
         maintenance organization or any similar organization.

         Traditional Long-Term Care Insurance as defined in Section 351A-1
         of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par.
         963A-1) [215 ILCS 5/351A-1] means any accident and health
         insurance policy or rider advertised, marketed, offered or
         designed to provide coverage for not less than 12 consecutive

         prepaid or other basis for one or more necessary or medically
         necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative,
         maintenance, or personal care services, provided in a setting
         other than an acute care unit of a hospital.  Such term includes
         group and individual life insurance policies or riders which
         provide directly or which supplement long-term care insurance.
         Such term also includes a policy or rider which provides for
         payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of
         function capacity. Long-term care insurance may be issued by
         insurers; fraternal benefit societies; nonprofit health, hospital,
         and medical service corporations; prepaid health plans; health
         maintenance organizations or any similar organization, to the
         extent they are otherwise authorized to issue life or health
         insurance. Long-term care insurance shall not include any
         insurance policy which is offered primarily to provide basic
         Medicare supplement coverage, basic hospital expense coverage,
         basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement
         indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability

         denomination that teaches reliance on spiritual treatment through
         prayer for healing.

Section 2012.50  Policy Practices and Provisions
 
     a)  Renewability. The terms "guaranteed renewable" and
         "noncancellable" shall not be used in any group and individual
         direct response or individual long-term care insurance policy or
         certificate without explanatory language in accordance with the
         disclosure requirements of Section 2012.70 of this Part.

          1)  No such policy or certificate issued to an individual shall
              contain renewal provisions less favorable to the insured than
              "guaranteed renewable."

          2)  The term "guaranteed renewable" may be used only when the
              insured has the right to continue the long-term care
              insurance in force by the timely payment of premiums and when
              the insurer has no unilateral right to make any change in any
              provision of the policy or rider while the insurance is in
              force, and cannot decline to renew, except that rates may be
              revised by the insurer on a class basis.

          3)  The term "noncancellable" may be used only when the insured
              has the right to continue the long-term care insurance in
              force by the timely payment of premiums during which period
              the insurer has no right to unilaterally make any change in
              any provision of the insurance or in the premium rate.

     b)  Limitations and Exclusions. No policy may be delivered or issued
         for delivery in this State as long-term care insurance if such
         policy limits or excludes coverage by type of illness, treatment,
         medical condition or accident, except as follows:

          1)  Preexisting conditions or diseases;

          2)  Mental or nervous disorders; however, this shall not permit
              exclusion or limitation of benefits on the basis of
              Alzheimer's Disease or senile dementia;

          3)  Alcoholism and drug addiction;

          4)  Illness, treatment or medical condition arising out of:

               A)  war or act of war (whether declared or undeclared);

               B)  participation in a felony, riot or insurrection;

               C)  service in the armed forces or units auxiliary thereto;

               D)  suicide (sane or insane), attempted suicide or
                   intentionally self-inflicted injury; or

               E)  aviation (this exclusion applies only to non-fare paying
                   passengers);

          5)  Treatment provided in a government facility (unless otherwise
              required by law), services for which benefits are available
              under Medicare or other governmental program (except
              Medicaid), any state or federal workers' compensation,
              employer's liability or occupational disease law, or any
              motor vehicle no-fault law, services provided by a member of
              the covered person's immediate family and services for which
              no charge is normally made in the absence of insurance.

          6)  This subsection (b) is not intended to prohibit exclusions
              and limitations for payment of services provided outside the
              United States.

     c)  Extension of Benefits. Termination of long-term care insurance
         shall be without prejudice to any benefits payable for
         institutionalization if such institutionalization began while the
         long-term care insurance was in force and continues without
         interruption after termination. Such extension of benefits beyond
         the period the long-term care insurance was in force may be
         limited to the duration of the benefit period, if any, or to
         payment of the maximum benefits and may be subject to any policy
         waiting period, and all other applicable provisions of the policy.

     d)  Continuation or Conversion

          1)  Group long-term care insurance issued in this state on or
              after the effective date of this Section shall provide
              covered individuals with a basis for continuation or
              conversion of coverage.

          2)  For the purposes of this Section, "a basis for continuation
              of coverage" means a policy provision which maintains
              coverage under the existing group policy when such coverage
              would otherwise terminate and which is subject only to the
              continued timely payment of premium when due. Group policies
              which restrict provision of benefits and services to, or
              contain incentives to use certain providers and/or facilities
              may provide continuation benefits which are substantially
              equivalent to the benefits of the existing group policy. The
              Director, in making a determination as to the substantial
              equivalency of benefits, shall take into consideration the
              differences between managed care and non-managed care plans,
              including, but not limited to, provider system arrangements,
              service availability, benefit levels and administrative
              complexity.

          3)  For the purposes of this Section, "a basis for conversion of
              coverage" means a policy provision that an individual whose
              coverage under the group policy would otherwise terminate or
              has been terminated for any reason, including discontinuance
              of the group policy in its entirety or with respect to an
              insured class, and who has been continuously insured under
              the group policy (and any group policy which it replaced),
              for at least six months immediately prior to termination,
              shall be entitled to the issuance of a converted policy by
              the insurer under whose group policy the individual is
              covered, without evidence of insurability.

          4)  For the purposes of this Section, "converted policy" means an
              individual policy of long-term care insurance providing
              benefits identical to or substantially equivalent to or in
              excess of those provided under the group policy from which
              conversion is made. Where the group policy from which
              conversion is made restricts the provision of benefits and
              services, or contains incentives to use certain providers
              and/or facilities, the Director, in making a determination as
              to the substantial equivalency of benefits, shall take into
              consideration the differences between managed care and
              non-managed care plans, including, but not limited to,
              provider system arrangements, service availability, benefit
              levels and administrative complexity.

          5)  Written application for the converted policy shall be made
              and the first premium due, if any, shall be paid as directed
              by the insurer not later than thirty-one days after
              termination of coverage under the group policy.  The
              converted policy shall be issued effective on the day
              following the termination of coverage under the group policy,
              and shall be guaranteed renewable.

          6)  Unless the group policy from which conversion is made
              replaced previous group coverage, the premium for the
              converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the
              insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy
              from which conversion is made. Where the group policy from
              which conversion is made replaced previous group coverage,
              the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on
              the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under
              the group policy replaced.

          7)  Continuation of coverage or issuance of a converted policy
              shall be mandatory, except where:

               A)  Termination of group coverage resulted from an
                   individual's failure to make any required payment of
                   premium or contribution when due; or

               B)  The terminating coverage is replaced not later than
                   thirty-one days after termination, by group coverage
                   effective on the day following the termination of
                   coverage:

                    i)   Providing benefits identical to or benefits
                         equivalent in design and actuarially equivalent in
                         value in excess of those provided by the
                         terminating coverage; and

                    ii)  The premium for which is calculated in a manner
                         consistent with the requirements of subsection
                         (d)(6) of this Section.

          8)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a
              converted policy issued to an individual who at the time of
              conversion is covered by another long-term care insurance
              policy which provides benefits on the basis of incurred
              expenses, may contain a provision which results in a
              reduction of benefits payable if the benefits provided under
              the additional coverage, together with the full benefits
              provided by the converted policy, would result in payment of
              more than 100 percent of incurred expenses. Such provision
              shall only be included in the converted policy if the
              converted policy also provides for a premium decrease or
              refund which reflects the reduction in benefits payable.

          9)  The converted policy may provide that the benefits payable
              under the converted policy, together with the benefits
              payable under the group policy from which conversion is made,
              shall not exceed those that would have been payable had the
              individual's coverage under the group policy remained in
              force and effect.

          10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any
              insured individual whose eligibility for group long-term care
              coverage is based upon his or her relationship to another
              person, shall be entitled to continuation of coverage under
              the group policy upon termination of the qualifying
              relationship by death or dissolution of marriage.

          11) For the purposes of this Section:  a "Managed-Care Plan" is a
              health care or assisted living arrangement designed to
              coordinate patient care or control costs through utilization
              review, case management or use of specific provider networks.

     e)  Discontinuance and Replacement

         If a group long-term care policy is replaced by another group
         long-term care policy issued to the same policyholder, the
         succeeding insurer shall offer coverage to all persons covered
         under the previous group policy on its date of termination.
         Coverage provided or offered to individuals by the insurer and
         premiums charged to persons under the new group policy:

          1)  Shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions
              that would have been covered under the group policy being
              replaced; and

          2)  Shall not vary or otherwise depend on the individual's health
              or disability status, claim experience or use of long-term
              care services.

     f)  The premiums charged to an insured for long-term care insurance
         shall not increase due to either:

          1)  The increasing age of the insured at ages beyond sixty-five
              (65); or

          2)  The duration the insured has been covered under the policy.

     g)  No long-term care insurance policy shall:

          1)  be cancelled, nonrenewed or otherwise terminated on grounds
              of the age or deterioration of the mental or physical health
              of the insured individual or certificateholder;

          2)  contain a provision establishing a new waiting period in the
              event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new
              or other form within the same company, except with respect to
              an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured
              individual or group policyholder;

          3)  provide coverage for skilled nursing care only or provide
              significantly more coverage for skilled care in a facility
              than coverage for lower levels of care.

Section 2012.55  Unintentional Lapse
 
Each insurer offering long-term care insurance shall, as a protection
against unintentional lapse, comply with the following:

     a)  Notice before lapse or termination.

          1)  No individual long-term care policy or certificate shall be
              issued until the insurer has received from the applicant a
              written designation of at least one person, in addition to
              the applicant, who is to receive notice of lapse or
              termination of the policy or certificate for nonpayment of
              premium; or a written waiver dated and signed by the
              applicant electing not to designate additional persons to
              receive notice.  The applicant has the right to designate at
              least one person who is to receive the notice of termination,
              in addition to the insured.  Designation shall not constitute
              acceptance of any liability on the third party for services
              provided to the insured.  The form used for the written
              designation shall provide space designated for listing at
              least one person.  The designation shall include each
              person's full name and home address.  In the case of an
              applicant who elects not to designate an additional person,
              the waiver shall state:  "Protection against unintended
              lapse.  I understand that I have the right to designate at
              least one person other than myself to receive notice of lapse
              or termination of this long-term care insurance policy for
              nonpayment of premium.  I understand that notice will not be
              given until thirty (30) days after a premium is due and
              unpaid.  I elect NOT to designate any person to receive such
              notice."  The insurer shall also notify the insured of the
              right to change this written designation, no less often then
              once every two (2) years.

          2)  When the policyholder or certificateholder pays premium for a
              long-term care insurance policy or certificate through a
              payroll or pension deduction plan, the requirements contained
              in subsection (a)(1) above need not be met until sixty (60)
              days after the policyholder or certificateholder is no longer
              on such a payment plan.  The application or enrollment form
              for such policies or certificates shall indicate the payment
              plan selected by the applicant.

          3)  Lapse or termination for nonpayment of premium.  No
              individual long-term care policy or certificate shall lapse
              or be terminated for nonpayment of premium unless the
              insurer, at least thirty (30) days before the effective date
              of the lapse or termination, has given notice to the insured
              and to those persons designated pursuant to subsection (a)(1)
              above, at the address provided by the insured for purposes of
              receiving notice of lapse or termination.  Notice shall be
              given by first class United States mail, postage prepaid; and
              notice shall not be given until thirty (30) days after a
              premium is due and unpaid.  Notice shall be deemed to have
              been given as of five (5) days after the date of mailing.

     b)  In addition to the requirements of subsection (a) above, a
         long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall include a
         provision which provides for reinstatement of coverage, in the
         event of lapse if the insurer is provided proof of cognitive
         impairment, the loss of functional capacity or if the insured
         would otherwise qualify for benefits under the contract.  This
         option shall be available to the insured if requested within five
         (5) months after termination and shall allow for the collection of
         past due premium.  The standard of proof of cognitive impairment
         or loss of functional capacity shall not be more stringent than
         the benefit eligibility criteria contained in the policy and
         certificate.

Section 2012.60  Required Disclosure Provisions
 
     a)  Renewability. Individual long-term care insurance policies shall
         contain a renewability provision. Such provision shall be
         captioned as a Renewal, shall appear on the first page of the
         policy, and shall clearly state the duration, where limited, of
         renewability and the duration of the term of coverage for which
         the policy is issued and of which it may be renewed. This
         provision shall not apply to policies which do not contain a
         renewability provision and under which the right to renew is
         reserved solely to the policyholder.

     b)  Riders and Endorsements. Except for riders or endorsements by
         which the insurer effectuates a request made in writing by the
         insured under  an individual long-term care insurance policy, all
         riders or endorsements added to an individual long-term care
         insurance policy after date of issue or at reinstatement or
         renewal which reduce or eliminate benefits or coverage in the
         policy shall require signed acceptance by the individual insured.
         After the date of policy issue, any rider or endorsement which
         increases benefits or coverage with a concomitant increase in
         premium during the policy term must be agreed to in writing signed
         by the insured, except if the increased benefits or coverage are
         required by law. Where a separate additional premium is charged
         for benefits provided in connection with riders or endorsements,
         such premium charge shall be set forth in the policy, rider or
         endorsement.

     c)  Payment of Benefits. A long-term care insurance policy or
         certificate which provides for the payment of benefits based on
         standards described as "usual and customary," "reasonable and
         customary" or words of similar import shall include a definition
         of such terms and an explanation of such terms in its accompanying
         outline of coverage.

     d)  Preexisting Conditions:  If a long-term care insurance policy or
         certificate contains any limitations with respect to preexisting
         conditions, such limitations shall appear as a separate paragraph
         of the policy or certificate and shall be labeled "Preexisting
         Condition Limitations." Limitations to preexisting conditions
         shall be in accordance with Section 351A-5 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 963A-5) [215
         ILCS 5/351A-5].

     e)  Other Limitations or Conditions on Eligibility for Benefits. In
         addition to complying with Section 351A-6 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code, beginning August 30, 1990, a long-term care
         insurance policy or certificate containing any limitations or
         conditions for eligibility other than those prohibited in Section
         351A-6 shall set forth a description of such limitations or
         conditions, including any required number of days of confinement
         in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate and shall
         label such paragraph "Limitations or Conditions on Eligibility for
         Benefits."

     f)  Disclosure Requirements for Accelerated Life Products

          1)  Policy Summary

              At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary shall be
              delivered for an individual life insurance policy which
              provides long-term care benefits within the policy or by
              rider.  In the case of direct response solicitations, the
              insurer shall deliver the policy summary upon the applicant's
              request, but regardless of request shall make such delivery
              no later than at the time of policy delivery.  In addition to
              complying with all applicable requirements, the summary shall
              also include:

               A)  an explanation of how the long-term care benefit
                   interacts with other components of the policy, including
                   deductions from death benefits;

               B)  an illustration of the amount of benefits, the length of
                   benefit, and the guaranteed lifetime benefits if any,
                   for each covered person;

               C)  any exclusion, reductions and limitations on benefits of
                   long-term care; and

               D)  if applicable to the policy type, the summary shall also
                   include:

                    i)   disclosure of the effects of exercising other
                         rights under the policy;

                    ii)  disclosure of guarantees related to long-term care
                         costs of insurance charges; and

                    iii) current and projected maximum lifetime benefits.

          2)  Benefit Reports

              Any time a long-term care benefit, funded through a life
              insurance vehicle by the acceleration of the death benefit,
              is in benefit payment status, a monthly report shall be
              provided to the policyholder.  Such report shall include:

               A)  any long-term care benefits paid during the month;

               B)  an explanation of any changes in the policy, including
                   changes in death benefits or cash values, due to
                   long-term care benefits being paid out; and

               C)  the amount of long-term care benefits existing or
                   remaining.

          3)  Outline of Coverage

              The Outline of Coverage should include an example filled out
              in John Doe form which illustrates how the long-term care
              benefit is calculated.  Refer to Section 2012.110 and Exhibit
              C for format and content requirements.

Section 2012.65  Prohibition Against Post Claims Underwriting

     a)  All applications for long-term care insurance policies or
         certificates except those which are guaranteed issue shall contain
         unambiguous questions designed to ascertain the health condition
         of the applicant.

          1)  If an application for long-term care insurance contains a
              question which asks whether the applicant has had medication
              prescribed by a physician, it must also ask the applicant to
              list the medication that has been prescribed.

          2)  If the medications listed in such application were known by
              the insurer, or were included in the insurers underwriting
              standards at the time of application, to be directly related
              to a medical condition for which coverage would otherwise be
              denied, then the policy or certificate shall not be rescinded
              for that condition.

     b)  Except for policies or certificates which are guaranteed issue:

          1)  The following language shall be set out in bold face type on
              the same page as the applicant's signature block on an

              certificate:

              Caution:  If your answers on this application are incorrect
              or untrue, [company] may have the right to deny benefits or
              rescind your policy.

          2)  The following language shall be set out on the long-term care
              insurance policy or certificate at the time of delivery:
              Caution:  The issuance of this long-term care insurance
              [policy] [certificate] is based upon your responses to the
              questions on your application.  A copy of your [application]
              [enrollment form] [is enclosed] [was retained by you when you
              applied].  If your answers are incorrect or untrue, the
              company may have the right to deny benefits or rescind your
              policy.  The best time to clear up any questions is now,
              before a claim arises! If, for any reason, any of your
              answers are incorrect, contact the company at this
              address:  [insert address]

          3)  Prior to issuance of a long-term care policy or certificate
              to an applicant age eighty (80) or older, the insurer shall
              obtain one of the following:

     c)  A copy of the completed application or enrollment form (whichever
         is applicable) shall be delivered to the insured no later than at
         the time of delivery of the policy or certificate unless it was
         retained by the applicant at the time of application.

     d)  Every insurer, as defined herein, selling or issuing long-term
         care insurance benefits shall maintain a record of all policy or
         certificate rescissions, both State and countrywide, except those
         which the insured voluntarily effectuated and shall annually
         furnish this information to the Director of Insurance in the
         format prescribed in Exhibit D.

Section 2012.70  Minimum Standards for Home Health and Community Care Benefits in Long-Term Care Insurance Policies
 
     a)  A long-term care insurance policy or certificate may not, if it
         provides benefits for home health care services, limit or exclude
         benefits:

          1)  By requiring that the insured/claimant would need skilled
              care in a skilled nursing facility if home health care
              services were not provided;

          2)  By requiring that the insured/claimant first or
              simultaneously receive nursing  and/or therapeutic services
              in a home or community setting before home health care
              services are covered;

          3)  By limiting eligible services to services provided by
              registered nurses or licensed practical nurses;

          4)  By requiring that a nurse or therapist provide services
              covered by the policy that can be provided by a home health
              aide, or other licensed or certified home care worker acting
              within the scope of his or her licensure or certification;

          5)  By requiring that the insured/claimant have an acute
              condition before home health care services are covered;

          6)  By excluding coverage for personal care services provided by
              a home health aide;

          7)  By requiring that the provision of home health care services
              be at a level of certification or licensure greater than that
              required by the eligible service;

          8)  By limiting benefits to services provided by
              Medicare-certified agencies or providers;

          9)  By excluding coverage for adult day care services.

     b)  A long-term care insurance policy or certificate, if it provides
         for home health or community care services, shall provide total
         home health or community care coverage that is a dollar amount
         equivalent to at least one-half of one year's coverage available
         for nursing home benefits under the policy or certificate, at the
         time covered home health or community care services are being
         received.  This requirement shall not apply to policies or
         certificates issued to residents of continuing care retirement
         communities.

     c)  Home health care coverage may be applied to the nonhome health
         care benefits provided in the policy or certificate when
         determining maximum coverage under the terms of the policy or
         certificate.

Section 2012.80  Requirement to Offer Inflation Protection
 
     a)  No insurer may offer a long-term care insurance policy unless the
         insurer also offers to the policyholder in addition to any other
         inflation protection the option to purchase a policy that provides
         for benefit levels to increase with benefit maximums or reasonable
         durations which are meaningful to account for reasonably
         anticipated increases in the costs of long-term care services
         covered by the policy.  Insurers must offer to each policyholder,
         at the time of purchase,  the option to purchase a policy with an
         inflation protection feature no less favorable than one of the
         following:

          1)  Increases benefit levels annually (in a manner so that the
              increases are compounded annually at a rate not less than
              five percent (5%));

          2)  Guarantees the insured individual the right to periodically
              increase benefit levels without providing evidence of
              insurability or health status so long as the option for the
              previous period has not been declined.  The amount of the
              additional benefit shall be no less than the difference
              between the existing policy benefit and that benefit
              compounded annually at a rate of at least five percent (5%)
              for the period beginning with the purchase of the existing
              benefit and extending until the year in which the offer is
              made; or

          3)  Covers a specified percentage of actual or reasonable charges
              and does not include a maximum specified indemnity amount or
              limit.

     b)  Where the policy is issued to a group, the required offer in
         subsection (a) above shall be made to the group policyholder;
         except, if the policy is issued to a discretionary group other
         than to a continuing care retirement community, the offering shall
         be made to each proposed certificateholder.

     c)  The offer in subsection (a) above shall not be required of life
         insurance policies or riders containing accelerated long-term care
         benefits.

     d)  Insurers shall include the following information in or with the
         outline of coverage:

          1)  A graphic comparison of the benefit levels of a policy that
              increases benefits over the policy period with a policy that
              does not increase benefits.  The graphic comparison shall
              show benefit levels over at least a twenty (20) year period.

          2)  Any expected premium increases or additional premiums to pay
              for automatic or optional benefit increases.  If premium
              increases or additional premiums will be based on the
              attained age of the applicant at the time of the increase,
              the insurer shall also disclose the magnitude of the
              potential premiums the applicant would need to pay at ages 75
              and 85 for benefit increases.

          3)  An insurer may use a reasonable hypothetical or a graphic
              demonstration for the purposes of this disclosure.

     e)  Inflation protection benefit increases under a policy which
         contains such benefits shall continue without regard to an
         insured's age, claim status or claim history, or the length of
         time the person has been insured under the policy.

     f)  An offer of inflation protection which provides for automatic
         benefit increases shall include an offer of a premium which the
         insurer expects to remain constant.  Such offer shall disclose in
         bold face type that the premium may change in the future unless
         the premium is guaranteed to remain constant.

     g)  Inflation protection as provided in subsection (a)(1) of this
         Section shall be included in a long-term care insurance policy
         unless an insurer obtains a rejection of inflation protection
         signed by the policyholder as required hereunder.  The rejection
         shall be considered a part of the application and shall state, "I
         have reviewed the outline of coverage and the graphs that compare
         the benefits and premiums of this policy with and without
         inflation protection.  Specifically, I have reviewed plan(s)
                       , and I reject inflation protection.

Section 2012.90  Requirements for Application Forms and Replacement Coverage
 
     a)  Application forms shall include the following questions designed
         to elicit information as to whether, as of the date of the
         application, the applicant has another long-term care insurance
         policy or certificate in force or whether a long-term care policy
         or certificate is intended to replace any other accident and
         sickness or long-term care policy or certificate presently in
         force.  A supplementary application or other form to be signed by
         the applicant and agent, except where the coverage is sold without
         an agent, containing such questions may be used.  With regard to a
         replacement policy issued to a group defined by Section 2012.30 of
         this Part the following questions may be modified only to the
         extent necessary to elicit information about health or long-term
         care insurance policies other than the group policy being
         replaced; provided, however, that the certificateholder has been
         notified of the replacement.

          1)  Do you have another long-term care insurance policy or
              certificate in force (including health care service contract,
              health maintenance organization contract)?

          2)  Did you have another long-term care insurance policy or
              certificate in force during the last twelve (12) months?

in relation to premiums provided the lifetime anticipated loss ratio is at
least sixty percent, calculated on the basis of the ratio of the present

premiums over the entire period for which rates are computed to provide
coverage. In evaluating the lifetime anticipated loss ratio, consideration
shall be given to the following factors:

     a)  Statistical credibility of incurred claims experience based on the
         following factors:  claim rates, variability in transaction costs,
         and number of lives exposed.

     b)  The period for which rates are computed to provide coverage;

     (Source:  Added at 18 Ill. Reg. 2238, effective February 1, 1994) 

 
Section 2012.120  Reserve Standards
 
     a)  When long-term care benefits are provided through the acceleration
         of benefits under group and individual life policies or riders to
         such policies, policy reserves for such benefits shall be
         determined in accordance with Section 223 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 835) [215 ILCS
         5/223]. Claim reserves must also be established in the case when
         such policy or rider is in claim status (see 50 Ill. Adm. Code
         2004.40). Reserves for policies and riders subject to this
         subsection should be based on the multiple decrement model
         utilizing all relevant decrements except for voluntary termination
         rates.  Single decrement approximations are acceptable if the
         calculation produces reserves which differ from the reserves based
         on the multiple decrement approach by less than 5% for each
         combination of issue age and duration, or are greater than the
         reserves based on the multiple decrement approach, or if the
         reserves for this line of business are less than five percent (5%)
         of the statutory net worth of the company. The calculations may
         take into account the reduction in life insurance benefits due to
         the payment of long-term care benefits. However, in no event shall
         the reserves for the long-term care benefit and life insurance
         benefit be less than the reserves for the life insurance benefit
         assuming no long-term care benefit. In the development and
         calculation of reserves for policies and riders subject to this
         subsection, due regard shall be given to the applicable policy
         provisions, marketing methods, administrative procedures and all
         other considerations which have an impact on projected claim
         costs, including, but not limited to, the following:

          1)  Definition of insured events

          2)  Covered long term care facilities

          3)  Existence of home convalescence care coverage

          4)  Definition of facilities

          5)  Existence or absence of barriers to eligibility

          6)  Premium waiver provision

          7)  Renewability

          8)  Ability to raise premiums

          9)  Marketing method

          10) Underwriting procedures

          11) Claims adjustment procedures

          12) Waiting period

          13) Maximum benefit

          14) Availability of eligible facilities

          15) Margins in claim costs

          16) Optional nature of benefit

          17) Delay in eligibility for benefit

          18) Inflation protection provisions

          19) Guaranteed insurability option

     b)  The valuation morbidity table shall be accompanied by a statement
         declaring it as appropriate as a statutory valuation table by a
         member of the American Academy of Actuaries.

     c)  When long-term care benefits are provided other than as in
         subsection a) above, reserves shall be determined in accordance
         with Section 353a of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.
         1991, ch. 73, par. 965a) [215 ILCS 5/353a].

              WITH LONG-TERM CARE INCURRED BY THE BUYER DURING THE PERIOD
              OF COVERAGE.  THE BUYER IS ADVISED TO REVIEW CAREFULLY ALL
              POLICY LIMITATIONS."

          4)  Inquire of a prospective applicant or enrollee for
              traditional long-term care insurance whether they already
              have accident and sickness or traditional long-term care
              insurance and the types and amounts of any such insurance.

          5)  Every insurer or entity marketing traditional long-term care
              insurance shall establish auditable procedures for verifying

          6)  The insurer shall, at solicitation, provide written notice to
              the prospective policyholder and certificateholder of the
              Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP) that such a program is
              available and the most current name, address and telephone
              number of the program.  The current address and toll-free
              telephone number is 320 W. Washington Street, Springfield,
              Illinois 62767, 1-800-598-9034.

          7)  For traditional long-term care health insurance policies and
              certificates, use the terms "noncancellable" or "level
              premium" only when the policy or certificate conforms to this
              Part.

          8)  Traditional long-term care insurance policies or certificates
              sold after July 1, 1995 that are not under the Illinois
              Long-Term Care Partnership Program shall include a statement
              on the outline of coverage, the policy or certificate
              application, and the front page of the policy or certificate
              in bold type and in a separate box as follows:  "THIS POLICY
              (CERTIFICATE) IS NOT APPROVED FOR MEDICAID ASSET PROTECTION
              UNDER THE ILLINOIS LONG-TERM CARE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.
              HOWEVER, THIS POLICY (CERTIFICATE) IS AN APPROVED TRADITIONAL
              LONG-TERM CARE POLICY (CERTIFICATE) UNDER STATE INSURANCE
              REGULATIONS.  FOR INFORMATION ABOUT POLICIES AND CERTIFICATES
              APPROVED UNDER THE ILLINOIS LONG-TERM CARE PARTNERSHIP
              PROGRAM, CALL THE SENIOR HELPLINE AT THE DEPARTMENT ON AGING
              AT 1-800-252-8966."

     b)  In addition to the practices prohibited in Article XXVI (Ill. Rev.
         Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 1028 et seq.) [215 ILCS 5/421 et seq.],
         the following acts and practices are prohibited:

          1)  Twisting.  Knowingly making any misleading representation or
              incomplete or fraudulent comparison of any insurance policies
              or insurers for the purpose of inducing, or tending to
              induce, any person to lapse, forfeit, surrender, terminate,
              retain, pledge, assign, borrow on or convert any insurance
              policy or to take out a policy of insurance with another
              insurer.

          2)  High pressure tactics.  Employing any method of marketing
              having the effect of, or tending to induce the purchase of
              insurance through force, fright, threat, whether explicit or
              implied, or undue pressure to purchase or recommend the
              purchase of insurance.

          3)  Cold lead advertising.  Making use directly or indirectly of
              any method of marketing which fails to disclose in a
              conspicuous manner that a purpose of the method of marketing
              is solicitation of insurance and that contact will be made by
              an insurance producer or insurance company.

     c)  With respect to the obligations set forth in this subsection, the
         primary responsibility of an association when procuring
         traditional long-term care insurance shall be to educate its
         members concerning long-term care issues in general so that its
         members can make informed decisions.  Associations should provide
         information regarding traditional long-term care insurance
         policies or certificates to ensure that members of such
         associations receive a complete explanation of the features in the
         policies or certificates that are being sold by the insurer.

          1)  The insurer shall file with this Department the following
              material:

                   administrative fees and other forms of financial
                   support) that the association receives from the sale of
                   the policy or certificate to its members, and

               B)  A brief description of the processes under which such
                   policies and the insurer issuing such policies were
                   selected.

          3)  If the association and the insurer have interlocking
              directorates or trustee arrangements, the association shall
              disclose such fact to its members.

          4)  The board of directors of associations shall review and
              approve such insurance policies as well as the compensation
              arrangements made with the insurer.

          5)  The association shall also engage the services of a person
              with expertise in long-term care insurance, not affiliated
              with the insurer, to conduct an examination of the policies
              including its benefits, features, and rates and update such
              examination thereafter in the event of a material change.

          6)  No group long-term care insurance policy or certificate may
              be issued to an association unless the insurer files with
              this Department the information required in this subsection.

          7)  The insurer shall not issue a traditional long-term care
              policy or certificate to an association or continue to market
              such a policy or certificate unless the insurer certifies
              annually that the association has complied with the
              requirements set forth in this subsection.

     d)  The insurer shall provide producer training as follows:

              otherwise contact any person for the purpose of marketing a
              traditional long-term care policy or certificate unless the
              producer has completed six (6) hours of training on
              traditional long-term care insurance as prescribed in Exhibit
              E of this Part; the course shall be specifically titled

              traditional long-term care course cannot be included as part
              of any other certified continuing education course;  however,

              requirements of Section 494.1(c) of the Illinois Insurance
              Code [215 ILCS 5/491.1(c)].  Insurers and producers shall

              50 Ill. Adm Code 3119.Exhibit D, and shall be signed by the
              producer and the provider of the education attesting to the
              completion of the required training.

          2)  The required training hours referenced in subsection
              2012.122(d)(1) above may qualify as part of the continuing
              education requirements of Section 494.1(c) of the Illinois
              Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/494.1(c)] only if the training
              course has been certified under 50 Ill. Adm. Code 3119.30.
              Each educational provider shall submit its request for
              certification to the Director on a form prescribed by 50 Ill.

Section 2012.EXHIBIT A  Replacement Notice for Other Than Direct Response Solicitations
 
   NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT AND
                   SICKNESS OR LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE

According to [your application] [information you have furnished], you
intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing accident and sickness or
long-term care insurance and replace it with an individual long-term care
insurance policy to be issued by [Company Name] Insurance Company. Your new
policy provides ten (10) days within which you may decide, without cost,
whether you desire to keep the policy. For your own information and
protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain factors
which may affect the insurance protection available to you under the new
policy.

     1.  Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting
         conditions), may not be immediately or fully covered under the new
         policy. This could result in denial or delay in payment of
         benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have
         been payable under your present policy.

     2.  You may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or its
         agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present policy.
         This is not only your right, but it is also in your best interest
         to make sure you understand all the relevant factors involved in
         replacing your present coverage.

     3.  If, after due consideration, you still wish to terminate your
         present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain to
         truthfully and completely answer all questions on the application
         concerning your medical health history. Failure to include all
         material medical information on an application may provide a basis
         for the company to deny any future claims and to refund your
         premium as though your policy had never been in force. After the
         application has been completed and before you sign it, reread it
         carefully to be certain that all information has been properly
         recorded.

The above "Notice to Applicant" was delivered to me on:

Section 2012.EXHIBIT B  Replacement Notice for Direct Response Solicitations
 
   NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS OR
                         LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE

According to [your application] [information you have furnished], you
intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing accident and sickness or
long-term care insurance and replace it with the long-term care insurance
policy delivered herewith issued by [Company Name] Insurance Company. Your
new policy provides thirty (30) days within which you may decide, without
cost, whether you desire to keep the policy. For your own information and
protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain factors
which may affect the insurance protection available to you under the new
policy.

     1.  Health conditions which you may presently have (preexisting
         conditions), may not be immediately or fully covered under the new
         policy. This could result in denial or delay in payment of
         benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have
         been payable under your present policy.

     2.  You may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or its
         agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present policy.
         This is not only your right, but it is also in your best interest
         to make sure you understand all the relevant factors involved in
         replacing your present coverage.

     3.  [To be included only if the application is attached to the
         policy.] If, after due consideration, you still wish to terminate
         you present policy and replace it with new coverage, read the copy
         of the application attached to your new policy and be sure that
         all questions are answered fully and correctly. Omissions or
         misstatements in the application could cause an otherwise valid
         claim to be denied. Carefully check the application and write to
         [Company Name and Address] within thirty (30) days if any
         information is not correct and complete, or if any past medical
         history has been left out of the application.

                                                                           
                                                          (Company Name)   
         

 
Section 2012.EXHIBIT C  Standard Format Outline of Coverage
 
                              [COMPANY NAME]

                         [ADDRESS - CITY & STATE]

                            [TELEPHONE NUMBER]

                         LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE

                            OUTLINE OF COVERAGE

       [Policy Number or Group Master Policy and Certificate Number]

     1.  This policy is [an individual policy of insurance] ([a group
         policy] which was issued in the [indicate jurisdiction in which
         group policy was issued]).

     2.  PURPOSE OF OUTLINE OF COVERAGE. This outline of coverage provides
         a very brief description of the important features of the policy.
         You should compare this outline of coverage to outlines of
         coverage for other policies available to you. This is not an
         insurance contract, but only a summary of coverage. Only the
         individual or group policy contains governing contractual
         provisions. This means that the policy or group policy sets forth
         in detail the rights and obligations of both you and the insurance
         company. Therefore, if you purchase this coverage, or any other
         coverage, it is important that you READ YOUR POLICY (OR
         CERTIFICATE) CAREFULLY!

     3.  TERMS UNDER WHICH THE POLICY OR CERTIFICATE MAY BE CONTINUED IN
         FORCE OR DISCONTINUED.

          a)  For long-term care health insurance policies or certificates
              include one of the following permissible policy renewability
              provisions:

               1)  Policies and certificates that are guaranteed renewable
                   shall contain the following
                   statement:  RENEWABILITY:  THIS POLICY [CERTIFICATE] IS
                   GUARANTEED RENEWABLE.  This means you have the right,
                   subject to the terms of your policy [certificate], to
                   continue this policy as long as you pay your premiums on
                   time.  [Company Name] cannot change any of the terms of
                   your policy on its own, except that, in the future, IT
                   MAY INCREASE THE PREMIUM YOU PAY.

               2)  Policies and certificates that are noncancellable shall
                   contain the following statement:  RENEWABILITY:  THIS
                   POLICY IS NONCANCELLABLE.  This means that you have the
                   right, subject to the terms of your policy, to continue
                   this policy as long as you pay your premiums on time.
                   [Company Name] cannot change any of the terms of your
                   policy on its own and cannot change the premium you
                   currently pay.  However, if your policy contains an
                   inflation protection feature where you choose to
                   increase your benefits, [Company Name] may increase your
                   premium at that time for those additional benefits.

          b)  For group coverage, specifically include
              continuation/conversion provisions applicable to the
              certificate and group policy;

          c)  Include waiver of premium provisions or state that there are
              no such provisions;

          d)  State whether or not the company has a right to change
              premium, and if such right exists, include each circumstance
              under which premium may change.

     4.  TERMS UNDER WHICH THE POLICY OR CERTIFICATE MAY BE RETURNED AND
         PREMIUM REFUNDED.

          (a) [Provide a brief description of the right to return -- "free
              look" provision of the policy.]

          (b) [Include a statement that the policy either does or does not
              contain provisions providing for a refund or partial refund
              of premium upon the death of an insured or surrender of the
              policy or certificate. If the policy contains such
              provisions, include a description of them.]

     5.  THIS IS NOT MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT COVERAGE. If you are eligible for
         Medicare, review the Medicare Supplement Buyer's Guide available
         from the insurance company.

          (a) [For agents] Neither [insert company name] nor its agents
              represent Medicare, the federal government or any state
              government.

          (b) [For direct response] [insert company name] is not
              representing Medicare, the federal government or any state
              government.

     6.  LONG-TERM CARE COVERAGE. Policies of this category are designed to
         provide coverage for one or more necessary or medically necessary
         diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance,
         or personal care services, provided in a setting other than an
         acute care unit of a hospital, such as in a nursing home, in the
         community or in the home.
         This policy provides coverage in the form of a fixed dollar
         indemnity benefit for covered long-term care expenses, subject to
         policy [limitations] [waiting periods] and [coinsurance]
         requirements. [Modify this paragraph if the policy is not an
         indemnity policy.]

     7.  BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY.

          (a) [Covered services, related deductible(s), waiting periods,
              elimination periods and benefit maximums.]

          (b) [Institutional benefits, by skill level.]

          (c) [Non-institutional benefits, by skill level.]
              (Any benefit screens must be explained in this Section. If
              these screens differ for different benefits, explanation of
              the screen should accompany each benefit description. If an
              attending physician or other specified person must certify a
              certain level of functional dependency in order to be
              eligible for benefits, this too must be specified. If
              activities of daily living (ADLs) are used to measure an
              insured's need or long-term care, then these qualifying
              criteria or screens must be explained.]

     8.  LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.
              [Describe:

          (a) Preexisting conditions;

          (b) Non-eligible facilities/provider;

          (c) Non-eligible levels of care (e.g., unlicensed providers, care
              or treatment provided by a family member, etc.);

          (d) Exclusions/exceptions;

          (e) Limitations.]

         [This section should provide a brief specific description of any
         policy provisions which limit, exclude, restrict, reduce, delay,
         or in any other manner operate to qualify payment of the benefits
         described in (6) above.]

         THIS POLICY MAY NOT COVER ALL THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR
         LONG-TERM CARE NEEDS.

     9.  RELATIONSHIP OF COST OF CARE AND BENEFITS. Because the cost of
         long-term care services will likely increase over time, you should
         consider whether and how the benefits of this plan may be
         adjusted. [As applicable, indicate the following:

          (a) That the benefit level will not increase over time;

          (b) Any automatic benefit adjustment provisions;

          (c) Whether the insured will be guaranteed the option to buy
              additional benefits and the basis upon which benefits will be
              increased over time if not by a specified amount or
              percentage;

          (d) If there is such a guarantee, include whether additional
              underwriting or health screening will be required, the
              frequency and amounts of the upgrade options, and any
              significant restrictions or limitations;

          (e) And finally, describe whether there will be any additional
              premium charge imposed, and how that is to be calculated.]

     10. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER ORGANIC BRAIN DISORDERS.

         [State that the policy provides coverage for insureds clinically
         diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease or related degenerative
         and dementing illnesses. Specifically describe each benefit screen
         or other policy provision which provides preconditions to the
         availability of policy benefits for such an insured.]

     11. PREMIUM.

          [(a) State the total annual premium for the policy;

          (b) If the premium varies with an applicant's choice among
              benefit options, indicate the portion of annual premium which
              corresponds to each benefit option.]

     12. ADDITIONAL FEATURES.

          [(a) Indicate if medical underwriting is used;

          (b) Describe other important important features.]

         "Prior Carrier" means the carrier of group health care coverage
         provided by the employer or other entity immediately prior to the
         effective date of discontinuance and which has or has not been
         replaced by a succeeding plan.

         "Succeeding Carrier" means the carrier of group health coverage
         provided by an employer or other entity which is issued within 90
         days after the discontinuance of the prior plan.

         For employees, the inability of the covered employee to perform
         his or her regular or customary occupational duties because of
         injury or disease; and after benefits have been paid for 24
         months, the covered person cannot perform the duties of any
         gainful occupation for which he or she is reasonably fitted by
         training, education or experience; or
         For dependents or retired employees, the inability because of
         injury or disease to engage in substantially all of the normal

Section 2013.40  Effective Date of Discontinuance for Non-Payment of Premium
 
     a)  If a group contract subject to this Part provides for automatic
         discontinuance of the contract after a premium has remained unpaid
         through the grace period allowed for such payment, the carrier
         shall be liable for valid claims for covered losses incurred prior
         to the end of the grace period.  The carrier shall, however, be
         entitled to the premium due for coverage provided during the grace
         period.

     b)  If the actions of the carrier after the end of the grace period
         indicate that it considers the group contract as continuing in
         force beyond the end of the grace period by continuing to
         recognize claims subsequently incurred, the carrier shall be
         liable for valid claims for losses beginning prior to the
         effective date of written notice of discontinuance to the contract
         holders or other entity responsible for making payments to the
         carrier.  The effective date of discontinuance shall not be prior
         to midnight at the end of the third scheduled work day after the
         date upon which the notice is delivered.

     (Source:  Amended at 18 Ill. Reg. 16921, effective November 15, 1994) 
 

Section 2013.50  Requirements for Notice of Discontinuance
 
     a)  Any notice of discontinuance so given by the carrier shall advise
         the group contract holder to notify enrolled individuals covered
         under the contract within 10 working days after receipt of such
         notice of the date the group contract will discontinue and to
         advise, unless otherwise provided in the contract, the carrier
         shall not be liable for claims for losses incurred after the date
         of discontinuance.

     b)  In the instance in which the plan involves employee contributions,
         if the contract holder continues to collect contributions for the
         coverage after the date of discontinuance, the group contract
         holder may be held solely liable for the benefits with respect to
         the period for which the contributions have been collected.

     c)  Simultaneously with the notice of discontinuance, the carrier
         shall furnish to the group contract holder a sample of a notice
         form to be distributed to the enrolled individuals indicating such
         discontinuance, the effective date thereof, and advising the
         enrolled individuals to refer to their certificates in order to
         determine what rights, if any, are available to them upon such
         discontinuance.

     (Source:  Amended at 17 Ill. Reg. 1525, effective January 20, 1993) 

 
Section 2013.60  Extension of Benefits
 
     a)  Every group contract subject to this Part must include a provision
         for a reasonable extension of benefits in the event of total
         disability on the date of discontinuance of the group contract as
         required by subsections (b) and (c) hereunder.

     b)  In the case of hospital and medical expense coverages and HMO
         plans, other than dental, pharmaceutical or other limited expense
         coverages,  such extension will be considered "reasonable" if it
         provides for an extension until the earliest of the following:

          1)  the end of twelve months; or

          2)  the date the maximum benefit is reached; or

          3)  the end of total disability.

     c)  For other types of hospital or medical expenses plans, such as
         those limited to hospital expenses only, medical expenses only, or
         surgical expenses only, such extension will be considered
         "reasonable" if it provides for an extension until the earliest of
         the following:

          1)  ninety days; or

          2)  the date the maximum benefit is reached; or

          3)  the end of total disability.

     d)  In the case of a disability income contract providing benefits for
         loss of time from work, or specific indemnity during hospital
         confinement on an accrued liability basis, discontinuance of the
         group contract during a disability or confinement shall have no
         effect on benefits payable for that disability or confinement.

     e)  Any applicable extension of benefits or accrued liability shall be
         described in the group contract involved as well as in group
         certificates.  All benefits payable during any period of extension
         of benefits or accrued liability will be subject to the group
         contract's regular benefit limits (e.g., benefits ceasing at
         exhaustion of a benefit period or of maximum benefits or benefit
         restrictions for services provided by unaffiliated providers of an
         HMO) but in no event shall benefits be reduced solely because of
         the discontinuance of the group contract except as otherwise
         permitted by this Part.

     f)  An extension of benefits need not be provided when an individual's
         coverage terminates under the group contract in accordance with
         the contract's eligibility and termination provisions.

     (Source:  Amended at 18 Ill. Reg. 16921, effective November 15, 1994) 

 
Section 2013.70  Continuance of Coverage in Situations Involving Replacement of One Group Contract by Another
 
This Section sets standards for determining liability when one group
contract replaces another group contract.

     a)  Liability of prior carrier.

          1)  The prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its
              accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits.  The position
              of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group
              contract holder or other entity secures replacement coverage
              from a new carrier, the same carrier, self-insures, or
              foregoes the provision of coverage.

          2)  Employees and dependents who are totally disabled on the date
              of discontinuance of the group policy of the prior carrier
              shall be provided an extension of benefits for a disabling
              illness, injury or condition as described in Section 2013.60.

          3)  The prior carrier, if an HMO, may limit the extension of
              benefits for a totally disabling illness, injury or condition
              to services provided by or through their participating
              providers, unless services are rendered on an emergency
              basis.

          4)  No prior carrier may terminate the required extension of
              benefits because the totally disabled person becomes covered
              under the succeeding carrier's contract.

          5)  The prior carrier must provide the extension of benefits
              without cost to the totally disabled person except for
              copayments, coinsurance and deductibles in effect at the time
              of discontinuance and following the discontinuance of
              coverage.

     b)  Liability of Succeeding Carrier.

          1)  Each person who is eligible for coverage in accordance with
              the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in respect to
              classes eligible and actively at work and non-confinement
              rules, shall be covered by the succeeding carrier's plan of
              benefits.  For purposes of this subsection, the succeeding
              carrier shall not individually underwrite when determining
              eligibility except for purposes of accepting or rejecting the
              group as a whole.

          2)  Each person not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan
              of benefits in accordance with subsection (b)(1) because he
              or she does not satisfy the actively at work or
              non-confinement requirement, must nevertheless be covered by
              the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following
              standards if such individual was validly covered, including
              by extension of benefits, under the prior plan on the date of
              discontinuance and such individual is a member of the class
              or classes of individuals eligible for coverage.  Any
              reference in the following standards to an individual who was
              or was not totally disabled is a reference to the
              individual's status immediately prior to the date the
              succeeding carrier's coverage becomes effective.

               A)  The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the
                   succeeding carrier shall be the applicable level of
                   benefits of the prior carrier's plan reduced by any
                   benefits payable by the prior plan.

               B)  When the succeeding carrier is an HMO, the benefits must
                   be the HMO's own level of benefits, reduced by benefits
                   provided or payable by the prior plan.

               C)  Benefits under this subsection must be provided by the
                   succeeding carrier until at least the earliest of the
                   following dates:

                    i)   the date the individual becomes eligible under the
                         succeeding carrier's group contract according to
                         subsection (b)(1) above.

                    ii)  the date the individual's benefits would terminate
                         in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan
                         provisions applicable to individual termination of
                         coverage (e.g., at termination of employment or
                         ceasing to be an eligible dependent).

                    iii) in the case of an individual who was totally
                         disabled and in the case of a type of coverage for
                         which Section 2013.60 requires an extension of
                         benefits or accrued liability, the end of any
                         period of extension or accrued liability, which is
                         required of the prior carrier by Section 2013.60
                         or, if the prior carrier's policy is not subject
                         to that Section, would have been required of that
                         carrier had its policy been subject to Section
                         2013.60.

          3)  The conversion privilege shall be available to those
              individuals whose benefits cease, if the individual has not
              become eligible under the succeeding carrier's plan described
              in subsection (b)(1) above.

          4)  In the case of a pre-existing conditions limitation included
              in the succeeding carrier's plan, the level of benefits
              applicable to pre-existing conditions of persons covered by
              the succeeding carrier during the period of time this
              limitation applies, shall be the lesser of:

               A)  the benefits of the new plan determined without
                   application of the pre-existing conditions limitation;
                   or

               B)  the benefits of the prior plan.

          5)  The succeeding carrier, in applying any deductibles,
              coinsurance, copayments  or waiting period in its plan, shall
              give credit for the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of
              the same or similar provisions under a prior plan providing
              similar benefits.  In the case of deductible provisions, the
              credit shall apply for the same or overlapping benefit
              periods and shall be given for expenses actually incurred and
              applied against the deductible provision of the prior
              carrier's plan during the 90 days preceding the effective
              date of the succeeding carrier's plan, but only to the extent
              these expenses are recognized under the terms of the
              succeeding carrier's plan and are subject to similar
              deductible provisions.

          6)  In any situation where a determination of the prior carrier's
              benefits is required by the succeeding carrier, at the
              succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish
              a statement of the benefits available or pertinent
              information, sufficient to permit verification of the benefit
              determination or the determination itself by the succeeding
              carrier.  For the purposes of this Section, benefits of the
              prior plan will be determined in accordance with all of the
              definitions, conditions, and covered expenses provisions of
              the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan.  The
              benefit determination will be made as if coverage had not
              been replaced by the succeeding carrier.

     c)  Liability of Succeeding Carrier as an HMO

          1)  So long as federally qualified HMOs are not permitted to
              require actively at work, hospital non-confinement rules,
              medical evidence of insurability, or pre-existing condition
              limitations, subsections (b)(2)(A) and (b)(4) above do not
              apply to federally qualified HMOs.

          2)  In situations where services for the totally disabled person
              are provided by the succeeding HMO, the succeeding HMO may
              bill the prior carrier for the reasonable cash value of
              services provided when the prior carrier has an obligation
              under its required extension of benefits.  The prior carrier
              shall make direct payment to the succeeding HMO for the cost
              of the services provided.

         pronuclear stage before cell division takes place.  The
         eggs are harvested and fertilized on one day and the
         embryo is transferred at a later time.

 
Section 2015.40  Oocyte Retrieval Limitation
 
For treatments that include oocyte retrievals, coverage for  such
treatments is not required if the covered individual has  already
received four completed oocyte retrievals, per lifetime  of said
individual; except that if a live birth follows a  completed
oocyte retrieval, then coverage is required for two  additional
completed oocyte retrievals.

         excluded if deemed non-experimental and
         non-investigational;

     d)  Selected termination of an embryo; provided, however,
         that where the life of the mother would be in danger
         were all embryos to be carried to full term, said
         termination shall be covered;

     e)  Non-medical costs of an egg or sperm donor;

         insurer or health maintenance organization;

     g)  Infertility treatments deemed experimental in  nature.
         However, where infertility treatment includes  elements
         which are not experimental in nature along  with those
         which are, to the extent services may be  delineated and
         separately charged, those services which  are not

         HMO required to provide infertility coverage  shall deny
         reimbursement for an infertility service or  procedure

         experimental or investigational unless supported by the
         written determination of the American Fertility Society
         or the American College of Obstetrics.  These entities
         will provide such determinations for specific procedures
         or treatments only and will not provide determinations
         on the appropriateness of a procedure or treatment for a
         specific individual. Coverage is required for all
         procedures specifically listed in Section 356m of the
         Illinois Insurance Code, entitled Infertility Coverage
         (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 73, par. 968m) [215 ILCS
         5/356m], regardless of experimental status.

              Director that the association or associations  have at the
              outset a minimum of 100 members and  have been organized and
              maintained in good faith  for purposes other than that of
              obtaining  insurance; have been in active existence for at
              least one year; and have a constitution and  by-laws which
              provide that:

                   the association or associations hold  regular meetings
                   not less than annually to  further the purposes of the
                   members; and

                   except for credit unions, the association(s) collect
                   dues or solicit  contributions from members; and
                   the members have voting privileges and  representation
                   on the governing board and  committees.

              Thirty days from receipt by the DOI of such filing, the
              association or associations will be deemed  to satisfy such
              organizational requirements,  unless the Director makes a
              finding that the  association(s) does not satisfy
              organizational requirements of this Section.

         A group, other than those described above, shall  otherwise be
         subject to a finding by the Director that:

              The issuance of the group policy is not  contrary to the best
              interest of the  public;

              The issuance of the group policy would  result in economies
              of acquisition or  administration; and

              The benefits are reasonable in relation to  the premiums
              charged;

              The standards to be used by the Director  for determining
              whether a group is eligible  shall include, but not be
              limited to:  the  policy shall not contain broad or
              misleading exclusions; premiums for group  policies are less
              than premiums for individual policies; and the loss ratio
              complies with Illinois requirements.

         Insured Event, for the purposes of determining  eligibility for
         benefits under a qualified policy or  certificate and for
         determining whether these  benefits result in an asset disregard
         for a qualified  insured, means the insured shall score fifteen or
         more  points on Part A of the Determination of Need (DON), at

Section 2018.50  Policy Practices and Provisions
 

     a)  Limitations and Exclusions.  No policy may be delivered  or issued
         for delivery in this State as a long-term  care partnership
         insurance policy if the policy limits  or excludes coverage by
         type of illness, treatment,  medical condition or accident, except
         as follows:

          1)  Preexisting conditions or diseases;

          2)  Mental or nervous disorders, other than Alzheimer's  Disease
              or related disorders;

          3)  Alcoholism and drug addiction;

          4)  Illness, treatment or medical condition arising out  of:

               A)  war or act of war (whether declared or undeclared);

               B)  conviction of a felony, riot or insurrection;

               C)  service in the armed forces or units auxiliary  thereto;

               D)  suicide (sane or insane), attempted suicide or
                   intentionally self-inflicted injury; or

               E)  aviation (this exclusion applies only to nonfare paying
                   passengers).

          5)  Treatment provided in a government facility (unless
              otherwise required by law), services for which  benefits are
              available under Medicare or other  governmental program
              (except Medicaid), any state  or federal workers'
              compensation, employer's liability or occupational disease
              law, or any motor  vehicle no-fault law, services provided by
              the  spouse of a covered person and services for which  no
              charge is normally made in the absence of insurance.

     b)  Case Management.  Assessment of need and the  development/revision
         of the Plan of Care shall be  provided without a reduction of
         policy benefits. Case management agencies shall be reimbursed by
         the State for the  administration of the Determination of Need.
         The  insurer shall reimburse the agencies for the development of
         the Plan of Care and any additional required  policy-specific
         activities related to the determination  of eligibility for
         benefits, as well as any subsequent  revisions, as a result of
         changes in need.  If the  insured elects to have the case
         management agency  perform service monitoring and Plan of Care
         implementation and management, the costs of these services shall
         be part of the policy benefit, reimbursed as a claim, and count
         towards asset  disregard.

     c)  Extension of Benefits.  Termination of long-term care  partnership
         insurance shall be without prejudice to any  benefits payable for
         long-term care partnership services if such services began while
         the long-term care  partnership policy was in force and continues
         without  interruption after termination.  Such extension of
         benefits beyond the period the long-term care partnership policy
         was in force may be limited to payment of  the maximum benefits
         and may be subject to any policy  waiting period and all other
         applicable provisions of  the policy.

     d)  Continuation or Conversion.

          1)  Group long-term care partnership policies issued in  this
              State shall provide covered individuals with a  basis for
              continuation or conversion of coverage.

               A)  A basis for continuation of coverage means a  policy
                   provision which maintains coverage under  the existing
                   group policy when such coverage  would otherwise
                   terminate and which is subject  only to the continued
                   timely payment of premium  when due;

               B)  A basis for conversion of coverage means a  policy
                   provision that an individual whose  coverage under the
                   group policy would otherwise  terminate or has been
                   terminated for any reason, including discontinuance of
                   the group  policy in its entirety or with respect to an
                   insured class, and who has been continuously  insured
                   under the group policy (and any group  policy which it
                   replaced), for at least 6  months immediately prior to
                   termination, shall  be entitled to the issuance of a
                   converted  policy by the insurer under whose group
                   policy  the individual is covered, without evidence of
                   insurability.

          2)  Converted policy means an individual long-term care
              partnership policy providing benefits identical to  or
              substantially equivalent to or in excess of  those provided
              under the group policy from which  conversion is made.

          3)  Written application for the converted policy shall  be made
              and the first premium due, if any, shall be  paid as directed
              by the insurer not later than 31  days after termination of
              coverage under the group  policy.  The converted policy shall
              be issued  effective on the day following the termination of
              coverage under the group policy and shall be  guaranteed
              renewable.

          4)  Unless the group policy from which conversion is  made
              replaced previous group coverage, the premium  for the
              converted policy shall be calculated on the  basis of the
              insured's age at inception of coverage  under the group
              policy from which conversion is  made.  Where the group
              policy from which conversion  is made replaced previous group
              coverage, the  premium for the converted policy shall be
              calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of
              coverage under the group policy replaced.

          5)  Continuation of coverage or issuance of a converted  policy
              shall be mandatory, except where:

               A)  Termination of group coverage resulted from an
                   individual's failure to make any required  payment of
                   premium or contribution when due; or

               B)  The terminating coverage is replaced not later  than
                   thirty-one days after termination, by  group coverage
                   effective on the day following  the termination of
                   coverage:

                    i)   Providing benefits identical to or benefits
                         equivalent in design and actuarially equivalent in
                         value in excess of those provided  by the
                         terminating coverage; and

                    ii)  The premium for which is calculated in a  manner
                         consistent with the requirements of  subsection
                         (d)(4) of this Section.

          6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, any
              insured individual whose eligibility for  group long-term
              care partnership coverage is based  upon his or her
              relationship to another person shall be  entitled to
              continuation of coverage under the  group policy upon
              termination of the qualifying  relationship by death or
              dissolution of marriage.

     e)  Discontinuance and Replacement.

         If a group long-term care partnership policy is replaced by
         another group long-term care partnership  policy issued to the
         same policyholder, the succeeding  insurer shall offer coverage to
         all persons covered  under the previous group policy on its date
         of termination.  Coverage provided or offered to individuals by
         the insurer and premiums charged to persons under the  new group
         policy:

          1)  Shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting  conditions
              that would have been covered under the  group policy being
              replaced; and

          2)  Shall not vary or otherwise depend on the individual's health
              or disability status, claim experience  or use of long-term
              care services.

     f)  The premiums charged to an insured for long-term care  insurance
         shall not increase due to either:

          1)  The increasing age of the insured; or

          2)  The duration the insured has been covered under the  policy.

     g)  No long-term care partnership policy shall:

          1)  Be cancelled, nonrenewed or otherwise terminated on  grounds
              of the age or deterioration of the mental  or physical health
              of the insured individual or  certificateholder; or

          2)  Contain a provision establishing a new waiting  period in the
              event existing coverage is converted  to, or replaced by, a
              new or other form within the  same company, except with
              respect to an increase in  benefits voluntarily selected by
              the insured individual or group certificateholder.

 
Section 2018.60  Unintentional Lapse
 
Each insurer offering long-term care partnership insurance  shall, as a
protection against unintentional lapse, comply with  the following:

     a)  Notice before lapse or termination.

          1)  No individual long-term care partnership policy or
              certificate shall be issued until the insurer has  received
              from the applicant a written designation  of at least one
              person, in addition to the applicant, who is to receive
              notice of lapse or termination of the policy or certificate
              for nonpayment of  premium, or a written waiver dated and
              signed by  the applicant electing not to designate additional
              persons to receive notice.  The applicant has the  right to
              designate at least one person who is to  receive the notice
              of termination, in addition to  the insured.  Designation
              shall not constitute  acceptance of any liability on the
              third party for  services provided to the insured.  The form
              used  for the written designation shall provide space
              designated for listing at least one person.  The  designation
              shall include each person's full name  and home address.  In
              the case of an applicant who  elects not to designate an
              additional person, the  waiver shall state:  "Protection
              against unintended  lapse.  I understand that I have the
              right to  designate at least one person other than myself to
              receive notice of lapse or termination of this  long-term
              care insurance policy for nonpayment of  premium.  I
              understand that notice will not be  given until 30 days after
              a premium is due and  unpaid.  I elect NOT to designate any
              person to  receive such notice."  The insurer shall also
              notify the insured of the right to designate or  change the
              designee, no less often than once every  2 years.

          2)  When the policyholder or certificateholder pays the premium
              for a long-term care partnership policy or  certificate
              through a payroll or pension deduction  plan, the
              requirements contained in subsection  (a)(1) of this Section
              need not be met until sixty  (60) days after the policyholder
              or certificateholder is no longer on such a payment plan.
              The  application or enrollment form for such policies or
              certificates shall indicate the payment plan selected by the
              applicant.

          3)  Lapse or termination for nonpayment of premium.  No
              individual long-term care partnership policy or  certificate
              shall lapse or be terminated for nonpayment of premium unless
              the insurer, at least  thirty (30) days before the effective
              date of the  lapse or termination, has given notice to the
              insured and to those persons designated pursuant to
              subsection (a)(1) of this Section, at the address  provided
              by the insured for purposes of receiving  notice of lapse or
              termination.  Notice shall be  given by first class United
              States mail, postage  prepaid, and notice shall not be given
              until thirty  (30) days after a premium is due and unpaid.
              Notice shall be deemed to have been given as of  five (5)
              days after the date of mailing.

     b)  In addition to the requirements of subsection (a)  above, a
         long-term care partnership policy or certificate shall include a
         provision which provides for  reinstatement of coverage, in the
         event of lapse, if  the insurer is provided proof of cognitive
         impairment  as defined in Section 2018.30(m) of this Part and as
         determined by a physician.  This option shall be available to the
         insured for no less than (5) months  after termination and shall
         allow for the collection of  past due premium.

 
Section 2018.70  Required Disclosure Provisions
 
     a)  Renewability.  Individual long-term care partnership  policies
         shall contain a renewability provision.  Such  provision shall be
         captioned as a Renewal, shall appear  on the first page of the
         policy, and shall clearly  state the duration, where limited, of
         renewability and  the duration of the term of coverage for which
         the  policy is issued and of which it may be renewed.

     b)  Riders and Endorsements.  Except for riders or endorsements by
         which the insurer effectuates a request made  in writing by the
         insured under an individual long-term  care partnership policy,
         all riders or endorsements  added to an individual long-term care
         insurance policy  after issuance or at reinstatement or renewal
         which  reduce or eliminate benefits or coverage in the policy
         shall require signed acceptance by the individual  insured.  After
         issuance, any rider or endorsement  which increases benefits or
         coverage with a concomitant  increase in premium during the policy
         term shall be  agreed to in writing and signed by the insured,
         with  the exception of when the increased benefits or coverage are
         required by law.  Where a separate additional  premium is charged
         for benefits provided in connection  with riders or endorsements,
         such premium charge shall  be set forth in the policy, rider or
         endorsement.

     c)  Pre-existing Conditions.  If a long-term care partnership policy
         or certificate contains any limitations  with respect to
         pre-existing conditions, such limitations shall appear as a
         separate paragraph of the  policy or certificate and shall be
         labeled "Pre-existing Condition Limitations."  Limitations to
         pre-existing conditions shall be in accordance with Section
         351A-5 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.  1991, ch.
         73, par. 963A-5) [215 ILCS 5/351A-5].

     d)  Disclosure Requirements for Accelerated Life Products.

          1)  Policy Summary

              At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary  shall be
              delivered for an individual life insurance  policy which
              provides long-term care partnership  benefits within the
              policy or by rider.  In the  case of direct response
              solicitations, the insurer  shall deliver the policy summary
              upon the applicant's request, but regardless of request shall
              make such delivery no later than at the time of  policy
              delivery.  In addition to complying with all  applicable
              requirements, the summary shall also  include:

               A)  an explanation of how the long-term care  partnership
                   benefit interacts with other components of the policy,
                   including deductions from  death benefits;

               B)  an illustration of the amount of benefits, the  length
                   of benefit, and the guaranteed lifetime  benefits, if

                   automatic increases in daily coverage benefits of at
                   least 5% per year compounded.  Companies may offer

         available for purchase any policy or certificate  issued that has
         been approved by the Director.  The  following describes the
         process and result of discontinuing the availability of a policy
         or certificate:

          1)  An insurer may discontinue the availability of a  policy or
              certificate if the insurer provides the  Director, in
              writing, its decision at least thirty  (30) days prior to
              discontinuing the availability  of the policy or certificate.
              The following shall  be considered a discontinuance of the
              availability  of a policy or certificate:

               A)  The sale or other transfer of a policy or  certificate
                   to another insurer.

               B)  A change in the rating structure or methodology  unless
                   the insurer complies with the following  requirements:
                   The insurer shall provide an actuarial  memorandum which
                   contains a complete description of the current rating
                   methodology  including all assumptions underlying the
                   current rates, and a complete description  of the
                   revised rating methodology including  all assumptions
                   underlying the rates proposed under the revised rating
                   methodology,  and actuarial justification, i.e.,
                   experience studies, general population data, etc., for
                   each of the assumptions that are  different than the
                   corresponding assumptions underlying the current rates,
                   and a demonstration of actuarial relationship  between
                   the current and proposed rates  using the distribution
                   of current insureds,  and an identification of the
                   rating cells,  i.e., age, sex, etc., which experience
                   the  greatest change in rates due to the change  in
                   rating methodology, and a demonstration  that the rates
                   based on the new rating  methodology meet the loss ratio
                   requirements of this Part and any other relevant
                   information.  The actuarial memorandum  should identify
                   the actuary responsible for  establishing the change in
                   rating methodology and be signed by the actuary.

          2)  An insurer that discontinues the availability of a  policy or
              certificate under subsection (1) above  shall not file for
              approval of a new long-term care  partnership policy or
              certificate for a period of  five (5) years after the insurer
              provides notice to  the Director of the discontinuance.

All long-term care partnership policies and certificates shall  meet the
following requirements:

     a)  Charge premiums based on the issue age of the applicant  at the
         time of policy or certificate issuance, not the  attained age of
         the insured.

     b)  Include a provision that the long-term care policy or  certificate
         shall utilize the insured event criteria,  defined in Section
         2018.30 of this Part, for determining eligibility for benefits and
         for determining the  amount of asset disregard.  Approval for
         admission to a  nursing facility under the Illinois preadmission
         screening program shall be deemed sufficient, but not  necessary
         to meet this insured event criteria.

     c)  Include a provision that the long-term care partnership  policy or
         certificate benefits can be used to purchase  nursing facility
         care or home and community based care.  Home and community based
         care shall include those  services listed in Section 2018.30 of
         this Part.

     d)  Include a provision that the insurer will provide  to the insured
         reports of asset protection as defined  in Section 2018.140 of
         this Part, and service summaries  as defined in Section 2018.150
         of this Part to enable  the insured to establish the amount of
         Asset Disregard.

     e)  Include a provision which allows for a thirty (30) day  period
         within which coverage may be cancelled by the  insured by
         delivering or mailing the evidence of coverage to the insurer or
         the producer through whom it was  effected for a full refund of
         any premium that was  paid.  The long-term care partnership policy
         or certificate shall have a notice prominently printed on the
         first page of the policy or certificate, or attached  thereto,
         stating that the policyholder or  certificateholder shall have the
         right to return the  policy or certificate to the insurer or its
         producer  for cancellation within thirty (30) days after its
         delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of
         the long-term care partnership policy or certificate, the insured
         person is not satisfied for any  reason.

     f)  Include a provision which, in the event the policy or  certificate
         is about to lapse or the policy or certificate is about to lose
         qualification status under Section 2018.30 of this Part, offers
         the long-term care  partnership policyholder or certificateholder
         the  option to reduce coverage to a lower benefit amount.
         However, this benefit amount offer, plus the amount of  benefits
         used to date, shall not be less than the  minimum benefit amount
         requirement specified in Section  2018.30 of this Part.  The
         insurer need only allow this  offer to be exercised one (1) time.
         Premiums shall be  based on the age of the long-term care
         partnership  policyholder or certificateholder at the time of the
         issuance of the original policy or certificate.

     g)  Include a provision that, upon sale of a long-term care
         partnership policy or certificate, the insurer shall do  the
         following:

          1)  Offer to collect and maintain the name and address  of an
              individual designated as an authorized designee, by the
              purchaser, to be notified when a policy  or certificate lapse
              is imminent.  The insurer  shall obtain a signed statement
              from purchasers who  do not choose to exercise their right to
              designate  an authorized designee.  Such statement shall also
              include that the purchaser(s) have been offered  this
              opportunity and declined.  It shall be the  insurer's
              responsibility to notify such designee  prior to canceling a
              long-term care partnership  policy or certificate due to lack
              of premium payment.  The designee notification shall occur no
              later than thirty (30) days after a premium is due and
              unpaid.  The insurer shall permit the long-term care
              partnership policyholder or certificateholder to no  less
              often than once every 2 years update the authorized designee.

          2)  Allow for the insured to request, within 5 months  after
              termination, reinstatement of the long-term  care partnership
              policy or certificate when such  policy or certificate has
              lapsed due to nonpayment  of premium, when the insured has a
              cognitive impairment and has paid all due and unpaid
              premiums.  The reinstated long-term care partnership policy
              or certificate shall have the same benefits, terms, and
              premiums as the policy or certificate which lapsed.

     h)  Include a provision that benefits shall only be paid  after the
         payment of all other benefits to which the  long-term care
         partnership policyholder or  certificateholder is otherwise
         entitled, excluding  Medicaid.  The insurer shall make efforts to
         determine  whether benefits are available from other long-term
         care partnership policies or certificates or from  Medicare.

     i)  Include a provision that the policy form shall not be  changed or
         otherwise modified without the signed acceptance of the
         policyholder, or include a provision that  the certificate issued
         under a group long-term care  partnership policy shall not be
         changed or otherwise  modified without the signed acceptance of
         the  certificateholder.

     j)  Include a provision that the benefits shall be  determined and
         established by the Case Management  Agency through the development
         of an authorized Plan of  Care.

 
Section 2018.120  Reporting Requirements
 
The requirements of this Section refer to insurer documentation  and
reporting requirements for long-term care partnership  policies and
certificates.  The reports shall be submitted for  each person entitled to
benefits under a long-term care partnership policy or certificate.  The
report shall conform with  the Long-Term Care Insurance Uniform Data Set
(February 15,  1993, revised November 30, 1993) established for Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Projects in a manner and form prescribed by  the DOI.
Insurers may receive a copy of the data set upon  request to the DOI, at a
charge.

 
Section 2018.130  Maintaining Auditing Information
 
     a)  Every insurer shall maintain information as required by subsection
         (f) below, on all long-term care partnership  policyholders or
         certificateholders who have ever  received any benefit under the
         policy or certificate.  Such information shall be updated at least
         quarterly. This requirement for updating shall not require the
         conduct of any assessment, reassessment, or other  evaluation of
         the long-term care partnership policyholder's or
         certificateholder's condition which is not  otherwise required.

     b)  When a long-term care partnership policyholder or
         certificateholder who has received any benefit dies or  lapses a
         long-term care partnership policy or  certificate for any reason,
         the insurer shall retain  the required information for a period of
         at least five  (5) years after the time when the policy was in
         force.  Unless notified by the DOI to the contrary during this
         period, after the expiration of five (5) years, the  service
         summary provided by the insurer will be deemed  to comply with all
         asset protection reporting, record  keeping, and auditing
         requirements of this Part.  The  insurer may use microfiche,
         microfilm, optical storage  media, or any other cost effective
         method of record  storage as alternatives to storage of paper
         copies.

     c)  At the time the long-term care partnership policy or certificate
         ceases to be in force, the insurer shall notify the policyholder
         or certificateholder of the right to request a copy of the service
         records as required by subsection (f) below.

     d)  The insurer shall also, upon request in writing,  provide such
         policyholder or certificateholder or the  policyholder's or
         certificateholder's authorized designee, if any, with a copy of
         the insurer's service  records as required by subsection (f) below
         which are  necessary to establish the asset disregard.  These
         records shall be provided within sixty (60) days after a  request.

     e)  The insurer shall enclose with the records a statement  advising
         former long-term care partnership policyholders or
         certificateholders that it is in their best  interest to retain
         the records if they ever wish to  establish eligibility for
         Medicaid.

     f)  The information to be maintained includes the  following:

          1)  Evidence that the insured event has taken place. The
              occurrence of the insured event shall be documented by case
              management agency staff, as part of  the initial assessment
              of the client or as part of  a subsequent reassessment.

          2)  Description of services provided under the  long-term care
              partnership policy or certificate,  including the following:

               A)  Name, address, phone number, and professional  license
                   number, if applicable, of Provider.

               B)  Amount, date, and type of services provided,  and
                   whether the services qualify for asset  protection.

               C)  Dollar amounts paid by the insurer, whether on  an
                   indemnity, expense incurred, or other basis.

               D)  The charges of the service providers, including  copies
                   of all invoices for services counting  toward asset
                   protection.

               E)  Identification of the case management agency,  if
                   applicable, and copies of all assessments  and
                   reassessments.

               F)  Determination of whether the long-term care  partnership
                   policyholder or certificateholder  was a qualified
                   insured at the time of benefit  payment.  The insurer
                   may rely on written  representation by the long-term
                   care partnership policyholder or certificateholder as to
                   whether he or she has had the required coverages
                   defined in this Part.

          3)  In order for home and community based services to  qualify
              for asset protection, these services shall  be in accord with
              a Plan of Care developed by a  case management agency.  If
              the long-term care  partnership policyholder or
              certificateholder has  received any benefits delivered as
              part of a Plan  of Care, the insurer shall retain the
              following:

               A)  A copy of the original Plan of Care and the
                   Determination of Need.

               B)  A copy of the Plan of Care required by DoA or  DORS.

               C)  A copy of any changes made in the Plan of Care.  The
                   Plan of Care shall document that the changes are
                   required by changes in the client's  medical situation,
                   cognitive abilities, or the  availability of social
                   supports.  Such services  shall count towards asset
                   protection after the  case management agency adds the
                   documented need  for and description of the new services
                   to the  Plan of Care.

 
Section 2018.140  Reporting on Asset Protection
 
     a)  Every insurer shall send an asset protection report at  least
         quarterly to each long-term care partnership  policyholder or
         certificateholder who has received any  benefits since the last
         asset protection report.  Each  asset protection report shall
         include the following  information:

          1)  The amount of asset protection for which the  long-term care
              partnership policyholder or  certificateholder had qualified
              prior to the quarter covered by the current report.

          2)  The total benefits paid by the insurer for services  rendered
              during the current quarter.

          3)  A statement of the amount of benefits paid by the  insurer
              for services rendered during the current  quarter which
              qualify for asset protection.

          4)  A summary total of the amount paid to date under  the
              long-term care partnership policy or certificate which
              qualifies for asset protection.

     b)  Asset protection reports shall be subject to audit by the
         Director.

 
Section 2018.150  Preparing a Service Summary
 
     a)  Every insurer shall prepare a service summary at the  insured's
         request specifically for the policyholder or  certificateholder
         applying for Medicaid.  The insurer  shall also prepare a service
         summary when the policyholder or certificateholder has exhausted
         benefits under the long-term care partnership policy or
         certificate or when the policy or certificate ceases to  be in
         force for a reason other than the death of the  policyholder or
         certificateholder, whichever occurs  first.

     b)  This Service Summary is separate and in addition to the
         information requirements of Section 2018.130.  The  service
         summary shall identify the following:

          1)  The specific long-term care partnership policy or
              certificate.

          2)  The total benefits paid for services rendered to  date.

          3)  The amount qualifying for asset protection.

     c)  A copy of the service summary shall be sent to the  DPA 30 days
         before the exhaustion of the benefits.

 
Section 2018.160  Plan of Action
 
Every insurer shall submit to the DOI a plan for complying with  the
information maintenance and documentation requirements set  forth in this
Part.  The documentation plan shall include the  following:

         policyholders or  certificateholders and on an individual basis
         for all  policyholders or certificateholders who have ever
         received any benefits.  Access to information on persons who have
         not applied for Medicaid is required in  order for the Director,
         or his or her appointed designee, to  determine if an insurer's
         system for documenting asset  protection is functioning correctly.
         The Director  shall have the final decision concerning the
         frequency  of access to the data and the size of samples for
         auditing or other purposes.

     c)  The name, job title, address, and telephone number  of the person
         primarily responsible for the maintenance  of the information
         required and for acting as liaison  with DPA and the DOI covering

The Director shall consult with DPA for all audits and examinations that
may be required to determine compliance with this Section.
 

Section 2018.180  Loss Ratio
 
Benefits under group and individual direct response and individual
long-term care partnership policies shall be deemed reasonable in relation
to premiums provided the lifetime anticipated loss ratio is at least sixty
percent (60%), calculated on  the basis of the ratio of the present value
of the expected  benefits to the present value of the expected premiums
over the  entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage.
In evaluating the lifetime anticipated loss ratio, consideration shall be
given to the following factors:

     a)  Statistical credibility of incurred claims experience  based on
         the following factors:  claim rates, variability in transaction
         costs, and number of lives exposed;

     b)  The period for which rates are computed to provide  coverage;

     c)  Experienced and projected trends;

     d)  Concentration of experience within early policy duration;

     e)  Expected claim fluctuation;

     f)  Experience refunds, adjustments or dividends;

     g)  Renewability features;

     h)  Interest;

     i)  Experimental nature of the coverage;

     j)  Product features such as long elimination periods  (period between
         when the claim arises and insured is  eligible to receive
         benefits), high deductibles and  high maximum limits.

 
Section 2018.190  Appropriateness of Recommended Purchase
 
In recommending the purchase or replacement of any long-term  care
partnership policy or certificate, an insurance producer  shall make
efforts to determine the appropriateness of a recommended purchase or
replacement, and the self-assessment guide  available from DoA or DOI shall
be provided.

 
Section 2018.200  Prohibition Against Pre-Existing Conditions  and Probationary Periods in Replacement Policies or Certificates
 
If a long-term care partnership policy or certificate replaces  another
long-term care partnership policy or certificate, the  replacing insurer
shall waive any time periods applicable to  pre-existing conditions and
probationary periods in the new  long-term care partnership policy for
similar benefits to the  extent that exclusions have been satisfied under
the original partnership policy.

         provide prominence equivalent to such  capitalization or
         underscoring.

     d)  Use of the text and sequence of text of the standard  format
         outline of coverage is mandatory.

     e)  The standard format, including style, arrangement and  overall
         appearance, and the content of an outline of  coverage appears in

                            [TELEPHONE NUMBER]
                   LONG-TERM CARE PARTNERSHIP INSURANCE
                            OUTLINE OF COVERAGE

Policy Number or Group Master Policy and Certificate Number]

     1.  This policy is [an individual policy of insurance] ([a  group
         policy] which was issued in the [indicate jurisdiction in which
         group policy was issued]).

     2.  PURPOSE OF OUTLINE OF COVERAGE.  This outline of coverage
         provides a very brief description of the important features  of
         the policy.  You should compare this outline of coverage  to
         outlines of coverage for other policies available to  you.  This
         is not an insurance contract, but only a summary  of coverage.
         Only the individual or group policy contains  governing
         contractual provisions.  This means that the  policy or group
         policy sets forth in detail the rights and  obligations of both
         you and the insurance company.  Therefore, if you purchase this
         coverage, or any other coverage,  it is important that you READ
         YOUR POLICY [OR CERTIFICATE] CAREFULLY!

     3.  TERMS UNDER WHICH THE POLICY OR CERTIFICATE MAY BE CONTINUED IN
         FORCE OR DISCONTINUED.

              include the following permissible policy renewability
              provisions:  Policies and certificates that are guaranteed
              renewable shall contain the following
              statement:  RENEWABILITY:  THIS POLICY [CERTIFICATE] IS
              GUARANTEED RENEWABLE.  This means you have the right, subject
              to  the terms of your policy [certificate], to continue  this
              policy as long as you pay your premiums on time.  [Company
              Name] cannot change any of the terms of your  policy on its
              own, except that, in the future, IT MAY INCREASE THE PREMIUM
              YOU PAY.

          b)  For group coverage, specifically include
              continuation/conversion provisions applicable to the
              certificate and group policy;

          c)  Include waiver of premium provisions or state that  there are
              no such provisions;

          d)  State whether the company has a right to change  premium, and
              if such right exists, include each circumstance under which
              premium may change.

     4.  TERMS UNDER WHICH THE POLICY OR CERTIFICATE MAY BE RETURNED AND
         PREMIUM REFUNDED.  [Provide a brief description of the  right to
         return -- "free look" provision of the policy.]

     5.  THIS IS NOT MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT COVERAGE.  If you are  eligible
         for Medicare, review the Medicare Supplement  Buyer's Guide
         available from the insurance company.
         [For agents] Neither [insert company name] nor its agents
         represent Medicare, the federal government or any state
         government.

     6.  LONG-TERM CARE PARTNERSHIP COVERAGE.  Policies of this  category
         are designed to provide coverage for one or more  necessary or
         medically necessary diagnostic, preventive,  therapeutic,
         rehabilitative, maintenance, or personal care  services, provided
         in a setting other than an acute care  unit of a hospital, such as
         in a nursing home, in the  community or in the home.

     7.  BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY.

          a)  (Covered services, related deductible(s), waiting  periods,
              elimination periods and benefit maximums.)

          b)  (Institutional benefits, by skill level.)

          c)  (Non-institutional benefits, by skill level.)

         [Any benefit screens must be explained in this Section.  If  these
         screens differ for different benefits, explanation of  the screen
         should accompany each benefit description.  If  an attending
         physician or other specified person must  certify a certain level
         of functional dependency in order  to be eligible for benefits,
         this too must be specified.    If activities of daily living
         (ADLs) are used to measure an  insured's need for long-term care,
         then these qualifying  criteria or screens must be explained.]

          a)  Preexisting conditions;

          b)  Non-eligible facilities/provider;

          c)  Non-eligible levels of care (e.g., unlicensed providers, care
              or treatment provided by a family member,  etc.);

          d)  Exclusions/exceptions;

          e)  Limitations.)

         [This Section should provide a brief specific description  of any
         policy provisions which limit, exclude, restrict,  reduce, delay,
         or in any other manner operate to qualify  payment of the benefits
         described in (6) above.]

     9.  RELATIONSHIP OF COST OF CARE AND BENEFITS.

         Because the  costs of long-term care services will likely increase
         over  time, you should consider whether and how the benefits of
         this plan may be adjusted.  [As applicable, indicate the
         following:

          a)  That the benefit level will not increase over time;

          b)  Any automatic benefit adjustment provisions;

          c)  Whether the insured will be guaranteed the option to  buy
              additional benefits and the basis upon which benefits will be
              increased over time if not by a specified  amount or
              percentage;

          d)  If there is such a guarantee, include whether additional
              underwriting or health screening will be required,  the
              frequency and amounts of the upgrade options, and  any
              significant restrictions or limitations;

          e)  And finally, describe whether there will be any additional
              premium charge imposed, and how that is to be  calculated.]

     10. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER ORGANIC BRAIN DISORDERS.

         (State that the policy provides coverage for insureds  clinically
         diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease or  related degenerative
         and dementing illnesses.  Specifically  describe each benefit
         screen or other policy provision  which provides preconditions to
         the availability of policy  benefits for such an insured.)

     11. PREMIUM.

          a)  State the total annual premium for the policy;

          b)  If the premium varies with an applicant's choice among
              benefit options, indicate the portion of annual premium
              which corresponds to each benefit option.

     12. ADDITIONAL FEATURES.

          a)  Indicate if medical underwriting is used;

          b)  Describe other important features.

Section 2101.10  Legal Reserve Life Blank Prescribed
 
Assessment companies operating under Article XVI and Article XXI
of the Illinois Insurance Code will report their transactions on
the legal reserve life annual statement blank.

     a)  The signature of the actuary on page 1 of the annual
         statement will be taken to mean that he personally was
         responsible for the calculation of the actuarial
         liabilities.

     b)  Companies having non-tabular business will show the
         amount representing the balance of the non-tabular fund
         at line 27, page 3.  Line 29, page 3, must include only
         the surplus in the tabular fund.  Tabular and
         non-tabular business will be separated and shown in
         separate columns on page 5 and all supporting exhibits.

          1)  Transactions involving guarantee fund certificates
              are to be shown in the surplus account, lines 34 to
              51, on page 4.

          2)  Coupons guaranteed under the terms of life
              insurance contracts are contract payments and are
              to be shown on line 9, page 4, and should not be
              included in dividends to policyholders, line 29,
              page 4.

     c)  All policy, membership and other fees formerly shown on
         line 5, page 2, of the assessment blank should be shown
         in gross on page 7, Exhibit 1.  The amount paid to or
         retained by agents is to be included on lines 23 to 25
         on page 7.

     d)  All properties are to be shown individually in Schedule

         A.  Permission to summarize will not apply to assessment
         companies.

          1)  Schedule B.  Instead of the five-page schedule in
              the life blank,  assessment companies will continue
              to file a one-page schedule showing all mortgages
              owned and their classification.

          2)  Schedule G.  All payments over $3000 will be shown
              as formerly.  Part 1 will be ignored and the
              amounts shown in Part 2.

          3)  Special interrogatories will be supplied on a
              separate page which will be inserted along with
              Schedule B.

Section 2301.10  Authority
 
This Rule is promulgated by the Director of Insurance under
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code, which empowers the
Director "to make reasonable rules and regulations as may be
necessary for making effective..." the insurance laws of this
State.  The purpose of this Part is to implement Section 397 of
the Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 2301.20  Scope
 
This Part shall apply to any company licensed to do an insurance
business in this State that is transacting the kind of business
described as Class 3(a) of Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance
Code (Ill. Rev Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 616).  This Part shall

The printed form of the policy together with optional first page

is hereby designated as the Standard Policy for fire and
lightning insurance of the State of Illinois. All policies or
contracts of such insurance issued or delivered by an insurer
subject to the provisions of the Illinois Insurance Code or by
any agent or representative thereof on any property in this State

is used, shall for the purpose of concurrence of contract be
deemed to be the Standard Policy.

 
Section 2301.40  Information To Be Printed on Policy
 
There shall be printed at the head of the policy, the spacing of
which, as to the first page, shall be optional, the name of the

In a policy in which contingent liability of members or

indemnifying clause.  Any insurer may also print upon the policy
such regulations or provisions as may be required by its home
state or such as may be appropriate to or required by its form of
organization or plan of operation.  There may be substituted for
the word "Company" where it appears in the policy, another term
more accurately descriptive of the insurer.

 
Section 2301.60  Contracts or Endorsements Against Other Perils
 
Appropriate forms of contracts or endorsements, whereby the
interest in the property described in such policy shall be

assume, may be used in connection with the Standard Policy.  Such
other contracts or endorsements attached to or printed thereon
may contain provisions and stipulations  inconsistent with the
Standard Policy to the  extent they are applicable only to such
other perils.  Subject to the approval of the Director, the first
page of the Standard Policy may be rearranged to provide space
for the listing of rates and premiums for coverages insured

thereof specifying the hour of the day at which the insurance

binder or contract of temporary insurance.

contracts, riders or endorsements to be attached to the Standard
Policy to be used by each insurer shall be filed with the

requirements and subject to the provisions of Section 143 of the
Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 755).

 
Section 2301.90  Applicability

of marine and transportation insurance, or to policies of

                             WARNING

                         PURCHASING THIS COVERAGE MAY VOID OR
                         LIMIT OTHER INSURANCE SUCH AS A

                         COVERING YOUR CONTENTS.  PLEASE READ ANY
                         SUCH POLICIES YOU HAVE.

                    ii)  On applications, the above described
                         warning shall appear immediately above
                         the space provided for the applicant's
                         signature.

                   Insurance, the above warning may be modified
                   if done so with substantially similar wording
                   to convey the intent and purpose of the
                   warning.

          9)  Certificates:

              Each certificate shall:

               A)  show the name and address of the master
                   policyholder and the certificate holder.

               B)  Provide that loss payments shall be made to
                   all insureds as their interest may appear at
                   the time of loss for property pledged as
                   collateral for loans.

               C)  Provide for repair or replacement of the
                   damaged property, or in the event of a cash
                   settlement, provide that payment shall be made
                   to the creditor to reduce or extinguish the
                   unpaid indebtedness with any excess payable to
                   the  purchaser when insuring property
                   purchased or sold under the terms of any open
                   end charge account or closed end installment
                   sales contract.

               D)  Have a description of the insured property;

                    i)   All insured items shall have a specific
                         description and shall have a specific
                         amount of coverage shown for each item
                         unless records are maintained and are
                         available to determine every item
                         insured and the amount of insurance
                         applicable thereto.  When insurance is
                         provided on a replacement cost basis, a
                         specific amount of insurance is not
                         required.  These records shall also be
                         maintained in sufficient detail and in a
                         form readily available to the Director
                         of Insurance or his designee in order to
                         verify every item insured and the amount
                         of insurance applicable thereto.

                    ii)  Items pledged as collateral for loans,
                         not related to the purchase or sale of
                         said items, may be collectively rather
                         than specifically described and one
                         amount of coverage may be shown for the
                         entire collateral.

               E)  Contain the following provisions of the master
                   policy:

                    i)   Perils insured against.

                    ii)  Cancellation provisions.

                    iii) All provisions applicable to claims.

               F)  Contain wording advising that it is necessary
                   to refer to the master policy for the entire
                   contract wording and state where, in the State
                   of Illinois, such master policy may be seen.

               G)  Contain the provisions set forth in Section
                   2302.40(c) of this Part.

          10) Each master policy or a certified duplicate thereof
              shall be maintained within the State of Illinois
              and shall be available for inspection, during usual
              business hours, by any holder of a certificate
              issued under such master policy.

     b)  Rates:

          1)  Each company shall file with the Director of
              Insurance each rate, rule and minimum premium
              before it is used in the State of Illinois.

          2)  All filings must be accompanied by:

               A)  a letter of submission, in duplicate,

               B)  the subject rates and rules, in duplicate,
                   showing the company name and identifying the
                   forms to which they will apply,

               C)  a proposed effective date,

               D)  notification as to whether the filing is new
                   or supersedes a present filing with
                   identification of all superseded filings.

          3)  The Director of Insurance may require the filing of
              statistical data and any other pertinent
              information necessary to determine the manner of
              promulgation and the acceptability or
              unacceptability of a filing for rules, minimum
              premiums, rates, forms or any combination thereof.
              All rates and minimum premiums shall be based upon
              sound actuarial principles.  Rates shall not be
              inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory.

          4)  Companies under the same ownership or general
              management shall make separate individual filings
              for each company wishing to use such material.
              Companies shall not file collectively as a group.

          5)  Minimum Premiums:

               A)  may be established for use with master
                   policies.

               B)  shall not be used for premiums charged on
                   certificates of insurance.  Certificate
                   holders may not be charged a premium that is
                   greater than the premium developed by
                   multiplying the rate times the amount of
                   coverage provided for said certificate holder.

     c)  Coverage Acceptance or Rejection By Insured Certificate
         Holder:

          1)  Such insureds shall be allowed fifteen (15) days
              after receiving a certificate of insurance to
              determine if the coverage is to remain in effect or
              is to be cancelled without any premium being
              earned.

          2)  If loss(es) occurs after the insured has signed an
              application for the coverage and before or during
              the above mentioned fifteen days and the insured
              has not given the insurer or the master
              policyholder evidence of his rejection of the
              coverage, such loss(es) shall be paid and the
              premiums shall be charged for the time coverage is
              in force.  Making any claim during this said period
              of time constitutes acceptance of the coverage by
              the insured.

          3)  If, during the fifteen days following the insureds
              receipt of the certificate of insurance, the
              insured chooses to reject the subject coverage and
              no loss has been claimed by said insured, the
              coverage shall be cancelled as of its effective
              date and without any premium being charged.  Any
              premium which may have been paid shall, in the
              event of such rejection, be returned to the
              insured.  Thereafter, no claims may be made under
              the subject coverage.

          4)  Computation of earned premium for cancellation,
              other than as described above, by insured
              certificate holder, may be on a short-rate basis.
              Such short-rate change shall not be more than ten
              percent (10%) in excess of the earned premium
              computed on a prorata basis.

          5)  When coverage is revised or cancelled and
              rewritten, earned premium shall be computed on a
              pro-rata basis.  Coverage shall continue without
              interruption and the revised or rewritten coverage
              shall be charged rates not to exceed those charged
              prior to the revision or rewriting.

     d)  Insurable Items and Determination of Amounts of
         Coverage:

          1)  The amounts of insurance provided applicable to
              items pledged as  collateral for loans or purchased
              or sold under the terms of any closed end
              transaction shall be exclusive of:

               A)  insurance premiums,

               B)  interest, carrying or finance charges;

               C)  service charges,

               D)  warranty charges,

               E)  other charges added to the net price of the
                   items.

          2)  The item(s) to be insured shall only be tangible
              property.

     e)  Revolving Charge Accounts.

         The company shall maintain sufficient records to provide
         satisfactory evidence for the Director of Insurance or
         his designee to determine that for each group policy
         written the average amount of insurance for the debtor
         of each group is at least equal to or greater than the
         value of tangible property insured for such debtors.

This Rule is promulgated by the Director of Insurance pursuant to
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981
ch. 73, para. 1013) which empowers the Director "...to make
reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for
making..." effective the insurance laws of this State, Section
155.23, of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch.
73, para. 767.23) which specifically empowers the Director "...to
promulgate reasonable rules requiring insurance companies
licensed in the State...to report factual information in their
possession which is pertinent to...property insurance
claims,...after he has made a determination that such information
is necessary to detect fraud or arson" and Section 155.23 (2) of
the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 19181, ch. 73, para.
767.23) which empowers the Director "to designate one or more
data processing organizations or governmental agencies to assist
the Director in gathering such information and making
compilations thereof..."  This rule implements Section 155.23 of
the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981 ch. 73 para.
767.23).

 
Section 2303.20  Purpose and Scope
 
This Rule will establish a uniform and required system for the
reporting and collection of information on certain property loss
claims from all companies doing business in this State.  The
objective of the system will be detection of commonalities which
may be indicative of arson fraud and require further
investigation by appropriate State and/or Federal authorities.

This Rule will:

     a)  designate the Property Insurance Loss Register ("PILR")
         as the entity to which all companies shall report
         certain factual information in their possession which is
         pertinent to property loss claims resulting from losses
         due to fire, lightning or explosion as they occur,

     b)  establish a uniform format and procedure for reporting
         property loss information to PILR, and

     c)  designate the State Fire Marshal's Office as the
         recipient of information compiled by PILR.

 
Section 2303.30  Definitions
 
         A "company" as used in this rule means any entity which
         is defined as a "company" in Section 2 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981 ch. 73, para. 614)
         the Illinois Fair Plan Association, surplus lines
         carrier, or any other entity which issues or delivers in
         this State policies or contracts for property insurance.
         "Property loss" as used in this rule means any claim on
         real estate and/or the personal property contained
         therein amounting to $1,000 or more resulting from loss
         due to fire and lightning or explosion when fire ensues.
         The term "Property Insurance Loss Register" or its
         acronym "PILR" as used in this Rule means the non-profit
         organization administered by the American Insurance
         Association and currently headquartered at 700 New
         Brunswick Avenue, Rahway, New Jersey.
         The term "PILR Loss Report Form" as used in this Rule
         means the form as set forth in Exhibit A attached to and
         made a part of this Rule.

 
Section 2303.40  Procedure
 
     a)  Each company shall be required to report accurate
         information and mail to PILR a PILR Loss Report Form
         within 30 days following the company's receipt of notice
         of a property loss.  (See Exhibit A for proper format)
         Each company shall retain a copy of the completed PILR
         form.  PILR will code the reported information and
         conduct a computer search of its Data Bank to determine
         whether the information is similar to information in the
         PILR Data Bank.

     b)  The State Fire Marshal is designated the recipient of
         search analysis reports from the PILR Data Bank for the
         purpose of determining whether a loss claim merits
         further investigation.  Search analysis reports will be
         sent directly to the State Fire Marshal and, if a report
         company is also a subscribing member of PILR, to the
         subscriber.

     c)  The Director of Insurance specifically exempts the
         following companies from complying with this
         Rule:  District, County and Township mutual companies.

 
Section 2303.50  Severability Provision
 
If any Section or portion of a Section of this Rule or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of the rule or the
applicability of such provision to other persons or circumstances
shall not be affacted thereby.

         of Insurance prior to their use, and

         jurisdictional objection, if such objection is raised at or before
         the time the party files his answer or motion, or, if no answer or
         motion is made, before the commencement of the hearing.

Section 2402.120  Intervention

     a)  Upon timely written application, the Hearing Officer shall permit

              affected by a final order arising from the hearing; or

          2)  when a party's circumstances and the hearing proceeding have
              a question of law or fact in common.

     b)  Two copies of a petition for intervention shall be filed with the
         Department (one for the Department attorney and one for the
         Hearing Officer) and one copy served on each additional party no
         later than 48 hours prior to the date set for hearing of the
         matters set forth in the Notice of Hearing.  The Hearing Officer
         may permit later intervention when there is good cause for the
         delay.

     c)  An intervenor shall have all the rights of an original party,
         except that the Hearing Officer may, in his Order allowing
         intervention, provide that the applicant shall be bound by Orders
         theretofore entered or by evidence theretofore received, that the
         applicant shall not raise issues which might more properly have
         been raised at an earlier stage of the proceeding, that the
         applicant shall not raise new issues or add new parties, or that
         in other respects the applicant shall not interfere with the
         control of the Hearing, as justice and the avoidance of undue
         delay may require.

 
Section 2402.130  Postponement on Continuance of Hearing
 
A hearing may be postponed or continued for due cause by the Director or
the Hearing Officer upon their own motion or upon motion of a party to the
hearing.  Notice of any postponement or continuance shall be given in
writing to all parties to the hearing within a reasonable time in advance
of the previously scheduled Hearing date.  All parties involved in a
hearing shall attempt to avoid undue delay caused by repetitive
postponements or continuances so that the subject matter of the hearing may
be resolved expeditiously.

 
Section 2402.140  Authority of a Hearing Officer

              introduction of proof;

          4)  the limitation of the number of witnesses;

     e)  All depositions and interrogatories taken pursuant to this Rule
         shall be for purpose of discovery only, except as herein provided.

         arguable interpretation of substantive law, the Hearing Officer
         shall admit such evidence.

     d)  A party may conduct examinations or cross-examinations without
         rigid adherence to formal rules of evidence, provided the
         examination or cross-examination can be shown to be necessary and

         the hearing.

     a)  Oral proceeding at which evidence is presented shall be recorded
         either by a certified court reporter or a mechanical recording

         who shall pay for the transcription of the portion requested,
         except as otherwise provided by the Department or by law.  Any
         transcription will be retained through and including the time
         allotted for appeal, revision, rehearing or other manner of review
         prior to final deposition as provided for by the Department or by
         law.

     b)  The transcript and the record offered in connection with the
         hearing shall constitute the official record.  Before the

         any person, examine the transcript for accuracy and then within a
         reasonable time certify that it is a true and correct transcript

         of Fact which may control the decision or order, the decision or
         order shall include a ruling upon each proposed finding.  Each
         conclusion of law shall be supported by authority or reasoned
         opinion.  A decision or order shall not be made except upon
         consideration of the record as a whole or such portion thereof as

         hearing shall be filed within 10 days of the date of mailing of

         be amended or vacated after rehearing.

 
Section 2402.290  Ex Parte Contacts
 
     a)  Except as to such matters which by law are subject to disposition
         on an ex parte basis, the Hearing Officer, any employee (or
         superior thereof) of the Department Division involved in the
         hearing, and any party to a hearing shall not make an unauthorized
         ex parte communication directly or indirectly about any matter

              upon all parties to the hearing,

          2)  any oral communication of any kind about the hearing unless:

               A)  48 hours advance written notice that it will be made is
                   given by the communicator to all parties to the hearing
                   (including the Department counsel); or

               B)  its contents are disclosed by the communicator at the
                   time of its presentation to all the parties to the
                   hearing (including the Department counsel); or

               C)  the substance of the contents of the oral communication
                   is reduced to writing and personal or telegraphic
                   service of copies thereof is made by the communicator
                   within 24 hours following the presentation of the oral
                   communication upon all parties to the hearing (including
                   the Department counsel).

     c)  Authorized ex parte communications shall consist of:

          1)  any communication made openly or on the record at a scheduled
              hearing, regardless of whether all the parties are present;

          2)  any oral or written communication which is authorized by
              statute or Department rule, or to which all parties agree, or
              which the Director formally rules may be made on an ex parte
              basis;

          3)  any oral or written request for information solely with
              respect to the status of a hearing;

          4)  any communication made with respect to a hearing about which
              no public notice has been issued, if the communicator has no
              actual notice of the pendency of the hearing;

          5)  any oral or written communication of facts or contentions
              which have general significance for the insurance industry
              and which the communicator cannot reasonably be expected to
              know that the facts or contentions are material to a
              substantive or procedural issue in a pending hearing;

          6)  any communication by persons other than:

               A)  a party seeking to intervene in a hearing; or

               B)  a party who might be adversely affected by a
                   determination in the hearing; or

               C)  a party who intercedes in a hearing by volunteering a
                   communication which he may reasonably be expected to
                   know might advance or adversely affect the interest of a
                   particular participant in a hearing, whether or not he
                   acts with the knowledge or consent of any participant or
                   participant's agent; or

               D)  an agent of any of the foregoing parties described in
                   Section 2402.290 (c) (6).

          7)  any oral or written communication between employees of the
              Department.  The Hearing Officer, or the Director may
              communicate with employees of the Department to obtain their
              aid and advice of technical matters which fall within the
              area of expertise of the employee consulted.

     d)  If the Hearing Officer or any employee of the Department or any
         party to a hearing receives a written communication which he knows
         is unauthorized, or which he concludes, in fairness, should be
         brought to the attention of all parties to the hearing, he shall
         transmit the communication promptly to the Director, together with
         a written statement of the circumstances under which it was made,
         if they are not apparent from the communication itself.  Upon
         receiving the communication, the Director shall place it and any
         accompanying statement in the Department file, concerning the
         hearing to which the communication relates, and he shall send
         copies of the communication to all parties to the hearing, to the
         Hearing Officer, and to the Department counsel, and he shall
         notify the communicator of the provisions of this Rule prohibiting
         ex parte communications.  He may also institute such sanctions
         against the communicator as he may deem appropriate and in
         accordance with the sanction provisions of this Rule.  Whenever
         the Director determines that the communications he receives are
         either so voluminous or of a borderline relevance to the issues in
         the hearing so as to constitute the procedure of sending copies to
         all parties too burdensome, he may instead notify all parties to
         the hearing that the communications have been received and placed
         in the Department files where they are available for examination.

     e)  If the Hearing Officer or any employee of the Department or any
         party to a Hearing receives an oral communication which he knows
         is unauthorized, or which he concludes, in fairness, should be
         brought to the attention of all parties to the Hearing, he shall
         put the substance of the communication in writing and transmit the
         writing promptly to the Director, together with a written
         statement of the circumstances under which the communication was
         made.  Upon receiving the writing, the Director shall place it and
         any accompanying statement in the Department files, concerning the
         Hearing to which the communication relates, and he shall send
         copies of the writing to all parties to the Hearing, to the
         Hearing Officer, and to the Department Counsel, and he shall
         notify the communicator of the provisions of this Rule prohibiting
         ex parte communications.  He may also institute such sanctions
         against the communicator as he may deem appropriate and in
         accordance with the sanction provisions of this Rule.  Whenever
         the Director determines that writings containing the substance of
         the communications are either so voluminous or of a borderline
         relevance to the issues in the Hearing so as to constitute the
         procedure for sending copies to all parties too burdensome, he may
         instead notify all parties to the hearing that the communications
         have been received and placed in the Department file where they
         are available for examination.

     f)  All parties to a hearing, including Department Counsel, may
         request of the Hearing Officer an opportunity to answer any
         allegations or contentions contained in any unauthorized ex parte
         communication or in any other ex parte communication brought to
         the attention of the parties in accordance with the provisions of
         this Rule.  The Hearing Officer will grant such requests whenever
         he determines  that the dictates of fairness so require.

     g)  The Director may, to the extent not prohibited by law, institute
         and enforce any or all of the following sanctions against any
         party who makes, or solicits the making of an authorized ex parte

         communication:

          1)  deny the relief, benefit or action sought by the party or
              parties to the hearing;

          2)  report any such unauthorized communication made by licensed
              professional persons to the appropriate disciplinary
              authorities  of the respective profession of the person
              involved;

          3)  censure, suspend, or dismiss any Department employee in
              accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Civil Service
              Code, when applicable.

 
Section 2402.295  Cancellation/Non-Renewal Hearing
 
     a)  Any section of this Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the
         procedures set out in this Section shall apply for all hearings
         conducted into the cancellation/non-renewal of an insurance policy
         pursuant to Section 143.23 of the Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.
         1981, ch. 73, 755.23).

          1)  Parties--The parties to a cancellation/non-renewal hearing
              shall be the individual insureds named on the policy which
              has been cancelled or non-renewed and the insurance company
              that issued the policy.  No intervention by any other party
              or persons shall be allowed.

          2)  Atorneys--An attorney shall not be required.  If an attorney
              is engaged, an appearance in accordance with Section 2402.70
              of this Rule is required.

          3)  Motion--All motions shall be presented at the commencement of
              the hearing.  All motions shall become part of the record.

          4)  Conduct of Hearing--The Hearing Officer shall conduct the
              hearing in the following manner:

              The insured shall proceed first and present his/her case in
              the narrative.  The company may ask relevant questions at the
              conclusion of the insured's narrative.   The company shall
              then proceed and present its case in the narrative.  The
              insured may ask relevant questions at the conclusion of the
              company's narrative.

              At the conclusion of all narratives and questions, if any,
              the Hearing Officer shall take the matter under advisement
              and enter his/her recommendations to the Director within 5
              days.

          5)  Record--The record of the hearing shall be comprised of the
              Hearing Officer's notes and all documents and motions
              introduced, if no transcription of the proceedings is
              requested.  The Hearing Officer may use a tape recorder to
              assist in the taking of notes.  A party may request that the
              proceedings be transcribed by a court reporter as provided in
              Section 2402.240.  This request shall be made at least one
              week before the hearing date, or less if a court reporter can
              be scheduled.

          6)  Hearing Officer's Recommendations--The Hearing Officer shall
              provide written recommendations and findings to the Director
              within 5 days after the close of the hearing.  The Hearing
              Officer's recommendations shall be limited to one of the
              following:

               A)  The actions of the insurance company were incorrect and
                   the company must retain the risk; or

               B)  The actions of the insurance company were correct and
                   the company need not retain the risk.

     b)  The procedures set forth in this Section are intended to provide a
         less formal setting for cancellation/non-renewal hearings.  These
         procedures shall apply only to cancellation/non-renewal hearings
         and no others.  Any Section of this Rule which does not conflict
         with these procedures is to be followed, with careful attention
         given to the overall informality of cancellation/non-renewal
         hearings.

 
Section 2402.300  Existing Statutory or Department Procedures and Practices
 
This Rule shall not be construed to limit or repeal additional requirements
imposed by Statute or otherwise, nor to charge existing Department
procedures which are equivalent to or exceed the standards of
administrative procedure prescribed in this Rule.

Section 2602.10  Authority

This Rule is promulgated by the Director of Insurance under
Section 401 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, Section 1013) of the
Illinois Insurance Code which empowers the Director ". . . to
make reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for

(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73, pars. 766.6(d) and (e) and 1028 et
seq.) of the Illinois Insurance Code.  Failure to adhere to the
standards herein set forth shall subject the offender, in
addition to any other penalties or remedies provided by law, to
proceedings under Article XXVI of the Illinois Insurance Code.

 
Section 2602.20  Purpose
 
The purpose of this Rule is to establish as an Unfair and
Deceptive Act and Practice the reduction or denial of any claim
to satisfy a previous overpayment except in accordance with this
Rule.  Compliance with this Rule shall be accomplished as set
forth in Section 2602.40 of this Part.

 
Section 2602.30  Scope
 
This Rule shall apply to all companies authorized to write the
class or classes of business set forth in Clause b of Class 1 or
Clause a of Class 2 of Section 4 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 73,
par. 616) of the Illinois Insurance Code as they apply to those
specific clauses.

 
Section 2602.40  Standards
 
No company shall withhold any portion of any benefit payable as
the result of a claim on the basis that the sum withheld is an
adjustment or correction for an overpayment made on a prior claim
arising under the same policy unless:

     a)  The company has within its files clear, documented
         evidence of overpayment and written authorization from
         the insured permitting such withholding procedure, or

     b)  The company has within its files clear, documented
         evidence of all of the following:

          1)  The amount of the claim payment was clearly
              erroneous under the provisions of the policy.  If
              the amount is the subject of a legitimate dispute
              between the insured and the company as to coverage
              or other policy provisions, this procedure may not
              be used.

          2)  The error which resulted in the payment is not a
              mistake of law.

          3)  The company notifies the insured in writing within
              six (6) months of the date of the error, or within
              twelve (12) months for errors arising from billing
              errors made by providers of services or treatment
              on the compensable claim.  Such six (6) or twelve
              (12) months period shall be measured from the date
              of the claim check or draft which contains the
              erroneous payment.

          4)  Such notice states clearly the nature of the error
              and the states the amount of the overpayment.

 
Section 2602.50  Limitation
 
A company may use the procedure set forth in Section 2602.40(b)
of this Rule provided that the claim used to adjust the first
overpayment is made no later than 3 years after the date of the
error.

Nothing herein shall be in any way interpreted as a limitation of
any kind on the right of any company to use the courts of any
state.

 
Section 2602.60  Exemptions
 
This Rule shall not apply to any group or blanket contracts or to
adjustments between different payments on the same claim.

 
Section 2602.70  Effective Date
 
This Rule shall become effective April 1, 1976, and shall apply
to all claims made on or after that date.

SOURCE:  Filed May 26, 1976, effective July 1, 1976; codified at

Section 2603.10  Authority
 

This Part is promulgated by the Director of Insurance pursuant to
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat.,
1981, ch. 73, Section 1013), which empowers the Director "...to
make reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for
making effective..." the insurance laws of this State.  This Part
implements Sections 236, 355a, 364 and 424(1) of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat., 1981, ch. 73, pars. 848, 967a,
976, 1031(1)).  Failure to adhere to the standards herein set
forth shall subject the offender, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, to proceedings under Article XXVI of

Section 2603.20  Purpose and Scope
 

The purpose of this Part is to eliminate unfair discrimination
based upon sex, sexual preference or marital status in the terms
and conditions of insurance contracts and in the underwriting
criteria of insurance carriers.  This Part shall apply to all
companies authorized to do an insurance business in this State of
the kind or kinds of business described in Class 1(a), 1(b) or
Class 2(a) of Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
Stat. 1981, ch. 73, par. 616), all companies licensed in

Rev. Stat., 1981, ch. 32, par. 551, et seq), the Voluntary Health
Services Plans Act (Ill. Rev. Stat., 1981, ch. 32, par. 595, et
seq), the Medical Service Plan Act (Ill. Rev. Stat., 1981, ch.
32, par. 563, et seq), the Health Maintenance Organization Act

all Fraternal Benefit Societies licensed in accordance with
article XVII of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev, Stat.,
1981, ch. 73, par. 894, et seq).  This regulation shall not
affect the rights of fraternal benefit societies as specified in
Sections 283 and 296(6) of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
Stat., 1981, ch. 73, pars. 895 and 908(6)).

 
Section 2603.30  Prohibited Practices
 

No company shall refuse to issue any contract of insurance,
certificate of insurance, notices of proposed insurance,
policies, endorsements or riders or decline to renew such
contract, certificate, notice, policy, endorsement or rider
because of the sex, sexual preference or marital status of the
insured or prospective insured.  The amount of benefits payable
or any term, condition or type of coverage shall not be
restricted, modified, excluded or reduced on the basis of the
sex, sexual preference or marital status of the insured or
prospective insured.  All underwriting criteria shall be applied
in all instances of similar circumstances without regard to the
sex, sexual preference or marital status of the insured or
prospective insured.  Where benefits for elective procedures are
offered, they must be offered equally.

     a)  Examples of the practices prohibited by this Section
         include, but are not limited to:

          1)  Offering coverage to males gainfully employed at
              home, employed part-time or employed by relatives
              while denying or offering reduced coverage to
              females similarly employed;

          2)  Denying policy riders because of an individual's
              sex, sexual preference or marital status;

          3)  Denying, cancelling or refusing to renew coverage,
              or providing coverage on different terms because
              the insured or prospective insured is residing with
              another person or persons of either sex not related
              by blood or marriage;

          4)  Reducing disability benefits for women who become
              disabled while not gainfully employed full-time
              out-side the home when a similar reduction is not
              applied to men;

          5)  Restricting availability of maternity coverages or
              benefits based upon marital status;

          6)  Offering dependent coverage to wives of male
              employees while denying dependent coverage to
              husbands of female employees;

          7)  Establishment of different conditions or benefit
              options based on an individual's sex, sexual
              preference or marital status.  This includes more
              restrictive benefit periods and more restrictive
              definitions of disability to women than to men
              except as permitted by this Part;

          8)  Requiring an applicant to submit to a medical
              examination because of the applicant's sex, sexual
              preference or marital status;

          9)  Denying to divorced or single persons coverage
              available to married persons;

          10) Denying disability income contracts of insurance,
              certificates of insurance, notices, policies,
              riders or endorsements to those in similar
              occupational classifications because of an
              individual's sex, sexual preference or marital
              status;

          11) Considering that portion of treatment attributed to
              complications of pregnancy in a manner different
              than any other illness or sickness covered by the
              contract, certificate, notice, policy, endorsement
              or rider;

          12) Limiting the amount of coverage an insured or
              prospective insured may purchase based upon the
              sex, sexual preference or marital status of the
              insured or prospective insured;

          13) Denying maternity coverages to an individual who
              has not purchased dependent or family coverage when
              maternity coverages are otherwise available.

     b)  Examples of practices not prohibited by this Section
         include, but are not limited to:

          1)  Offering annuity benefit amounts which differ (such
              as through the election of a settlement option in a
              Life Insurance Policy) based upon the individual's
              sex;

          2)  Taking marital status into account for the purpose
              of determining a spouse eligible for dependent
              benefits under a group or family policy; marital
              status of the named insured or certificate holder
              shall not be taken into account for the purpose of
              determining eligibility for dependent benefits with
              regard to natural or adopted children and to
              obligations as required by the courts.  When
              maternity benefits are provided, such benefits
              shall be applied to natural or adopted children who
              are covered as dependents.

 
Section 2603.40  Rates
 

     a)  No insurance company shall place a risk in a rating
         classification on the basis of sex, sexual preference or
         marital status or otherwise differentiate in rates on
         the basis of sex, sexual preference or marital status
         unless such classification or differentiation is based
         upon expected claim costs and expenses derived by
         applying sound actuarial principles to relevant and
         reasonably current company or intercompany studies,
         claim costs and expense experience.  Three years after
         the effective date of this Part no company shall charge
         a differential by sex, sexual preference or marital
         status larger than the differential indicated by the
         criterion stated in the preceding sentence.  An insurer
         shall, upon request of the Director of Insurance,
         justify to the Director that such classification or
         differentiation equitably and reasonably reflects
         differences in expected claim costs and expenses.

     b)  Effective July 1, 1976, unless otherwise specified, this
         Section shall apply to all previously issued contracts,
         notices, policies, endorsements or riders, which do not
         contain provisions for guaranteed rates, at the time of
         any future rate change.

 
Section 2603.50  Severability Provision
 

If any Section or portion of a Section of this Part, or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid by a court,  the remainder of the Part, or the
applicability of such provision or circumstance, shall not be
affected thereby.

 
Section 2603.60  Effective Date
 

This Part shall become effective July 1, 1976, and will apply to
all contracts, endorsements or riders issued on or after that
date.

Section 2801.10  Policies or Contracts of Insurance

Policies or contracts of insurance may not be placed with
companies not authorized to do business in Illinois  other than
through surplus line producers licensed pursuant to Section 445
of the Illinois Insurance Code (the Code) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987,
ch. 73, par. 1057).

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 11754, effective July 1,
         1988) 

 
Section 2801.20  License Expiration
 

A surplus line producer license issued pursuant to Section 445 of
the Illinois Insurance Code shall expire twelve (12) calendar
months after its issuance unless the license is renewed as
permitted by Section 2801.100 of this Part.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 11754, effective July 1,
         1988) 

 
Section 2801.30  Unauthorized Companies
 

     a)  A surplus line producer may procure insurance from an
         unauthorized company:

          1)  Which based upon information available to the
              surplus line producer has a policyholders' surplus
              of not less than $5,000,000 determined in
              accordance with accounting rules as set forth in
              the Illinois Insurance Code which are applicable to
              authorized companies, (Section 445 of the Code) and

          2)  which has standards of solvency and management
              which are adequate for the protection of
              policyholders (Section 445 of the Code).

     b)  Information available to the surplus line producer at
         the time of procurement includes financial information
         published by the unauthorized company, the financial
         information and quarterly listing of alien insurers
         published by the National Association of Insurance
         Commissioners' Non-Admitted Insurers Office and
         information published by Best's Insurance Reports or
         other independent market reporting agencies.

     c)  In determining whether the standards of solvency and
         management of an unauthorized company at the time of
         procurement are such that meet requirements necessary
         for the protection of policyholders, the surplus line
         producer shall consider the financial condition of the
         company, the ready acceptance of the company in
         responsible commercial markets, the general reputation
         of the company, and the company's past and current
         performance of its obligations.

     d)  When an unauthorized company does not meet the standards
         set forth in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Section
         or a surplus line producer is unable to verify such
         facts, the surplus line producer may procure insurance
         from that company only if prior written warning of such
         fact or condition is given to the insured by the
         insurance producer or surplus line producer. Evidence of
         the warning and its delivery shall be maintained by the
         insurance producer and surplus line producer, together
         with the evidence of coverage.  Such written warning
         shall be in a form substantially similar to the sample
         warning set forth in Illustration A of this Part.

     e)  If the Director at any time determines that the further
         assumption of risks might be hazardous to the
         policyholders of an unauthorized company, the Director
         shall order the Surplus Line Association of Illinois not
         to countersign insurance contracts evidencing insurance
         in such company.  Said determination will be made by
         examining the criteria contained in the Illinois
         Insurance Code for authorized companies.  In such event
         the Director shall also direct all surplus line
         producers to cease procuring insurance from such
         company.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 11754, effective July 1,
         1988) 

 
Section 2801.40  Maintenance of Funds in Illinois
 

Nothing contained in this Part shall be construed to prohibit an
unauthorized company from maintaining funds in Illinois to
service its business.

     (Source:  Section repealed, new Section adopted at 12 Ill.
         Reg. 11754, effective July 1, 1988) 

 
Section 2801.50  Procurement of Policies or Contracts
 

     a)  The Surplus Line producer must exert diligent effort to
         procure the policies or contracts required by the
         insureds from companies which are authorized to transact
         business in Illinois (Section 445 of The Code).
         Diligent effort by the Surplus Line producer shall be
         deemed to have been exercised if the Surplus Line
         producer or the referring  insurance producer shall
         submit a risk  to three or more authorized companies,
         which are engaged in writing in Illinois the type of
         coverage sought, or if there are no companies actually
         engaged in writing such coverage, the risk shall be
         submitted to companies which, in the Surplus Line
         producer's or the insurance producer's professional
         judgment, are the most likely to accept the risk.

     b)  Submission of insuring contracts to the Surplus Line
         Association of Illinois constitutes a certification by
         the surplus line producer or by the insurance producer
         who presented the risk to the surplus line producer for
         placement as a surplus line risk that after diligent
         effort the required insurance could not be procured from
         companies which are authorized to transact business in
         this State and that such procurement was otherwise in
         accordance with the surplus line law.

     (Source:  Amended at 12 Ill. Reg. 11754, effective July 1,
         1988) 

 
Section 2801.60  Record of Efforts to Procure Policies or Contracts
 
The surplus line producer must maintain with the copy of the
insurance that was placed a record of such diligent effort which
must state the name of the authorized companies and the
individuals contacted at each company who declined the risk.  If
the diligent effort was made by the insurance producer, the
surplus line producer must maintain a written record signed by
the insurance producer that the insurance producer made such
diligent effort, and the insurance producer must maintain a
record that states the name of the authorized companies and the
individuals contacted at each company who declined the risk.

     (Source:  Section repealed, new Section adopted at 12 Ill.
         Reg. 11754, effective July 1, 1988) 

 
Section 2801.70  Declinations of Artificial Coverage not Acceptable
 

     a)  Declinations by authorized companies for the following
         reasons do not qualify insurance to be placed under the
         surplus line law:

          1)  Artificial division of one coverage into two or
              more proposed contracts;

          2)  Differential in premium or rate quoted between an
              authorized company and an unauthorized company.

     b)  Declinations by authorized companies for the following
         reasons do qualify insurance to be placed under the
         surplus line law:

          1)  Underwriting reason pertaining to the risk or the
              class;

          2)  Size of the risk;

          3)  Coverage is not available except in combination
              with other coverage not required by the insured;

          4)  Required coverage is not acceptable in part to the
              authorized company although part of the coverage is
              acceptable and the unauthorized company will accept
              only the entire risk and not solely the rejected
              portion; and

          5)  Authorized companies will accept less than the
              amount of coverage required and the entire amount
              and not just part thereof will be accepted by
              unauthorized companies.

     (Source:  Section repealed, new Section adopted at 12 Ill.
         Reg. 11754, effective July 1, 1988) 

 
Section 2801.80  Surplus Line Association of Illinois
 

     a)  All surplus line insurance placed on Illinois risks must
         be submitted to the Surplus Line Association which will
         process and countersign the insurance  policies or
         contracts, keep records of the business written and
         report to the surplus line producers and to the Director
         pursuant to Sections 445 and 445.1 of the Code.  The
         Surplus Line Association shall report to the surplus
         line producers and the Director by July 15 each year the
         business processed by each surplus line producer during
         the six month period ending June 30, and by January 15
         each year the business processed by each surplus line
         producer during the six month period ending December 31
         of the previous year.

     b)  The Surplus Line Association is authorized to charge a
         fee to cover its cost of operations.  The fee is payable
         by the surplus line producer based on the same gross
         premiums which are subject to the surplus line tax.  The
         fee schedule is subject to the Director's approval.  The
         Director's approval of the fee schedule shall be
         determined from the annual audited financial report
         submitted to the Director by the Surplus Line
         Association.

         Reg. 11754, effective July 1, 1988) 

 
Section 2801.90  Separate Records and Accounts
 

Each Surplus Line producer must keep separate  accounts and
records of the business transacted under his Surplus Line
license, and these separate accounts and records  shall be open
at all times to the inspection of the Illinois Director of
Insurance or the members of his staff.

         1988) 

 
Section 2801.100  License Rejection or Renewal Refusal
 

Application for a surplus line producer license shall be
rejected, or renewal thereof refused, for failure:

     a)  To pay the tax required by Section 445 of the Illinois
         Insurance Code and by Section 12 of "An Act relating to
         the investigation and prevention of fire" (Ill. Rev.

     c)  to maintain the surety bond required by Section 445; or

     d)  to pay the fee due the Surplus Line Association; or

     e)  to exert diligent effort to secure the business required
         by an insured in duly authorized companies; or

     f)  to procure surplus line policies or contracts or
         coverage from companies that have at least $5,000,000 in
         policyholders surplus and have the standards of solvency
         or management necessary for the protection of
         policyholders; or

     g)  to process all surplus line business on Illinois risks

Section 2801.110  Service of Process
 

     a)  Service of process relating to any surplus line
         insurance which the Surplus Line Association receives
         from the Director shall be delivered to the surplus line
         producer for delivery to the unauthorized company.  The
         surplus line producer shall promptly forward any such
         process by the fastest, most reliable means to the
         unauthorized company or its designated representative
         for service of process.

     b)  Any unauthorized company which elects to do so may file
         a written request with the Surplus Line Association that
         service of process be forwarded directly to the company
         in which case the Surplus Line Association shall forward
         a copy of such process directly to the company and a
         copy to the surplus line producer.

RE:  (Name of Unauthorized Company)
     (Type of Coverage)

In accordance with Section 445 of the Illinois Insurance Code, I
hereby provide you with a written WARNING that the

              the reserves required by this Part together with any other
              unpaid liabilities, he shall then order the Pool
              Administrator to assess the individual Pool participants in
              an amount not less than necessary to correct the deficiency.

              agreement.

              participants, by reason of insolvency or otherwise, to pay
              assessments required by subsection(d)(1) above, the Director
              shall levy upon and collect from all group self-insurers an
              assessment to assure prompt payment of such unpaid
              compensation and medical services.

Section 2903.10  Authority
 
This Part is promulgated by the Director of Insurance under
Section 401 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985,
ch. 73, par. 1013), which empowers the Director to make
reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary for making
effective the insurance laws of this State.  This Part implements
Section 466 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985,
ch. 73, Section 1065.13).

 
Section 2903.20  Purpose and Scope
 
The purpose of this Part is to implement Section 466 of the
Illinois Insurance Code by requiring the recording and reporting
of premium, loss and expense experience for companies that write
workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance in order
to aid the Director of Insurance in determining whether rating
systems on file with the Department of Insurance for such
companies comply with the standards set forth in Section 456 of
the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 73 par.
1065.6).  This Part shall apply to all insurers licensed to write
workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance in this
State.

 
Section 2903.30  Statistical Agent
 
The Director of Insurance shall designate a statistical agent to
assist in the recording and reporting of premium, loss and
expense experience for workers' compensation and employers'
liability insurance required pursuant to this Part.  The
designated statistical agent shall, subject to the approval of
the Director of Insurance, develop a statistical reporting plan.
The Director shall approve the statistical reporting plan if it
meets the standards set out in Section 466(1) of the Illinois
Insurance Code.

 
Section 2903.40  Reporting
 
Every insurer who is a member or subscriber of the designated
statistical agent shall record and report its premium, loss and
expense experience to the agent in accordance with the
statistical reporting plan developed by the agent and approved by
the Director of Insurance.  Insurance companies that are not a
member or subscriber of the designated statistical agent must
record and report their premium, loss and expense experience to
the Director of Insurance in accordance with a filed statistical
reporting plan.  On an annual basis, the designated statistical
agent shall compile such statistics in a format approved by the
Director of Insurance and submit such compilation to the
Department of Insurance.  A format for the compilation of such
statistics will be approved by the Director if it provides a
complete summary (which includes but is not limited to direct
premiums written, direct premiums earned, losses paid, losses
incurred, loss reserves, and all expenses including loss
adjustment - both allocated and unallocated) of all data
collected under the statistical reporting plans and meets the
confidentiality requirements of Sections 466(1) of the Illinois
Insurance Code.

 
Section 2903.50  Statistical Plan
 
The statistical reporting plan approved by the Director of
Insurance shall be maintained by the Director of Insurance and
made available for public inspection.  In addition, a copy of
this plan shall be filed with the State Library of the Secretary
of State's Office.

Section 3109.10  Authority
 
This Part is promulgated pursuant to Section 401 of the Illinois
Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat., 1983, ch. 73, par. 1013) which
empowers the Director "....to make reasonable rules and
regulations as may be necessary for making effective...." the
insurance laws of this State.  This Part implements Sections
494.1, 495.1 and 497.1 of the Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev.
Stat. 1983, ch. 73, pars. 1065.41-1, 1065.42-1 and 1065.44-1).

     (Source:  Amended at 9 Ill. Reg. 5327, effective April 12,
         1985) 

 
Section 3109.20  Purpose and Scope
 
This Part establishes uniform procedure guidelines for
individuals conducting insurance business under an assumed name
or firm name.

     (Source:  Amended at 9 Ill. Reg. 5327, effective April 12,
         1985) 

 
Section 3109.30  Procedural Guidelines
 
     a)  Prior to a licensee transacting insurance business in
         this State under an assumed name, the licensee shall
         comply with "An Act in relation to the use of an assumed
         name in the conduct or transaction of business in this
         State" (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 96, pars. 4 et seq.).

     b)  Applicants operating under an assumed name  shall notify
         the Department in writing of the assumed name under
         which the individual will be operating prior to doing
         business in this State.  A name is not considered to be
         an assumed name for the purpose of this Part if it
         includes the individual's legal name under which the
         individual transacts business.

     c)  The assumed name of any individual or a firm name  shall
         not be the same as, or deceptively similar to the name
         or designation adopted by an insurance company
         authorized to transact business in Illinois or by a
         licensee of this Department.  The standard to be used
         for determining whether a name is deceptively similar is
         whether the use of the name is reasonably likely to
         confuse or mislead the public into the belief that the
         individual operating under an assumed name or a firm
         name is one and the same or closely associated with an
         insurance company licensed to transact insurance
         business in this State.

     d)  The words "Insurance Department," "Insurance Company,"
         "Policy Department" and other similar words or phrases
         shall not be used in any assumed name or firm name.  The
         words "Underwriters" and "Insurers" or other similar
         words or phrases shall not be used in any assumed name
         or firm name unless the word "agency" is included in the
         name and is appropriately positioned therein.

Section 3110.10  Application
 
The following rules apply to any person who shall notify the
Director of Insurance that while licensed other than temporarily

     a)  An Insurance Producer License in force on the date of
         entering military service shall continue in full force

         renewal application to qualify for license and without
         the payment of any further Insurance Producer license
         fee until the holder thereof is honorably discharged
         from military service.  The holder of such Insurance
         Producer license may continue to receive commissions and
         exercise all authorities granted by such existing
         license.

     b)  By executing a proper Power of Attorney and filing with
         the Director a certified copy thereof, any licensee in
         military service may designate an individual to act in
         his stead during his absence and to conduct his business
         for him.  The individual so designated shall fulfill all
         requirements of the law as to eligibility including the
         filing of an application, the completion of the required
         examination and the payment of the statutory fees.

     c)  If any change in the status of the existing licenses,
         other than the renewal thereof is desired while the
         licensee is in the military service, an application
         therefor shall be completed and filed with the Director.

     d)  Any examination fee in effect on the date of entering
         military service shall, from the date of honorable
         discharge, continue in effect for the unexpired period.

     a)  All licensees required to maintain a PFTA, pursuant to
         50 Ill. Adm. Code 3113.40(c), shall establish and
         maintain a PFTA in a financial institution.  All
         resident and quasi-resident licensees required to
         maintain a PFTA pursuant to this Section shall maintain
         such PFTA with one or more financial institutions
         located within the State of Illinois and subject to the
         jurisdiction of the Illinois courts.  Licensees are not
         required to maintain a separate PFTA for each insurer
         unless required by an insurer(s).

     b)  All licensees required to maintain a PFTA, pursuant to
         50 Ill. Adm. Code 3113.40(c), shall certify at each
         license extension date that premiums are held in a PFTA.
         The account must be designated Premium Fund Trust
         Account on the bank records and those words shall be
         displayed on the face of the checks of that account.

     c)  A PFTA must be established and maintained if a licensee:

          1)  Holds any premiums for 15 days or more before
              remitting to an insurer or other licensee.

          2)  Deposits any collected premiums into a financial
              institution account or other account or uses the
              premiums, even though the premiums are remitted
              within 15 days.

     d)  The absence of a PFTA does not relieve the licensee of
         the obligation to hold the premiums in a fiduciary
         capacity, and the premiums shall not be used for other
         purposes.

     e)  All licensees who maintain or are required to maintain a
         PFTA must deposit all premiums received into the PFTA.

     f)  Non-premium monies received by the licensee for
         soliciting, negotiating, effecting, procuring, renewing,
         continuing or binding policies of insurance may be
         deposited into the PFTA.  Examples of non-premium monies
         are service fees, policy fees, late charges, inspection
         fees and surplus lines premium taxes.

     g)  All monies deposited into the PFTA are considered to be
         fiduciary funds until lawfully withdrawn.

     h)  The following disbursements may be lawfully withdrawn
         from the PFTA:

          1)  Net or gross premium remittances due other
              licensees or insurers.  Claims payments or
              reinsurance premiums when offset at the direction
              of the insurer may be transferred to another
              account;

          2)  Return premiums due insureds;

          3)  Commissions due the licensee, net of any financial
              institution fees or service charges, or commissions
              due another licensee only when the commission
              withdrawal is matched and identified with premiums
              previously deposited into the PFTA;

          4)  Non-premium monies when matched and identified with
              prior non-premium PFTA deposits;

          5)  Interest or other revenue which the licensee is
              authorized to retain.

          6)  Withdrawals pursuant to Subsections
              3113.40(h)(3),(4) and(5) must be made payable to
              the licensee or another licensee.

     i)  The PFTA shall not be used as a general operating
         account or claim payment account.

     j)  The PFTA balance in the financial institution shall at
         all times be the amount deposited less lawful
         withdrawals.  If the balance in the financial
         institution is less than the amount deposited less
         lawful withdrawals, the licensee shall be deemed to have
         misappropriated fiduciary funds and to have acted in a
         financially irresponsible manner.

     k)  All licensees may place PFTA funds in interest bearing
         or income producing assets and retain the interest or
         income thereon, provided the licensee obtains the prior
         written authorization of the insurer on whose behalf the
         funds are to be held.  The written authorization from
         the insurer shall be on a form the same as Exhibit A or
         other written form signed and dated by the licensee and
         the insurer.  No investment shall be made which assumes
         any risk other than the risk that the obliger shall not
         pay the principal when due.  Employing the use of
         specialized techniques or strategies which incur
         additional risks to generate higher returns or to extend
         maturities is not permitted.  Such techniques would
         include but not be limited to the following:  Use of
         financial futures or options, buying on margins,
         pledging of PFTA balances and when issued trading.  In
         addition to savings and checking accounts in a financial
         institution, a licensee may invest in the following

               B)  the collateral has a market value at the time
                   the repurchase agreement is entered into at
                   least equal to the value of the repurchase
                   agreement; and

               C)  the repurchase agreement does not exceed 30

Section 3113.60  Return Premium
 
     a)  Return premiums must be paid to the insured or credited

         billing statement from the insurer or other licensee,
         the licensee must pay the return premium or credit the
         insured's account within 15 days subsequent to payment
         of the statement or the due date of the statement
         whichever is sooner.  If the return premium is to be
         credited to the insured's account, the credit must be
         shown and applied to the next billing statement sent to
         the insured.

     b)  If the credit results in a credit balance on the
         insured's account the credit must be returned within 15
         days unless the licensee receives written authorization
         from the insured to retain the credit balance and other
         developed credit balances for a period of no more than
         12 months from the date of authorization. Such
         authorization must contain a notification to the insured
         that he has the right to withdraw the authorization in
         writing and that the return premium will be refunded
         within 15 days of the authorization withdrawal. A copy
         of the authorization must be maintained in the
         licensee's file and a copy file must be given to the
         insured at the time that the authorization is obtained.
         If authorization is obtained, the licensee must send
         monthly written notification to the insured which
         clearly reflects a credit owed to the insured.

         has been successfully completed and for which the producer has

Section 3119.70  Course and Provider Disqualification
 
     a)  The Director may disqualify any provider and/or any provider's
         course(s) if the Director finds that:

          1)  the provider or course has not met the requirements of this
              Part;

          2)  the provider has made a material misstatement or intentional
              misrepresentation on a certification form filed with the
              Director; a misstatement will be considered material if the
              course would not have been certified in the absence of such
              statement.

          3)  the provider has intentionally misrepresented itself or its
              course to students or prospective students.

          4)  The provider has violated any commitment made in the request
              for certification and supplementary attachments thereto
              including failure to maintain the standards and method of
              operation set forth in the request for certification and any
              supplementary attachments thereto;

          5)  the provider has employed instructors who do not meet the
              requirements of Section 3119.30(e) of this Part;

          6)  the provider is deemed by the Director to have failed to act
              in good faith in providing a course.  A failure to act in
              good faith may only be evidenced by the following:

               A)  a student pass/fail ratio inconsistent with those of
                   other providers for courses which are similar in content
                   and difficulty;

               B)  the number of complaints received by the Director which
                   specifically relate to the provider's course(s);

               C)  provides to the student a proof of completion form which
                   contains false or incomplete information;

               D)  provides to the student a partially completed proof of
                   completion form.

          7)  the provider has failed to maintain the materials and records
              pursuant to Section 3119.30.

          8)  the provider failed upon request of the Director to provide
              the Director with information and records required by this
              Part or the provider provided false, or incomplete
              information or records.

     b)  Disqualification of a provider or course pursuant to this Section
         shall be by written order sent to the provider by certified or
         registered mail at the address specified in the records of the
         Department.  The provider may in writing request a hearing in
         accordance with 50 Ill. Adm. Code 2402, within 30 days from the
         date of mailing.  If no written request is made, such order shall
         be final upon the expiration of said 30 days.

     c)  If the provider requests a hearing pursuant to this Section within
         30 days, then the Director shall issue within 30 days of receipt
         of such request a written notice of hearing to the provider by
         certified or registered mail sent to the provider to the address
         as specified in the records of the Department, and stating:

          1)  The grounds, charges or conduct which justifies
              disqualification under this Section;

          2)  A specific time for the hearing, which may not be less than
              20 days nor more than 30 days after the mailing of the notice
              of hearing; and

          3)  A specific place for the hearing.

     d)  Upon disqualification, the provider shall immediately discontinue
         offering its course(s) as a certified course(s).  The Director
         shall publish all final disqualifications.

     e)  In any order of disqualification, the Director shall give
         consideration of credit hours to present students.
