<h2>III. Whether Issuance of an Injunction Will Save Plaintiff
from Irreparable Injury</h2>

Having considered the substantial likelihood of
Plaintiff's success on the merits, this Court now turns to the
remaining prongs governing the issuance of a preliminary
injunction. The second prong of the preliminary injunction
standard requires the Court to make findings as to whether the
issuance of an injunction is necessary to save the plaintiff
from irreparable injury.<p>

Importantly, Plaintiff Haskell has standing in this
lawsuit not only to raise his own rights, but also to raise
the rights of his patients. Therefore, this Court need not
decide whether the harm which Plaintiff Haskell will suffer if
prosecuted criminally or sued civilly under the Act, is
irreparable. Instead, this Court will focus on the harm which
will b suffered by his patients.<p>

Both Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two
testified that they chose to terminate their pregnancies, late
in the second trimester, after discovering that their unborn
children had severe anomalies. If this Act had been in
effect, either or both of these women may have been prevented
from terminating their pregnancies under either the
provisions of the viability testing requirement, or the
provisions of the post-viability ban. In both cases, the
fetus may well have been determined to have been viable, and
would not have been able to be aborted.<p>

In this Court's opinion, the cost of being forced by the
state to carry to term a child without a spine, or functioning
kidneys, or with other such severe defects, is beyond
description. It is difficult to imagine how horrible it would
be to knowingly carry a child to term who is dying, or who has
no reasonable chance of normal physical development.<sup>43</sup>

<hr width=35% align=left><font size=-1>
43 Although it may seem that a child who was certain to die, and had no
reasonable chance for normal development, would not be considered to
be
viable, the testimony in this case indicates otherwise. Dr. Harlan
Giles,
for example, testified that babies with certain chromosomal defects
are
considered to be viable "even though these children have no reasonable
chance for normal mental motor development.... even though it's a very
serious defect, [and] even though it usually leads to death in the
nursery." (Tr. , 11/13, at 286).
</font><hr width=35% align=left>
<p>

In addition, it is impossible to calculate the harm which
would be suffered by a pregnant woman who, though she would
prefer to try surgery or other methods to mitigate her unborn
child's severe defects, is compelled by this ban on
post-viability abortions -- which only allows an abortion if her
physical health is in danger -- to terminate her pregnancy
before the ban can apply to her, instead of taking measures to
help her unborn child, because she feared the emotional and
mental cost of carrying a child to term who had such severe
defects. It is difficult to imagine a clearer example of
irreparable harm, than is evidenced by these two scenarios.<p>

As for the harm suffered by pregnant women who are unable
to terminate their pregnancies by means of the D&amp;X procedure,
Jane Doe Number Two testified that the procedure was helpful
to her because it allowed her fetus to be aborted intact,
which was necessary for the performance of an autopsy. After
learning that the defect was not genetic, she and her husband
had more children. Jane Doe Number One testified that the D&amp;X
procedure was much easier to endure than an earlier abortion
performed by use of an induction procedure. In addition, this
Court has held that Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial
likelihood of success of showing that the alternatives to the
D&amp;X procedure -- induction methods, hysterotomies, and
hysterectomies -- are neither as safe to the mother's health,
nor as available to women seeking non-therapeutic abortions.
Pregnant women in this state who are unable to terminate their
pregnancies by means of the D&amp;X procedure may therefore suffer
irreparable harm, either because other abortion methods are
not as safe for their health, or because other abortion
methods are not as available to them.<p>

Based on the above, this Court concludes that a
preliminary injunction would serve to prevent irreparable
injury to the- patients of Plaintiff Haskell.<p>

<h2>IV. Whether Issuance of an Injunction Would Harm Others</h2>

The third prong of the preliminary injunction standard
traditionally requires this Court to "balance the equities" in
considering whether the harm to the Defendant resulting from
issuing the injunction, would outweigh the harm to the
Plaintiff resulting from denying the injunction.<p>

As far as the Defendants' interests are concerned, a
preliminary injunction will merely maintain the status quo
while the constitutionality of this legislation is decided.
The potential for irreparable injury to some of Plaintiff's
patients has already been discussed; in addition, other
pregnant women may be harmed by specific provisions of the
Act. For example, the objective reasonableness standard in
the medical-emergency definition may chill the discretion of a
pregnant woman's physician in determining that a medical
emergency exists, to the detriment of her health. As another
example, the apparent vagueness of the determination of
non-viability may chill physicians from determining that certain
fetuses are not viable, and, therefore, may place an undue
burden in the path of a woman seeking a pre-viability
abortion. In this Court's opinion, therefore, the harm to the
patients whom Plaintiff represents, should the preliminary
injunction be denied, would be greater than the harm to the
Defendants, if the injunction were granted.<p>

<h2>V. Whether Issuance of an Injunction Would Serve the Public
Interest</h2>

The final prong of the preliminary injunction standard
requires this Court to determine whether the issuance of an
injunction would serve the public interest.<p>

In this Court's opinion, the public interest is best
served by a full and fair hearing on the merits of the
constitutionality of this legislation, particularly in view of
the fact that the Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial
likelihood of success of showing that numerous provisions in
House Bill 135 are unconstitutional. Accordingly, the Court
concludes that the public interest would be served by the
issuance of a preliminary injunction.<p>

<h2>VI. Conclusion/Conclusions of Law</h2>

To summarize, this Court has held that all four prongs of
the preliminary injunction standard weigh in favor of granting
a preliminary injunction, which enjoins enforcement of all
provisions of House Bill 135. In addition, this Court has
held:<p>

(1) it has federal question jurisdiction, under 28 U.S.C.
&#167 1331, over this constitutional challenge to a state statute,<p>

(2) Plaintiff Haskell may seek pre-enforcement review of
House Bill 135, and this lawsuit is therefore ripe;<p>

(3) Plaintiff Haskell has standing to bring this action, and
may assert both his own rights and the rights of his patients;<p>

(4) the <i>Salerno</i> standard no longer applies to a facial
challenge to pre-viability abortion regulations;<p>

(5) the <i>Salerno</i> standard does not apply to a facial
challenge to post-viability abortion regulations;<p>

(6) although a state may proscribe most abortions subsequent
to viability, the state may not take away a pregnant woman's
right to have a post-viability abortion where, in appropriate
medical judgment, such an abortion is necessary to preserve
her life or health -- accordingly, strict scrutiny should not be
utilized in this analysis;<p>

(7) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the definition of "Dilation and
Extraction procedure" in O.R.C. &#167 2919.15(A) is
unconstitutional, because of vagueness;<p>

(8) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the ban on use of the D&amp;X procedure in
&#167 2919.15(B) is unconstitutional, because the state may not
ban an abortion procedure unless there are safe and available
alternatives, and because this ban may chill the exercise of a
woman's right to a pre-viability abortion;<p>

(9) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the ban on use of the D&amp;X procedure
dons not serve the stated interest of preventing unnecessary
cruelty to the fetus;<p>

(10) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the mandated determination of
non-viability in &#167 2919.18(A)(1), as applied to the post-viability
ban (&#167 2919.17(A)(2)) and the viability testing requirement
(&#167 2919.18), is unconstitutional, because the objective
standard in that determination is inconsistent with the purely
subjective standard in the definition of viable in
&#167 2919.16(L);<p>

(11) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the definition of serious risk of the
substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily
function in &#167 2919.16(J), as it applies to one allowable
exception to the ban on post viability abortions, in
2919.17(A)(1), is unconstitutional, because its limitation to
factors relating solely to physical health impermissibly
restricts the physician's determination of whether an abortion
is necessary to preserve the health of the pregnant woman;<p>

(12) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the definition of medical emergency in
&#167 2919.16(F), as it applies to the post-viability ban (&#167
2919.17) and the viability testing requirement (&#167 2919.18), is
unconstitutional, because it lacks a scienter requirement, and
thus is vague, and because it does not allow the physician to
rely on his or her own best clinical judgment that a medical
emergency exists, and so may chill physicians from determining
that a medical emergency exists even where necessary to
preserve the pregnant woman's life or health;<p>

(13) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the second physician concurrence
requirement in &#167 2919.17(B)(1)(b) is unconstitutional, because
it impermissibly limits the primary physician's discretion,
and because it may chill the performance of post-viability
abortions that are necessary to preserve the life or health of
the mother;<p>

(14) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the choice of method requirement in
&#167 2919.17(B)(l)(d) is unconstitutional, because it requires
the woman to bear an increased medical risk, forces the
physician to "trade off" the pregnant woman's health for that
of the fetus, and impermissibly interferes with the
physician's exercise of discretion, to the detriment of the
pregnant woman's health;<p>

(15) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the second physician attendance
requirement in &#167 2919.17(B)(1)(e) is unconstitutional, because
the medical emergency exception appears to be
unconstitutional;<p>

(16) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the rebuttable presumption of
viability in &#167 2919.17(C) is unconstitutional, because the
mandated determination of non-viability in House Bill 135
appears to be unconstitutional;<p>

(17) Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of
success of showing that the viability testing requirement in
&#167 2919.18(A)(1) is unconstitutional, because the medical
emergency definition appears to be unconstitutional, and
because the mandated determination of non-viability appears to
be unconstitutional.<p>

This Court further concludes that the issuance of an
injunction will prevent irreparable injury to the patients of
Plaintiff Haskell, that such injury outweighs the injury which
will be suffered by Defendants if this injunction is issued,
and that the public interest would be served by the issuance
of this preliminary injunction.<sup>44</sup>

<hr width=35% align=left><font size=-1>
44 This Court adopts the findings set forth within this Opinion as its
Findings of Fact, for purposes of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of
Civil
Procedure. This Court finds support for its lack of separate findings
of
fact in the Supreme Court's holding "that there must be findings,
stated
either in the court's opinion or separately, which are sufficient to
indicate the factual basis for the ultimate conclusion." <i>Kelley v.
Everglades Drainage Dist.,</i> 319 U.S. 415, 422 (1943), quoted with
approval in
<i>B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Rubber Latex Prod., Inc.,</i> 400 F.2d 401, 402 (6th
Cir. 1968); see also <i>Slanco v. United Counties,</i> No 82-3115 (6th Cir.
1983) (allowing district court to adopt oral opinion as findings of fact
and conclusions of law for purposes of Rule 52); <i>Croggett v. Bd. of
Educ.
of Cleveland City Sch. Dist.,</i> 338 F.2d 941 (6th Cir. 1964) (allowing
district court to adopt written memorandum as findings of fact and
conclusions of law for purposes of Rule 52).<p>

However, this Court assures Counsel for the Plaintiff and the state
Defendants that their detailed, proposed Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of
Law was thoroughly reviewed and form the basis of much of
the discussion
contained herein. This includes the submissions of the state Defendants
which were not fully delivered to this Court's chambers, by
facsimile, until 3:45 a.m., this date. In short, the diligent effort of
Counsel has not been in vain.<p>

For purposes of completing the record, this Court also renders the
following evidentiary rulings: Plaintiff's Exhibit 24 is admitted,
for
the limited purpose of showing the position of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists on the federal Partial Birth Abortion
Act
of 1995, but not for the truth of the statements asserted therein.
Plaintiff's Exhibit 25 is excluded, as hearsay.
</font><hr width=35% align=left>
<p>

WHEREFORE, based upon the aforesaid, this Court orders
that the Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction be
GRANTED, effective as of the filing of this opinion.
Accordingly, Defendants, their employees, agents, and servants
are preliminarily enjoined from enforcing any provision of
House Bill 135. Having considered the issue of bond as is
required by Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
this Court concludes that no bond should be required of the
Plaintiff .<p>

Counsel listed below will note that a brief telephone
conference will be held, between Court and Counsel, beginning
at 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, on Friday, December 22, 1995, for
the express purpose of determining further procedures to be
followed in this litigation. Specifically, Counsel should be
prepared to discuss whether they wish to proceed to trial upon
the merits of the captioned cause, at a date in mid-1996, or
whether, in the alternative, Defendants wish to take an
immediate appeal of this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167 1292(a)(1).<p>

<h2>IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BLOUNT COUNTY, TENNESSEE,
AT MARYVILLE,
EQUITY DlVISION (DlVISION I)</h2><p>

MARY SUE DAVIS, <i>Defendant,</i>
<p align=center>
v.
<p align=center>
RAY KING, M.D., d/b/a, Fertility Center of East Tennessee,
<i>Third Party Defendant.</i><p>

<h2>SYLLABUS</h2>

IN THIS DOMESTIC RELATIONS case, the only issue before the
Court is the disposition of seven cryogenically frozen embryos maintained by
the Third Party Defendant and the product of in vitro fertilization
undertaken by the Plaintiff and the Defendant.<p>

THE CASE is one of first impression.<p>

IN ITS OPINION below, the Court has made certain findings of fact and
conclusions of law resulting in judgment.<p>

THE SALIENT findings, conclusions and the judgment are summarized
as follows, to-wit:<p>

(1) Mr. and Mrs. Davis undertook in vitro procedures for the purpose of
producing a human being to be their child.<p>

(2) The seven cryogenically preserved embryos are human embryos.<p>

(3) American Fertility Society Guidelines are for intra-professional use,
are not binding upon the Court, but are of probative value for consideration
by the Court.<p>

(4) The term "preembryo" is not an accepted term and serves as a false
distinction between the developmental stages of a human embryo.<p>

(5) From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo are differentiated,
unique and specialized to the highest degree of distinction.<p>

(6) Human embryos are not property.<p>

(7) Human life begins at conception.<p>

(8) Mr. and Mrs. Davis have produced human beings, in vitro, to be
known as their child or children.<p>

(9) For domestic relations purposes, no public policy prevents the
continuing development of the common law as it applies to the seven human
beings existing as embryos, in vitro, in this domestic relations case.<p>

(10) The common law doctrine of <i>parens patriae</i> controls children, in
vitro.<p>

(11) it is to the manifest best interests of the child or children, in vitro,
that they be available for implantation.<p>

(12) it serves the best interests of the child or children, in vitro, for their
Mother, Mrs. Davis, to be permitted the opportunity to bring them to term
through implantation.<p>

JUDGMENT OF THE COURT: The temporary custody of the seven
cryopreserved human embryos is vested in Mrs. Davis for the purpose of
implantation. All issues of support, visitation, final custody and related
issues are reserved to the Court for consideration and disposition at such
time as one or more of the seven human embryos are the product of live
birth.<p>

<h2>APPENDICES TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>

BECAUSE of much public interest in the case, Appendix A will assist the
parties and the public to understand some fundamental rules and principles
required to be applied [by] the Court in the process of deciding the case.
Appendix B is the Court's summary of the testimony given in the case over
a period of almost three days (August 7, 1989, August 8, 1989 and August
10, 1989). Appendix C is footnote references to the Court's Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law section of the Opinion.<p>

<h2>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</h2>

<h3>The Davises - Their Marriage</h3>

Based on the record before it, the Court finds that Mr. Davis is a
gentleman; he is 30 years of age, employed as an electrician and a
refrigeration technician by the Maryville Housing Authority, Maryville,
Tennessee, earning about $17,500.00 annually. Mrs. Davis is a lady; she is 28
years of age who, at the trial, was employed by the Sea Ray Boat Company,
Vonore, Tennessee, as a sales representative earning about $18,000.00
annually. Subsequent to the trial, Mrsb Davis has become domiciled in the
state of Florida.<a name="~c1"><a href="#c1">(1)</a><p>

<h3>Infertility of Mrs. Davis</h3>

Mr. and Mrs. Davis have been married about nine years. They very much
wanted to have a family, but after Mrs. Davis suffered five tubal
pregnancies, her physican advised and she undertook surgical treatment
which rendered her incapable of natural conception. The Court finds that
Mrs. Davis suffered significant trauma and pain resulting from the parties'
attempts to procure their family by way of natural childbirth. In vitro
fertilization <a name="~c2"><a href="#c2">(2)</a> is the only option now
available to her to
have her own child.<p>

<h3>In Vitro and Adoption Attempts</h3>

Remaining committed to having a family, Mr. and Mrs. Davis sought the
advice and counsel of Dr. Ray King in the Fall, 1985, became familiar with
and participated in the in vitro fertilization program under Dr. King's
direction and guidance. Dr. King was assisted by his colleague, Dr. Charles
A. Shivers, who performed the necessary laboratory work in connection
with the in vitro fertilization program. In addition, Dr. King was assisted by
his patient coordinator, Deborah Cooper McCarter, a Registered Nurse and
Dr. King's administrative assistant.<p>

After some six attempts by the couple to produce a child through the in
vitro fertilization process, resulting in no pregnancy, the parties temporarily
suspended their participation in the program and sought to obtain a child
through adoption. The adoption process did not work, and the parties
abandoned adoption attempts and returned to the in vitro fertilization
program conducted by Dr. King.<p>

<h3>Cryopreservation Technique</h3>

In the Fall, 1988, Mrs. Davis learned of the new
cryopreservation<a name="~c3"><a href="#c3">(3)</a>
program sponsored by King's clinic whereby several
ova<a name="~c4"><a href="#c4">(4)</a>
could be
aspirated,<a name="~c5"><a href="#c5">(5)</a>
inseminated<a name="~c6"><a href="#c6">(6)</a>
in the laboratory and if the insemination process produced fertilized zygotes,
the
zygotes<a name="~c7"><a href="#c7">(7)</a>
could be allowed to mature in the
laboratory to a medically accepted point for the purpose of either
implantations or cryopreservation for future implantation. Mrs. Davis
discussed the new technique with her husband and armed with that
information the parties proceeded to reenter the program with the intent of
producing a child or children which would constitute their family.<p>

<h3>Further in Vitro Attempts</h3>

It is undisputed in the record and the Court finds that in order to prepare
her reproductive system to produce quality ova for insemination, Mrs. Davis
went through many painful, physically tiring, emotionally and mentally
taxing procedures, both before the December, 1988 events and after those
events. As a prospective Mother, she spent many hours of anxious moments
waiting for word as to whether she would be a Mother. The cryopreservation
technique offered Mrs. Davis much welcomed relief from the rigors of the
full procedure each time in vitro fertilization was attempted.<p>

It is further undisputed and the Court finds that Mr. Davis donated
sperm for the December, 1988 insemination and resulting fertilization
process, that he spent many anxious hours, early in the morning and late at
night, waiting at the hospital while Mrs. Davis underwent the aspiration and
implant procedures and that he spent many anxious hours, as a prospective
Father, awaiting word as to whether he would be a Father.<p>

On December 8, 1988, nine ova were aspirated from Mrs. Davis, nine ova
were inseminated with Mr. Davis' sperm by Dr. Shivers in his laboratory
and the nine ova were fertilized, producing acceptable zygotes for
implantation consideration by Dr. King and Dr. Shivers. The zygotes were
permitted
to mature under laboratory conditions, variously developing from the
four-cell cleavage<a name="~c9"><a href="#c9">(9)</a> stage to the eight-cell
cleavage
stage, all of which were found to
be of excellent quality by Dr. Shivers and Dr. King. On December 10, 1988,
two of the embryos<a name="~c10"><a href="#c10">(10)</a> were implanted in Mrs.
Davis,
neither of which resulted in pregnancy, and the remaining seven embryos were
placed in cryogenic storage for future implantation purposes.<p>

<h3>Cryopreservation For Davis Family Only</h3>

The Court finds that before their embryos were committed to cryogenic
storage, Mr. and Mrs. Davis knew, were aware of and had discussed
between themselves (and with at least Dr. Shivers) the fact that reliable
medical data indicated the practical storage life of the human embryos
would probably not exceed two years. Mr. and Mrs. Davis had discussed
the fact that if Mrs. Davis became pregnant as a result of her implant on
December 10, 1988, the possibility existed that the remaining seven embryos
in cryopreservation could be donated to another infertile couple, but the
parties made no decision about that matter.<p>

The Court further finds that during the time between December, 1988 and
the filing of the original Complaint in this case (February 23, 1989), Mr. and
Mrs. Davis discussed the possibility of and had tentatively planned to
implant at least one of the cryopreserved embryos in Mrs. Davis' body in
March or April, 1989.<p>

<h3>The Intent of Mr. and Mrs. Davis</h3>

The Court further finds that Dr. King and Dr. Shivers engaged in a
concerted effort with the Davises to help Mr. and Mrs. Davis become
parents, both as to the IVF procedures before and after the utilization of the
cryopreservation technique; and the Court finds and concludes that Mr. and
Mrs. Davis participated in the IVF program, both before and after the
employment of the cryopreservation technique, for one purpose: to produce
a human being to be known as their child.<p>

<h3>Issues for the Court</h3>

There is no fact in the record to persuade the Court that Mr. and Mrs.
Davis discussed or had any thought of changing their intent until the
Complaint was filed in this case on February 23, 1989 and it must be
determined from the proof whether Mr. and Mrs. Davis accomplished their
intent. That determination is to be made by the answer to the most poignant
question of the case: When does human life begin?<p>

To answer this question, several additional questions must first be asked
and answered, based on the record in this case: Are the embryos human?
Does a difference exist between a
preembryo<a name="~c11"><a href="#c11">(11)</a> and an
embryo? Are the embryos beings? Are the embryos property that may become human
beings?<p>

<h3>Human Embryos-- The Experts</h3>

Of the eight witnesses who gave testimony in this case, five of the
witnesses presented themselves possessing the requisite knowledge, special
skill, experience and education necessary to establish themselves as
experts<a name="~c12"><a href="#c12">(12)</a> in their respective fields of
professional
endeaevor.<p>

Because of her special training as a Registered Nurse, Mrs. McCarter is an
expert witness; Dr. King<a name="~c13"><a href="#c13">(13)</a> is a Medical
Doctor and is a
well qualified
specialist in the field of Infertility/ Reproductive Endocrinology;
Dr. Shivers<a name="~c14"><a href="#c14">(14)</a>
is a well qualified Embryologist and is experienced in the laboratory work
necessary for in vitro fertilization and cryogenic storage of human embryos;
Professor Robertson<a name="~c15"><a href="#c15">(15)</a> is an eminently
qualified Professor
of Law whose
scholarly treatises, dealing primarily with non-coital reproduction, have
served as the basis for consideration of many medical-legal subjects; and Dr.
Jerome Lejeune<a name="~c16"><a href="#c16">(16)</a> is an eminently qualified
Medical
Doctor, Doctor in
Science, Professor of Fundamental Genetics and recognized throughout the
world in his specialty, Human Genetics.<p>

The expert witnesses (except Mrs. McCarter) offered opinions to assist the
court in determining when human life begins. It should be noted that all four
witnesses agree that the seven cryopreserved embryos are human; that is,
"belonging or relating to man; characteristic of
man ..."<a name="~c17"><a href="#c17">(17)</a><p>

The Court finds and concludes that the seven cryopreserved embryos are
human.<p>

<h3>Preembryo vs. Embryo: Human Beings</h3>

Three of the experts, however, respectfully disagree with Dr. Lejeune that
the human embryos are in "being;" that is, in "existence; conscious existence;
as, things brought into being by generation . . ." or living,
alive<a name="~c18"><a href="#c18">(18)</a>.
The three experts insist the entities are at a stage in development where they
simply possess the potential for life.<p>

In the analysis of the testimony offered on the point of whether or not the
seven embryos are human beings, the Court believes it is helpful to even
further condense the already summarized opinion testimony
(Appendix B)<a name="~c19"><a href="#c19">(19)</a> of each expert on the
subject:<p>

1. Dr. Irving Ray King: There is first a one-cell
gamete<a name="~c20"><a href="#c20">(20)</a>, a zygote (after
the first cell divides), a preembryo (up to 14 days after fertilization) and
finally an embryo (after 14 days and upon cell differentiation).<p>

2. Dr. Charles Alex Shivers: A preembryo is a zygote up to 11-14 days
and consists largely of undifferentiated cells; that after attachment to the
uterus wall and the appearance of the primitive streak, the cells then become
different; that is organs, organ systems, body parts and the like are formed.
At the time of fertilization, genetic controls are "locked in forever" and
control who the preembryo will later be, but, "... as far as we know ...,
to my knowledge ..., there is no way to distinguish the cells [at the zygote
stage] ... [T]hey are the same [undifferentiated] ..."<p>

3. Professor John A. Robertson: A human preembryo is an entity
composed of a group of undifferentiated cells which have no organs or
nervous system. That at about 10-14 days, the preembryo attaches itself to
the uteran wall, develops its primitive streak and life then commences. It is
"... not clear ..." that a human preembryo is a unique individual; that
simply because fertilization has occurred, the gamete contributors have not
procreated<a name="~c21"><a href="#c21">(21)</a>.<p>

4. Dr. Jerome Lejeune: Each human has a unique beginning which
occurs at the moment of conception. Embryo: "... that youngest form of a
being.. ." Preembryo: there is no such word. There is no need for a
subclass of the embryo to be called a preembryo, because there is nothing
before the embryo; before an embryo there is only a sperm and an egg;
when the egg is fertilized by the sperm the entity becomes a zygote; and
when the zygote divides it is an embryo. When the first cell exists, all the
"tricks of the trade" to build itself into an individual already exists.
Shortly after fertilization at the three-cell stage, a "... tiny human being
..." exists.
When the ovum is fertilized by the sperm, the result is "... the most
specialized cell under the sun ..."; specialized from the point of view that
no other cell will ever have the same instructions in the life of the
individual being created. No scientist has ever offered the opinion that an
embryo is property. As soon as he has been conceived, a man is a man. New
findings recited
[Jeffrey's-DNA]<a name="~c22"><a href="#c22">(22)</a>
<a name="~c23"><a href="#c23">(23)</a>
definitely prove differentiation and that from the
very beginning there exists an embryo.<p>

Dr. King, Dr. Shivers and Professor Robertson rely at least to some
degree on the report of the Ethics Committee of The American Fertility
Society<a name="~c24"><a href="#c24">(24)</a> in forming the basis of their
opinions. Each
makes a distinction
between "embryo" and "preembryo" in conformity to the AFS guidelines.<p>

The ethical considerations by the committee for the AFS were referred to
in, cited and relied upon by the Brief<a name="~c25"><a href="#c25">(25)</a>
filed by Mr.
Davis; testimony was
given about the Committee and its work. Professor Robertson is a member
of the Ethics Committee, Dr. King is a member of the American Fertility
Society and various witnesses gave testimony indicating reliance on the
pronouncements of the Committee.<p>

The AFS guidelines were published by the Society in September, 1986
after the Committee's last deliberation on April 14, 1986 in Norfolk,
Virginia<a name="~c26"><a href="#c26">(26)</a>. The guidelines were promulgated
by the
committee pursuant to    
the charge of the Society's President by letter dated November 7,
1984<a name="~c27"><a href="#c27">(27)</a>,
requesting the committee to address ethical issues regarding reproduction
and to disseminate the committee's knowledge of these positions on those
matters.<p>

In its report, the committee defined the term "preembryo", and prefaced
its definitions section with the following language:<p>

<strong>"In order to avoid confusion, </strong>
the committee found it necessary to adopt certain definitions <strong>for
the purposes of this document."</strong> [Emphasis
supplied]<a name="~c28"><a href="#c28">(28)</a><p>

The Committee then defined the word preembryo this way:<br>
"A <strong>preembryo</strong> is a product of gametic union from fertilization
to the
appearance of the embryonic axis. The preembryonic stage is considered to
last until 14 days after fertilization. This definition is not intended to
imply   a moral evaluation of the
preembryo."<a name="~c29"><a href="#c29">(29)</a><p>

In reviewing the guidelines, it is of interest to call attention to several
considerations set-forth in the report. One of those considerations is the
recognition by the committee that there are several respected views relative
to the moral and legal status of a preembryo. The committee adopted this
view:<p>

"A third view -- one that is most widely held -- takes an intermediate
position between the other two. It holds that the preembryo deserves respect
greater than accorded to human tissue but not the respect accorded to
actual persons. The preembryo is due greater respect than any other human
tissue because of its potential to become a person and because of its
symbolic meaning for many people. Yet, it should not be treated as a
person, because it has not yet developed the features of personhood, is not
yet established as developmentally individuals and may never realize its
biologic potential."<a name="~c30"><a href="#c30">(30)</a><p>

Under the heading "Emerging Consenus on Preembryo Status," the
following statement is made:<p>

"The Ethics Advisory Board, for example, unanimously agreed in 1979
that "the human <strong>embryo</strong>
[i.e., <strong>preembryo</strong> in this report] is entitled to
profound respect, but this respect does not necessarily encompass the full
legal and moral rights attributed to persons" (Ethics Advisory Board,
1979)." [Emphasis supplied.]<a name="~c31"><a href="#c31">(31)</a><p>

In the Committee's summary of points of special interest, the following is
found:<p>

"The Committee finds that the human preembryo is not a person but is
entitled to respect because it has the potential to become a person. This
view limits the circumstances in which a preembryo may be discarded or
used in research ..."<a name="~c32"><a href="#c32">(32)</a><p>

The Court finds and concludes that the report of the Ethics Committee of
the American Fertility Society constitutes guidelines for those professionals
involved in the field of fertility treatment; as Professor Robertson testified,
they constitute guidelines for these professionals to be primarily utilized for
litigation purposes. In other words, they are the self-imposed standards one
professional would testify must be met by another professional, for example,
in a medical malpractice suit. The guidelines do not have the force and effect
of the law but must be considered by this Court for whatever
probative<a name="~c33"><a href="#c33">(33)</a> value they may possess.<p>

The Court finds and concludes that the guidelines of the AFS do not
serve as authority for this Court in making a determination of whether the
seven human embryos in question are human beings, and concludes the term
"preembryo" has arisen in this suit primarily because the AFS Committee
chose that term to avoid the confusion for the purposes of its own
guidelines. The Court has made a thorough search of encyclopedias and
dictionaries of which the Court may take judicial notice and the Court can
nowhere find the word "preembryo" defined nor can the Court find even a
reference to that term.<p>

Careful scrutiny of the testimony and an exhibit at the trial gives the
Court even greater assurance that the term "preembryo" serves as a false
distinguishing term in this case.<p>

Exhibit 8, at the trial, are the handwritten notes of Dr. King. Dr. King's
notes concerning the status of his patient, Mary Davis, covering the period
of time from December 8, 1988 at 10:08 a.m. through and including
December 10, 1988 at 3:31 p.m., all refer to the ova after fertilization as
"embryo"; and the last document in that series of notes makes reference to
the "condition of embryo" and variously describes the seven embryos as
"... 4-cell embryo -- perfect ..."<p>

The Court finds it curious that Dr. King, who adopts the AFS guideline
definition of a "preembryo" to distinguish it from an "embryo" would in his
own notes call them embryo(s).<p>

Counsel for Mr. Davis furnished the Court a revised copy of Professor
Robertson's paper<a name="~c34"><a href="#c34">(34)</a> written recently by him
(probably
finished in July,
1989), dealing specifically with the case at bar. The solution Professor
Robertson set-forth in his paper is the same solution he offered through his
testimony. He was asked about that opinion on direct examination by
Counsel for Mr. Davis; he was cross-examined by Counsel for Mrs. Davis
about his opinion cited therein. The paper is entitled <i>Resolving Disputes
Over Disposition of Frozen Embryos;</i> from the title page through 31
additional pages (the entire text), Professor Robertson, speaking about the
case at bar, referred time and again to the "embryos."<p>

It is curious that this very scholarly paper does not reflect the very fine
distinction between "preembryo" and "embryo" made by Professor Robertson
throughout his testimony at the trial.<p>

The Court is persuaded that the debate between these most sincere and
knowledgeable witnesses perhaps boils down to much the same debate Sweet
Juliet had with herself when she rationalized her strong affection for Romeo,
who was not a Montague:<p>

"... Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>
... What's in a name? that which we call a rose<br>
By any other name would smell as
sweet ..."<a name="~c35"><a href="#c35">(35)</a><p>

The Court finds and concludes there is no such term as "preembryo"; that
to use the term in the context of this case creates a false distinction, one
that does not exist. The Court finds and concludes the seven cryopreserved
entities are human embryos.<p>

<h3>DNA Manipulation Verifies Uniqueness</h3>

Based on the analysis of the testimony comprising the positions of Dr.
King, Dr. Shivers and Professor Robertson, it appears that where these
gentlemen most sharply differ with Dr. Lejoune is in the area of cell
differentiation. Dr. Lejeune, of course, gives emphatic testimony that the
cells are especially differentiated and that such position is a proven
scientific fact.<p>

The term "differentiate"<a name="~c36"><a href="#c36">(36)</a> means to
distinguish by a
specific difference.
If the cells, therefore, of a four cell zygote are undifferentiated, the cells
lack any distinction; a skilled scientist could not distinguish the cells of
one zygote
from those of another zygote nor could the scientist distinguish between any
of four cells within the hypothetical zygote. Dr. Lejeune bases his emphatic
opinion to the contrary ("... the most specialized cell under the sun ...")
on a complicated scientific process of manipulating and reading the DNA
molecule, characterized by him as new findings which definitely prove
differentiation, now known through the science of molecular
genetics<a name="~c37"><a href="#c37">(37)</a> beyond any doubt.<p>

The testimony given by Dr. Lejeune relative to conclusive proof induced
through DNA examination is highly technical, incapable of observation by
the Court and requires the Court to either accept or reject the scientist's
conclusion that it can be done. While this factor requires the Court to
proceed with special caution, it does not of itself render testimony or other
evidence based on this highly specialized field of molecular genetics
unreliable<a name="~c38"><a href="#c38">(38)</a>.<p>

Quite to the contrary, DNA profiling, through "genetic fingerprint"
evidence by which strands of coating found in genetic molecule of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), has been accepted as competent and admissable
evidence in Courts of law, is considered reliable, is performed by a
number of laboratories around the world and is generally accepted in the
scientific community<a name="~c39"><a href="#c39">(39)</a>.<p>

As indicated in footnote 39, the <i>Andrews</i> case was decided by the United
States District Court of Appeals of Florida, Fifth District, on October 20,
1988 and review of the case was denied in 1989. It is the only case this Court
has been able to find dealing with the reliability of the DNA procedures so
forcefully relied on by Dr. Legeune. <i>Andrews</i> approves the reliability of
DNA profiling, a process very similar to the one described and relied on by
Dr. Lejeune.<p>

Both Dr. Shivers and Professor Robertson cite undifferentiated cells as
one basis for their opinions that human embryos are not human beings, but
each hedges on the point. Dr. Shivers says "as far as he knows" there is no
way to distinguish the cells; that they are undifferentiated; and Professor
Robertson says "it is not clear that a unique individual" then exists.<p>

The testimony of Dr. Lejeune stands unrebutted in the record; the Court
accepts his testimony that DNA manipulation of molecules of human
chromosomes<a name="~c40"><a href="#c40">(40)</a> reliably proves cell
differentiation. The
Court is persuaded
that this relatively new technique opens a tiny window to the world to see
and be aware of the most intimate and intricate details of man from his very
beginning.<p>

The Court finds and concludes that the cells of human embryos are
comprised of differentiated cells, unique in character and specialized to the
highest degree of distinction.<p>

Dr. Shivers and Professor Robertson testified that the preembryo is not a
being because he or she has no (observable) organs or nervous system, no
body parts. Dr. Lejeune, on the other hand, says a man is a man; that upon
fertilization, the entire constitution of the man is clearly, unequivocally
spelled-out, including arms, legs, nervous systems and the like; that upon
inspection via DNA manipulation, one can see the life codes for each of
these otherwise unobservable elements of the unique individual.<p>

The testimony of Dr. Lejeune stands unrebutted in the record; the Court
accepts his testimony founded on the fact that DNA manipulation of the
molecules of human chromosomes reliably detect these features of man; that
the life codes for each special, unique individual are resident at conception
and antimate the new person very soon after fertilization occurs.<p>

The argument that the human embryo may never realize its biologic
potential, it appears to the Court, is
statistically<a name="~c41"><a href="#c41">(41)</a>
and speculatively true, but
is a hollow argument. A newborn baby may never realize its biologic
potential, but no one disputes the fact that the newborn baby is a human
being. And if it is a part of the logic that an embryo, only a few hours old
and perhaps only four cells in development, is not a being because it cannot
sustain itself, then we must also reason that a newborn baby (which no one
disputes is a human being) can likewise not sustain itself without the aid and
assistance of a mature individual (hopefully its Mother); and we must reason
the newborn also lacks a necessary criteria to qualify as a human being. For
surely it is good logic that a newborn human being, left naked in a field
without the sustenance, aid and assistance of another human being will
surely die; it is utterly helpless; it, too, lacks the capacity to sustain
itself.<p>

It must be noted that one solution offered for the Court's disposition of
the embryos is to allow them to die a passive death. Mrs. Davis reasons that
in order to die, one must first live. Her logic is appealing, persuasive and
accepted by the Court.<p>

The technical arguments of human genetics aside, Mr. Davis asserts the
theory that embryos constitute property jointly owned by the
parties<a name="~c42"><a href="#c42">(42)</a>; that
the embryos do not constitute life, but have the potential for life. Professor
Robertson also adopts this view and suggests the embryos, at this stage of
development, might properly be designated fungible
property<a name="~c43"><a href="#c43">(43)</a>.<p>

In light of all the proof before the Court, it is impossible for the Court to
find the assertion well founded in logic and good reason. Perhaps Tennessee's
Senator Albert Gore best expressed the Court's apprehension when then
Congressman Gore (in 1984), hearing a similar theory asserted during
testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on
Investigations and Oversight of the Committee on Science and Technology,
said:<p>

"I disagree that there's just a sliding scale of continuum with property at one
point along the spectrum and human beings at another. I think there's a
sharp distinction between something that is property and something that is
not property ..."<a name="~c44"><a href="#c44">(44)</a><p>

The Court finds and concludes that by whatever name one chooses to call
the seven frozen entities -- be it preembryo or embryo -- those entities are
human beings; they are not property.<p>

<h3>Human Life Begins at Conception</h3>

The answer then, to the question: When does human life begin? ... from the
record in this case, the Court finds and concludes that human life begins
at the moment of
conception<a name="~c45"><a href="#c45">(45)</a>; that Mr. and Mrs. Davis have
accomplished their original intent to produce a human being to be known as
their child.<p>

What then is the legal status to be accorded a human being existing as an
embryo, in vitro, in a divorce case in the state of Tennessee?<p>

For the purposes of the Tennessee Wrongful Death
Statute<a name="~c46"><a href="#c46">(46)</a>, an unborn
child is accorded status only if the child is viable at the time of injury;
that is:
if a child had achieved a stage of development where it could reasonably be
expected to be capable of living outside the uterus. For the purposes of the
Tennessee Criminal Abortion Statute<a name="~c47"><a href="#c47">(47)</a>, the
child is
accorded no recognized
status during the first three months of its Mothers pregnancy. But the
legislature for the state of Tennessee has not yet, and to the best of the
Court's knowledge, information and belief, no state in the union has,
established a public policy<a name="~c48"><a href="#c48">(48)</a> declaring the
rights to be
accorded a human embryo, in vitro, in a divorce case.<p>

In order to give effect to this Court's judgment, it is necessary to establish,
in the absence of any authority to give the Court guidance, the status of
these unborn human beings in this divorce proceeding.<p>

As my learned colleague in the law, Professor Robertson, pointed out
during his testimony, the recent
<i>Webster</i><a name="~c49"><a href="#c49">(49)</a> case
leaves open the door for a state to establish its compelling interest in
protecting even potential human life by legislation declaring its public
policy. Even as to the abortion issue, the <i>Webster</i> Court opined that it
saw no reason why the state's interest in protecting potential human life
should come into existence only at the point of
viability<a name="~c50"><a href="#c50">(50)</a>.<p>

The Court understands that both
<i>Roe</i><a name="~c51"><a href="#c51">(51)</a> and
<i>Webster</i>
dealt with questions of the constitutionality of <strong>abortion
statutes</strong> and the
court's decisions in those cases have a profound effect on the states'
compelling interest in the protection of human life, <strong>but
only as it deals with
the abortion issue.</strong><p>

In its research of Tennessee law, the Court finds only one case that gives it
solace. In <i>Smith v. Gore,</i>
728 SW 2nd 738 (1987), a tort action was brought
for a wrongful pregnancy resulting from a failed tubal ligation. While the
case deals in the main with the tort aspect of the claim, the Court, in its
discussion of public policy recognizes that the state places great value on
human life. But of greater importance, it appears to the Court, is the
<i>Smith</i>
Court's consideration of the distinction between judical decisions which
infringe on the legislative right to set public policy and a Court's finding
that no public policy prevents the continuing development of common law.<p>

The function of the Courts is to declare the law as the Courts find it, and
it is for the Legislature to weigh the affect [sic] and the consequences of
legislation enacted<a name="~c52"><a href="#c52">(52)</a>. The Legislature has
exclusive and
ample power to
determine the public policy of the state<a name="~c53"><a href="#c53">(53)</a>.
The law in
Tennessee, therefore,
restricts this Court's role in declaring public policy. The Court is not free
to establish what it believes to be the best policy for the state; rather,
the Court
must determine where public policy is to be found, what the specific public
policy is, and how it applies to the case at
hand<a name="~c54"><a href="#c54">(54)</a>.
For the Court to find that
no public policy prevents the continuing development of the common law is
wholly different from positively declaring the public policy of the
state<a name="~c55"><a href="#c55">(55)</a>.<p>

This Court finds and concludes that for domestic relations purposes in
Tennessee no public policy prevents the continuing development of the
common law as it may specifically apply to the seven human beings existing
as embryos, in vitro, in this domestic relations case. The Court is of the
opinion, finds and concludes that the age-old common law doctrine of
<i>parens
patriae</i><a name="~c56"><a href="#c56">(56)</a> controls these children, in
vitro, as it
has always supervised
and controlled children of a marriage at live birth in domestic relations cases
in Tennessee.<p>

The common law doctrine of <i>parens patriae</i> is defined as that power of
the sovereign to watch over the interests of those who are incapable of
protecting
themselves<a name="~c57"><a href="#c57">(57)</a>. It is well settled
that Court's
having historic
Chancery or equity jurisdiction exercise and control the sovereign power
called <i>parens
patriae</i><a name="~c58"><a href="#c58">(58)</a>. The thrust of the equitable
nature of this
doctrine is
that it turns its full focus on the best interests of the child; its concern
is not
for those who claim "rights" to the child, nor for those who claim custody of
the child, nor for those who may suffer perceived or real inequities resulting
from scrupulously guarding the child's best
interest<a name="~c59"><a href="#c59">(59)</a>.<p>

The doctrine of parens patriae is most commonly expressed as the "best
interests of the child doctrine" and its sole objective is to achieve justice
for
the child<a name="~c60"><a href="#c60">(60)</a>. In the case of very young
children, it was a
former practice in
Tennessee for many years to confuse the so-called "Tender Years Doctrine"
(the placing of children of tender years with their Mother, regardless of the
circumstances) with the "best interests of the child" rule. In 1987, our
legislature amended the custody provisions of our Tennessee divorce statute
to create a rebuttable presumption of parental fitness in child custody cases,
mandating the long-standing test, however, "... as the welfare and interest
of the child or children may
demand ..."<a name="~c61"><a href="#c61">(61)</a><p>

In the case at bar, the undisputed, uncontroverted testimony is that to
allow the parties' seven cryogenically preserved human embryos to remain so
preserved for a period exceeding two years is tantamount to the destruction
of these human beings. It was the clear intent of Mr. and Mrs. Davis to
create a child or children to be known as their family. No one disputes the
fact that unless the human embryos, in vitro, are implanted, their lives will
be lost; they will die a passive death.<p>

Mr. Davis strenuously objects to the anonymous donation of the human
embryos even for their survival; Mrs. Davis wants to bring these children to
term; the human embryos were not caused to come into being by Mr. and
Mrs. Davis for any purpose other than the production of their family.
Therefore, the Court finds and concludes that it is to the manifest best
interest of the children, in vitro, that they be made available for
implantation to assure their opportunity for live birth; implantation is their
sole and only
hope for survival. The Court respectfully finds and concludes that it further
serves the best interest of these children for Mrs. Davis to be permitted the
opportunity to bring these children to term through implantation.<p>

It is the judgment of the Court that the temporary custody of the parties'
seven cryogenically preserved human embryos be vested in Mrs. Davis for
the purposes set-forth hereinabove, and that all matters concerning support,
visitation, final custody and related issues be reserved to the Court for
further consideration and disposition at such time as one or more of the
seven cryogenically preserved human embryos are the product of live birth.<p>

Mr. Christenberry, Counsel for Mrs. Davis, will prepare an appropriate
Order, pursuant to and in accord with the provisions of the Court's Opinion,
submit same to Counsel for Mr. Davis and to Counsel for Dr. King for
approval as to form, and the Order will be tendered to the Court for entry
on or before October 23, 1989, taxing the costs hereof to the Plaintiff.<p>

<h3>Some Fundamental Principles Utilized By The Court</h3>

The fundamental duty of any Court is to fairly and impartially administer
justice as between the litigants, resolving aU their disputes, if possible, so
a just end results. Litigants are entitled to understand how the Court arrives
at its decision, even if
they disagree with the resulting judgment.<p>

Where litigation affects or is of interest to a material segment of the public,
the Court is persuaded that an additional and important responsibility is
imposed on the judiciary: to assist the public in understanding the procedures
of the Court.<a name="~a1"><a href="#a1">(1)</a> With
this in mind, the Court deems it appropriate to briefly outline some of the
basic principles of law and rules of evidence which are to be considered by the
Court in connection with its decision in this case; and of equal importance, it
will also be
noted that there exist many theories, ideas and concepts which may not be
considered by the Court in connection with its decision in this case.<p>

The duties and responsibilities of a Trial Court are numerous and are largely
carried out by the Judge without the assistance of others. The Judge is
assisted in his
administrative duties by his Secretary, his Court Officer(s), the Clerk of the
Court and the Clerk's Deputy Clerks. Trial Judges in Tennessee are not provided
law clerks to assist the Court in its research of the law; it is the duty of
Counsel for litigants to
call to the Court's attention applicable legal precedents and, through arguments
given, either orally or through written briefs, to persuade the Court to apply
the referenced law to the facts in the record of the case.<p>

Occasionally, learned members of the bar, on their own initiative or at the
request of the Court with the knowledge of the parties, file <i>amicus
curiae</i>
briefs ("friend of
the court" briefs) to aid and assist the Court in resolving issues of
precedental or unusual nature.<a name="~a2"><a href="#a2">(2)</a> The Honorable
Richard Hash, a member of the Blount County, Tennessee Bar has filed
<i>amicus</i> briefs in this case, for which the Court is most grateful.<p>

<h3>The Oath of Office of a Judge</h3>

In considering the responsibilities of a Trial Court, it is important to
understand
that the Judge has taken an oath of office to administer justice without
respect of persons, to impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on him to
the best of his
skill and ability and he makes a public affirmation to support the
Constitution of the state of Tennessee and of the United States of
America<a name="~a3"><a href="#a3">(3)</a>.<p>

<h3>Trial Court's General Duty</h3>

The Trial Court's general duty is not to change the law, but to work out the
principles already sanctioned by the practice of the past; the duty is to
develop the principles which are found with such consistency as the Trial Court
may be able to attain.<a name="~a4"><a href="#a4">(4)</a><p>

<h3>Weighing the Evidence</h3>

This case was heard by the Court without the intervention of a jury; domestic
relations cases are generally conducted in that manner.<p>

As the finder of fact in a nonjury case, the Court is bound to determine the
facts by what the law perceives to be the "preponderance of the evidence,"
which means that amount of factual information presented to the Court during
the course of the trial which is sufficient to cause it to believe that the
matter being asserted is
probably true. In order to preponderate, the evidence must have the greater
convincing effect in the formation of the belief about the facts; and if the
evidence on a particular issue appears to be equally balanced as between the
contending parties,
the party having the burden of proving that particular issue must fail. The
term "preponderance of the evidence" is sometimes expressed as the greater
weight of the
evidence."<a name="~a5"><a href="#a5">(5)</a>
<a name="~a6"><a href="#a6">(6)</a><p>

The evidence considered by the Court in connection with its findings of fact
may be either direct or circumstantial evidence. It is direct evidence if it
proves a fact without any inference, and which in itself, if it is true,
conclusively establishes that fact. It's circumstantial evidence if it proves a
fact from which the inference of the
existence of another fact may be drawn.<a name="~a7"><a href="#a7">(7)</a> The
law makes no
distinction between
direct and circumstantial evidence as to the degree of proof required.<p>

The finder of fact is correct in considering any evidence of probative value,
that is, evidence which has a tendency to prove or actually proves a
fact.<a name="~a8"><a href="#a8">(8)</a><p>

<h3>No Prejudice, Passion, Sympathy</h3>

In deciding any case, the Court must not be influenced by prejudice, passion or
sympathy, for or against any party.<a name="~a9"><a href="#a9">(9)</a>
Cases are to be decided by the head, not by the heart.<p>

<h3>Conflicting Testimony</h3>

Many times, the Court will hear conflicting testimony. In that connection, it
is the law of evidence in the state of Tennessee that the testimony of one
witness worthy of belief is sufficient for the proof of any fact. Cases are not
decided in conformity with
the testimony of a number of witnesses which does not produce conviction in the
mind of the Court against the testimony of a lesser number of witnesses or other
evidence which appeals to the mind of the Court with more convincing force.<p>

An issue is not to be decided by the simple process of counting the number of
witnesses who have testified on the opposing sides; the final test is not in
the relative number of witnesses, but in the relative convincing force of the
evidence.<a name="~a10"><a href="#a10">(10)</a><p>

In reaching its decision, the Court must consider only the evidence in the
case; however, the Court is not required to set aside its common
knowledge -- "horse sense" -- as it has the right to weigh the evidence in
light of its own observations and experiences of
life.<a href="#a11">(11)</a><p>

<h3>Credibility of the Witnesses</h3>

The finder of fact is the sole and exclusive judge of the credibility (or
believability) of the witnesses who testify in a case. In determining the
credibility of a witness, it is
proper to consider any matter that has a tendency in good reason to prove or to
disprove the truthfulness of that witness' testimony and among the many things
the trier of fact may consider in judging the credibility of the testimony of
any witness are the following: the demeanor of the witness while testifying and
the manner in which he testifies; the character of that witness' testimony; the
extent of his capacity to perceive, to recollect or to communicate about any
matter about which he testifies;
the extent of his opportunity to perceive any matter about which he testifies;
and the existence or non-existence of a bias, interest or other motive for
giving testimony.<a name="~a12"><a href="#a12">(12)</a><p>

<h3>Discrepancies in Testimony</h3>

Often, the trier of fact will note discrepancies in a witness' testimony or
between his testimony and that of others. The notation of that fact, within
itself, does not necessarily mean that the witness should be discredited.
Whether a discrepancy
pertains to a fact of importance or only to a trivial detail should be
considered in weighing its relative
significance.<a name="~a13"><a href="#a13">(13)</a><p>

<h3>Expert Witnesses</h3>

Courts often hear testimony from expert witnesses. A witness who has special
knowledge, skill, experience, training or education in a particular science,
profession or occupation may give his opinion as an expert as to any matter in
which he is skilled.<p>

In determining the weight to be given such an opinion or in resolving
conflicts in the testimony of different expert witnesses, the trier of fact
should consider the qualifications and credibility of the expert, the relative
qualifications and credibility
of the other experts, as well as the reasons, the facts and any other matters
upon which any opinion is based.<p>

The Court is not bound by an expert's opinion, but it must give the weight, if
any, to which the Court thinks it is
entitled.<a name="~a14"><a href="#a14">(14)</a><p>

It must be emphasized that expert testimony is adduced only to aid the trier
of fact to understand the evidence, not to dominate or control the court in the
decision of the disputed issues.<a name="~a15"><a href="#a15">(15)</a><p>

<h3>The Judgment</h3>

In its simplest form, the duty of the Trial Court is to make findings of fact
based on all the evidence presented dunng the course of the trial, regardless
of who presented it, and to apply the applicable law to those facts as the
Court finds them to be. The result is the Court's judgment in the case.<p>

<h3>The Technical Record</h3>

The facts which the Court finally decides as true in the case must appear in
the record of the proceedings. The record of the proceedings is composed of the
pleadings filed by the litigants, any exhibits appropriately attached to the
pleadings,
the testimony of the parties and their witnesses given under oath in open
Court, any
testimony submitted to the Court by way of deposition (testimony given outside
of Court, under oath, and transcribed both as to questions and answers by a
Court Reporter, typed, and in bound form), and any exhibits to the testimony of
the parties and their witnesses deemed appropriate by the Court at the trial
under applicable rules of evidence.<p>

<h3>Judgment Based on In-Court Proceedings</h3>

The Judge of a Court does not live in a vacuum. Just as any other citizen, the
Judge is exposed to the opinions and ideas of others outside the Courtroom by
way of radio, television, newspapers, magazines and the like. This Court has
received
hundreds of communications through the mail from most sincere people who have
expressed their opinion on the case, sent newspaper clippings and other
material for the Court's consideration.<p>

It is not proper for the Court to consider such extrajudicial communications in
making any findings of fact, conclusions of law and the resulting judgment of
the case. This case has not been decided by the Court based upon or influenced
by any such extrajudicial communications.<p>

As a citizen, the Judge of this Trial Court is keenly aware of the various
theological positions which may be impacted by the Court's judgment in this
case; the Court is aware of the various ethical positions which may be impacted
by the Court's decision in this case; the Court is aware that many members of
the public consider the questions involved to be of a strict moral nature, not
of a legal nature, and that the impact of the Court's decision may offend, give
support to or otherwise affect many moral views of a substantial segment of the
public; the Court is aware of the so called "pro-life" and "pro-choice"
factions of society and the Court's decision
in this case may offend, give support to or otherwise impact one side or the
other; and finally, the Court knows the positions of the political parties may
be impacted by the Court's decision.<p>

Consideration of these matters do not come within the purview of the duty or
authority of this Court; the Court's duty is to decide the case based on the
evidence before it and the applicable law to be applied to the facts as the
Court finds them to be. The matter of public policy is fully dealt with by the
Court in its Opinion.<a name="~a16"><a href="#a16">(16)</a><p>

<h3>Divorce Proceedings</h3>

The case at bar is a domestic relations case, heard by the Court without the
intervention of a jury and is, by its very nature, an equity cause of
action.<p>

In a divorce case, it is incumbent upon the Trial Court to take full
responsibility over all issues involved with and arising from the marriage
relationship of the
husband and wife. The Court must find the facts and apply the law in order to
make an equitable distribution of the parties' property, if any, and provide
for the care, custody and support of the parties' minor children, if
any.<a name="~a17"><a href="#a17">(17)</a>
<a name="~a18"><a href="#a18">(18)</a><p>

Because divorce is statutory, the Court must look to the mandates of the
legislature of the state of Tennessee relative to the dissolution of the
parties' marriage
and in considering all the issues involved in connection with the dissolution.
These statutory provisions are discussed in the Court's Opinion.<p>

<h3>Equity Jurisdiction</h3>

In domestic relations matters, the Circuit Courts of our state are vested with
the same equity jurisdiction as exists inherently in the jurisdiction of the
Chancery Courts of our state.<a name="~a19"><a href="#a19">(19)</a><p>

The system of jurisprudence called Equity is best defined by describing its
origin. In England, when an injustice was found at law, or perhaps the law had
no remedy for a particular circumstance, a plea to the Crown or to its Lord
Chancellor led to the creation of a separate system of law -- one where the
Chancellor, as "keeper of the
King's conscience," sought to do equity and to cure the injustice and
inequities often
caused by the inflexible forms of the common law. As the system of equity
jurisprudence grew, its hallmark became one of flexibility and invention to
meet new situations and circumstances.<a name="~a20"><a href="#a20">(20)</a>

Out of equity jurisprudence has arisen a litany of equity maxims: universal
statements of justice. Equity maxims lie at the foundation of universal justice
and have been worthily and aptly called
"the law of laws."<a href="#a21">(21)</a>
It is a part of our jurisprudence system that in default of the law, the maxim
rules;<a name="~a22"><a href="#a22">(22)</a> maxims have an
inherent probative force and need not be
proved<a name="~a23"><a href="#a23">(23)</a>
and, among many other salient
sage pronouncements, one maxim forcefully notes that the welfare of the people
is the supreme law and the rights of the individual must be subordinated to
public good.<a name="~a24"><a href="#a24">(24)</a><p>

<h3>Judicial Discretion</h3>

Another fundamental tool in the administration of equity jurisprudence is the
ability of the Court to temper the Court's decisions with judicial
discretion.<p>

Judicial discretion may be defined as the liberty which a Judge posesses to
decide as may seem to him, in the light of his experience, right and just under
the circumstances of the particular case, not being governed in such decision
by any inflexible rule of law, but being guided by the principles of law and
justice.<a name="~a25"><a href="#a25">(25)</a><p>

This flexibility is needed in our jurisprudence system: no compiler of laws and
codes has yet been able to devise a system of laws that will embrace all
situations and will furnish the means of solving all jural and social
difficulties. In the very nature of things, it is impossible to foresee and
anticipate all events of life; yet Judges and
lawyers must never forget that things unanticipated and unsuspected will surely
arise and those matters must be dealt with as difficulties and obstructions
which must be solved by the possessors of the power to adjudicate; hence the
unquestioned assumption of the Judges of the right and the power to dispose of
the unheard and the unpredictable.<a name="~a26"><a href="#a26">(26)</a><p>

In its broadest sense, judicial discretion is a feeling of right and wrong
which has
arisen or been brought about from the combination of various legal and
equitable considerations which have never been reduced to codes or written laws
but are nevertheless essential parts of an enlightened system of
junsprudence.<a name="~a27"><a href="#a27">(27)</a> In its narrower sense it is
referred to as
the capacity of
the trial judge to understand and to apply the law of the land to particular
facts or situations arising in
a pending lawsuit and which call for some decision which will tend toward a
settlement of the rights of the parties and the attainment of
justice.<a href="#a28">(28)</a><p>

Judicial discretion concerns itself with the election or choice between two or
more courses of action. It implies a discriminating examination of alternatives
for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion as to which is the better way of
solving or obviating a difficulty or attaining a certain end. It is further
suggested that judicial discretion has reference to the mental faculty of
separating the whole of a set of circumstances into its parts and the balancing
of its several elements and when it is considered in connection with judicial
power, it can readily be seen that the true meaning of the term is the
discrimating consideration of all the contending elements of forces not
controlled by well-established rules of law and the adoption of the most
feasible, convenient, and efficacious way of proceeding with the
administration of justice.<a name="~a29"><a href="#a29">(29)</a><p>

But judicial discretion has its limitations, and a noteable one is that it
must be understood that at no time can Judges act arbitrarily or capaciously
and in disregard of the spirit of the law and of sound public
policy.<a name="~a30"><a href="#a30">(30)</a><p>

<h3>Judicial Notice</h3>

It has been aptly stated that for every rule at law or in life there is at
least one exception. Judicial notice is a note-worthy exception to the rule
that each case must be decided based strictly on the technical record before
it.<p>

Judicial notice is the cognizance by the Court of certain facts which Judges
may properly accept and act upon without proof because they already know them.
A fact of which a Court takes judicial notice must be universally regarded as
established.<a name="~a31"><a href="#a31">(31)</a><p>

Our Tennessee Courts have spoken often about how our Trial Courts hase used
and abused their concepts of judicial notice. The appellate Courts have held
that a Trial Court cannot take judicial notice of the contents of scientific
books and treatises,<a name="~a32"><a href="#a32">(32)</a> but has permitted
Trial Courts to
take judicial notice
of facts universally known and found in encyclopedias and dictionaries if the
facts are of such universal notoriety and so generally understood that those
facts may be regarded as forming a part of the common knowledge of every
person.<a name="~a33"><a href="#a33">(33)</a><p>

In addition, Trial Courts are permitted to take judicial notice of facts
relating to human life, health and habits and management and conduct of
businesses which are common knowledge; and such matters may be properly
considered by the finder of fact in its determination of inferences to be drawn
from proven circumstantial facts.<a name="~a34"><a href="#a34">(34)</a><p>

<h3>The Intent of Appendix A</h3>

The foregoing is submitted for the reader's consideration of several general
rules and principles which assist the Trial Court in reaching a fair and just
decision. But because each case is different, the specific rules applicable to
each case may also vary according to the nature of any given case.<p>

It is the Court's intent that by deliniating the foregoing rules and
principles some of the judicial mystique surrounding the way our Courts operate
will be stripped away and the reader will better understand how and why some
results are reached in this complicated legal proceeding.<p>

<h2>APPENDIX B</h2>

The following constitutes the Court's summary of testimony given by the
respective witnesses at the trial:<p>

<h3>Junior Lewis Davis</h3>

Junior Lewis ("J.R.") Davis is thirty years of age, employed as an electrician
and a refrigeration technician by the Maryville Housing Authonty, Maryville,
Tennessee, earning about $17,500.00 annually.<p>

Mr. and Mrs. Davis met while both were in the United States Army in Germany
and were married about nine years ago. Both Mr. and Mrs. Davis very much wanted
to have children and after Mrs. Davis suffered some half dozen tubular
pregnancies, the couple consulted Dr. Ray King in the Fall, 1985, shortly after
which they entered the in vitro fertilization program under Dr. King's
guidance.<p>

After several IVF attempts, Mrs. Davis failed to be pregnant and the parties
temporarily abandoned the program and sought to adopt a child. A Kentucky girl,
pregnant with child, offered her child for adoption prior to birth. The Davises
paid her medical expenses, but upon delivery, the Mother chose to keep the
child.<p>

The parties had discussed on many occasions their keen desire to have a family,
had decided they wanted at least two children by way of adoption or through IVF
and were thwarted in their attempts through either method.<p>

In the Fall, 1988, Mr. Davis noted the parties marriage had been somewhat
unstable for about two years. Notwithstanding the status of his marriage in
the mind of Mr. Davis, (Mrs. Davis testified she was not aware their marriage
had incurred the problems Mr. Davis testified about), the Davises agreed to
again enter King's IVF program in an effort to have a child. Mrs. Davis
counseled with Dr. King about cryopreservation of embryos for future use, Mrs.
Davis explained the technique and procedure to Mr. Davis and the parties agreed
to this technique as a part of their resumption of IVF attempts to accomplish a
family.<p>

In December, 1988 nine ova were surgically extracted from Mrs. Davis, all of
them inseminated in Dr. Shiver's laboratory with Mr. Davis' sperm. The nine ova
were fertilized, two were implanted in Mrs. Davis with the hope that one would
cause her to become pregnant and the remaining seven were cryopreserved by Dr.
Shivers for future implantation purposes. No detailed discussions were
undertaken with Mr. Davis by Dr. King or others relative to cryopreservation
and no decision was made by Mr. and Mrs. Davis as to the disposition of their
cryopreserved embryos in the event of divorce, death or other unforeseen
eventuality. No writing was executed by the parties as to the subject
embryos.<p>

The night of the implantation (December 10, 1988), Mr. and Mrs. Davis discussed
how long the embryos would last in cryopreservation and the possibility of
donating embryos not utilized in causing Mrs. Davis to be pregnant. Mr. Davis
acknowledged the embryos were frozen with "... the intent they be saved for
later use ...", but maintained there was no decision or even any discussion
relative to whether they would be used in the marriage or out of the
marriage.<p>

Mr. Davis requests the Court to: (1) give Mr. and Mrs. Davis joint custody of
their embryos; or (2) prohibit Mrs. Davis or another from using the embryos for
implantation until he can decide about their disposition; or (3) if none of the
foregoing, then consider only Mrs. Davis as a suitable party for implantation
(Mr. Davis opposes destruction of the embryos, but prefers their destruction
rather than allow someone other than Mrs. Davis to implant the embryos).<p>

As to his joint custody request, Mr. Davis emphasized that he does not want
exclusive control over the embryos; he insisted that he and Mrs. Davis should
jointly decide about their disposition; that all decisions prior to the divorce
were jointly made by the parties; that only the parties should be involved as
to future decisions. Davis insists that until the parties can agree, the
embryos should remain in their cryopreserved state.<p>

Mr. Davis opposes Mrs. Davis' use of the embryos because he does not want to be
"... raped of my reproductive rights ..."; he maintains her use without his
consent forces unwanted parenthood on him, a situation which disturbs him
greatly. He doesn't want a child produced to live in a single-parent situation.
Mr. Davis detailed how his own life, at age 6, had been shattered by the
divorce of his Mother and Father; how he and three brothers were sent to a boys
home where he stayed until age 18; he related the problems he experienced being
away from his family and he emphasized his despair because there was no natural
bond with his parents. Because
of his own shattered and disappointing childhood, he became angry, he became
distrustful of others and he bears that psychological burden even today. He
strongly and sincerely insists that because of his poor relationship with his
own parents he strenuously objects to bringing a child into the world who would
suffer the same or a similar experience without any opportunity on his part to
bond with his child.<p>

Mr. Davis objected to the anonymous donation of the embryos to another
infertile couple inasmuch as it would place a great psychological and emotional
burden on both him and Mrs. Davis. In addition, he testified that the parents
of the potential child might possibly divorce in the future, giving rise to
enhanced apprehension for the child's welfare.<p>

As to destruction of the embryos, Mr. Davis speculated that someday he might
change his mind about their disposition and would then regret any such action.
He opposes their destruction except in lieu of donation to anonymous
recipients.<p>

It is Mr. Davis' position that the embryos do not constitute life, but firmly
believes the embryos have the "potential for life." (Davis commented that he is
very much opposed to abortion.) He maintained that if the only choices are to
donate the embryos to anonymous recipients or allow Mrs. Davis to use them, he
would prefer Mrs. Davis having them.<p>

If Mrs. Davis is awarded the embryos and a child results, Davis testified that
he would visit with the child as much as possible and he would try to develop a
parent-child bond; in addition, he would actively seek to support his child and
he would actively seek the custody of his child.<p>

Davis readily admits that he and Mrs. Davis began and continued the IVF
program with Dr. King with the intent and for the purpose of having a child or
children.<p>

<h3>John A. Robertson</h3>

Professor John A. Robertson is a Baker and Botts Professor of Law at the
University of Texas at Austin, Texas.<p>

Professor Robertson testified that he is a member of the American Fertility
Society's Ethics Committee, serving since the Fall, 1985. The AFS's first
publication came about in 1984-85 and on the subject of ethical considerations
of the human preembryo, the AFS had taken the position that human preembryos
are not persons,
but deserve special respect because human preembryos have the potential to
become persons. AFS guidelines constitute suggested standards of care for
physicians involved in fertility practice and are generally utilized for
litigation purposes.
Robertson did not appear as a spokesperson for the AFS, but as a scholar who
researched the issue, formed an opinion and written an article concerning this
specific case, as well as many other articles dealing primarily with issues
relating to non-coital reproduction.<p>

Professor Robertson described his understanding of a human preembryo as an
entity composed of a group of undifferentiated cells which have no organs or
nervous system. He testitied that at about 10-14 days, the preembryo attaches
itself to the uterine wall, develops its primitive streak and life then
commences. Robertson believes it is "not clear" that a human preembryo is a
unique individual; that simply because fertilization has occured, the gamete
contributors have not procreated.<p>

Robertson asserts the position that both gamete contributors are the only
decisional authonties over their preembryos; in the event the gamete
contributors cannot agree, it is his position the preembryos should be allowed
to die a passive death.<p>

Where there is no [statutory] law, no agreement between the gamete contributors
nor any previous Court decision on which to rely, Professor Robertson reasons
that the Court, as in this case, should then decide the case by balancing the
equities as between the two gamete contributors and, in this case, decide in
favor of the party who does not want to go forward with parenthood, Mr. Davis.
The precise issue in this case, according to Professor Robertson, is the
balancing of the equities; that is, considering the relative burdens of the
parties, the Court should make a determination
of which party will be injured more if the process goes forward. In this case,
Professor Robertson sides with Mr. Davis because of the traumatic psychological
burdens of being forced to be a parent against his will, countered by the
ability of Mrs. Davis to apparently successfully participate in the IVF program
with another partner in the future.<p>

As to the law applicable to in vitro fertilization, Robertson concedes that his
research has indicated there is no case precisely in point to give this Court
guidance.
He recited Great Britain's Wornack Committee consideration of similar issues in
1978, the <i>Rios</i>
case in Australia in 1984, the New York <i>Delrio</i> tort case in 1978, the
Pennsylvania Statute of 1980 (recordkeeping, mainly), and the Louisiana Statute
passed in 1986 which, among other things, limits the authority of parents as to
disposition of their preembryos and grants certain as yet unquantified rights
to preembryos to sue and be sued.<p>

Robertson opines that the <i>Webster</i> case possibly leaves open the question
of whether a state may pass a Constitutionally sound statute regulating IVF
transactions derived from the point of view that fertilization/conception is
the commencement of human life. The <i>Webster</i> Court declined consideration
of the preamble issue, did not decide it and said it had no effect or bearing
on the Webster issues, thus leaving unsettled whether the preamble provisions
passed relevant Constitutional scrutiny.<p>

<h3>Irving Ray King</h3>

Dr. Irving Ray King is a medical doctor, licensed by the State of Tennessee and
has been involved in the subspecialty of Gynecology, Infertility/Reproductive
Endocrinology, for some twelve years. He operates the Fertility Center of East
Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee; the intent of his IVF practice and the
ultimate goal of the cryopreservation procedure is to assist infertile couples
to become parents.<p>

Dr. King testified that the natural human pregnancy rate is about 25%; that
humans are not the best reproducers of the mammalian species; that there are
seven general indicia of infertility; and there is about a 50% success rate in
correcting some or all of the general causes of infertility.<p>

As to Mrs. Davis, Dr. King testified that while she could become pregnant she
could not follow with a normal birth. After some five miscarriages and surgery
in 1983, he recommended in vitro fertilization as an alternative way of
accomplishing the strong desire of Mr. and Mrs. Davis to have a family.<p>

Dr. King outlined the history of in vitro fertilization, beginning with the
first success in the United States in 1978 and how he came to establish his
clinic in the Fall, 1984. Statistics as to success rate and the methodology and
procedures of in vitro fertilization were outlined.<p>

In October, 1988 Dr. King employed a new program whereby excess preembryos
could be cryogenically preserved for later implantation, thereby avoiding the
necessity of aspiration and insemination on the occasion of each implantation.
Dr. King delineated the December, 1988 procedures resulting in the extraction
from Mrs. Davis of nine ovum, the laboratory insemination of the ovum, all of
which were fertilized, two of which were implanted and seven of which were
cryogenically frozen. Dr. King is of the opinion that Mrs. Davis has a 52%
chance of becoming pregnant utilizing the seven preserved preembryos and there
is no medical reason Mrs. Davis cannot use the preembryos.<p>

King testified that in the development of a human child from the first cell
division after fertilization to the embryo stage, there is first a one cell
gamete, a zygote (after the first cell divides), a preembryo (up to fourteen
days after fertilization) and finally an embryo (after fourteen days and upon
cell differentiation).<p>

As to the Davis' IVF attempts, Dr. King testified that the normal cost was from
$4,000 to $6,000, each attempt. No forms were signed by the Davises and
Dr. King has no recollection of whether Mr. Davis was present when he spoke
with Mrs. Davis about whether unused preembryos would be cryogenically
preserved.<p>

Dr. King testified that cryopreserved human preembryos can be kept in good
condition for at least two years, but King had no further data on the length of
cryopreservation. Dr. King acknowledged that freezing and thawing is the
hazardous part of cryopreservation. An annual storage fee is charged for
cryopreservation.<p>

Normally, a woman can produce eggs until about 52 or 53; after 35, there is a
concern because of Down's Syndrome and other genetic malfunction, and it is
possible to implant eggs relatively late in life, as long as the eggs have
been extracted early in life.<p>

When the seven preembryos were cryopreserved, five were of the four-cell stage
and two were in cleavage between four and eight cells. As to all seven, there
is no cell differentation and twinning is still possible.<p>

Dr. King knows of no physical reason why Mrs. Davis cannot undergo future
ovum aspirations with a similar success rate, recognizing that her health
varies from cycle to cycle. Dr. King has treated Mrs. Davis for six years, has
performed 21 aspirations and has transferred 14 preembryos, none of which have
resulted in pregnancy. Dr. King characterizes Mrs. Davis as "a committed person
in an effort to have a child."<p>

Considering Mrs. Davis' infertility, IVF is the only method available to Mrs.
Davis for having a child.<p>

Dr. King testified there are no guarantees Mrs. Davis could ever produce
another usable egg and notwithstanding his clinic's current policy to not allow
single persons to participate in the IVF program, if the Court awarded her the
preembryos, he would implant the preembryos at her request.<p>

Dr. King's theory of balancing the equities between the parties is that there
is no more psychological burden on one party than the other; that both parties
are very much emotionally involved; that the seven preembryos are of excellent
quality; that a 52% chance of pregnancy exists for Mrs. Davis if all seven
preembryos were thawed and implanted; and that the greater benefit would be
bestowed if Mrs. Davis were allowed to use them.<p>

Under all circumstances, Dr. King opposes destruction or unlimited
cryopreservation, suggesting the embryos be anonymously donated if not used by
Mrs. Davis.<p>

<h3>Charles Alex Shivers</h3>

Dr. Charles A. Shivers is the Head of the University of Tennessee Department of
Zoology, Knoxville, Tennessee. Since 1963, Dr. Shivers has been involved in
teaching and research in biology and chemistry at U.T.; he is an Embryologist,
teaching and directing graduate work in the study of the development of the
embryo. Dr. Shivers has worked in the field of embryology since 1958 and has
worked with in vitro fertilization with Dr. King since 1984. His work is
primarily in the laboratory.<p>

Dr. Shivers explained to the Court the various steps and procedures from
aspiration (extraction of ovum) to implantation and gave detailed testimony
regarding his laboratory work.<p>

In explaining the normal process of his laboratory work for IVF patients after
aspiration, Dr. Shivers defined "insemination" as the laboratory worker's
placing of the male sperm and the female ovum together in a laboratory petre
dish and that "fertilization" was the actual joinder of an ovum and a sperm (a
union, fusion), which process was entirely completed by the sperm and ovum
without the intervention of lab workers or mechanical devices. Under ordinary
circumstances, Dr. Shivers said, fertilization takes place sometime after
insemination and usually within four-six-eight hours of insemination.
Ordinarily, inseminated eggs are left in a secure laboratory environment
overnight for examination by him the following morning. Under ordinary
circumstances, and upon inspection the following morning, fertilization can be
determined by using a powerful microscope;
the fertilized ovum continues in the laboratory environment until from two to
eight cell development has taken place at which time implantation is usually
perfected through an out-patient type procedure.<p>

Dr. Shivers stated that cryopreservation of animal cells had been conducted
since the 1970's and that he had participated in the cryopreservation of human
cells in connection with the IVF program since 1988.<p>

As to his contact with Mr. and Mrs. Davis, Dr. Shivers indicated that he had
worked with the couple since July 30, 1985; that thereafter he had completed
only one cryopreservation of human embryos for the Davises when nine ova were
extracted from Mrs. Davis, all nine were inseminated in his laboratory, two
were transferred by Dr. King to Mrs. Davis and the remaining seven were
committed to cryopreservation pursuant to considerable discussion with Mr. and
Mrs. Davis as to how many preembryos to transfer and how many preembryos to
cryopreserve.<p>

Dr. Shivers stated that all seven frozen embryos were from the four to eight
cell development stage when frozen and all of them appeared to be of first-rate
quality.<p>

Dr. Shivers expressed the opinion that the chances of a pregnancy resulting
from frozen then thawed preembryos are better than the implantation of freshly
fertilized preembryos, the risk to cryopreserved preembryos being mainly in the
freezing process.<p>

Dr. Shivers testified that the longest human preembryos have been stored and
remain viable has been for an approximate two-year penod; that embryos of mice
have been successfully preserved for as long as ten years; and that it was
impossible for him to offer an opinion about the condition of human preembryos
past two years.<p>

In the opinion of Dr. Shivers, a human preembrvo is a zygote up to
eleven-fourteen days and consists largely of undifferentiated cells, that after
attachment to the uterus wall and the appearance of the pnmitive streak, the
cells then become different: that is organs, organ systems, body parts and the
like are formed. At the time of fertilization, Dr. Shivers testified, genetic
controls are "locked in forever" and control who the preembryo will later be,
but, Shivers stated, "... as far as we know ..., to my knowledge ..., there
is no way to distinguish the cells [at the zygote state] ... they are the
same [i.e., undifferentiated] ..."<p>

Dunng the course of his testimony, Dr. Shivers greatly assisted the Court by
using photographic slides to visually demonstrate many areas of his testimony,
for all of which the Court is deeply grateful.<p>

<h3>Deborah Cooper McCarter</h3>

Deborah Cooper McCarter, is a Registered Nurse, the pnmary patient coordinator
for Dr. King's IVF clinic. She is a liaison between patients and their spouses
and Dr. King, she teaches medication injection techniques, gives new couples
counselling about IVF and its step-by-step procedures and generally is an
administrative assistant to Dr. King, scheduling and coordinating the various
IVF procedures from start to finish.<p>

Normally, Ms. McCarter is responsible for obtaining informed consent-type forms
to be executed by participants, but, through oversight no forms were executed
by the Davises. (The December, 1988 document utilized by Dr. King contained no
covenant or understanding which would be, had it been executed, dispositive of
the issues in this case.)<p>

In December, 1988, Ms. McCarter recalls an approximate ten minute discussion
with Mr. and Mrs. Davis relative to the cryopreservation process, at which
time both Mr. and Mrs. Davis acknowledged themselves to be willing participants
in cryopreservation of embryos not utilized for implantation on December 10,
1988.<p>

On the morning of Mrs. Davis' last implantation (December 10, 1988), Ms.
McCarter distinctly recalls a statement made to her by Mrs. Davis (she is not
certain at all that Mr. Davis was present when the statement was made) to the
effect that if she became pregnant as a result of the December, 1988
implantation, she would consider donating the cryopreserved embryos to another
infertile couple for implantation.<p>

<h3>Mary Sue Easterly Davis</h3>

Mary Sue Davis is twenty-eight years of age; she has twin brothers. At the
trial, Mrs. Davis was employed by the Sea Ray Boat Company, Vonore, Tennessee,
as a sales representative, earning about $18,000.00 annually. The record shows
that since the trial, Mrs. Davis is now domiciled in the state of Florida.<p>

Mrs. Davis testified at some length about the trauma and pain she suffered
resulting from five tubal pregnancies during the course of the parties'
marriage. At the fifth tubal pregnancy, the marriage had lasted four years; she
concluded she could no longer endure further natural attempts to bear a child
even though she and Mr. Davis remained desirous of having children.<p>

The couple turned to Dr. King's IVF program in 1985 and six IVF attempts were
made for her to become pregnant. She gave considerable testimony relative to
the many injections she received or administered to herself to prepare her body
reproductive system for the removal of her eggs in preparation for the IVF
procedures; and she emphasized the painful, physically trying, emotionally and
mentally taxing ordeals she endured to participate in the program. During six
IVF attempts, no cryopreservation procedures were employed; each implantation
was the culmination of weeks of preparation -- drugs to stimulate her
reproductive system, surgical extraction of ova, insemination in vitro, anxious
hours of waiting to confirm fertilization, implantation -- then additional
weeks of waiting to determine if an in utero pregnancy had occured. The six IVF
attempts were futile; each attempt cost from $4,000.00 to $6,000.00.<p>

At the last aspiration and implant (December, 1988) and at the time the embryos
were cryopreserved, Mrs. Davis testified she didn't realize the parties'
marriage was so "rocky", else she wouldn't have participated in the attempt;
that there was an understanding between herself and Mr. Davis relative to the
cryopreservation process and she testified that "... we [Mr. and Mrs. Davis]
made decisions together as to when to reenter [the IVF program] ..."<p>

Mrs. Davis testified the embryos are "... the beginning of life ... I'm the
Mother of the embryos ..."; she feels an attachment to the embryos, views
them as children, testified she would like to have her own children through
their implantation and requested the Court to award the embryos to her for that
purpose. In the event she is not allowed to utilize the embryos, she testified,
she would not foreclose the possibility of donating them for use by another
infertile couple.<p>

Mrs. Davis testified that her husband consented to being a Father; that their
efforst constituted a partnership to become parents; and that she and Mr. Davis
had tentatively planned to implant one cryopreserved embryo in March or April,
1989. She says it is difficult for her to understand her husband's somewhat
sudden change in position.<p>

Mrs. Davis assured the court that she would have no problem raising a child as
a single parent, especially in light of Mr. Davis' expressed willingness to be
a Father to and support such a child even after dissolution of their marriage;
that allowing the embryos to remain frozen is equivalent to killing them
inasmuch as she understands that two years is the maximum life of cryopreserved
human embryos.<p>

Mrs. Davis responded to Professor Robertson's testimony that the court should
allow the embryos to die a passive death by remaining frozen: she maintains
that if the embryos can suffer a "passive death, then they must constitute
life."<p>

<h3>Sue Easterly</h3>

Mrs. Sue Easterly, is the Mother of Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Easterly's brief testimony
indicated her strong affection for her son-in-law, describing Mr. Davis as
having been "... like a son to me."<p>

Mrs. Easterly testified that she is the Mother of six children and she would
very much like to be a Grandmother as the result of her daughter's having a
child.<p>

<h3>Jerome Lejeune</h3>

Dr. Jerome Lejeune is a Medical Doctor, a Doctor in Science and has been a
Professor of Fundamental Genetics for about 20 years. He started his medical
practice as a Pediatrician, now for several years specializing in Genetics,
is a French citizen, residing, teaching and practicing his profession in Paris,
France. Dr. Lejeune
discovered the genetic cause of Down's Syndrome, receiving the Kennedy Prize
for the discovery and, in addition, Dr. Lejeune received the Memorial Allen
Award Medal, the highest award for work in the field of Genetics in the world.
Both awards are conferred in the United States.<p>

Dr. Lejeune testified that artificial fertilization is not new to biology,
having been applied to animals long before it was applied to man; and that in
vitro fertilization is an area with which he is familiar, having first written
an article on the subject some fifteen years ago, before the modern practice of
IVF came into being.<p>

In considering the IVF process, Dr. Lejeune stated it is important to
understand the meaning of fertilization at the beginning of a human being: that
each human has a unique beginning which occurs at the moment of conception. Dr.
Lejeune testified that when the 23 chromosomes carried by a sperm encounter the
23 chromosomes carried by the ovum, all information necessary and sufficient to
spell out all the characteristics of a new human being is then gathered in one
place; that upon
fertilization of the ovum by the sperm, a unique personal constitution is
spelled out for the specific human being then created, which personal
constitution has never occurred before and will never occur again.<p>

Dr. Lejeune testified that the novelty of the unique creation has been known by
scientific induction for more than 50 years, but because of the minuteness of
the information wntten on the DNA molecule of the chromosome, such supposition
was a mere scientific hypothesis until about two years ago when it became a
demonstrable scientific fact.<p>

Dr. Lejeune gave detailed information to the Court relative to the composition
of the DNA molecule of a human chromosome, generally defining it as a long
thread of about one meter in length, cut in 23 pieces, each piece being coiled
on itself very tightly to make a spiral so that under the microscope, it
appears as a very tiny rod.<p>

In comparing the difference between IVF fertilization and natural
fertilization, Dr. Lejeune stated that the only difference is that the sperm
and the egg are meeting inside a tube of glass because the egg has been removed
from the body of the woman and the sperm has just been added to the tube of
glass, pointing out that it is not at
all the inseminator who makes fertilization but it is the sperm that makes the
fertilization. Fertilization, Lejeune stated, can not be implemented by man;
fertilization requires that it come about directly by the cells. What is
reproduced and transmitted as a result of fertilization is information by way
of the DNA molecules;
the information then antimates matter.<p>

Turning to cryopreservation (sometimes called "freezing") of human embryos, Dr.
Lejeune offered the opinion that temperature is merely a measure of the speed
at which molecules move in a given medium; that if one progressively diminished
temperature, the speed and the number of collisions between the molecules are
progressively slowed down and, therefore, time is frozen, not embryos. Life is
not arrested at freezing and life is not started again when thawed: time for
the embryo has been arrested and in the human species, a human embryo cannot
successfully withstand an arrest of time greater than two years.<p>

As to the term "preembryo," Dr. Lejeune is of the opinion that there is no such
word. In support of his position, Dr. Lejeune cited to the Court the definition
of embryo, found in his dictionary printed some fifty years ago: "... that
youngest form of a being ..." There is no need, he testified, for a subclass
of the embryo to be
called a preembryo, because there is nothing before the embryo; before an
embryo there is only a sperm and an egg when the egg is fertilized by the
sperm, the entity becomes a zygote; and when the zygote divides it is an
embryo. When the first cell exists, all the "tricks of the trade" (or "tricks
of Mother Nature" as he later called it)
to build itself into an individual already exists. This fact has been known for
many years, Dr. Lejeune testified, by induction but is now scientifically
demonstrated in the
laboratory. Lejeune stated the term "preembryo" is misleading and was invented
by the British to lead one to believe there is a difference between a preembryo
and an embryo when there is no such entity as a preembryo.<p>

In describing the cell division which takes place shortly after fertilization,
Dr. Lejeune stated that at the three-cell stage, "... tiny human being ..."
exists and that less than two years ago through a discovery of [Dr. Alec]
Jeffreys in England
("... the remarkable manipulator of DNA ..."), it is now an
experimentally-demonstrated fact that at the three-cell stage, every individual
is uniquely different from any other individual and the probability that the
genetic information found in
one cell would be identical to another person is less than one in one billion.
Through further research and discovery not more than two years ago, Dr. Lejeune
testified, Jeffreys developed a technique whereby one molecule could be taken
from one cell and in the nucleus of that cell the uniqueness of the individual
could be scientifically demonstrated.<p>

But the most remarkable discovery of all, said Dr. Lejeune, came about only
four years ago through the work of Sanai [sic], whereby it became demonstrated
that some of the basis of DNA were carrying an extra piece of material called
methyl (CH3). Dr. Lejeune testified the import of this discovery is that the
DNA carried by the sperm is not underlined or crossed by methylation on the
same place that the equivalent molecule, chromosomes carried by the ovum; the
sperm contains the ability to underline certain information from step to step
in the process resulting in the fact that at the moment the two sets of
chromosomes coming from the sperm
and egg are joined, they are not identical, as had been thought for years.
When the ovum is fertilized by the sperm, the result is "... the most
specialized cell under the
sun ..."; specialized from the point of view that no other cell will ever again
have the same instructions in the life of the individual being created.<p>

The special underlining instructions tell the cells when it splits in three,
all the information it needs to form the unique individual under construction.
Dr. Lejeune stated that during the process, as the cell develops, nothing new
is learned by the developing cells, but progressively a lot of things are
forgotten: the first cell knew more than the three cell stage, and the three
cell stage knew more than any of those
to follow. In other words, Lejeune explained, the information is written in the
first cell and it is not written progressively in the other cells. This
information is not theoretical, Dr. Lejeune said, it is information which the
science of genetics now knows beyond any doubt.<p>

Lejeune described the cell resulting immediately after fertilization in this
way: "... at the very beginning of life the genetic information and the
molecular structure of the egg, the spirit and the matter, the soul and the
body must be that tightly intricated because it is a beginning of the new
marvel that we call a human ..."<p>

Assuming the embryos are early human beings, Dr. Lejeune offered the opinion
that those early human beings constituted Mrs. Davis' own flesh (and are also
Mr. Davis' flesh) and that the hospitality of her body is the best place in the
world for them to be. He asserted that "... the early human beings in the
concentration can ... are not spare parts in which we could take at random,
they are not expenmental material that we could freeze and defreeze at our own
will, they are not property that we could exchange against anything ... An
early human being inside the suspended time which is the can cannot be the
property of anybody because it's
the only one in the world to have the property of building himself ... As soon
as he has been conceived, a man is a man."<p>

Because of Jeffreys' relatively recent discoveries and the development of
scientifically provable procedures to verify through DNA that all of life's
messages are written in the very first cell, Dr. Lejeune stated the conclusion
that the mystery of cell differentation has been solved because we now know
where the information is written. He testified the observation or conclusion
that the one cell of the fertilized zygote is an apparently undifferentiated
cell mass is wrong; that the new findings recited definitively prove
differentiation and that from the very beginning there exists
an embryo.<p>

On cross-examination, Dr. Lejeune explained the meaning of the Hippocratic
Oath: that it does not matter what the size of the patient, a patient is a
patient.<p>

In explaining the difference between the rights an early human being should
have compared to a later human being (such as an adult), Dr. Lejeune explained:
"as far as your nature is concerned, I cannot see any difference between the
early human being you were and the late human being you are because in both
cases, you were and you are a member of our species ..."<p>

On the subject of whether or not the embryos constitute property, Dr. Lejeune
testified that no scientist has ever offered the opinion that an embryo is
property; that he had never heard one of his colleagues say to him or to anyone
else that a frozen embryo is the property of somebody, that it could be sold,
that it could be destroyed like property.<p>

Dr. Lejeune offered the opinion that the person to have custody of the embryos
is the person who "... would preserve the life of the embryos ... the
Solomon decision. The Mother is the one who prefers the baby be given to
another than the baby being killed. Then I would suppose that the justice would
be on the side of Solomon ..."<p>

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3>WEBSTER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, ET AL<br>
v<br>
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL</h3>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.<p>

No. 88-605. Argued April 26, 1989 -- Decided July 3, 1989<p>
</center>

Appellees, state-employed health professionals and private nonprofit
corporations providing abortion services, brought suit in the District
Court for
declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of a
Missouri statute regulating the performance of abortions. The statute,
<i>inter alia:</i> (1) sets forth "findings" in its preamble that "[t]he life
of each human being begins at conception," and that "unborn children have
protectable interests in life, health, and well-being," &#167;&#167;1.205.1(1),
(2), and requires
that all state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the same
rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the Federal Constitution and this
Court's precedents, &#167;1.205.2; (2) specifies that a physician, prior to
performing an abortion on any woman whom he has reason to believe is 20 or more
weeks pregnant, must ascertain whether the fetus is "viable" by performing
"such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of [the
fetus'] gestational age, weight, and lung maturity," &#167;188.029; (3)
prohibits
the use of public employees and facilities to perform or assist
abortions not necessary to save the mother's life, &#167;&#167;188.210,
188.215; and (4)
makes it unlawful to use public funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose
of "encouraging or counseling" a woman to have an abortion not necessary to
save her life, &#167;&#167; 188.205, 188.210, 188.215. The District Court
struck down each of the above provisions, among others, and enjoined their
enforcement. The
Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the provisions in question violated this
Court's decisions in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, 410 U.S. 113, and subsequent cases.<p>

<i>Held:</i> The judgment is reversed.<p>

<a href="webst-o.htm">Rehnquist,</a> C. J., announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Part II-C, the

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3>WEBSTER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, ET AL<br>
v<br>
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL</h3>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.<p>

No. 88-605. Argued April 26, 1989 -- Decided July 3, 1989<p>
</center>

[*498] CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST announced the judgment
of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I,
II-A, II-B, and II-C, and an opinion with respect [*499] to Parts II-D and
III, in which JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE KENNEDY join.<p>

This appeal concerns the constitutionality of a Missouri statute regulating
the performance of abortions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit struck down several provisions of the statute on the ground
that they violated this Court's decision in <i>Roe
v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113  (1973),
and cases following it. We noted probable jurisdiction, 488 U.S. 1003 (1989),
and now reverse.<p>

[*500]<p>
<h2 align=center>I</h2>

In June 1986, the Governor of Missouri signed into law Missouri Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1596 (hereinafter Act or
statute), which amended existing state law concerning unborn children and
abortions.<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a>
[*501] The Act consisted of 20 provisions, 5 of which are now
before the Court. The first provision, or preamble, contains "findings" by the
state legislature that "[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,"
and that "unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and
well-being." Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167;1.205.1(1), (2) (1986). The Act
further requires
that all Missouri laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the same
rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the Federal Constitution and this
Court's precedents. &#167;1.205.2. Among its other provisions, the Act
requires
that, prior to performing an abortion on any woman whom a physician has
reason to believe is 20 or more weeks pregnant, the physician ascertain
whether the fetus is viable by performing "such medical examinations and tests
as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational  age, weight, and lung
maturity of the unborn child." &#167;188.029. The Act also prohibits the use
of
public employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not necessary to
save the mother's life, and it prohibits the use of public funds, employees, or
facilities for the purpose of "encouraging or counseling" a woman to have an
abortion not necessary to save her life. &#167;&#167;188.205, 188.210,
188.215.<p>

In July 1986, five health professionals employed by the State and two
nonprofit corporations brought this class action in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Missouri to challenge the constitutionality
of the Missouri statute. Plaintiffs, appellees in this Court, sought
declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that certain statutory
provisions violated the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the
Federal Constitution.
App. A9. They asserted violations of various rights, including the
"privacy [*502] rights of pregnant women seeking abortions"; the "woman's
right to an abortion"; the "righ[t] to privacy in the physician-patient
relationship"; the physician's "righ[t] to practice medicine"; the pregnant
woman's "right to life due to inherent risks involved in childbirth"; and the
woman's right to "receive ... adequate medical advice and treatment"
concerning abortions. <i>Id.</i>, at A17-A19.<p>

Plaintiffs filed this suit "on their own behalf and on behalf of the entire
class consisting of facilities and Missouri licensed physicians or other health
care professionals offering abortion services or pregnancy counseling and on
behalf of the entire class of pregnant females seeking abortion
services or pregnancy counseling within the State of Missouri." <i>Id.,</i> at
A13. The two nonprofit corporations are Reproductive Health Services, which
offers family planning and gynecological services to the public, including
abortion services up to 22 weeks "gestational
age,"<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> and
Planned Parenthood of Kansas City,
which provides abortion services up to 14 weeks gestational age. <i>Id.,</i> at
A9-A10.
The individual plaintiffs are three physicians, one nurse, and a social worker.
All are "public employees" at "public facilities" in Missouri, and they are
paid for their services with "public funds," as those terms are defined by
&#167;188.200.
The individual plaintiffs, within the scope of their public employment,
encourage and counsel pregnant women to have nontherapeutic abortions. Two of
the physicians perform abortions. App. A54-A55.<p>

Several weeks after the complaint was filed, the District Court temporarily
restrained enforcement of several provisions of the Act. Following a 3-day
trial in December 1986, the District Court declared seven provisions of the Act
unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement. 662 F. Supp. 407 (WD Mo.
1987).
These provisions included the preamble, &#167;1.205; the "informed consent"
provision, which required [*503] physicians to inform the pregnant woman of
certain facts before performing an abortion, &#167;188.039; the requirement
that post-16-week abortions be performed  only in hospitals, &#167;188.025;
the mandated
tests to determine viability, &#167;188.029; and the prohibition on the use of
public funds, employees, and facilities to perform or assist nontherapeutic
abortions, and the restrictions on the use of public funds, employees, and
facilities to encourage or counsel women to have such abortions, &#167;&#167;
188.205, 188.210, 188.215. <i>Id.,</i> at 430.<p>

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, with one exception not
relevant to this appeal. 851 F. 2d 1071 (1988). The Court of Appeals determined
that Missouri's declaration that life begins at conception was "simply
an impermissible state adoption of a theory of when life begins to justify its
abortion regulations." <i>Id.,</i> at 1076. Relying on <i>Colautti v.
Franklin,</i>
439 U.S. 379, 388-389 (1979), it further held that the requirement that
physicians
perform viability tests was an unconstitutional legislative intrusion on a
matter of medical skill and judgment. 851 F. 2d, at 1074-1075. The Court of
Appeals invalidated Missouri's prohibition on the use of public facilities and
employees to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's
life. <i>Id.,</i> at 1081-1083. It distinguished our decisions in <i>Harris v.
McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297 (1980), and <i>Maher v. Roe,</i>
432 U.S. 464 (1977), on the ground that
"'[t]here is a fundamental difference between providing direct funding to
effect the abortion decision and allowing staff physicians to perform abortions
at an
existing publicly owned hospital.'" 851 F. 2d, at 1081, quoting
<i>Nyberg v. City of Virginia,</i>
667 F. 2d 754, 758 (CA8 1982), appeal dism'd, 462
U.S. 1125 (1983). The Court of Appeals struck down the provision
prohibiting the use of public funds for "encouraging or counseling" women to
have nontherapeutic abortions, for the reason that this provision was both
overly vague and inconsistent with the right to an abortion enunciated in
<i>Roe v. Wade.</i> 851 F. 2d, at 1077-1080. The court also invalidated the
hospitalization
[*504] requirement for 16-week abortions, <i>id.,</i> at 1073-1074, and the
prohibition on the use of public employees and facilities for abortion
counseling, <i>id.,</i> at 1077-1080, but the State has not appealed those
parts of the judgment below. See Juris. Statement
I-II.<a href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a><p>

<h2 align=center>II</h2>

Decision of this case requires us to address four sections of the Missouri
Act: (a) the preamble; (b) the prohibition on the use of public facilities or
employees to perform abortions; (c) the prohibition on public funding of
abortion counseling; and (d) the requirement that physicians conduct viability
tests prior to performing abortions. We address these <i>seriatim.</i><p>

<h2 align=center>A</h2>

The Act's preamble, as noted, sets forth "findings" by the Missouri
Legislature that "[t]he life of each human being begins at conception," and
that "[u]nborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and
well-being."
Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167;1.205.1(1), (2) (1986). The Act then  mandates that
state laws
be interpreted to provide unborn children with "all the rights, privileges, and
immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state,"
subject to the Constitution and this Court's precedents.
&#167;1.205.2.<a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In
invalidating [*505] the preamble, the Court of Appeals relied on this
Court's dictum that "'a State may not adopt one theory of when life begins to
justify its regulation of abortions.'" 851 F. 2d, at 1075-1076, quoting
<i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416, 444
(1983),
in turn citing <i>Roe
v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S., at 159-162. It rejected Missouri's claim
that the preamble was "abortion-neutral," and "merely determine[d] when life
begins in a nonabortion context, a traditional state prerogative." 851 F. 2d,
at 1076. The court thought that "[t]he only plausible inference" from the fact
that "every remaining section of the bill save one regulates the performance of
abortions" was that "the state intended its abortion regulations to be
understood against the backdrop of its theory of life."
<i>Ibid.</i><a href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a><p>

The State contends that the preamble itself is precatory and
imposes no substantive restrictions on abortions, and that appellees therefore
do not have standing to challenge it. Brief for Appellants 21-24. Appellees, on
the other hand, insist that the preamble is an operative part of the Act
intended to guide the interpretation of other provisions of the Act. Brief for
Appellees 19-23. They maintain, for example, that the preamble's definition of
life may prevent physicians [*506] in public hospitals from dispensing
certain forms of contraceptives, such as the intrauterine device. <i>Id.,</i>
at 22.<p>

In our view, the Court of Appeals misconceived the meaning of the
<i>Akron</i> dictum, which was only that a State could not "justify" an
abortion regulation otherwise invalid under <i>Roe v. Wade</i>
on the ground that it embodied
the State's view about when life begins. Certainly the preamble does not by its
terms regulate abortion or any other aspect of appellees' medical practice. The
Court has emphasized that <i>Roe
v. Wade</i> "implies no limitation on the authority of
a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion." <i>Maher
v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S., at 474. The preamble can be read simply to express that
sort of value judgment.<p>

We think the extent to which the preamble's language might be used to
interpret other state statutes or regulations is something that only the courts
of Missouri can definitively decide. State law has offered protections to
unborn children in tort and probate law, see <i>Roe v. Wade, supra,</i>
at 161-162, and &#167;1.205.2 can be interpreted to do no more than that. What
we have, then, is much the same situation that the Court confronted in
<i>Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory,</i>
325 U.S. 450 (1945). As in that case:<p>

"We are thus invited to pass upon the constitutional validity of a state
statute which has not yet been applied or threatened to be applied by the state
courts to petitioners or others in the manner anticipated. Lacking any
authoritative construction of the statute by the state courts, without which no
constitutional question arises, and lacking the authority to give such a
controlling
construction ourselves, and with a record which presents no concrete set of
facts to which the statute is to be applied, the case is plainly not one to be
disposed of by the declaratory judgment procedure." <i>Id.,</i> at 460.<p>

It will be time enough for federal courts to address the meaning of the
preamble should it be applied to restrict the activities of appellees in some
concrete way. Until then, this [*507] Court "is not empowered to decide ...
abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases,
principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in
issue in the case before it." <i>Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration,</i>
179 U.S. 405, 409 (1900). See also <i>Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc.,</i>
454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982).<a href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> We
therefore need not pass on the constitutionality of the Act's preamble.<p>

<h2 align=center>B</h2>

Section 188.210 provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any public employee
within the scope of his employment to perform or assist an abortion, not
necessary to save the life of the mother," while &#167;188.215 makes it
"unlawful for any public facility to be used for the purpose of performing or
assisting an abortion not necessary to save the life of the
mother."<a href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> The
Court of Appeals held that these provisions contravened this Court's abortion
decisions. 851 F. 2d, at 1082-1083. We take the contrary view.<p>

As we said earlier this Term in <i>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social
Services,</i> 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989): "[O]ur cases have recognized that the
Due
Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even
where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property
interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual." In
<i>Maher v. Roe,</i>
supra, the Court upheld a Connecticut welfare regulation under which Medicaid
recipients received payments for medical services related [*508] to
childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions. The Court rejected the claim
that this unequal subsidization of childbirth and abortion was impermissible
under <i>Roe v. Wade.</i> As the Court put it:<p>

"The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws
invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation
places no obstacles -- absolute or otherwise -- in the pregnant woman's path to
an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage
as a consequence of Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues
as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she
desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative,
thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on
access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it
difficult -- and in some cases, perhaps, impossible -- for some women to have
abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut
regulation." 432 U.S., at 474.<p>

Relying on <i>Maher,</i>
the Court in <i>Poelker v. Doe,</i> 432 U.S. 519, 521 (1977), held
that the city of St. Louis committed "no constitutional violation ... in
electing, as a policy choice, to provide publicly financed hospital services
for childbirth without providing corresponding services for nontherapeutic
abortions."<p>

More recently, in <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297 (1980), the Court upheld
"the most restrictive version of the Hyde Amendment," <i>id.,</i> at 325, n.
27, which
withheld from States federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse the
costs of abortions, "'except where the life of the mother would be
endangered if the fetus were carried to term.'" Ibid. (quoting Pub. L. 94-439,
&#167;209, 90 Stat. 1434). As in <i>Maher</i>
and <i>Poelker,</i> the Court required only a showing
that Congress' authorization of "reimbursement for medically necessary services
generally, but not for certain medically necessary [*509] abortions" was
rationally related to the legitimate governmental goal of encouraging
childbirth. 448 U.S., at 325.<p>

The Court of Appeals distinguished these cases on the ground that "[t]o
prevent access to a public facility does more than demonstrate a political
choice in favor of childbirth;  it clearly narrows and in some cases forecloses
the availability of abortion to women." 851 F. 2d, at 1081. The court reasoned
that the ban on the use of public facilities "could prevent a woman's chosen
doctor from performing an abortion because of his unprivileged status at other
hospitals or because a private hospital adopted a similar anti-abortion
stance."
<i>Ibid.</i> It also thought that "[s]uch a rule could increase the cost of
obtaining an abortion and delay the timing of it as well." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

We think that this analysis is much like that which we rejected in
<i>Maher,</i> <i>Poelker,</i> and <i>McRae.</i> As in those cases, the State's
decision here to use public
facilities and staff to encourage childbirth over abortion "places no
governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her
pregnancy." <i>McRae,</i> 448 U.S., at 315. Just as Congress' refusal to fund
abortions in <i>McRae</i> left "an indigent woman with at least the same range
of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as
she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at
all," <i>id.,</i> at 317, Missouri's refusal to allow public employees to
perform abortions
in public hospitals leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the
State had chosen not to operate any public hospitals at all. The challenged
provisions only restrict a woman's ability to obtain an abortion to the extent
that she chooses to use a physician affiliated with a public hospital. This
circumstance is more easily remedied, and thus considerably less burdensome,
than indigency, which "may make it difficult -- and in some cases,
perhaps, impossible -- for some women to have abortions" without public
funding.
<i>Maher,</i> 432 U.S., at 474. Having held that the State's refusal to fund
abortions does not violate <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, it strains logic to reach a
contrary
result for the use [*510] of public facilities and employees. If the State
may "make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and ...
implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds," <i>Maher</i>,
<i>supra</i>, at 474, surely
it may do so through the allocation of other public resources, such as
hospitals and medical staff.<p>

The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish our cases on the additional ground
that "[t]he evidence here showed that all of the public facility's costs in
providing abortion services are recouped when the patient pays." 851 F. 2d, at
1083. Absent any expenditure of public funds, the court thought that Missouri
was "expressing" more than "its preference for childbirth over abortions," but
rather was creating an "obstacle to exercise of the right to choose an
abortion [that could not] stand absent a compelling state interest."
Ibid. We disagree.<p>

"Constitutional concerns are greatest," we said in <i>Maher</i>, <i>supra</i>,
at 476,
"when the State attempts to impose its will by the force of law; the State's
power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily
far broader." Nothing in the Constitution requires States to enter or remain in
the business of performing abortions. Nor, as appellees suggest, do private
physicians and their patients have some kind of constitutional right of access
to public facilities for the performance of abortions. Brief for Appellees
46-47. Indeed, if the State does recoup all of its costs in performing
abortions, and no state subsidy, direct or indirect, is available, it is
difficult to see how any procreational choice is burdened by the State's ban on
the use of its facilities or employees for performing
abortions.<a href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a><p>

[*511]<i>Maher</i>, <i>Poelker</i>, and <i>McRae</i> all support the view that
the State need not commit any resources to facilitating abortions, even if it
can turn a profit by doing so. In <i>Poelker</i>, the suit was filed by an
indigent who could not afford
to pay for an abortion, but the ban on the performance of nontherapeutic
abortions in city-owned hospitals applied whether or not the
pregnant woman could pay. 432 U.S., at 520; <i>id.,</i> at 524 (Brennan, J.,
dissenting).<a href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Court emphasized that
the mayor's decision to prohibit
abortions in city hospitals was "subject to public debate and approval or
disapproval at the polls," and that "the Constitution does not forbid a State
or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for
normal childbirth as St. Louis has done." <i>Id.,</i> at 521. Thus we uphold
the Act's
restrictions on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance
or assistance of nontherapeutic abortions.<p>

<h2 align=center>C</h2>

The Missouri Act contains three provisions relating to "encouraging or
counseling a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life." Section
188.205 states that no public funds can be used for this purpose; &#167;
188.210
states that public employees cannot, within the scope of their employment,
engage in such speech; and &#167;188.215 forbids such speech in public
facilities.
The Court of Appeals did not consider &#167;188.205 separately from
&#167;&#167;188.210 and
188.215. It held that all three of these provisions were unconstitutionally
vague, and that "the ban on using public funds, employees, and facilities to
encourage or counsel a woman to have an abortion is an unacceptable
infringement of the woman's fourteenth amendment right to choose an abortion
after receiving [*512] the medical information necessary to exercise the
right knowingly and intelligently." 851 F. 2d, at
1079.<a href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a><p>

Missouri has chosen only to appeal the Court of Appeals' invalidation of the
public funding provision,  &#167;188.205. See Juris. Statement I-II. A
threshold
question is whether this provision reaches primary conduct, or whether it is
simply an instruction to the State's fiscal officers not to allocate funds for
abortion counseling. We accept, for purposes of decision, the State's claim
that &#167;188.205 "is not directed at the conduct of any physician or health
care provider, private or public," but "is directed solely at those persons
responsible for expending public funds." Brief for Appellants
43.<a href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a><p>

Appellees contend that they are not "adversely" affected under the
State's interpretation of &#167;188.205, and therefore that there is no longer
a case or controversy before us on this question. Brief for Appellees 31-32.
Plaintiffs are masters of their complaints and remain so at the appellate stage
of a litigation. See <i>Caterpillar
Inc. v. Williams,</i> 482 U.S. 386, 398-399 (1987).
A majority of the Court agrees with appellees that the controversy over &#167;
188.205 is now moot, because appellees' argument amounts to a decision to no
longer seek a declaratory judgment that &#167;188.205 is unconstitutional and
accompanying declarative relief. See <i>Deakins
v. Monaghan,</i> 484 U.S. 193, 199-201
(1988); <i>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,</i> 340 U.S. 36, 39-40
(1950). We accordingly direct the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment of
the District Court [*513] with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of the
complaint. <i>Deakins,</i> 484 U.S., at 200. "Because this [dispute] was
rendered moot
in part by [appellees'] willingness permanently to withdraw their equitable
claims from their federal action, a dismissal with prejudice is
indicated." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

Section 188.029 of the Missouri Act provides:<p>

"Before a physician performs an abortion on a woman he has reason to believe is
carrying an unborn child of twenty or more weeks gestational age, the physician
shall first determine if the unborn child is viable by using and exercising
that degree of care, skill, and proficiency commonly exercised by the
ordinarily
skillful, careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under the
same or similar conditions. In making this determination of viability, the
physician shall perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and
tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and
lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings and
determination of viability in the medical record of the
mother."<a href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a><p>

As with the preamble, the parties disagree over the meaning of this statutory
provision. The State emphasizes the language of the first sentence, which
speaks in terms of the physician's determination of viability being made by the
standards of ordinary skill in the medical profession. Brief for Appellants
32-35. Appellees stress the language of the second sentence, which
prescribes such "tests as are necessary" to make a finding of gestational age,
fetal weight, and lung maturity. Brief for Appellees 26-30.<p>

[*514] The Court of Appeals read &#167;188.029 as requiring that after 20
weeks "doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight and
lung maturity." 851 F. 2d, at 1075, n. 5. The court indicated that the tests
needed
to determine fetal weight at 20 weeks are "unreliable and inaccurate" and would
add $ 125 to $ 250 to the cost of an abortion. <i>Ibid.</i> It also stated that
"amniocentesis, the only method available to determine lung maturity, is
contrary to accepted medical practice until 28-30 weeks of gestation,
expensive, and imposes significant health risks for both the pregnant woman and
the fetus." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

We must first determine the meaning of &#167;188.029 under Missouri law. Our
usual practice is to defer to the lower court's construction of a state
statute, but we believe the Court of Appeals has "fallen into plain error" in
this case.
<i>Frisby v. Schultz,</i> 487 U.S. 474, 483 (1988); see <i>Brockett v. Spokane
Arcades, Inc.,</i>
472 U.S. 491, 500, n. 9 (1985). "'In expounding a statute, we must not be
guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions
of the whole law, and to its object and policy.'" <i>Philbrook v. Glodgett,</i>
421 U.S. 707, 713 (1975), quoting <i>United States v. Heirs of Boisdore,</i>
8 How. 113, 122 (1849). See <i>Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. FPC,</i>
420 U.S. 395, 402-403 (1975); <i>Kokoszka v. Belford,</i>
417 U.S. 642, 650 (1974). The Court of Appeals'
interpretation also runs "afoul of the well established principle that statutes
will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties." <i>Frisby,</i>
<i>supra</i>, at 483.<p>

We think the viability-testing provision makes sense only if the
second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful to making
subsidiary findings as to viability. If we construe this provision to require a
physician to perform those tests needed to make the three specified findings in
all circumstances, including when the physician's reasonable professional
judgment indicates that the tests would be irrelevant to determining viability
or even dangerous to the mother and the fetus, the second sentence of &#167;
188.029
would [*515] conflict with the first sentence's requirement that a physician
apply his reasonable professional skill and judgment. It would also be
incongruous to read this provision, especially the word
"necessary,"<a href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> to
require the performance of tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose
of determining viability. It thus seems clear to us that the Court of Appeals'
construction of &#167;188.029 violates well-accepted canons of statutory
interpretation used in the Missouri courts, see <i>State ex rel. Stern Brothers
&amp; Co. v. Stilley,</i> 337 S. W. 2d 934, 939 (Mo. 1960) ("The basic rule of
statutory construction is to first seek the legislative intention, and to
effectuate it if possible, and the law favors constructions which harmonize
with reason, and which tend to avoid unjust, absurd, unreasonable or
confiscatory results, or oppression"); <i>Bell v. MidCentury Ins. Co.,</i>
750 S. W. 2d 708, 710
(Mo. App. 1988) ("Interpreting the phrase literally would produce an absurd
result, which the Legislature is strongly presumed not to have intended"),
which Justice Blackmun ignores. Post, at 545-546.<p>

The viability-testing provision of the Missouri Act is concerned with
promoting the State's interest in potential human life rather than
in maternal health. Section 188.029 creates what is essentially a presumption
of viability at 20 weeks, which the physician must rebut with tests indicating
that the fetus is not viable prior to performing an abortion. It also directs
the physician's determination as to viability by specifying consideration, if
feasible, of gestational age, fetal weight, and lung capacity. The District
Court found that "the medical evidence is uncontradicted that a 20-week fetus
is not viable," and that "23 1/2 to 24 weeks gestation is the earliest point in
pregnancy where a reasonable possibility of viability [*516] exists." 662 F.
Supp., at 420. But it also found that there may be a 4-week error in estimating
gestational age, <i>id.,</i> at 421, which supports testing at 20 weeks.<p>

In <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the Court recognized that the State has "important and
legitimate" interests in protecting maternal health and in the potentiality of
human life. 410 U.S., at 162. During the second trimester, the State "may, if
it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably 
related to maternal health." <i>Id.,</i> at 164. After viability, when the
State's interest in potential human life was held to become compelling, the
State "may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where
it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the
life or health of the mother." <i>Id.,</i> at
165.<a href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a><p>

In <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379 (1979), upon which
appellees rely, the Court held that a Pennsylvania statute regulating the
standard of care to be used by a physician performing an abortion of a possibly
viable fetus was void for vagueness. <i>Id.,</i> at 390-401. But in the course
of reaching that conclusion, the Court reaffirmed its earlier statement in
<i>Planned
Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 64 (1976), that "'the
determination of whether a particular [*517] fetus is viable is, and must
be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.'" 439
U.S., at 396. Justice Blackmun, post, at 545, n. 6, ignores the statement in
<i>Colautti</i> that "neither the legislature nor the courts may proclaim one
of the elements entering into the ascertainment of viability -- be it weeks of
gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor -- as the determinant of
when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus."
439 U.S., at 388-389. To the extent that &#167;188.029 regulates
the method for determining viability, it undoubtedly does superimpose state
regulation on the medical determination whether a particular fetus is viable.
The Court of Appeals and the District Court thought it unconstitutional for
this reason. 851 F. 2d, at 1074-1075; 662 F. Supp., at 423. To the extent that
the viability tests increase the cost of what are in fact second-trimester
abortions, their validity may also be questioned under <i>Akron,</i>
462 U.S., at 434-435, where the Court held that a requirement that
second-trimester
abortions must be performed in hospitals was invalid because it substantially
increased the expense of those procedures.<p>

We think that the doubt cast upon the Missouri statute by these cases is not
so much a flaw in the statute as it is a reflection of the fact that the rigid
trimester analysis of the course of a pregnancy enunciated in <i>Roe</i> has
resulted in subsequent cases like <i>Colautti</i> and <i>Akron</i> making
constitutional law in this
area a virtual Procrustean bed. Statutes specifying elements of informed
consent to be provided abortion patients, for example, were invalidated if
they were thought to "structur[e] ... the dialogue between the woman and her
physician." <i>Thornburgh
v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i>
476 U.S. 747, 763 (1986). As the dissenters in Thornburgh pointed out, such a
statute would have been sustained under any traditional standard of judicial
review, <i>id.,</i> at 802 (White, J., dissenting), or for any other surgical
procedure except abortion. <i>Id.,</i> at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).<p>

[*518] <i>Stare decisis</i> is a cornerstone of our legal system, but it has
less power in constitutional cases, where, save for constitutional amendments,
this Court is the only body able to make needed changes. See <i>United
States v. Scott,</i> 437 U.S. 82, 101 (1978). We have not refrained from
reconsideration of a prior
construction of the Constitution that has proved "unsound in principle and
unworkable in practice." <i>Garcia
v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i>
469 U.S. 528, 546 (1985); see <i>Solorio v. United States,</i>
483 U.S. 435, 448-450 (1987); <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i>
304 U.S. 64, 74-78 (1938). We think
the <i>Roe</i> trimester framework falls into that category.<p>

In the first place, the rigid <i>Roe</i> framework is hardly consistent with
the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms, as ours is, and
usually speaking in general principles, as ours does. The key elements of the
<i>Roe</i> framework -- trimesters and viability -- are not found in the text
of the Constitution or in any place else one would expect to find a
constitutional principle. Since the bounds of the inquiry are essentially
indeterminate, the result has been a web of legal rules that have become
increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations rather than a body of
constitutional doctrine.<a href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> As JUSTICE
WHITE has put it, the trimester framework has left this Court to serve as the
country's "<i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove
medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States."
<i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S., at 99
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Cf. <i>Garcia, supra,</i>
at 547.<p>

In the second place, we do not see why the State's interest in protecting
potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability,
and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowing state regulation after
viability but prohibiting it before viability. The dissenters in Thornburgh,
writing in the context of the <i>Roe</i> trimester analysis, would have
recognized this fact by positing against the "fundamental right" recognized in
<i>Roe</i> the State's
"compelling interest" in protecting potential human life throughout pregnancy.
"[T]he State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling
before viability." <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S., at 795 (White, J., dissenting);
see <i>id.,</i> at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("State has compelling
interests in ensuring maternal health and in protecting potential human life,
and these interests exist 'throughout pregnancy'") (citation omitted).<p>

The tests that &#167;188.029 requires the physician to perform are designed to
determine viability. The State here has chosen viability as the point at which
its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded. See Mo.
Rev. Stat. &#167;188.030  (1986) ("No abortion of a viable unborn child shall
be performed unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman"). It
is true that the tests in question increase the expense of abortion, and
regulate the discretion of the physician in determining the viability of the
fetus. Since the tests will undoubtedly show in many cases that the fetus is
not viable, the tests will have been performed for what were in fact
second-trimester
abortions. But we are satisfied that the requirement of these tests permissibly
furthers [*520] the State's interest in protecting potential human life, and
we therefore believe &#167;188.029 to be constitutional.<p>

The dissent takes us to task for our failure to join in a "great issues"
debate as to whether the Constitution includes an "unenumerated" general right
to privacy as recognized in cases such as <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381
U.S. 479 (1965), and <i>Roe</i>. But <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> unlike
<i>Roe</i>, did not purport to adopt a whole framework, complete with detailed
rules and
distinctions, to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest
would apply. As such, it was far different from the opinion, if not
the holding, of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, which sought to establish a constitutional
framework for judging state regulation of abortion during the entire term of
pregnancy. That framework sought to deal with areas of medical practice
traditionally subject to state regulation, and it sought to balance once and
for all by reference only to the calendar the claims of the State to protect
the fetus as a form of human life against the claims of a woman to decide for
herself whether or not to abort a fetus she was carrying. The experience of the
Court in applying <i>Roe v. Wade</i> in later cases, see <i>supra</i>, at 518,
n. 15, suggests
to us that there is wisdom in not unnecessarily attempting to elaborate the
abstract differences between a "fundamental right" to abortion, as the Court
described it in <i>Akron</i>, 462 U.S. at 420, n. 1, a "limited fundamental
constitutional right," which Justice Blackmun's dissent today treats <i>Roe</i>
as having established, <i>post,</i> at 555, or a liberty interest protected by
the Due Process Clause, which we believe it to be. The Missouri testing
requirement here is
reasonably designed to ensure that abortions are not performed where
the fetus is viable -- an end which all concede is legitimate -- and that is
sufficient to sustain its constitutionality.<p>

The dissent also accuses us, <i>inter alia,</i> of cowardice and illegitimacy
in dealing with "the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our
time." Post, at 559. There is [*521] no doubt that our holding today will
allow some governmental regulation of abortion that would have been prohibited
under the language of cases such as <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379
(1979), and <i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i>
<i>supra</i>. But the goal of
constitutional adjudication is surely not to remove inexorably "politically
divisive" issues from the ambit of the legislative process, whereby the people
through their elected representatives deal with matters of concern to them. The
goal of constitutional adjudication is to hold true the balance between that
which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that
which it does not. We think we have done that today. The dissent's
suggestion, post, at 538, 557-558, that legislative bodies, in a Nation where
more than half of our population is women, will treat our decision today as an
invitation to enact abortion regulation reminiscent of the Dark Ages not only
misreads our views but does scant justice to those who serve in such
bodies and the people who elect them.<p>

<h2 align=center>III</h2>

Both appellants and the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> have urged that
we overrule our decision in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. Brief for Appellants 12-18;
Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8-24. The facts of the present
case, however, differ from those at issue in <i>Roe</i>. Here, Missouri has
determined that viability
is the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded.
In <i>Roe</i>, on the other hand, the Texas statute criminalized the
performance of all
abortions, except when the mother's life was at stake. 410 U.S., at 117-118.
This case therefore affords us no occasion to revisit the holding of
<i>Roe</i>, which was that the Texas statute unconstitutionally infringed the
right to an abortion derived from the Due Process Clause, <i>id.,</i> at 164,
and we leave it undisturbed. To the extent indicated in our opinion, we would
modify and narrow <i>Roe</i> and succeeding cases.<p>

[*522] Because none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act
properly before us conflict with the Constitution, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is<p>

<i>Reversed.</i>
<hr>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<a name="f1"></a>1. After <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> the State of Missouri's
then-existing abortion regulations, see Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167;559.100,
542.380, and 563.300 (1969), were
declared unconstitutional by a three-judge federal court. This Court summarily
affirmed that judgment. <i>Danforth v. Rodgers,</i> 414 U.S. 1035 (1973). Those
statutes, like the Texas statute at issue in <i>Roe,</i> made it a crime to
perform an abortion except when the mother's life was at stake. 410 U.S., at
117-118, and n. 2.<p>

In June 1974, the State enacted House Committee Substitute for House Bill No.
1211, which imposed new regulations on abortions during all stages of pregnancy.
Among other things, the 1974 Act defined "viability," &#167;2(2); required the
written consent of the woman prior to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy, &#167;3(2); required the written consent of the woman's spouse
prior to an elective abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, &#167;
3(3); required the written consent of one parent if the woman was under 18 and
unmarried prior to an elective abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy,
&#167;3(4); required
a physician performing an abortion to exercise professional care to "preserve
the life and health of the fetus" regardless of the stage of pregnancy and, if
he should fail that duty, deemed him guilty of manslaughter and made him liable
for damages, &#167;6(1); prohibited the use of saline amniocentesis, as a
method of abortion, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, &#167;9; and
required certain
recordkeeping for health facilities and physicians performing abortions,
&#167;&#167;10, 11. In <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i>
428 U.S. 52 (1976), the Court upheld the definition of viability, <i>id.,</i>
at 63-65, the consent provision
in &#167;3(2), <i>id.,</i> at 65-67, and the recordkeeping requirements.
<i>Id.,</i> at 79-81. It struck down the spousal consent provision, <i>id.,</i>
at 67-72, the parental consent
provision, <i>id.,</i> at 72-75, the prohibition on abortions by amniocentesis,
<i>id.,</i> at 75-79, and the requirement that physicians exercise professional
care to preserve the life of the fetus regardless of the stage of pregnancy.
<i>Id.,</i> at 81-84.<p>

In 1979, Missouri passed legislation that, inter alia, required abortions
after 12 weeks to be performed in a hospital, Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;188.025
(Supp. 1979); required a pathology report for each abortion performed, &#167;
188.047; required the presence of a second physician during abortions performed
after viability, &#167;188.030.3; and required minors to secure parental
consent or consent from the juvenile court for an abortion, &#167;188.028. In
Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476
(1983), the Court struck down the second-trimester hospitalization requirement,
<i>id.,</i> at 481-482, but upheld the other provisions described above.
<i>Id.,</i> at 494.<p>

<a name="f2"></a>2. The Act defines "gestational age" as the "length of
pregnancy as measured from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period."
Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;188.015(4) (1986).<p>

<a name="f3"></a>3. The State did not appeal the District Court's invalidation
of the Act's "informed consent" provision to the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d,
at 1073, n. 2, and it is not before us.<p>

<a name="f4"></a>4. Section 1.205 provides in full:<p>

"1. The general assembly of this state finds that:<p>

"(1) The life of each human being begins at conception;<p>

"(2) Unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and
well-being;<p>

"(3) The natural parents of unborn children have protectable interests in the
life, health, and well-being of their unborn child.<p>

"2. Effective January 1, 1988, the laws of this state shall be interpreted
and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of
development, all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other
persons, citizens, and residents of this state, subject only to the
Constitution of the United States, and decisional interpretations thereof by
the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the
statutes and constitution of this state.<p>

"3. As used in this section, the term 'unborn children' or 'unborn child'
shall include all unborn child [sic] or children or the offspring of human
beings from the moment of conception until birth at every stage of biological
development.<p>

"4. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as creating a cause of
action against a woman for indirectly harming her unborn child by failing to
properly care for herself or by failing to follow any particular program of
prenatal care."<p>

<a name="f5"></a>5. Judge Arnold dissented from this part of the Court of
Appeals' decision, arguing that Missouri's declaration of when life begins
should be upheld "insofar as it relates to subjects other than abortion," such
as "creating causes of action against persons other than the mother" for
wrongful death or extending the protection of the criminal law to fetuses. 851
F. 2d, at 1085 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).<p>

<a name="f6"></a>6. Appellees also claim that the legislature's preamble
violates the Missouri Constitution. Brief for Appellees 23-26. But the
considerations discussed in the text make it equally inappropriate for a
federal court to pass upon this claim before the state courts have interpreted
the statute.<p>

<a name="f7"></a>7. The statute defines "public employee" to mean "any person
employed by this
state or any agency or political subdivision thereof." Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;
188.200(1) (1986). "Public facility" is defined as "any public institution,
public facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or
controlled by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof."
&#167;188.200(2).<p>

<a name="f8"></a>8. A different analysis might apply if a particular State had
socialized medicine and all of its hospitals and physicians were publicly
funded. This case might also be different if the State barred doctors who
performed abortions in private facilities from the use of public facilities for
any purpose. See <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297, 317, n. 19 (1980).<p>

<a name="f9"></a>9. The suit in <i>Poelker</i> was brought by the plaintiff "on
her own behalf and on
behalf of the entire class of pregnant women residents of the City of St. Louis,
Missouri, desiring to utilize the personnel, facilities and services of the
general public hospitals within the City of St. Louis for the termination of
pregnancies." <i>Doe v. Poelker,</i> 497 F. 2d 1063, 1065 (CA8 1974).<p>

<a name="f10"></a>10. In a separate opinion, Judge Arnold argued that
Missouri's prohibition violated the First Amendment because it "sharply
discriminate[s] between kinds
of speech on the basis of their viewpoint: a physician, for example, could
discourage an abortion, or counsel against it, while in a public facility, but
he or she could not encourage or counsel in favor of it." 851 F. 2d, at 1085.<p>

<a name="f11"></a>11. While the Court of Appeals did not address this issue,
the District Court thought that the definition of "public funds" in Mo. Rev.
Stat. &#167;188.200 (1986) "certainly is broad enough to make 'encouraging or
counseling' unlawful for anyone who is paid from" public funds as defined in
&#167;188.200. 662 F. Supp. 407, 426 (WD Mo. 1987).<p>

<a name="f12"></a>12. The Act's penalty provision provides that "[a]ny person
who contrary to the provisions of sections 188.010 to 188.085 knowingly
performs ... any abortion or knowingly fails to perform any action required by
[these] sections ... shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor." Mo. Rev. Stat.
&#167;188.075 (1986).<p>

<a name="f13"></a>13. See Black's Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979)
("Necessary. This word must be considered in the connection in which it is
used, as it is a word susceptible of various meanings. It may import absolute
physical necessity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only
convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or conducive to the end
sought").<p>

<a name="f14"></a>14. The Court's subsequent cases have reflected this
understanding. See <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i>
439 U.S. 379, 386 (1979) (emphasis added) ("For both logical and biological
reasons, we indicated in [<i>Roe</i>] that the State's interest
in the potential life of the fetus reaches the compelling point at the stage of
viability. Hence, prior to viability, the State may not seek to further this
interest by directly restricting a woman's decision whether or not to terminate
her pregnancy"); <i>id.,</i> at 389 ("Viability is the critical point. And we
have recognized no attempt to stretch the point of viability one way or the
other"); accord, <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i>
428 U.S., at 61 (State regulation designed to protect potential human life
limited to period "subsequent to viability"); <i>Akron v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416, 428 (1983), quoting <i>Roe
v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S., at 163 (emphasis added)
(State's interest in protecting potential human life "becomes compelling only at
viability, the point at which the fetus 'has the capability of meaningful life
outside the mother's womb'").<p>

<a name="f15"></a>15. For example, the Court has held that a State may require
that certain information be given to a woman by a physician or his assistant,
<i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S., at 448,
but that it may not require that such information be furnished to her only by
the physician himself. <i>Id.,</i> at 449. Likewise, a State may require that
abortions in the second trimester be performed in clinics, <i>Simopoulos
v. Virginia,</i> 462 U.S. 506 (1983),
but it may not require that such abortions be performed only in hospitals.
<i>Akron, supra,</i> at 437-439. We do not think these distinctions are of any
constitutional import in view of our abandonment of the trimester framework.
The dissent's claim, <i>post,</i> at 539-541, n. 1, that the State goes too
far, even under <i>Maher v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464 (1977); <i>Poelker v.
Doe,</i> 432 U.S. 519 (1977); and <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297 (1980),
by refusing to permit the use of public facilities, as defined in Mo. Rev.
Stat. &#167;188.200 (1986), for the
performance of abortions is another example of the fine distinctions endemic in
the Roe framework.<p>

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3>WEBSTER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, ET AL<br>
v<br>
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL</h3>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.<p>

No. 88-605. Argued April 26, 1989 -- Decided July 3, 1989<p>
</center>

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.<p>

I concur in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the Court's opinion.<p>

<h2 align=center>I</h2>

Nothing in the record before us or the opinions below indicates that
subsections 1(1) and 1(2) of the preamble to Missouri's abortion regulation
statute will affect a woman's decision to have an abortion. Justice Stevens,
following appellees, see Brief for Appellees 22, suggests that the preamble may
also "interfer[e] with contraceptive choices," <i>post</i>, at 564, because
certain contraceptive devices act on a female ovum after it has been fertilized
by a male sperm. The Missouri Act defines "conception" as "the fertilization of
the ovum of a female by a sperm of a male," Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;188.015(3)
(1986), and invests "unborn children" with "protectable interests in life,
health, and well-being," &#167;1.205.1(2), from "the moment of conception .
..."
&#167;1.205.3. Justice Stevens asserts that any possible interference with a
woman's right to use such postfertilization contraceptive devices would be
unconstitutional under <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and
our subsequent contraception cases. <i>Post,</i> at 564-566. Similarly, certain
<i>amici</i> suggest that the Missouri Act's preamble may prohibit the
developing technology of in vitro fertilization, a technique used to aid
couples otherwise unable to bear children in which a number of ova are removed
from the woman and fertilized by male sperm. This process often produces excess
fertilized ova ("unborn
children" under the Missouri Act's definition) that are discarded rather than
reinserted into the woman's uterus. Brief for Association of Reproductive Health
Professionals [*523] et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 38. It may be correct that
the use of postfertilization contraceptive devices is constitutionally
protected by <i>Griswold</i> and its progeny, but, as with a woman's abortion
decision, nothing in
the record or the opinions below indicates that the preamble will
affect a woman's decision to practice contraception. For that matter, nothing in
appellees' original complaint, App. 8-21, or their motion <i>in limine</i>
to limit testimony and evidence on their challenge to the preamble, <i>id.,</i>
at 57-59, indicates that appellees sought to enjoin potential violations of
Griswold. Neither is there any indication of the possibility that the preamble
might be applied to prohibit the performance of in vitro fertilization. I agree
with the Court, therefore, that all of these intimations of unconstitutionality
are simply too hypothetical to support the use of declaratory judgment
procedures and injunctive remedies in this case.<p>

Similarly, it seems to me to follow directly from our previous decisions
concerning state or federal funding of abortions, <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448
U.S. 297 (1980), <i>Maher v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464 (1977), and <i>Poelker v.
Doe,</i> 432 U.S. 519
(1977), that appellees' facial challenge to the constitutionality of Missouri's
ban on the utilization of public facilities and the participation of public
employees in the performance of abortions not necessary to save the
life of the mother, Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167;188.210, 188.215 (1986), cannot
succeed.
Given Missouri's definition of "public facility" as "any public institution,
public facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or
controlled by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof,"
&#167;188.200(2), there may be conceivable applications of the ban on the use
of public facilities that would be unconstitutional. Appellees and <i>amici</i>
suggest
that the State could try to enforce the ban against private hospitals using
public water and sewage lines, or against private hospitals leasing state-owned
equipment or state land. See Brief for Appellees 49-50; Brief for National
Association of Public Hospitals as Amicus Curiae [*524] 9-12. Whether some
or all of these or other applications of &#167;188.215 would be constitutional
need not be decided here. <i>Maher,</i>
<i>Poelker,</i> and <i>McRae</i> stand for the
proposition that some quite straightforward applications of the Missouri ban on
the use of public facilities for performing abortions would be constitutional
and that is enough to defeat appellees' assertion that the ban is
facially unconstitutional. "A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of
course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger
must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be
valid. The fact that the [relevant statute] might operate unconstitutionally
under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly
invalid, since we have not recognized an 'overbreadth' doctrine outside the
limited context of the First Amendment." <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481
U.S. 739, 745 (1987).<p>

I also agree with the Court that, under the interpretation of &#167;188.205
urged by the State and adopted by the Court, there is no longer a case or
controversy
before us over the constitutionality of that provision. I would note, however,
that this interpretation of &#167;188.205 is not binding on the Supreme Court
of Missouri which has the final word on the meaning of that State's statutes.
<i>Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 383, 395 (1988);
<i>O'Brien v. Skinner,</i> 414 U.S. 524, 531 (1974). Should it happen that
&#167;188.205, as ultimately interpreted by the Missouri Supreme Court, does
prohibit publicly employed health professionals from giving specific medical
advice to pregnant women, "the vacation and dismissal of the complaint that has
become
moot 'clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the
parties,' should subsequent events rekindle their controversy." <i>Deakins v.
Monaghan,</i> 484 U.S. 193, 201, n. 5 (1988), quoting <i>United States v.
Munsingwear, Inc.,</i>
340 U.S. 36, 40 (1950). Unless such events make their appearance and give
rise to relitigation, I agree that we and all federal courts are
without jurisdiction to hear the merits of this moot dispute.<p>

<h2 align=center>II</h2>

In its interpretation of Missouri's "determination of viability" provision,
Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;188.029 (1986), see <i>ante</i>, at 513-521, the
plurality has
proceeded in a manner unnecessary to deciding the question at hand. I agree with
the plurality that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals to interpret the
second sentence of &#167;188.029 as meaning that "doctors must perform tests
to find gestational age, fetal weight and lung maturity." 851 F. 2d
1071, 1075, n. 5 (CA8 1988) (emphasis in original). When read together with the
first sentence of &#167;188.029 -- which requires a physician to "determine if
the unborn child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill,
and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinary skillful, careful, and
prudent
physician engaged in similar practice under the same or similar conditions" --
it would be contradictory nonsense to read the second sentence as requiring a
physician to perform viability examinations and tests in situations where it
would be careless and imprudent to do so. The plurality is quite correct: "the
viability-testing provision makes sense only if the second sentence is read to
require only those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to
viability," <i>ante,</i> at 514, and, I would add, only those examinations and
tests that it would not be imprudent or careless to perform in the particular
medical situation before the physician.<p>

Unlike the plurality, I do not understand these viability testing
requirements to conflict with any of the Court's past decisions concerning state
regulation of abortion. Therefore, there is no necessity to accept the State's
invitation to reexamine the constitutional validity of <i>Roe v.  Wade,</i>
410 U.S. 113 (1973). Where there is no need to decide a constitutional question,
it is a venerable principle of this Court's adjudicatory processes not to
do so, for "[t]he Court will not 'anticipate a question of
constitutional law in advance of the [*526] necessity of deciding it.'"
<i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring),
quoting <i>Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of
Emigration,</i> 113
U.S. 33, 39 (1885). Neither will it generally "formulate a rule of
constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is
to be applied." 297 U.S., at 347. Quite simply, "[i]t is not the habit of the
court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary
to a decision of the case." <i>Burton
v. United States,</i> 196 U.S. 283, 295 (1905).
The Court today has accepted the State's every interpretation of its
abortion statute and has upheld, under our existing precedents, every provision
of that statute which is properly before us. Precisely for this reason
reconsideration of <i>Roe</i> falls not into any "good-cause exception" to this
"fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . ." <i>Three Affiliated Tribes of
Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C.,</i> 467 U.S. 138, 157
(1984). See <i>post</i>, at 532-533 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment).
When the constitutional invalidity of a State's abortion statute actually turns
on the constitutional validity of <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> there will be time enough
to reexamine <i>Roe.</i> And to do so carefully.<p>

In assessing &#167;188.029 it is especially important to recognize that
appellees did not appeal the District Court's ruling that the first sentence of
&#167;188.029
is constitutional. 662 F. Supp. 407, 420-422 (WD Mo. 1987). There is,
accordingly, no dispute between the parties before us over the
constitutionality of the "presumption of viability at 20 weeks," <i>ante</i>,
at 515,
created by the
first sentence of &#167;188.029. If anything might arguably conflict with
the Court's previous decisions concerning the determination of viability, I
would think it is the introduction of this presumption. The plurality, see
<i>ante,</i> at 515, refers to a passage from <i>Planned Parenthood of Central
Mo. v. Danforth,</i>
428 U.S. 52, 64 (1976): "The time when viability is achieved may vary with each
pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is,
and must [*527] be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending
physician." The 20-week presumption of viability in the first sentence of
&#167;188.029, it could be argued (though, I would think, unsuccessfully),
restricts
"the judgment of the responsible attending physician," by imposing on that
physician the burden of overcoming the presumption. This presumption may be a
"superimpos[ition] [of] state regulation on the medical determination whether a
particular fetus is viable," <i>ante,</i> at 517, but, if so, it is a
restriction on
the physician's judgment that is not before us. As the plurality properly
interprets the second sentence of &#167;188.029, it does nothing more than
delineate means by which the unchallenged 20-week presumption of viability may
be overcome if those means are useful in doing so and can be prudently
employed. Contrary to the plurality's suggestion, see <i>ante</i>, at 517, the
District Court did not think the second sentence of &#167;188.029
unconstitutional for this
reason. Rather, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals thought the
second sentence to be unconstitutional precisely because they interpreted that
sentence to impose state regulation on the determination of viability that it
does not impose.<p>

Appellees suggest that the interpretation of &#167;188.029 urged by the State
may "virtually eliminat[e] the constitutional issue in this case." Brief for
Appellees 30. Appellees therefore propose that we should abstain from deciding
that provision's constitutionality "in order to allow the state courts to
render the saving construction the State has proposed." <i>Ibid</i>. Where the
lower court has
so clearly fallen into error I do not think abstention is necessary or prudent.
Accordingly, I consider the constitutionality of the second
sentence of &#167;188.029, as interpreted by the State, to determine whether
the constitutional issue is actually eliminated.<p>

I do not think the second sentence of &#167;188.029, as interpreted by
the Court, imposes a degree of state regulation on the medical determination of
viability that in any way conflicts with prior decisions of this Court. As the
plurality [*528] recognizes, the requirement that, where not imprudent,
physicians perform examinations and tests useful to making subsidiary findings
to determine viability "promot[es] the State's interest in potential human life
rather than in maternal health." <i>Ante</i>, at 515. No decision of this Court
has held that the State may not directly promote its interest in potential life
when viability is possible. Quite the contrary. In <i>Thornburgh v. American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747 (1986), the Court
considered a
constitutional challenge to a Pennsylvania statute requiring that a second
physician be present during an abortion performed "when viability is possible."
<i>Id.</i>, at 769-770. For guidance, the Court looked to the earlier decision
in <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft,</i> 462
U.S. 476 (1983), upholding a Missouri statute requiring the presence of a
second physician during an abortion performed after viability. <i>Id.</i>, at
482-486 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>id.</i>, at 505 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment in
part and dissenting in part). The <i>Thornburgh</i> majority struck down the
Pennsylvania statute merely because the statute had no exception for emergency
situations and not because it found a constitutional difference between the
State's promotion of its interest in potential life when viability is possible
and when viability is certain. 476 U.S., at 770-771. Despite the clear
recognition by the <i>Thornburgh</i> majority that the Pennsylvania and
Missouri
statutes differed in this respect, there is no hint in the opinion of the
<i>Thornburgh</i> Court that the State's interest in potential life differs
depending
on whether it seeks to further that interest postviability or when viability is
possible. Thus, all nine Members of the <i>Thornburgh</i> Court appear to have
agreed that it is not constitutionally impermissible for the State to enact
regulations designed to protect the State's interest in potential life when
viability is possible. See <i>id.</i>, at 811 (White, J., dissenting);
<i>id.</i>, at 832 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). That is exactly what Missouri
has done in &#167;188.029.<p>

[*529] Similarly, the basis for reliance by the District Court and the
Court of Appeals below on <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379 (1979),
disappears when &#167;188.029 is properly interpreted. In <i>Colautti,</i> the
Court observed:<p>

"Because this point [of viability] may differ with each pregnancy, neither the
legislature nor the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering into the
ascertainment of viability -- be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any
other single factor -- as the determinant of when the State has a compelling
interest in the life or health of the fetus. Viability is the critical point."
<i>Id.</i>, at 388-389.<p>

The courts below, on the interpretation of &#167;188.029 rejected here, found
the second sentence of that provision at odds with this passage from
<i>Colautti.</i> See
851 F. 2d, at 1074; 662 F. Supp., at 423. On this Court's interpretation
of &#167;188.029 it is clear that Missouri has not substituted any of the
"elements entering into the ascertainment of viability" as "the determinant of
when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus."
All the second sentence of &#167;188.029 does is to require, when not
imprudent, the
performance of "those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to
viability." <i>Ante</i>, at 514 (emphasis added). Thus, consistent with
<i>Colautti,</i> viability remains the "critical point" under
&#167;188.029.<p>

Finally, and rather halfheartedly, the plurality suggests that the marginal
increase in the cost of an abortion created by Missouri's viability testing
provision may make &#167;188.029, even as interpreted, suspect under this
Court's decision in <i>Akron
v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416,
434-439 (1983), striking down a second-trimester hospitalization requirement.
See <i>ante</i>, at 517. I dissented from the Court's opinion in <i>Akron</i>
because it was
my view that, even apart from <i>Roe's</i> trimester framework which I continue
to consider problematic, see <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at [*530] 828
(dissenting opinion), the <i>Akron</i> majority had distorted and misapplied
its own standard for evaluating state regulation of abortion which the Court
had applied
with fair consistency in the past: that, previability, "a regulation imposed on
a lawful abortion is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to
seek an abortion." <i>Akron, supra,</i> at 453 (dissenting opinion) (internal
quotations omitted).<p>

It is clear to me that requiring the performance of examinations and tests
useful to determining whether a fetus is viable, when viability is possible,
and when it would not be medically imprudent to do so, does not impose an undue
burden on a woman's abortion decision. On this ground alone I would reject the
suggestion that &#167;188.029 as interpreted is unconstitutional. More to the
point,
however, just as I see no conflict between &#167;188.029 and <i>Colautti</i>
or any
decision of this Court concerning a State's ability to give effect to its
interest in potential life, I see no conflict between &#167;188.029 and the
Court's opinion in <i>Akron.</i>
The second-trimester hospitalization requirement struck down in <i>Akron</i>
imposed, in the majority's view, "a heavy, and unnecessary,
burden," 462 U.S., at 438, more than doubling the cost of "women's access to a
relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure."
<i>Ibid</i>.; see also <i>id.</i>, at 434. By contrast, the cost of
examinations and tests
that could usefully and prudently be performed when a woman is 20-24 weeks
pregnant to determine whether the fetus is viable would only marginally, if at
all, increase the cost of an abortion. See Brief for American Association of
Prolife Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i>
3 ("At twenty weeks gestation, an ultrasound examination to determine
gestational age is standard medical practice. It is routinely provided by the
plaintiff clinics. An
ultrasound examination can effectively provide all three designated findings of
sec. 188.029"); <i>id.</i>, at 22 ("A finding of fetal weight can be obtained
from the same ultrasound test used to determine gestational age"); <i>id.</i>,
at 25 ("There are
a number of different [*531] methods in standard medical practice to determine
fetal lung maturity at twenty or more weeks gestation. The most simple
and most obvious is by inference. It is well known that fetal lungs
do not mature until 33-34 weeks gestation. ... If an assessment of the
gestational age indicates that the child is less than thirty-three weeks, a
general finding can be made that the fetal lungs are not mature. This finding
can then be used by the physician in making his determination of viability
under
section 188.029"); cf. Brief for American Medical Association et al. as
<i>Amici Curiae</i> 42 (no suggestion that fetal weight and gestational age
cannot be determined from the same sonogram); <i>id.</i>, at 43 (another
clinical test for
gestational age and, by inference, fetal weight and lung maturity, is an
accurate report of the last menstrual period), citing Smith, Frey, &amp;
Johnson, Assessing Gestational Age, 33 Am. Fam. Physician 215, 219-220
(1986).<p>

Moreover, the examinations and tests required by &#167;188.029 are to be
performed when viability is possible. This feature of &#167;188.029
distinguishes it
from the second-trimester hospitalization requirement struck down by the
<i>Akron</i> majority. As the Court recognized in <i>Thornburgh,</i>
the State's compelling interest
in potential life postviability renders its interest in
determining the critical point of viability equally compelling. See
<i>supra,</i> at
527-528. Under the Court's precedents, the same cannot be said for the
<i>Akron</i>
second-trimester hospitalization requirement. As I understand the Court's
opinion in <i>Akron,</i>
therefore, the plurality's suggestion today that <i>Akron</i> casts
doubt on the validity of &#167;188.029, even as the Court has interpreted it,
is without foundation and cannot provide a basis for reevaluating <i>Roe.</i>
Accordingly,
because the Court of Appeals misinterpreted &#167;188.029, and because,
properly
interpreted, &#167;188.029 is not inconsistent with any of this Court's prior
precedents, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.<p>

In sum, I concur in Parts I, II-A,  II-B, and II-C of the Court's opinion and
concur in the judgment as to Part II-D.<p>

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3>WEBSTER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, ET AL<br>
v<br>
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL</h3>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.<p>

No. 88-605. Argued April 26, 1989 -- Decided July 3, 1989<p>
</center>

[*532] JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.<p>

I join Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the opinion of the Court. As to Part
II-D, I share Justice Blackmun's view, <i>post</i>, at 556, that it effectively
would overrule <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113 (1973). I think that should be
done, but would do it more explicitly. Since today we contrive to avoid doing
it, and indeed to avoid almost any decision of national import, I need not set
forth my reasons, some of which have been well recited in dissents of my
colleagues in other cases. See, e. g., <i>Thornburgh v. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 786-797 (1986) (White, J.,
dissenting); <i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462
U.S. 416, 453-459 (1983) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>Roe v. Wade,</i>
<i>supra</i>, at 172-178 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); <i>Doe v. Bolton,</i> 410
U.S. 179, 221-223 (1973) (White, J., dissenting).<p>

The outcome of today's case will doubtless be heralded as a triumph of
judicial statesmanship. It is not that, unless it is statesmanlike needlessly
to prolong this Court's self-awarded sovereignty over a field where it has
little
proper business since the answers to most of the cruel questions posed are
political and not juridical -- a sovereignty which therefore quite properly,
but to the great damage of the Court, makes it the object of the sort of
organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy ought to
receive.<p>

Justice O'Connor's assertion, <i>ante</i>, at 526, that a "'fundamental rule of
judicial restraint'" requires us to avoid reconsidering <i>Roe</i>, cannot be
taken seriously. By finessing <i>Roe</i> we do not, as she suggests,
<i>ibid.</i>, adhere to the
strict and venerable rule that we should avoid "'decid[ing] questions of a
constitutional nature.'" We have not disposed of this case on some statutory or
procedural ground, but have decided, and could not avoid deciding, whether the
Missouri statute meets the requirements of the United States Constitution.
[*533] The only choice available is whether, in deciding that constitutional
question, we should use <i>Roe v. Wade</i> as the benchmark, or something else.
What is
involved, therefore, is not the rule of avoiding constitutional issues where
possible, but the quite separate principle that we will not "'formulate a rule
of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it
is to be applied.'" <i>Ante</i>, at 526. The latter is a sound general
principle, but
one often departed from when good reason exists. Just this Term, for
example, in an opinion authored by Justice O'Connor, despite the fact that we
had already held a racially based set-aside unconstitutional because
unsupported
by evidence of identified discrimination, which was all that was needed to
decide the case, we went on to outline the criteria for properly tailoring
race-based remedies in cases where such evidence is present. <i>Richmond
v. J. A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 506-508 (1989). Also this Term, in an
opinion joined by Justice O'Connor, we announced the constitutional rule that
deprivation of the right to confer with counsel during trial violates the Sixth
Amendment even if no prejudice can be shown, despite our finding that there had
been no such deprivation on the facts before us -- which was all that was
needed to decide that case. <i>Perry v. Leeke,</i> 488 U.S. 272, 278-280
(1989); see <i>id.</i>, at
285 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part). I have not identified with certainty the
first instance of our deciding a case on broader constitutional grounds than
absolutely necessary, but it is assuredly no later than <i>Marbury v.
Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), where we held that mandamus could
constitutionally
issue against the Secretary of State, although that was unnecessary given our
holding that the law authorizing issuance of the mandamus by this Court was
unconstitutional.<p>

The Court has often spoken more broadly than needed in precisely the fashion
at issue here, announcing a new rule of constitutional law when it could have
reached the identical result by applying the rule thereby displaced. To
describe [*534] two recent opinions that Justice O'Connor joined: In <i>Daniels
v. Williams,</i> 474 U.S. 327 (1986), we overruled our prior holding that a
"deprivation" of liberty or property could occur through negligent governmental
acts, ignoring the availability of the alternative constitutional ground that,
even if a deprivation had occurred, the State's postdeprivation remedies
satisfied due process, see <i>id.</i>, at 340-343 (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment). In <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213 (1983), we replaced the
pre-existing "two-pronged" constitutional test for probable cause with a
totality-of-the-circumstances approach, ignoring the concurrence's
argument that the same outcome could have been reached under the old test, see
<i>id.</i>, at 267-272 (White, J., concurring in judgment). It is rare, of
course, that
the Court goes out of its way to <i>acknowledge</i> that its judgment could
have been
reached under the old constitutional rule, making its adoption of the new one
unnecessary to the decision, but even such explicit acknowledgment is not
unheard of. See <i>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,</i> 453 U.S. 609 (1981);
<i>Perez v. Campbell,</i> 402 U.S. 637 (1971). For a sampling of other cases
where the
availability of a narrower, well-established ground is simply ignored in the
Court's opinion adopting a new constitutional rule, though pointed out in
separate opinions of some Justices, see <i>Michelin
Tire Corp. v. Wages,</i> 423 U.S. 276 (1976); <i>Pointer v. Texas,</i>
380 U.S. 400 (1965); and <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S.
643 (1961). It would be wrong, in any decision, to ignore the reality that our
policy not to "formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is
required by the precise facts" has a frequently applied good-cause exception.
But it seems particularly perverse to convert the policy into an absolute in
the present case, in order to place beyond reach the inexpressibly
"broader-than-was-required-by-the-precise-facts" structure established by
<i>Roe v. Wade.</i><p>

The real question, then, is whether there are valid reasons to go beyond the
most stingy possible holding today. It seems to me there are not only valid but
compelling ones. [*535] Ordinarily, speaking no more broadly than is
absolutely required avoids throwing settled law into confusion; doing so today
preserves a chaos that is evident to anyone who can read and count. Alone
sufficient to justify a broad holding is the fact that our retaining control,
through <i>Roe</i>, of what I believe to be, and many of our citizens recognize
to be, a political issue, continuously distorts the public perception of the
role of this Court. We can now look forward to at least another Term with
carts full of mail from the public, and streets full of demonstrators, urging
us -- their unelected and lifetenured judges who have been awarded those
extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that
we might follow the law despite the popular will -- to follow the popular will.
Indeed, I expect we can look forward to even more of that than before, given
our indecisive decision today. And if these reasons for taking the
unexceptional course of reaching a broader holding are not enough, then
consider the nature of
the constitutional question we avoid: In most cases, we do no harm by not
speaking more broadly than the decision requires. Anyone affected by the
conduct that the avoided holding would have prohibited will be able to
challenge it
himself and have his day in court to make the argument. Not so with respect to
the harm that many States believed, pre-<i>Roe</i>, and many may continue to
believe,
is caused by largely unrestricted abortion. That will continue to occur if the
States have the constitutional power to prohibit it, and would do so, but we
skillfully avoid telling them so. Perhaps those abortions cannot
constitutionally be proscribed. That is surely an arguable question, the
question that reconsideration of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> entails. But what is not at
all arguable, it seems to me, is that we should decide now and not
insist that we be run into a corner before we grudgingly yield up our judgment.
The only sound reason for the latter course is to prevent a change in the law
-- but to think that desirable begs the question to be decided.<p>

[*536] It was an arguable question today whether &#167;188.029 of the Missouri
law contravened this Court's understanding of
<i>Roe v. Wade</i>,<a href="#f1">*</a> and I
would have examined <i>Roe</i> rather than [*537] examining the
contravention. Given the
Court's newly contracted abstemiousness, what will it take, one
must wonder, to permit us to reach that fundamental question? The result of our
vote today is that we will not reconsider that prior opinion, even if most of
the Justices think it is wrong, unless we have before us a statute that in fact
contradicts it -- and even then (under our newly discovered
"no-broader-than-necessary" requirement) only minor problematical aspects of
<i>Roe</i> will be reconsidered, unless one expects state legislatures to adopt
provisions whose compliance with <i>Roe</i> cannot even be argued with a
straight face. It thus
appears that the mansion of constitutionalized abortion law, constructed
overnight in <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> must be disassembled doorjamb by doorjamb,
and never entirely brought down, no matter how wrong it may be.<p>

Of the four courses we might have chosen today -- to reaffirm <i>Roe</i>, to
overrule it explicitly, to overrule it <i>sub silentio,</i> or to avoid the
question -- the last is the least responsible. On the question of the
constitutionality of &#167;188.029, I concur in the judgment of the Court and
strongly dissent from the manner in which it has been reached.<p>

<hr>

<h2>Footnote</h2>

<a name="f1"></a>* That question, compared with the question whether we should
reconsider and reverse <i>Roe</i>, is hardly worth a footnote, but I think
Justice O'Connor answers
that incorrectly as well. In <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, 410 U.S. 113, 165-166 (1973),
we said that "the physician [has the right] to administer medical treatment
according to
his professional judgment up to the points where important state interests
provide compelling justifications for intervention." We have subsequently made
clear that it is also a matter of medical judgment when viability (one of those
points) is reached. "The time when viability is achieved may vary with each
pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is,
and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician."
<i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 64 (1976).
Section 188.029 conflicts with the purpose and hence the fair import of this
principle because it will sometimes require a physician to perform tests that
he would not
otherwise have performed to determine whether a fetus is viable. It is
therefore a legislative imposition on the judgment of the physician, and one
that increases the cost of an abortion.<p>

Justice O'Connor would nevertheless uphold the law because it "does not
impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion decision." <i>Ante</i>, at 530.
This
conclusion is supported by the observation that the required tests impose only
a marginal cost on the abortion procedure, far less of an increase than the
cost-doubling hospitalization requirement invalidated in <i>Akron v. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416 (1983). See <i>ante</i>,
at 530-531. The
fact that the challenged regulation is less costly than what we struck down in
<i>Akron</i>
tells us only that we cannot decide the present case on the basis of that
earlier decision. It does not tell us whether the present requirement is an
"undue burden," and I know of no basis for determining that this particular
burden (or any other for that matter) is "due." One could with equal
justification conclude that it is not. To avoid the question of <i>Roe v.
Wade</i>'s
validity, with the attendant costs that this will have for the Court and for
the principles of self-governance, on the basis of a standard that offers "no
guide but the Court's own discretion," <i>Baldwin v. Missouri,</i>
281 U.S. 586, 595 (1930) (Holmes, J., dissenting), merely adds to the
irrationality of what we do today.<p>

Similarly irrational is the new concept that Justice O'Connor introduces into
the law in order to achieve her result, the notion of a State's "interest in
potential life when viability is possible." <i>Ante</i>, at 528. Since
"viability" means the mere possibility (not the certainty) of survivability
outside the
womb, "possible viability" must mean the possibility of a possibility of
survivability outside the womb. Perhaps our next opinion will expand the third
trimester into the second even further, by approving state action designed to
take account of "the chance of possible viability."<p>

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3>WEBSTER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, ET AL<br>
v<br>
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL</h3>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.<p>

No. 88-605. Argued April 26, 1989 -- Decided July 3, 1989<p>
</center>

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.<p>

Today, <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and the fundamental
constitutional
right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, survive but are not
secure. Although the Court extricates itself from this case without making a
single, even incremental, change in the law of abortion, the plurality and
Justice Scalia would overrule Roe (the first silently, the other explicitly)
and would return to the States [*538] virtually unfettered authority to
control
the quintessentially intimate, personal, and life-directing decision whether to
carry a fetus to term. Although today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution
and the decisions of this Court prohibit a State from enacting laws
that inhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right, a plurality of
this Court implicitly invites every state legislature to enact more and more
restrictive abortion regulations in order to provoke more and more test cases,
in the hope that sometime down the line the Court will return the law of
procreative freedom to the severe limitations that generally prevailed in this
country before January 22, 1973. Never in my memory has a plurality announced a
judgment of this Court that so foments disregard for the law and for our
standing decisions.<p>

Nor in my memory has a plurality gone about its business in such a deceptive
fashion. At every level of its review, from its effort to read the real meaning
out of the Missouri statute, to its intended evisceration of precedents and its
deafening silence about the constitutional protections that it would jettison,
the plurality obscures the portent of its analysis. With feigned restraint, the
plurality announces that its analysis leaves <i>Roe</i> "undisturbed," albeit
"modif[ied] and narrow[ed]." <i>Ante</i>, at 521. But this disclaimer is
totally
meaningless. The plurality opinion is filled with winks, and nods,
and knowing glances to those who would do away with <i>Roe</i>
explicitly, but turns a
stone face to anyone in search of what the plurality conceives as the scope of
a woman's right under the Due Process Clause to terminate a pregnancy free from
the coercive and brooding influence of the State. The simple truth is that
<i>Roe</i>
would not survive the plurality's analysis, and that the plurality provides no
substitute for Roe's protective umbrella.<p>

I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty and equality of the millions of
women who have lived and come of age in the 16 years since <i>Roe</i>
was decided. I
fear for the integrity of, and public esteem for, this Court.<p>

I dissent.<p>

<h2 align=center>I</h2>

The Chief Justice parades through the four challenged sections of the
Missouri statute <i>seriatim</i>. I shall not do this, but shall relegate
most of my comments as to those sections to the
margin.<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Although
I disagree  with the Court's consideration [*540] of &#167;&#167;1.205,
188.210, and 188.215, and am especially disturbed by its misapplication of our
past decisions
in upholding Missouri's ban on the performance of abortions at [*541]
"public facilities," its discussion of these provisions is merely
prologue to the plurality's consideration of the statute's viability-testing
requirement, &#167;188.029 -- the only section of the Missouri statute that
the plurality construes as implicating <i>Roe</i> itself. There, tucked away at
the end of
its opinion, the plurality suggests a radical reversal of the law of abortion;
and there, primarily, I direct my attention.<p>

In the plurality's view, the viability-testing provision imposes a burden on
second-trimester abortions as a way of furthering the State's interest in
protecting the potential life of the fetus. Since under the <i>Roe</i>
framework, the
State may not fully regulate abortion in the interest of potential life (as
opposed to maternal health) until the third trimester, the plurality finds it
necessary, in order to save the Missouri testing provision, to throw out
<i>Roe</i>'s trimester framework. <i>Ante</i>, at 518-520. In flat
contradiction to <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S.,
at 163, the plurality concludes that the State's interest in potential life is
compelling before viability, and upholds the testing provision [*542]
because it "permissibly furthers" that state interest. <i>Ante</i>, at 519.<p>

<h2 align=center>A</h2>

At the outset, I note that in its haste to limit abortion rights, the
plurality compounds the errors of its analysis by needlessly reaching out to
address constitutional questions that are not actually presented. The conflict
between &#167;188.029 and <i>Roe</i>'s trimester framework, which purportedly
drives the
plurality to reconsider our past decisions, is a contrived conflict: the
product of an aggressive misreading of the viability-testing
requirement and a needlessly wooden application of the <i>Roe</i> framework.<p>

The plurality's reading of &#167;188.029 is irreconcilable with the plain
language of the statute and is in derogation of this Court's settled view that
"'district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to
interpret the laws of their respective States.'" <i>Frisby v. Schultz,</i>
487 U.S. 474, 482 (1988), quoting <i>Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472
U.S. 491, 499-500 (1985). Abruptly setting aside the construction of &#167;
188.029 adopted by
both the District Court and Court of Appeals as "plain error," the plurality
reads the viability-testing provision as requiring only that before a physician
may perform an abortion on a woman whom he believes to be carrying a fetus of
20 or more weeks gestational age, the doctor must determine whether the fetus
is viable and, as part of that exercise, must, to the extent feasible and
consistent with sound medical practice, conduc  tests necessary to make
findings of gestational age, weight, and lung maturity. <i>Ante</i>, at
514-517.
But the plurality's reading of the provision, according to
which the statute requires the physician to perform tests only in
order to determine <i>viability,</i> ignores the statutory language explicitly
directing that "the physician <i>shall</i> perform or cause to be performed
such medical examinations and tests as are <i>necessary to make a finding of
the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity</i> of the unborn child and
<i>shall</i> enter
such findings" in the mother's medical record. &#167;188.029 (emphasis added).
The
[*543] statute's plain language requires the physician to undertake whatever
tests are necessary to determine gestational age, weight, and lung maturity,
regardless of whether these tests are necessary to a finding of viability, and
regardless of whether the tests subject the pregnant woman or the fetus to
additional health risks or add substantially to the cost of an
abortion.<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a><p>

Had the plurality read the statute as written, it would have had
no cause to reconsider the <i>Roe</i> framework. As properly construed, the
viability-testing provision does not pass constitutional muster under even a
rational-basis standard, the least restrictive level of review applied by this
Court. See <i>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co.,</i>
348 U.S. 483 (1955). By mandating
tests to determine fetal weight and lung maturity for every fetus thought to be
more than 20 weeks gestational age, the statute requires physicians to
undertake
procedures, such as amniocentesis, that, in the situation presented, have no
medical justification, impose significant additional health risks on both the
pregnant woman and the fetus, and bear no rational relation to the State's
interest in protecting fetal life.<a href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a>
As written, &#167;188.029 is an arbitrary
imposition of discomfort, risk, and expense, furthering no discernible interest
except to make the procurement of an abortion as arduous and difficult as
possible. Thus, were it not for [*544] the plurality's tortured effort to
avoid the plain import of &#167;188.029, it could have struck down the testing
provision as patently irrational irrespective of the Roe
framework.<a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a><p>

The plurality eschews this straightforward resolution, in the hope of
precipitating a constitutional crisis. Far from avoiding constitutional
difficulty, the plurality attempts to engineer a dramatic retrenchment in our
jurisprudence by  exaggerating the conflict between its untenable construction
of &#167;188.029 and the <i>Roe</i> trimester framework.<p>

No one contests that under the <i>Roe</i> framework the State, in order to
promote
its interest in potential human life, may regulate and even proscribe
nontherapeutic abortions once the fetus becomes viable. <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S.,
at 164-165. If, as the plurality appears to hold, the testing provision simply
requires a physician to use appropriate and medically sound tests to determine
whether the fetus is actually viable when the estimated gestational age is
greater than 20 weeks (and therefore within what the District Court found to be
the margin of error for viability, <i>ante</i>, at 515-516), then I see little
or no conflict with <i>Roe.</i><a href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Nothing in <i>Roe</i>, or any of its progeny, holds
that a State may not effectuate its compelling interest in the potential life
of a viable fetus by seeking to ensure that no viable fetus is
mistakenly aborted because of the inherent lack of precision in estimates of
gestational age. A requirement that a physician make a finding of viability,
one way or [*545] the other, for every fetus that falls within the range of
possible viability does no more than preserve the State's recognized authority.
Although, as the plurality correctly points out, such a testing requirement
would have the effect of imposing additional costs on second-trimester
abortions where the tests indicated that the fetus was not viable, these costs
would be merely incidental to, and a necessary accommodation of, the State's
unquestioned right to prohibit nontherapeutic abortions after the point of
viability. In short, the testing provision, as construed by the plurality, is
consistent with the <i>Roe</i> framework and could be upheld effortlessly under
current doctrine.<a href="#f6><sup>6</sup></a><p>

How ironic it is, then, and disingenuous, that the plurality scolds the
Court of Appeals for adopting a construction of the statute that fails to avoid
constitutional difficulties. <i>Ante</i>, at [*546] 514, 515. By distorting
the
statute, the plurality manages to avoid invalidating the testing provision on
what should have been noncontroversial constitutional grounds; having done so,
however, the plurality rushes headlong into a much deeper constitutional
thicket, brushing past an obvious basis for upholding &#167;188.029 in search
of a
pretext for scuttling the trimester framework. Evidently, from the plurality's
perspective, the real problem with the Court of Appeals' construction of &#167;
188.029 is not that it raised a constitutional difficulty, but that it raised
the wrong constitutional difficulty -- one not implicating <i>Roe.</i> The
plurality
has remedied that, traditional canons of construction and judicial forbearance
notwithstanding.<p>

<h2 align=center>B</h2>

Having set up the conflict between &#167;188.029 and the <i>Roe</i> trimester
framework, the plurality summarily discards <i>Roe</i>'s analytic core as
"'unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.'" <i>Ante</i>, at 518,
quoting <i>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U.S.
528, 546 (1985).
This is so, the plurality claims, because the key elements of the framework do
not appear in the text of the Constitution, because the framework more closely
resembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutional doctrine, and because
under the framework the State's interest in potential human life is considered
compelling only after viability, when, in fact, that interest is equally
compelling throughout pregnancy. <i>Ante</i>, at 519-520. The plurality does
not bother to explain these alleged flaws in <i>Roe.</i>
Bald assertion masquerades as reasoning.
The object, quite clearly, is not to persuade, but to prevail.<p>

<h2 align=center>1</h2>

The plurality opinion is far more remarkable for the arguments that it does
not advance than for those that it does. The plurality does not even mention,
much less join, the true jurisprudential debate underlying this case: whether
the Constitution includes an "unenumerated" general right to [*547] privacy
as recognized in many of our decisions, most notably <i>Griswold v.
Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and <i>Roe</i>, and, more specifically,
whether, and to what
extent, such a right to privacy extends to matters of childbearing and family
life, including abortion. See, e. g., <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</i> 405 U.S.
438 (1972) (contraception); <i>Loving v. Virginia,</i> 388 U.S. 1 (1967)
(marriage); <i>Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U.S. 535 (1942)
(procreation);
<i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U.S. 510 (1925)
(childrearing).<a href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> These are
questions of unsurpassed significance in this Court's interpretation of the
Constitution, and mark the battleground upon which this case was fought, by the
parties, by the United States as <i>amicus</i> on behalf of petitioners, and by
an unprecedented number of <i>amici.</i>
On these grounds, abandoned by the plurality, the
Court should decide this case.<p>

But rather than arguing that the text of the Constitution makes no mention of
the right to privacy, the plurality complains that the critical elements of the
<i>Roe</i> framework -- trimesters [*548] and viability -- do not appear in
the
Constitution and are, therefore, somehow inconsistent with a Constitution cast
in general terms. <i>Ante</i>, at 518-519. Were this a true concern, we would
have to
abandon most of our constitutional jurisprudence. As the plurality well knows,
or should know, the "critical elements" of countless constitutional doctrines
nowhere appear in the Constitution's text. The Constitution makes no mention,
for example, of the First Amendment's "actual malice" standard for proving
certain libels, see <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</i>
376 U.S. 254 (1964), or of
the standard for determining when speech is obscene. See <i>Miller v.
California,</i> 413 U.S. 15 (1973). Similarly, the Constitution makes no
mention of the rational-basis test, or the specific verbal formulations of
intermediate
and strict scrutiny by which this Court evaluates claims under the Equal
Protection Clause. The reason is simple. Like the <i>Roe</i> framework,
these tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be, rights protected by
the Constitution. Rather, they are judge-made methods for evaluating and
measuring the strength and scope of constitutional rights or for balancing the
constitutional rights of individuals against the competing interests of
government.<p>

With respect to the <i>Roe</i> framework, the general constitutional principle,
indeed the fundamental constitutional right, for which it was developed is the
right to privacy, see, e. g., <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479
(1965), a species of "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause, which under
our past decisions safeguards the right of women to exercise some control over
their own
role in procreation. As we recently reaffirmed in <i>Thornburgh v. American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i>
476 U.S. 747 (1986), few decisions are "more
basic to individual dignity and autonomy" or more appropriate to that "certain
private sphere of individual liberty" that the Constitution reserves from the
intrusive reach of government than the right to make the uniquely
personal, intimate, and self-defining decision whether to end [*549] a
pregnancy. <i>Id.</i>, at 772. It is this general principle, the "'moral fact
that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole,'"
<i>id.</i>, at 777, n. 5 (Stevens, J., concurring), quoting <i>Fried,
Correspondence, 6 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff.</i> 288-289 (1977), that is found in
the Constitution. See <i>Roe</i>, 410 U.S.,
at 152-153. The trimester framework simply defines and limits that right to
privacy in the abortion context to accommodate, not destroy, a State's
legitimate interest in protecting the health of pregnant women and in
preserving potential human life. <i>Id.</i>, at 154-162. Fashioning such
accommodations between
individual rights and the legitimate interests of government, establishing
benchmarks and standards with which to evaluate the competing claims of
individuals and government, lies at the very heart of constitutional
adjudication. To the extent that the trimester framework is useful in this
enterprise, it is not only consistent with constitutional interpretation, but
necessary to the wise and just exercise of this Court's paramount
authority to define the scope of constitutional rights.<p>

<h2 align=center>2</h2>

The plurality next alleges that the result of the trimester framework has
"been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a
code of regulations rather than a body of constitutional doctrine."
<i>Ante</i>, at
518. Again, if this were a true and genuine concern, we would have to abandon
vast areas of our constitutional jurisprudence. The plurality complains that
under the trimester framework the Court has distinguished between a city
ordinance requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed in clinics and
a state law requiring that these abortions be performed in hospitals, or
between
laws requiring that certain information be furnished to a woman by a physician
or his assistant and those requiring that such information be furnished by the
physician exclusively. <i>Ante</i>, at 518, n. 15, citing <i>Simopoulos v.
Virginia,</i> 462
U.S. 506 (1983), [*550] and <i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,
Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416 (1983). Are these distinctions any finer, or more
"regulatory," than the distinctions we have often drawn in our First
Amendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we have held that a "release time"
program permitting public-school students to leave school grounds during
school hours to receive religious instruction does not violate the
Establishment Clause, even though a release-time program permitting religious
instruction on school grounds does violate the Clause? Compare <i>Zorach v.
Clauson,</i> 343 U.S. 306 (1952), with <i>Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of
Education of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign County,</i> 333 U.S. 203  (1948).
Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes factual distinctions no less
intricate. Just this Term, for example, we held that while an aerial
observation from a helicopter hovering at 400 feet does not violate any
reasonable
expectation of privacy, such an expectation of privacy would be violated by a
helicopter observation from an unusually low altitude. <i>Florida v. Riley,</i>
488 U.S. 445, 451 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Similarly, in
a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that although an overnight ban
on attorney-client communication violated the constitutionally guaranteed right
to counsel, <i>Geders v. United States,</i> 425 U.S. 80 (1976), that right was
not violated when a trial judge separated a defendant from his lawyer during a
15-minute recess after the defendant's direct testimony. <i>Perry v. Leeke,</i>
488 U.S. 272 (1989).<p>

That numerous constitutional doctrines result in narrow differentiations
between similar circumstances does not mean that this Court has abandoned
adjudication in favor of regulation. Rather, these careful distinctions reflect
the process of constitutional adjudication itself, which is often highly fact
specific, requiring such determinations as whether state laws are "unduly
burdensome" or "reasonable" or bear a "rational" or "necessary" relation to
asserted state interests. In a recent due process case, The Chief Justice wrote
for the [*551] Court: "[M]any branches of the law abound in nice
distinctions that may be troublesome but have been thought nonetheless
necessary: 'I do not think we need trouble ourselves with the thought that my
view depends upon differences of degree. The whole law does so as
soon as it is civilized.'" <i>Daniels v. Williams,</i> 474 U.S. 327, 334
(1986), quoting <i>LeRoy Fibre Co. v. Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co.,</i>
232 U.S. 340, 354 (1914) (Holmes, J., partially concurring).<p>

These "differences of degree" fully account for our holdings in
<i>Simopoulos,</i> <i>supra</i>, and <i>Akron,</i> <i>supra</i>. Those
decisions rest on this Court's reasoned and accurate judgment that
hospitalization and doctor-counseling requirements unduly
burdened the right of women to terminate a pregnancy and were not rationally
related to the State's asserted interest in the health of pregnant women, while
Virginia's substantially less restrictive regulations were not unduly
burdensome and did rationally serve the State's
interest.<a href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> That the Court exercised its
best judgment in evaluating these markedly different statutory schemes no more
established the Court as an "'ex officio medical board,'" <i>ante</i>, at 519,
quoting <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 99
(1976) (opinion of White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), than
our decisions involving religion in the public schools establish the
Court as a national school board, or our decisions concerning prison
regulations establish the Court as [*552] a bureau of prisons. See
<i>Thornburgh v. Abbott,</i>
490 U.S. 401 (1989) (adopting different standard of First Amendment review for
incoming as opposed to outgoing prison mail). If, in delicate and complicated
areas of constitutional law, our legal judgments "have become increasingly
intricate," <i>ante</i>, at 518, it is not, as the plurality contends, because
we have
overstepped our judicial role. Quite the opposite: the rules are intricate
because we have remained conscientious in our duty to do justice carefully,
especially when fundamental rights rise or fall with our decisions.<p>

<h2 align=center>3</h2>

Finally, the plurality asserts that the trimester framework cannot stand
because the State's interest in potential life is compelling throughout
pregnancy, not merely after viability. <i>Ante</i>, at 519. The opinion
contains not
one word of rationale for its view of the State's interest. This
"it-is-so-because-we-say-so" jurisprudence constitutes nothing other than an
attempted exercise of brute force; reason, much less persuasion, has no
place.<p>

In answering the plurality's claim that the State's interest in the fetus is
uniform and compelling throughout pregnancy, I cannot improve upon what Justice
Stevens has written:<p>

"I should think it obvious that the State's interest in the protection of an
embryo -- even if that interest is defined as 'protecting those who will be
citizens' ... -- increases progressively and dramatically as the organism's
capacity to feel pain, to experience pleasure, to survive, and to react to its
surroundings increases day by day. The development of a fetus -- and pregnancy
itself -- are not static conditions, and the assertion that the government's
interest is static simply ignores this reality. ... [U]nless the religious
view that a fetus is a 'person' is adopted ... there is a
fundamental and well-recognized difference between a fetus and a human being;
indeed, if [*553] there is not such a difference, the permissibility of
terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of the state
legislatures. And if distinctions may be drawn between a fetus and a human
being
in terms of the state interest in their protection -- even though the fetus
represents one of 'those who will be citizens' -- it seems to me quite odd to
argue that distinctions may not also be drawn between the state interest in
protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in protecting the
9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. Recognition of this
distinction is supported not only by logic, but also by history and by our
shared experiences." <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S., at 778-779 (footnote
omitted).<p>

See  also <i>Roe</i>, 410 U.S., at 129-147.<p>

For my own part, I remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court 16
years ago were convinced, that the <i>Roe</i> framework, and the viability
standard in
particular, fairly, sensibly, and effectively functions to safeguard
the constitutional liberties of pregnant women while recognizing and
accommodating the State's interest in potential human life. The viability line
reflects the biological facts and truths of fetal development; it marks that
threshold moment prior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the woman
and cannot reasonably and objectively be regarded as a subject of rights or
interests distinct from, or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At the
same time, the viability standard takes account of the undeniable fact that as
the fetus evolves into its postnatal form, and as it loses its dependence on the
uterine environment, the State's interest in the fetus' potential human life,
and in fostering a regard for human life in general, becomes compelling. As a
practical matter, because viability follows "quickening" -- the
point at which a woman feels movement in her womb -- and because viability
occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, it establishes an easily
applicable standard for regulating abortion while [*554] providing a pregnant
woman ample time to exercise her fundamental right with her responsible
physician to terminate her
pregnancy.<a href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Although I have stated
previously for a majority of this Court that "[c]onstitutional rights do not
always have easily ascertainable boundaries," to seek and establish those
boundaries remains the special responsibility of this Court. <i>Thornburgh,</i>
476 U.S., at 771. In <i>Roe</i>, we discharged that responsibility as logic and
science compelled. The plurality today advances not one reasonable argument as
to why our judgment in that case was wrong and should be abandoned.<p>

<h2 align=center>C</h2>

Having contrived an opportunity to reconsider the <i>Roe</i> framework, and
then having discarded that framework, the plurality finds the testing provision
unobjectionable because it "permissibly furthers the State's interest in
protecting potential human life." <i>Ante</i>, at 519-520. This newly minted  
[*555] standard is circular and totally  meaningless. Whether a challenged
abortion
regulation "permissibly furthers" a legitimate state interest is the question
that courts must answer in abortion cases, not the standard for courts to
apply. In keeping with the rest of its opinion, the plurality makes no attempt
to
explain or to justify its new standard, either in the abstract or as applied in
this case. Nor could it. The "permissibly furthers" standard has no independent
meaning, and consists of nothing other than what a majority of this Court may
believe at any given moment in any given case. The plurality's novel test
appears to be nothing more than a dressed-up version of rational-basis review,
this Court's most lenient level of scrutiny. One thing is clear, however: were
the plurality's "permissibly furthers" standard adopted by the Court, for all
practical purposes, <i>Roe</i> would be
overruled.<a href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a><p>

The "permissibly furthers" standard completely disregards the irreducible
minimum of <i>Roe</i>: the Court's recognition that a woman has a limited
fundamental
constitutional right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. That right
receives no meaningful recognition in the plurality's written
opinion. Since, in the plurality's view, the State's interest in
potential life is compelling as of the moment of conception, and is therefore
served only if abortion is abolished, every hindrance to a woman's ability to
obtain an abortion must be "permissible." Indeed, the more severe the
hindrance, the more effectively (and permissibly) the State's interest would be
furthered.
A tax on abortions or a criminal prohibition would both satisfy the plurality's
standard. So, for that [*556] matter, would a requirement that a pregnant
woman memorize and recite today's plurality opinion before seeking an
abortion.<p>

The plurality pretends that <i>Roe</i> survives, explaining that the facts of
this case differ from those in <i>Roe</i>: here, Missouri has chosen to assert
its interest in potential life only at the point of viability, whereas, in
<i>Roe</i>, Texas had
asserted that interest from the point of conception, criminalizing all
abortions, except where the life of the mother was at stake. <i>Ante</i>, at
521. This, of course, is a distinction without a difference. The plurality
repudiates every principle for which <i>Roe</i> stands; in good conscience, it
cannot possibly  believe
that <i>Roe</i> lies "undisturbed" merely because this case does not call
upon the Court to reconsider the Texas statute, or one like it. If the
Constitution permits a State to enact any statute that reasonably furthers its
interest in potential life, and if that interest arises as of conception, why
would the Texas statute fail to pass muster? One suspects that the plurality
agrees. It is impossible to read the plurality opinion and especially its final
paragraph, without recognizing its implicit invitation to every State to enact
more and more restrictive abortion laws, and to assert their interest in
potential life as of the moment of conception. All these laws will satisfy the
plurality's nonscrutiny, until sometime, a new regime of old dissenters and new
appointees will declare what the plurality intends: that <i>Roe</i> is no
longer good law.<a href="#f11"><sup><11></sup></a><p>

[*557]
<h2 align=center>D</h2>

Thus, "not with a bang, but a whimper," the plurality discards a landmark
case of the last generation, and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of
every woman in this country who had come to believe that the Constitution
guaranteed her the right to exercise some control over her unique
ability to bear children. The plurality does so either oblivious or insensitive
to the fact
that millions of women, and their families, have ordered their lives around the
right to reproductive choice, and that this right has become vital to the full
participation of women in the economic and political walks of American life.
The plurality would clear the way once again for government to force upon women
the physical labor and specific and direct medical and psychological harms that
may accompany carrying a fetus to term. The plurality would clear the
way again for the State to conscript a woman's body and to force upon her a
"distressful life and future." <i>Roe</i>, 410 U.S., at 153.<p>

The result, as we know from experience, see Cates &amp; Rochat, Illegal
Abortions in the United States: 1972-1974, 8 Family Planning Perspectives 86,
92 (1976), would be that every year hundreds of thousands of women, in
desperation, would defy the law, and place their health and safety in the
unclean and unsympathetic hands of back-alley abortionists, or they would
attempt to perform abortions upon themselves, [*558] with disastrous
results. Every year, many women, especially poor and minority women, would die
or suffer debilitating physical trauma, all in the name of enforced morality or
religious dictates or lack of compassion, as it may be.<p>

Of the aspirations and settled understandings of American women, of the
inevitable and brutal consequences of what it is doing, the tough-approach
plurality utters not a word. This silence is callous. It is also profoundly
destructive of this Court as an institution. To overturn a constitutional
decision is a rare and grave undertaking. To overturn a constitutional decision
that secured a fundamental personal liberty to millions of persons would be
unprecedented in our 200 years of constitutional history. Although the doctrine
of <i>stare decisis</i> applies with somewhat diminished force in
constitutional cases generally, <i>ante</i>, at 518, even in ordinary
constitutional cases "any departure from ... <i>stare decisis</i> demands
special justification." <i>Arizona v. Rumsey,</i> 467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984). See
also <i>Vasquez v. Hillery,</i> 474 U.S. 254, 266 (1986) ("[T]he careful
observer will discern that any detours from the straight path of <i>stare
decisis</i> in our past have occurred for articulable reasons, and
only when the Court has felt obliged 'to bring its opinions into agreement with
experience and with facts newly ascertained,'" quoting <i>Burnet
v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U.S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting)). This requirement of justification applies with unique force
where, as here, the Court's
abrogation of precedent would destroy people's firm belief, based on past
decisions of this Court, that they possess an unabridgeable right to undertake
certain conduct.<a href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a><p>

[*559] As discussed at perhaps too great length above, the plurality makes
no serious attempt to carry "the heavy burden of persuading ... that changes
in society or in the law dictate" the abandonment of <i>Roe</i> and its
numerous progeny, <i>Vasquez,</i> 474 U.S., at 266, much less the greater
burden of
explaining the abrogation of a fundamental personal freedom. Instead, the
plurality pretends that it leaves <i>Roe</i> standing, and refuses even to
discuss the
real issue underlying this case: whether the Constitution includes an
unenumerated right to privacy that encompasses a woman's right to decide
whether to terminate a pregnancy. To the extent that the plurality does
criticize the <i>Roe</i> framework, these criticisms are pure <i>ipse
dixit.</i><p>

This comes at a cost. The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> "permits society to
presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the
proclivities of individuals, and thereby contributes to the integrity of our
constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact." 474 U.S.,
at 265-266. Today's decision involves the most politically divisive domestic
legal issue of our time. By refusing to explain or to justify its proposed
revolutionary revision in the law of abortion, and by refusing to abide
not only by our precedents, but also by our canons for reconsidering those
precedents, the plurality invites charges of cowardice and [*560]
illegitimacy to our door. I cannot say that these would be undeserved.<p>

<h2 align=center>II</h2>

For today, at least, the law of abortion stands undisturbed. For today, the
women of this Nation still retain the liberty to control their destinies. But
the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.<p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<a name="1"></a>1. Contrary to the Court, I do not see how the preamble,
&#167;1.205, realistically may be construed as "abortion-neutral." It declares
that "[t]he
life of each human being begins at conception" and that "[u]nborn children have
protectable interests in life, health, and well-being." Mo. Rev. Stat.
&#167;&#167;1.205.1(1) and (2) (1986). By the preamble's specific terms, these
declarations apply to all of Missouri's laws which, in turn, are to be
interpreted to protect
the rights of the unborn to the fullest extent possible under the Constitution
of the United States and the decisions of this Court. &#167;1.205.2. As the
Court of
Appeals concluded, the Missouri Legislature "intended its abortion regulations
to be understood against the backdrop of its theory of life." 851 F. 2d 1071,
1076 (CA8 1988). I note the United States' acknowledgment that this backdrop
places "a burden of uncertain scope on the performance of abortions by
supplying a general principle that would fill in whatever interstices may be
present in existing abortion precedents." Brief for United States as <i>Amicus
Curiae</i> on behalf of appellants 8-9, n. 5.<p>

In my view, a State may not expand indefinitely the scope of its abortion
regulations by creating interests in fetal life that are limited solely by
reference to the decisional law of this Court. Such a statutory scheme, whose
scope is dependent on the uncertain and disputed limits of our holdings, will
have the unconstitutional effect of chilling the exercise of a woman's right to
terminate a pregnancy and of burdening the freedom of health professionals to
provide abortion services. In this case, moreover, because the preamble defines
fetal life as beginning upon "the fertilization of the ovum of a female by a
sperm of a male," &#167;188.015(3), the provision also unconstitutionally
burdens
the use of contraceptive devices, such as the IUD and the "morning after" pill,
which may operate to prevent pregnancy only after conception as defined in the
statute. See Brief for Association of Reproductive Health Professionals et al.
as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 30-39.<p>

The Court upholds &#167;&#167;188.210 and 188.215 on the ground that the
constitutionality of these provisions follows from our holdings in <i>Maher
v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464 (1977), <i>Poelker v. Doe,</i> 432 U.S. 519 (1977),
and <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297 (1980). There were strong dissents in
all those cases.<p>

Whatever one may think of <i>Maher,</i> <i>Poelker,</i> and <i>Harris,</i>
however, they most
certainly do not control this case, where the State not only has withdrawn from
the business of abortion, but has taken affirmative steps to assure that
abortions are not performed by private physicians in private institutions.
Specifically, by defining "public facility" as "any public institution, public
facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or controlled
by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof," &#167;188.200,
the
Missouri statute prohibits the performance of abortions in institutions that in
all pertinent respects are private, yet are located on property owned, leased,
or controlled by the government. Thus, under the statute, no abortion may be
performed at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City -- where, in 1985, 97 percent
of all Missouri hospital abortions at 16 weeks or later were performed -- even
though the Center is a private hospital, staffed primarily by private doctors,
and administered by a private corporation: the Center is located on ground
leased from a political subdivision of the State.<p>

The sweeping scope of Missouri's "public facility" provision sharply
distinguishes this case from <i>Maher</i>, <i>Poelker</i>, and <i>Harris</i>.
In one of those cases,
it was said: "The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative
... but it ... imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not
already there." <i>Maher</i>, 432 U.S., at 474. Missouri's public facility ban,
by contrast, goes far beyond merely offering incentives in favor of childbirth
(as in <i>Maher</i> and <i>Harris</i>), or a straightforward disassociation of
state-owned institutions and personnel from abortion services (as in
<i>Poelker</i>). Here, by
defining as "public" every health-care institution with some connection to the
State, no matter how attenuated, Missouri has brought to bear the full force of
its economic power and control over essential facilities to discourage its
citizens from exercising their constitutional rights, even where the State
itself could never be understood as authorizing, supporting, or having any
other positive association with the performance of an abortion. See R. Dworkin,
The Great Abortion Case, New York Review of Books, June 29, 1989, p. 49.<p>

The difference is critical. Even if the State may decline to subsidize or to
participate in the exercise of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, and
even if a State may pursue its own abortion policies in distributing public
benefits, it may not affirmatively constrict the availability of abortions by
defining as "public" that which in all meaningful respects is private. With the
certain knowledge that a substantial percentage of private health-care
providers will fall under the public facility ban, see Brief for National
Association of Public Hospitals as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10-11, Missouri does
not "leav[e] a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the State had chosen
not to operate any public hospitals at all," <i>ante</i>, at 509; rather, the
public facility ban leaves the
pregnant woman with far fewer choices, or, for those too sick or too poor to
travel, perhaps no choice at all. This aggressive and shameful infringement on
the right of women to obtain abortions in consultation with their chosen
physicians, unsupported by any state interest, much less a compelling one,
violates the command of <i>Roe</i>.<p>

Indeed, Justice O'Connor appears to recognize the constitutional difficulties
presented by Missouri's "public facilities" ban, and rejects respondents'
"facial" challenge to the provisions on the ground that a facial challenge
cannot succeed where, as here, at least some applications of the challenged law
are constitutional. <i>Ante</i>, at 523-524. While I disagree with this
approach,
Justice O'Connor's writing explicitly leaves open the possibility that some
applications of the "public facilities" ban may be unconstitutional, regardless
of <i>Maher</i>, <i>Poelker</i>, and <i>Harris</i>.<p>

I concur in Part II-C of the Court's opinion, holding that respondents'
challenge to &#167;188.205 is moot, although I note that the constitutionality
of this provision might become the subject of relitigation between these
parties should the Supreme Court of Missouri adopt an interpretation of the
provision that differs from the one accepted here. See <i>Deakins
v. Monaghan,</i> 484 U.S. 193, 201, n. 5 (1988).<p>

<a name="f2"></a>2. I consider irrefutable Justice Stevens' discussion of this
interpretive point. See post, at 560-563.<p>

<a name="f3"></a>3. The District Court found that "the only method to evaluate
[fetal] lung
maturity is by amniocentesis," a procedure that "imposes additional significant
health risks for both the pregnant woman and the fetus." 662 F. Supp. 407, 422
(WD Mo. 1987). Yet the medical literature establishes that to require
amniocentesis for all abortions after 20 weeks would be contrary to sound
medical practice and, moreover, would be useless for the purpose of determining
lung maturity until no earlier than between 28 and 30 weeks gestational age.
<i>Ibid.;</i> see also Brief for American Medical Association et al. as
<i>Amici Curiae</i> 41. Thus, were &#167;188.029 read to require a finding of
lung maturity, it would
require physicians to perform a highly intrusive procedure of risk that would
yield no result relevant to the question of viability.<p>

<a name="f4"></a>4. I also agree with the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d, at
1074-1075, that, as written, &#167;188.029 is contrary to this Court's
decision in <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379, 388-389 (1979).<p>

<a name="f5"></a>5. The plurality never states precisely its construction of
&#167;188.029. I base
my synopsis of the plurality's views mainly on its assertion that the entire
provision must be read in light of its requirement that the physician act only
in accordance with reasonable professional judgment, and that the provision
imposes no requirement that a physician perform irrelevant or dangerous tests.
<i>Ante</i>, at 514-515. To the extent that the plurality may be reading the
provision
to require tests other than those that a doctor, exercising reasonable
professional judgment, would deem necessary to a finding of viability, the
provision bears no rational relation to a legitimate governmental interest, and
cannot stand.<p>

<a name="f6"></a>6. As convincingly demonstrated by Justice O'Connor,
<i>ante</i>, at 527-531, the
cases cited by the plurality, are not to the contrary. As noted by the
plurality, in both <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S., at 388-389, and
<i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52 (1976), we
stressed that the
determination of viability is a matter for the judgment of the responsible
attending physician. But &#167;188.029, at least as construed by the
plurality, is consistent with this requirement. The provision does nothing to
remove the determination of viability from the purview of the attending
physician; it
merely instructs the physician to make a finding of viability using tests to
determine gestational age, weight, and lung maturity when such tests are
feasible and medically appropriate.<p>

I also see no conflict with the Court's holding in <i>Akron v. Akron Center for
Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416 (1983), that the State may not
impose "a heavy, and unnecessary, burden on women's access to a relatively
inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure." <i>Id.</i>, at
438 (emphasis
added). In <i>Akron,</i> we invalidated a city ordinance requiring that all
second-trimester abortions be performed in acute-care hospitals on the ground
that such a requirement was not medically necessary and would double the cost
of abortions. <i>Id.</i>, at 434-439. By contrast, the viability determination
at issue in
this case (as read by the plurality), is necessary to the effectuation of the
State's compelling interest in the potential human life of viable fetuses and
applies not to all second-trimester abortions, but instead only to that small
percentage of abortions performed on fetuses estimated to be of more than 20
weeks gestational age.<p>

<a name="f7"></a>7. The plurality, ignoring all of the aforementioned cases
except <i>Griswold,</i> responds that this case does not require consideration
of the "great issues" underlying this case because <i>Griswold,</i>
"unlike <i>Roe</i>, did not purport to adopt a
whole framework ... to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest
would apply." <i>Ante</i>, at 520. This distinction is highly ironic. The Court
in <i>Roe</i>
adopted the framework of which the plurality complains as a mechanism necessary
to give effect both to the constitutional rights of the pregnant woman and to
the State's significant interests in maternal health and potential life.
Concededly, <i>Griswold</i> does not adopt a framework for determining the
permissible scope of state regulation of contraception. The reason is simple:
in <i>Griswold</i> (and <i>Eisenstadt</i>),
the Court held that the challenged statute, regulating the use
of medically safe contraception, did not properly serve any significant state
interest. Accordingly, the Court had no occasion to fashion a framework to
accommodate a State's interests in regulating contraception. Surely, the
plurality is not suggesting that it would find <i>Roe</i> unobjectionable if
the Court
had forgone the framework and, as in the contraception decisions, had left the
State with little or no regulatory authority. The plurality's focus on the
framework is merely an excuse for avoiding the real issues embedded in this
case and a mask for its hostility to the constitutional rights that <i>Roe</i>
recognized.<p>

<a name="f8"></a>8. The difference in the <i>Akron</i> and <i>Simopoulos</i>
regulatory regimes is stark.
The Court noted in <i>Akron</i> that the city ordinance requiring that all
second-trimester abortions be performed in acute-care hospitals undoubtedly
would have made the procurement of legal abortions difficult and often
prohibitively expensive, thereby driving the performance of abortions back
underground where they would not be subject to effective regulation. Such a
requirement obviously did not further the city's asserted interest in maternal
health. 462 U.S., at 420, n. 1. On the other hand, the Virginia law at issue in
<i>Simopoulos</i>, by permitting the performance of abortions in licensed
out-patient clinics as well as hospitals, did not similarly constrict the
availability of legal abortions and, therefore, did not undermine its own
stated purpose of protecting maternal health.<p>

<a name="f9"></a>9. Notably, neither the plurality nor Justice O'Connor
advances the now-familiar catch-phrase criticism of the <i>Roe</i> framework
that because the point of viability will recede with advances in medical
technology, <i>Roe</i> "is clearly on
a collision course with itself." See <i>Akron</i>, 462 U.S., at 458 (dissenting
opinion). This critique has no medical foundation. As the medical literature
and the amicus briefs filed in this case conclusively demonstrate, "there is an
'anatomic threshold' for fetal viability of about 23-24 weeks of gestation."
Brief for American Medical Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7. See
also Brief for 167 Distinguished Scientists and Physicians, including 11 Nobel
Laureates, as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-14. Prior to that time, the crucial organs
are not
sufficiently mature to provide the mutually sustaining functions that are
prerequisite to extrauterine survival, or viability. Moreover, "no technology
exists to bridge the development gap between the three-day embryo culture and
the 24th week of gestation." Fetal Extrauterine Survivability, Report to the
New York State Task Force on Life and the Law 3 (1988). Nor does the medical
community believe that the development of any such technology is possible in
the foreseeable future. <i>Id.</i>, at 12. In other words, the threshold of
fetal viability is, and will remain, no different from what it was at the time
<i>Roe</i> was decided.
Predictions to the contrary are pure science fiction. See Brief for A Group of
American Law Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 23-25.<p>

<a name="f10"></a>10. Writing for the Court in <i>Akron</i>, Justice Powell
observed the same
phenomenon, though in hypothetical response to the dissent in that case: "In
sum, it appears that the dissent would uphold virtually any abortion regulation
under a rational-basis test. It also appears that even where heightened
scrutiny is deemed appropriate, the dissent would uphold virtually any
abortion-inhibiting regulation because of the State's interest in preserving
potential human life. ... This analysis is wholly incompatible with the
existence of the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>." 462 U.S.,
at 420-421, n. 1.<p>

<a name="f11"></a>11. The plurality claims that its treatment of <i>Roe</i>,
and a woman's right to
decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, "hold[s] true the balance between that
which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that
which it does not." <i>Ante</i>, at 521. This is unadulterated nonsense. The
plurality's balance matches a lead weight (the State's allegedly compelling
interest in fetal life as of the moment of conception) against a feather (a
"liberty interest" of the pregnant woman that the plurality barely mentions,
much less describes). The plurality's balance -- no balance at all -- places
nothing, or virtually nothing, beyond the reach of the democratic process.<p>

Justice Scalia candidly argues that this is all for the best. <i>Ante</i>, at
532. I cannot agree. "The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw
certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them
beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal
principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and
property ... may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no
elections." <i>West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette,</i>
319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943). In a Nation that cherishes liberty, the ability of a
woman to control the biological operation of her body and to determine with her
responsible physician whether or
not to carry a fetus to term must fall within that limited sphere of individual
autonomy that lies beyond the will or the power of any transient majority. This
Court stands as the ultimate guarantor of that zone of privacy, regardless of
the bitter disputes to which our decisions may give rise. In <i>Roe</i>, and
our numerous cases reaffirming <i>Roe</i>, we did no more than discharge our
constitutional duty.<p>

<a name="f12"></a>12. Cf. <i>South Carolina v. Gathers,</i> 490 U.S. 805, 824
(1989) (Scalia, J.,
dissenting) ("[T]he respect accorded prior decisions increases, rather than
decreases, with their antiquity, as the society adjusts itself to their
existence, and the surrounding law becomes premised on their validity").<p>

Moreover, as Justice Powell wrote for the Court in <i>Akron</i>: "There are
especially compelling reasons for adhering to <i>stare decisis</i> in applying
the principles of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. That case was considered with special
care. It was
first argued during the 1971 Term, and reargued -- with extensive briefing --
the following Term. The decision was joined by The Chief Justice and six other
Justices. Since <i>Roe</i> was decided in January 1973, the Court repeatedly
and consistently has accepted and applied the basic principle that a woman has
a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to
terminate her pregnancy." 462 U.S., at 420, n. 1. See, e. g., <i>Planned
Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52 (1976); <i>Bellotti
v. Baird,</i> 428 U.S. 132 (1976); <i>Beal v. Doe,</i> 432 U.S. 438 (1977);
<i>Maher v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464 (1977); <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i>
439 U.S. 379 (1979); <i>Bellotti v. Baird,</i> 443 U.S. 622 (1979); <i>Harris
v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297 (1980); <i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive
Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416 (1983); <i>Thornburgh v. American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747 (1986).<p>

<h2>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<h3>WEBSTER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, ET AL<br>
v<br>
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL</h3>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.<p>

No. 88-605. Argued April 26, 1989 -- Decided July 3, 1989<p>
</center>

JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.<p>

Having joined Part II-C of the Court's opinion, I shall not comment on &#167;
188.205 of the Missouri statute. With respect to the challenged portions of
&#167;&#167;188.210 and 188.215, I agree with Justice Blackmun, <i>ante</i>,
at 539-541, n. 1
(concurring in part and dissenting in part), that the record identifies a
sufficient number of unconstitutional applications to support the Court of
Appeals' judgment invalidating those provisions. The reasons why I would also
affirm that court's invalidation of &#167;188.029, the viability testing
provision, and &#167;&#167;1.205.1(1), (2) of the
preamble,<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> require separate explanation.<p>

<h2 align=center>I</h2>

It seems to me that in Part II-D of its opinion, the plurality strains to
place a construction on &#167;188.029<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a>  that
enables [*561] it to conclude: "[W]e would modify and narrow <i>Roe</i>
and succeeding cases," <i>ante</i>, at 521. That
statement is ill advised because there is no need to modify even
slightly the holdings of prior cases in order to uphold &#167;188.029. For the
most plausible nonliteral construction, as both Justice Blackmun, <i>ante</i>,
at 542-544 (concurring in part and dissenting in part), and Justice O'Connor,
<i>ante</i>, at 525-531 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment), have
demonstrated, is constitutional and entirely consistent with our precedents.<p>

I am unable to accept Justice O'Connor's construction of the second sentence
in &#167;188.029, however, because I believe it is foreclosed by two
controlling
principles of statutory interpretation. First, it is our settled practice to
accept "the interpretation of state law in which the District Court and the
Court of Appeals have concurred even if an examination of the state-law issue
without such guidance might have justified a different conclusion." <i>Bishop
v. Wood,</i> 426 U.S. 341, 346 (1976).<a href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Second,
"[t]he fact that a particular
application of the clear terms of a statute might be unconstitutional does not
provide us with a justification for ignoring the plain meaning of the statute."
<i>Public Citizen v. Department of Justice,</i> 491 U.S. 440, 481 (1989)
(Kennedy, J.,
concurring [*562] in judgment).<a href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In this case,
I agree with the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d 1071, 1074-1075 (CA8 1988), and
the District Court, 662 F. Supp. 407, 423 (WD Mo. 1987), that the meaning of
the second sentence of &#167;188.029 is too plain to be ignored. The sentence
twice uses the mandatory term "shall," and contains no qualifying language. If
it is implicitly limited to tests that are useful in determining viability, it
adds nothing to the requirement imposed by the preceding sentence.<p>

My interpretation of the plain language is supported by the structure of the
statute as a whole, particularly the preamble, which "finds" that life "begins
at conception" and further commands that state laws shall be construed to
provide the maximum protection to "the unborn child at every stage of
development." Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167;1.205.1(1), 1.205.2 (1986). I agree
with the
District Court that "[o]bviously, the purpose of this law is to protect the
potential life of the fetus, rather than to safeguard maternal health." 662 F.
Supp., at 420. A literal reading of the statute tends to accomplish that goal.
Thus it is not "incongruous," <i>ante</i>, at 515, to assume that the Missouri
Legislature was trying to protect the potential human life of nonviable fetuses
by making the abortion decision more costly.<a href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> On
the contrary, I am satisfied
that the Court of Appeals, as well as the District Court, correctly concluded
that the Missouri Legislature meant exactly what it said in the second sentence
of &#167;188.029. I am also satisfied, [*563] for the reasons stated by
Justice Blackmun, that the testing provision is manifestly unconstitutional
under <i>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co.,</i> 348 U.S. 483 (1955), "irrespective
of the <i>Roe</i> [<i>v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113 (1973),] framework."
<i>Ante</i>, at 544 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).<p>

<h2 align=center>II</h2>

The Missouri statute defines "conception" as "the fertilization of the ovum
of a female by a sperm of a male," Mo. Rev. Stat. &#167;188.015(3) (1986),
even though standard medical texts equate "conception" with implantation in
the uterus, occurring about six days after
fertilization.<a href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Missouri's declaration
therefore implies regulation not only of previability abortions, but also of
common forms of contraception such as the IUD and the morning-after
pill.<a href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Because the preamble, read in context, threatens serious encroachments upon the
liberty of the pregnant woman and the health professional, I am
persuaded that these plaintiffs, appellees before us, have [*564] standing
to challenge its constitutionality. Accord, 851 F. 2d, at 1075-1076.<p>

To the extent that the Missouri statute interferes with contraceptive
choices, I have no doubt that it is unconstitutional under the Court's holdings
in <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479 (1965); <i>Eisenstadt v.
Baird,</i> 405 U.S. 438 (1972); and <i>Carey v. Population Services
International,</i> 431 U.S. 678 (1977). The place of <i>Griswold</i>
in the mosaic of decisions defining a woman's liberty
interest was accurately stated by Justice Stewart in his concurring opinion in
<i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 167-170 (1973):<p>

"[I]n <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U.S. 479, the Court held a
Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so
recently said in
<i>[Ferguson v.] Skrupa,</i> [372 U.S. 726 (1963),] the Court's opinion in
<i>Griswold</i> understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due
Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet, the Connecticut law did
not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor any other specific
provision of the Constitution. So it was clear to me then, and it is
equally clear to me now, that the <i>Griswold</i> decision can be rationally
understood
only as a holding that the Connecticut statute substantively invaded the
'liberty' that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. As so understood, <i>Griswold</i> stands as one in a long line of
pre-<i>Skrupa</i> cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process,
and I now accept it as such.<p>

...<p>

"Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice
in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Loving v. Virginia,</i> 388
U.S. 1, 12 [(1967)]; <i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> <i>supra</i>; <i>Pierce
v. Society of Sisters,</i> [268 U.S. 510 (1925)]; <i>Meyer v. Nebraska,</i>
[262 U.S. 390 (1923)]. See also [*565] <i>Prince v. Massachusetts,</i>
321 U.S. 158, 166 [(1944)]; <i>Skinner v. Oklahoma,</i> 316 U.S. 535, 541
[(1942)]. As recently as last Term, in <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</i>
405 U.S. 438, 453 [(1972)], we recognized 'the right of the individual,
married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into
matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or
beget a child.' That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide
whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. 'Certainly the interests of a woman
in giving of her physical and emotional self during pregnancy and the interests
that will be affected throughout her life by the birth and raising of a child
are of a far greater degree of significance and personal intimacy than the
right to send a child to private school protected in <i>Pierce v. Society of 
Sisters,</i> 268 U.S. 510 (1925), or the right to teach a foreign language
protected in <i>Meyer v. Nebraska,</i> 262 U.S. 390 (1923).' <i>Abele v.
Markle,</i> 351 F. Supp. 224, 227 (Conn. 1972).<p>

"Clearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the right
asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty protected by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." (Emphasis in
original; footnotes omitted.)<a href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a><p>

One might argue that the <i>Griswold</i> holding applies to devices "preventing
conception," 381 U.S., at 480 -- that is, fertilization -- but not to those
preventing implantation, and therefore, that <i>Griswold</i> does not protect a
woman's choice to use an IUD or take a morning-after pill. There is
unquestionably [*566] a theological basis for such an
argument,<a href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> just as there was unquestionably a
theological basis for the Connecticut statute that the Court invalidated in
<i>Griswold</i>. Our jurisprudence, however, has consistently
required a
secular basis for valid legislation. See, e. g., <i>Stone v. Graham,</i>
449 U.S. 39, 40 (1980) (per curiam).<a href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Because I
am not aware of any secular
basis for differentiating between contraceptive procedures that are effective
immediately before and those that are effective immediately after
fertilization, I believe it inescapably follows that the preamble to the
Missouri statute is invalid under <i>Griswold</i> and its progeny.<p>

Indeed, I am persuaded that the absence of any secular purpose
for the legislative declarations that life begins at conception and that
conception occurs at fertilization makes the relevant portion of the preamble
invalid under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal
Constitution. This conclusion does not, and could not, rest on the fact that
the statement happens to coincide with the tenets of certain religions, see
<i>McGowan v. Maryland,</i> 366 U.S. 420, 442 (1961); <i>Harris v. McRae,</i>
448 U.S. 297, 319-320 (1980), or on the fact that the legislators who voted to
enact it may have been motivated by religious considerations, see <i>Washington
v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 253 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring). Rather, it
rests on the fact
that the preamble, an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet of some but
by no means all Christian faiths,<a href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> serves no
identifiable [*567] secular
purpose. That fact alone compels a conclusion that the statute violates the
Establishment Clause.<a href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> <i>Wallace v.
Jaffree,</i> 472 U.S. 38, 56 (1985).<p>

My concern can best be explained by reference to the position on this issue
that was widely accepted by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church for many
years. The position is summarized in a report, entitled "Catholic Teaching On
Abortion," prepared by the Congressional Research Service of the
Library of Congress. It states in part:<p>

"The disagreement over the status of the unformed as against the formed fetus
was crucial for Christian teaching on the soul. It was widely held that the
soul was not present until the formation of the fetus 40 or 80 days after
conception,
for males and females respectively. Thus, abortion of the 'unformed' or
'inanimate' fetus (from anima, soul) was something less than true homicide,
rather a form of anticipatory or quasi-homicide. This view received its
definitive treatment in St. Thomas Aquinas and became for a time the dominant
interpretation in the Latin Church.<p>

...<p>

"For St. Thomas, as for mediaeval Christendom generally, there is a lapse of
time -- approximately 40 to 80 days -- after conception and before the soul's
infusion. ...<p>

"For St. Thomas, 'seed and what is not seed is determined by sensation and
movement.' What is destroyed in abortion of the unformed fetus is seed, not
man.
This distinction received its most careful analysis in St. Thomas. It was the
general belief of Christendom, reflected, [*568] for example, in the Council
of Trent (1545-1563), which restricted penalties for homicide to abortion of an
animated fetus only." C. Whittier, Catholic Teaching on Abortion: Its Origin
and Later Development (1981), reprinted in Brief for Americans United for
Separation of Church and State as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 13a, 17a (quoting <i>In
octo libros politicorum</i> 7.12, attributed to St. Thomas Aquinas).<p>

If the views of St. Thomas were held as widely today as they were in the Middle
Ages, and if a state legislature were to enact a statute prefaced with a
"finding" that female life begins 80 days after conception and male life begins
40 days after conception, I have no doubt that this Court would promptly
conclude that such an endorsement of a particular religious tenet is violative
of the Establishment Clause.<p>

In my opinion the difference between that hypothetical statute and Missouri's
preamble reflects nothing more than a difference in theological doctrine. The
preamble to the Missouri statute endorses the theological position that there
is the same secular interest in preserving the life of a fetus during the first
40 or 80 days of pregnancy as there is after viability -- indeed, after the
time when the fetus has become a "person" with legal rights protected by
the Constitution.<a href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> To sustain that
position as a matter of law, I
believe  Missouri has the burden of identifying the secular interests that
differentiate the first 40 days of pregnancy from the period immediately
[*569] before or after fertilization when, as <i>Griswold</i> and related
cases establish, the Constitution allows the use of contraceptive procedures to
prevent potential life from developing into full personhood. Focusing our
attention on the first several weeks of pregnancy is especially appropriate
because that is the period when the vast majority of abortions are actually
performed.<p>

As a secular matter, there is an obvious difference between the state
interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in
protecting a 9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. There
can be no interest in protecting the newly fertilized egg from physical pain or
mental anguish, because the capacity for such suffering does not yet exist;
respecting a developed fetus, however, that interest is valid. In fact, if one
prescinds the theological concept of ensoulment -- or one accepts St. Thomas
Aquinas' view that ensoulment does not occur for at least 40 days -- a State
has no greater secular interest in protecting the potential life of an embryo
that is still "seed" than in protecting the potential life of a sperm or an
unfertilized ovum.<p>

There have been times in history when military and economic interests would
have been served by an increase in population. No one argues today, however,
that Missouri can assert a societal interest in increasing its population as
its secular reason for fostering potential life. Indeed, our national policy,
as reflected in legislation the Court upheld last Term, is to prevent the
potential life that is produced by "pregnancy and childbirth among unmarried
adolescents." <i>Bowen v. Kendrick,</i> 487 U.S. 589, 593 (1988); accord,
<i>id.</i>, at 602.
If the secular analysis were based on a strict balancing of fiscal costs and
benefits, the economic costs of unlimited childbearing would outweigh those of
abortion. There is, of course, an important and unquestionably valid secular
interest in "protecting a young pregnant woman from the consequences of an
incorrect decision," <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428
U.S. 52, 102 (1976) [*570] (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part). Although that interest is served by a requirement that the woman
receive medical and, in appropriate circumstances, parental,
advice,<a href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> it does not justify the
state legislature's official endorsement  of the theological tenet
embodied in &#167;&#167;1.205.1(1), (2).<p>

The State's suggestion that the "finding" in the preamble to its abortion
statute is, in effect, an amendment to its tort, property, and criminal laws is
not persuasive. The Court of Appeals concluded that the preamble "is simply an
impermissible state adoption of a theory of when life begins to justify its
abortion regulations." 851 F. 2d, at 1076. Supporting that construction is the
state constitutional prohibition against legislative enactments pertaining to
more than one subject matter. Mo. Const., Art. 3, &#167;23. See <i>In
re Ray,</i> 83 B. R. 670 (Bkrtcy Ct., ED Mo. 1988); <i>Berry
v. Majestic Milling Co.,</i> 223 S. W. 738 (Mo.
1920). Moreover, none of the tort, property, or criminal law cases cited by the
State was either based on or buttressed by a theological answer to the question
of when life begins. Rather, the Missouri courts, as well as a number of other
state courts, had already concluded that a "fetus is a 'person,' 'minor,' or
'minor child' within the meaning of their particular wrongful death statutes."
[*571] <i>O'Grady v. Brown,</i> 654 S. W. 2d 904, 910 (Mo. 1983) (<i>en
banc</i>).<a href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a><p>

Bolstering my conclusion that the preamble violates the First Amendment is
the fact that the intensely divisive character of much of the national debate
over the abortion issue reflects the deeply held religious convictions of many
participants in the debate.<a href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Missouri
Legislature may not inject its
endorsement of a particular religious tradition into this debate, for "[t]he
Establishment Clause does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement."
See <i>County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater
Pittsburgh Chapter,</i> <i>post,</i> at 651 (Stevens, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part).<p>

In my opinion the preamble to the Missouri statute is unconstitutional for
two reasons. To the extent that it has substantive impact on the freedom
to use contraceptive procedures, it is inconsistent with the central
holding in <i>Griswold</i>. To the extent that it merely makes "legislative
findings
without operative effect," as the State argues, Brief for Appellants 22, it
violates the Establishment Clause of the First [*572] Amendment. Contrary to
the theological "finding" of the Missouri Legislature, a woman's
constitutionally protected liberty encompasses the right to act on her own
belief that -- to paraphrase St. Thomas Aquinas -- until a seed has acquired
the powers of sensation and movement, the life of a human being has not yet
begun.<a href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a><p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<a name="f1"></a>1.  The State prefers to refer to subsections (1) and (2) of
&#167;1.205.1 as "prefatory statements with no substantive effect." Brief for
Appellants 9; see <i>id.</i>, at 21; see also 851 F. 2d 1071, 1076 (CA8 1988).
It is true that &#167;1.205 is
codified in Chapter 1, Laws in Force and Construction of Statutes, of Title I,
Laws and Statutes, of the Missouri Revised Statutes, while all other
provisions at issue are codified in Chapter 188, Regulation of Abortions, of
Title XII, Public Health and Welfare. But because &#167;1.205 appeared at the
beginning of House Bill No. 1596, see <i>ante</i>, at 500-501, it is entirely
appropriate to consider it as a preamble relevant to those regulations.<p>

<a name="f2"></a>2.  The testing provision states:
"188.029. Physician, determination of viability, duties<p>

"Before a physician performs an abortion on a woman he has reason to believe
is carrying an unborn child of twenty or more weeks gestational age, the
physician shall first determine if the unborn child is viable by using and
exercising that degree of care, skill, and proficiency commonly exercised by
the ordinarily skillful, careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar
practice under the same or similar conditions. In making this determination of
viability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such medical
examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational
age, weight, and
lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings and
determination of viability in the medical record of the mother." Mo. Rev. Stat.
&#167;188.029 (1986).<p>

<a name="f3"></a>3. See also <i>United States v. Durham Lumber Co.,</i> 363
U.S. 522, 526-527 (1960); <i>Propper v. Clark,</i> 337 U.S. 472, 486-487
(1949); <i>Hillsborough v. Cromwell,</i> 326 U.S. 620, 630 (1946);

v. State Mutual Life Ins. Co.,</i> 315 U.S. 280, 281 (1942) (<i>per
curiam</i>).<p>

<a name="f4"></a>4.  We have stated that we will interpret a federal statute to
avoid serious constitutional problems if "a reasonable alternative
interpretation poses no constitutional question," <i>Gomez
v. United States,</i> 490 U.S. 858, 864 (1989), or
if "it is fairly possible to interpret the statute in a manner that renders it
constitutionally valid," <i>Communications Workers v. Beck,</i>
487 U.S. 735, 762 (1988), or "unless such construction is plainly contrary to
the intent of Congress," <i>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building and Construction Trades Council,</i> 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988).<p>

<a name="f5"></a>5.  As with the testing provision, the plurality opts for a
construction of
this statute that conflicts with those of the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d, at
1076-1077, and the District Court, 662 F. Supp. 407, 413 (WD Mo. 1987).<p>

<a name="f6"></a>6.  The fertilized egg remains in the woman's Fallopian tube
for 72 hours, then travels to the uterus' cavity, where cell division continues
for another 72 hours before implantation in the uterine wall. D. Mishell &amp;
V. Davajan, Infertility, Contraception and Reproductive Endocrinology 109-110
(2d ed. 1986); see also Brief for Association of Reproductive Health
Professionals et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 31-32 (ARHP Brief) (citing,
<i>inter alia,</i> J. Pritchard, P. MacDonald, &amp; N. Gant, Williams
Obstetrics 88-91 (17th ed. 1985)). "[O]nly 50 per cent of
fertilized ova ultimately become implanted." ARHP Brief 32, n. 25 (citing Post
Coital Contraception, The Lancet 856 (Apr. 16, 1983)).<p>

<a name="f7"></a>7.  An intrauterine device, commonly called an IUD, "works
primarily by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting." Burnhill,
Intrauterine Contraception, in Fertility Control 271, 280 (S. Corson, R.
Derman, &amp; L. Tyrer
eds. 1985). See also 21 CFR &#167;801.427, p. 32 (1988); ARHP Brief 34-35.
Other contraceptive methods that may prevent implantation include
"morning-after pills," high-dose estrogen pills taken after intercourse,
particularly in cases
of rape, ARHP Brief 33, and the French RU 486, a pill that works "during the
indeterminate period between contraception and abortion," <i>id.</i>, at 37.
Low-level estrogen "combined" pills -- a version of the ordinary, daily
ingested birth control pill -- also may prevent the fertilized egg from
reaching the uterine wall and implanting. <i>Id.</i>, at 35-36.<p>

<a name="f8"></a>8.  The contrast between Justice Stewart's careful explication
that our
abortion precedent flowed naturally from a stream of substantive due process
cases and Justice Scalia's notion that our abortion law was "constructed
overnight in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>," <i>ante</i>, at 537 (concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), is remarkable.<p>

<a name="f9"></a>9.  Several <i>amici</i> state that the "sanctity of human
life from conception and opposition to abortion are, in fact, sincere and
deeply held religious beliefs," Brief for Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod et al.
as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 20 (on behalf of
49 "church denominations"); see Brief for Holy Orthodox Church as <i>Amicus
Curiae</i> 12-14.<p>

<a name="f10"></a>10.  The dissent in Stone did not dispute this proposition;
rather, it argued that posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls has a
secular purpose. 449 U.S., at 43-46 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<p>

<a name="f11"></a>11.  See, e. g., Brief for Catholics for a Free Choice et al.
as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 5 ("There is no constant teaching in Catholic theology
on the commencement of personhood").<p>

<a name="f12"></a>12.  Pointing to the lack of consensus about life's onset
among experts in medicine, philosophy, and theology, the Court in <i>Roe
v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 158, 162 (1973), established that the Constitution
does not permit a State to adopt a theory of life that overrides a pregnant
woman's rights. Accord, <i>Akron v. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416, 444 (1983). The
constitutional violation is doubly grave if, as here, the only basis for the
State's "finding" is nonsecular.<p>

<a name="f13"></a>13.  No Member of this Court has ever questioned the holding
in <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S., at 156-159, that a fetus is not a "person" within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Even the dissenters in <i>Roe</i>
implicitly endorsed that holding by arguing that state legislatures should
decide whether to prohibit or to
authorize abortions. See <i>id.</i>, at 177 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)
(arguing that
the Fourteenth Amendment did not "withdraw from the States the power to
legislate with respect to this matter"); <i>Doe v. Bolton,</i> 410 U.S. 179,
222 (1973) (White, J., dissenting jointly in <i>Doe</i>
and <i>Roe</i>). By characterizing the basic
question as "a political issue," see <i>ante</i>, at 535 (concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), Justice Scalia likewise implicitly accepts this
holding.<p>

<a name="f14"></a>14.  "The Court recognizes that the State may insist that the
decision not be
made without the benefit of medical advice. But since the most significant
consequences of the decision are not medical in character, it would seem to me
that the State may, with equal legitimacy, insist that the decision be made
only after other appropriate counsel has been had as well. Whatever choice a
pregnant young woman makes -- to marry, to abort, to bear her child out of
wedlock -- the
consequences of her decision may have a profound impact on her entire future
life. A legislative determination that such a choice will be made more wisely
in most cases if the advice and moral support of a parent play a part in the
decisionmaking process is surely not irrational. Moreover, it is perfectly clear
that the parental-consent requirement will necessarily involve a parent in the
decisional process." <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428
U.S., at 103 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<p>

<a name="f15"></a>15.  The other examples cited by the State are statutes
providing that unborn children are to be treated as though born within the
lifetime of the decedent,
see Uniform Probate Code &#167;2-108 (1969), and statutes imposing criminal
sanctions in the nature of manslaughter for the killing of a viable fetus or
unborn quick child, see, e. g., Ark. Stat. Ann. &#167;41-2223 (1947). None of
the cited statutes included any "finding" on the theological question of when
life begins.<p>

<a name="f16"></a>16.  No fewer than 67 religious organizations submitted their
views as <i>amici curiae</i> on either side of this case. Amici briefs on both
sides, moreover,
frankly discuss the relation between the abortion controversy and religion. See
generally, e. g., Brief for Agudath Israel of America as <i>Amicus Curiae</i>,
Brief for Americans United for Separation of Church and State et al. as
<i>Amici Curiae,</i>
Brief for Catholics for a Free Choice et al. as <i>Amici Curiae,</i>
Brief for Holy Orthodox Church as <i>Amicus Curiae</i>, Brief for Lutheran
Church-Missouri Synod et
al. as <i>Amici Curiae,</i> Brief for Missouri Catholic Conference as <i>Amicus
Curiae</i>.<p>

Cf. Burke, Religion and Politics in the United States, in Movements and Issues
in World Religions 243, 254-256 (C. Fu &amp; G. Spiegler eds. 1987).<p>

<a name="f17"></a>17.  "Just as the right to speak and the right to refrain
from speaking are
complementary components of a broader concept of individual freedom of mind, so
also the individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his
right to refrain from accepting the creed established by the majority. At one
time it was thought that this right merely proscribed the preference of one
Christian sect over another, but would not require equal respect for the
conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian
faith such as Islam or Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been
examined in
the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously concluded that the
individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the
right to select any religious faith or none at all. This conclusion derives
support not only from the interest in respecting the individual's freedom of
conscience, but also from the conviction that religious beliefs worthy of
respect are the product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful, and from
recognition of the fact that the political interest in forestalling intolerance
extends beyond intolerance among Christian sects -- or even intolerance among
'religions' -- to encompass intolerance of the disbeliever and the uncertain.
As Justice Jackson eloquently stated in <i>West Virginia Board of Education v.
Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943):<p>

"'If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that
no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,
nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess
by word or act their faith therein.'
"The State . . ., no less than the Congress of the United States, must respect
that basic truth." <i>Wallace v. Jaffree,</i> 472 U.S. 38, 52-55 (1985)
(footnotes omitted).<p>

Justice STEVENS announced the judgment of the Court and delivered
an opinion, in which Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and
Justice POWELL join.<p>

This case presents the question whether certain regulations governing the provision
of health care to handicapped infants are
authorized by  504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973. That section provides, in part:<p>

''No otherwise qualified handicapped individual ... shall, solely by reason of
his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance." 87 Stat. 394, 29 U.S.C.  794.<sup>1</sup><p>

<h2 align=center>I</h2>

The American Medical Association, the
American Hospital Association, and several
other respondents<sup>2</sup> challenge the validity
of Final Rules promulgated on January 12,
1984, by the Secretary of the Department
of Health and Human Services.<sup>3</sup> These
Rules establish "Procedures relating to
health care for handicapped infants," and
in particular require the posting of informational notices, authorize expedited
access to records and expedited compliance
actions, and command state child protective
services agencies to "prevent instances of
unlawful medical neglect of handicapped
infants." 45 CFR  84.55 (1985).<p>

Although the Final Rules comprise six parts, only the four mandatory components
are challenged here.<sup>4</sup> Subsection (b) is
entitled "Posting of informational notice" and requires every "recipient health care
provider that provides health care services
to infants in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance" -- a
group to which we refer generically as "hospitals" -- to post an informational
notice in one of two approved forms. 45 CFR
 84.55(b) (1985). Both forms include a
statement that  504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap, and indicate
that because of this prohibition "nourishment and medically beneficial treatment (as
determined with respect for reasonable
medical judgments) should not be withheld
from handicapped infants solely on the basis of their present or anticipated mental or
physical impairments." 45 CFR  84.55(b)(3), (4) (1985). The notice's statement
of the legal requirement does not distinguish between medical care for which
parental consent has been obtained and that for which it has not. The notice must
identify the telephone number of the appropriate child protective services agency and,
in addition, a toll-free number for the Department that is available 24 hours a day.
<i>lbid.</i> Finally, the notice must state that the "identity of callers will be kept
confidential" and that federal law prohibits retaliation "against any person who provides
information about possible violations." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

Subsection (c), which contains the second
mandatory requirement, sets forth "Responsibilities of recipient state child
protective services agencies." Subsection (c)
does not mention  504 (or any other federal statute) and does not even use the word
"discriminate." It requires every designated agency to establish and maintain
procedures to ensure that "the agency utilizes
its full authority pursuant to state law to
prevent instances of unlawful medical neglect of handicapped infants." 45 CFR
 84.55(c)(1). Mandated procedures must include (1) "[a] requirement that health
care providers report on a timely basis ... known or suspected instances of unlawful
medical neglect of handicapped infants,"  84.55(c)(1)(i); (2) a method by which the
state agency can receive timely reports of
such cases,  84.55(c)(1)(ii); (3) "immediate" review of those reports,
including "on-site investigation," where appropriate,  84.55(c)I1)(iii); (4)
protection of
"medically neglected handicapped infants" including, where appropriate, legal
action to secure "timely cour order[s] to comple the provision of necessary
nourishment andmedical treatment,"  84.55(c)I1)(iv); and (5) "[t]imely notification"
to HHS of every report of "suspected unlawful medical neglect" of handicapped
infants. The preamble to the Final Rules makes clear that this subsection applies
"where a refusal to provide medically beneficial treatment is a result, not of
decisions by a health care provider, but of decisions by parents." 49 Fed. Reg.
1627 (1984).<p>

The two remaining mandated regulations authorize "[e]xpedited access to
records" and "[e]xpedited action to effect compliance." 45 CFR  84.55(d),
(e) (1985). Subsection (d) likewise dispenses with otherwise applicable
requirements of notice to the hospital "when, in the judgment of the
responsible Department official, immediate action to effect compliance is
necessary to protect the life or health of a handicapped individual."  84.55(e).
The expedited comliance provision is intended to allow "the government
[to[ see[k] a temporary restraining order to sustain the life of a
handicapped infant in imminent danger of death." 49 Fed.Reg. 1628 (1984).
Like the provision affording expedited access to records, it applies without
regard to whether parental consent to treatment has been withheld or
whether the matter has already been referred to a state child protective
agency.<p>

<h2 align=center>II</h2>

The Final Rules represent the Secretary's ultimate response to an April 9,
1982, incident in which the parents of a Bloomington, Indiana, infant with
Down's syndrome and other handicaps refused consent to surgery to remove
an esophageal obstruction that prevented oral feeding. On April 10, the
hospital initiated judicial proceedings to override the parents' decision, but
an Indiana trial court, after holding a hearing the same evening, denied the
requested relief. On April 12 the court asked the local Child Protection
Committee to review its decision. After conducting its own hearing, the
Committee found no reason to disagree with the court's ruling.<sup>5</sup>
The infant died six days after its birth.<p>

Citing "heightened public concern" in the aftermath of the Bloomington Baby
Doe incident, on May 18, 1982, the director of the Department's Office of
Civil Rights, in response to a directive from the President, "remind[ed]" health
care providers receiving federal financial assistance that newborn infants
with handicaps such as Down's syndrome were protected by  504.
47 Fed.Reg. 26027 (1982).<sup>6</sup>

This notice was followed, on March 7, 1983, by an "Interim Final Rule"
contemplating a "vigorous federal role." 48 Fed.
Reg. 9630. The Interim Rule required
health care providers receiving federal financial assistance to post "in a conspicuous
place in each delivery ward, each maternity
ward, each pediatric ward, and each nursery, including each intensive care
nursery" a notice advising of the applicability of  504 and the availability of a telephone
"hotline" to report suspected violations of the law to HHS. Id, at 9631. Like the
Final Rules, the Interim Rule also provided for expedited compliance actions and
expedited access to records and facilities when,
"in the judgment of the responsible Department official," immediate action or access
was "necessary to protect the life or health
of a handicapped individual." <i>Id.,</i> at 9632.
The Interim Rule took effect on March 22.<p>

On April 6, 1983, respondents American
Hospital Association et al. filed a complaint
in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a
declaration that the Interim Final Rule was invalid
and an injunction against its enforcement.
Little more than a week later, on April 14,
in a similar challenge brought by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other
medical institutions, the Federal District Court
for the District of Columbia declared the
Interim Final Rule "arbitrary and capricious and promulgated in violation of the
Administrative Procedure Act." <i>American Academy of Pediatrics v. Heckler,</i> 561
F.Supp. 395, 404 (1983).  The District
Judge in that case "conclude[d] that haste
and inexperience ha[d] resulted in agency
action based on inadequate consideration"
of several relevant concerns and, in the
alternative, found that the Secretary had
improperly failed to solicit public comment
before issuing the Rule. <i>Id,</i> at 899-401.<p>

On July 6, 1983, the Department issued
new "Proposed Rules" on which it invited
comment. Like the Interim Final Rule, the
Proposed Rules required hospitals to post
informational notices in conspicuous places
and authorized expedited access to records
to be followed, if necessary, by expedited
compliance action. 48 Fed.Reg. 30851. In
a departure from the Interim Final Rule,
however, the Proposed Rules required federally assisted state child protective
services agencies to utilize their "full authority
pursuant to State law to prevent instances
of medical neglect of handicapped infants."
<i>Ibid.</i> Mandated procedures mirrored those
contained in the Final Rules described
above. <i>Ibid.</i> The preamble and appendix
to the Proposed Rules did not acknowledge
that hospitals and physicians lack authority
to perform treatment to which parents
have not given their consent.<sup>7</sup><p>

After the period for notice and comment had passed, HHS, on December 30,
1983, promulgated the Final Rules and announced that they would take effect on
February 13, 1984. On March 12 of that
year respondents American Hospital Association et al. amended their complaint and
respondents American Medical Association
et al. filed suit to declare the new regulations invalid and to enjoin their
enforcement. The actions were consolidated in the
Federal District Court for the Southern
District of New York, which awarded the
requested relief on the authority of the
decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
<i>United States v. University Hospital,</i> 729 F.2d
144 (1984). <i>American Hospital Assn. v. Heckler,</i> 586 F.Supp. 541 (1984); App. to
Pet. for Cert. 50a. On appeal, the parties
agreed that the reasoning of the Court of
Appeals in University Hospital, if valid,
required a judgment against the Government in this case.<sup>8</sup>
In accordance with its earlier decision, the Court of Appeals summarily
affirmed the District Court. 694 F.2d 676 (1984). Since the judgment here
thus rests entirely on the reasoning of
<i>University Hospital,</i> it is appropriate to
examine that case now.<p>

<h2 align=center>III</h2>

On October 11, 1983, after the Department's Interim Final Rule had been
declared invalid but before it had promulgated the Final Rules challenged here, a
child with multiple congenital defects
known as "Baby Jane Doe" was born in
Long Island, New York, and was
promptly transferred to University Hospital for corrective surgery. After
consulting with physicians and other advisers, the
parents decided to forgo corrective surgery
that was likely to prolong the child's life,
but would not improve many of her handicapping conditions.<p>

On October 16, 1983, an unrelated attorney named Washburn filed suit in the New
York Supreme Court, seeking the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the infant
who would direct the hospital to perform the corrective surgery. The trial court
granted that relief on October 20, but was
reversed the following day by the Appellate Division which found that the
"concededly concerned and loving parents" had
"chosen one course of appropriate medical
treatment over another" and made an informed decision that was "in the best
interest of the infant." <i>Weber v. Stony Brook
Hospital,</i> 95 A.D.2d 587, 589, 467 N.Y.S.2d
685, 687 (<i>per curiam</i>). On October 28, the
New York Court of Appeals affirmed, but
on the ground that the trial court should
not have entertained a petition to initiate
child neglect proceedings by a stranger
who had not requested the aid of the responsible state agency. <i>Weber v. Stony
Brook Hospital,</i> 60 N.Y.2d 208, 211-213,
456 N.E.2d 1186, 1187-1188 (<i>per curiam</i>).<p>

While the state proceedings were in progress, on October 19, HHS received a
complaint from a "private citizen" that Baby Jane Doe was being discriminatorily
denied medically indicated treatment. HHS promptly referred this complaint to
the New York State Child Protective Service. (The agency investigated the charge
of medical neglect and soon thereafter concluded that there was no cause for state
intervention.) In the meantime, before the
State Child Protective Service could act,
HHS on October 22, 1983, made repeated
requests of the hospital to make its records
available for inspection in order to determine whether the hospital was in
compliance with  504. The hospital refused the
requests and advised HHS that the parents had not consented to a release of the
records.<p>

Subsequently, on November 2, 1983, the
Government filed suit in Federal District
Court invoking its general authority to enforce  504 and 45 CFR  84.61 (1985), a
regulation broadly authorizing access to information necessary to ascertain
compliance. The District Court allowed the parents to intervene as defendants, expedited
the proceeding, and ruled against the
Government. It reasoned that the Government had no right of access to information
because the record clearly established that
the hospital had not violated the statute.
<i>United States v. University Hospital, State Univ. of N.Y. at Stony Brook,</i> 575
F.Supp. 607, 614 (EDNY). Since the uncontradicted evidence established that the
hospital "ha[d] at all times been willing to perform the surgical procedures in
question, if only the parents ... would consent," the hospital "failed to perform the
surgical procedures in question, not because Baby Jane Doe [wa]s handicapped,
but because her parents ha[d] refused to consent." <i>Ibid</i><p>

The Court of Appeals affirmed. In an opinion handed down on February 23, 1984,
six weeks after promulgation of the Final
Rules, it agreed with the District Court
that "an agency is not entitled to information sought in an investigation that
'over-reaches the authority Congress has given."' 729 F 2d, at 150 (quoting
<i>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling,</i> 327 U.S.
186, 217, 66 S.Ct. 494, 510, 90 L.Ed. 614
(1946)). It further held that although Baby
Jane Doe was a "handicapped individual,"
she was not "otherwise qualified" within
the meaning of  504 because "where
medical treatment is at issue, it is typically
the handicap itself that gives rise to, or at
least contributes to the need for services";
as a result "the 'otherwise qualified' criterion of section 504 cannot be meaningfully
applied to a medical treatment decision."
729 F.2d, at 156. For the same reason, the
Court of Appeals rejected the Government's argument that Baby Jane Doe had
been "subjected to discrimination" under
 504: "Where the handicapping condition is related to the condition(s) to be
treated, it will rarely, if ever, be possible to
say with certainty that a particular decision
was 'discriminatory'." <i>Id,</i> at 157. The
diffieulty of applying  504 to individual
medical treatment decisions confirmed the
Court of Appeals in its view that "[C]ongress never contemplated that section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act would apply to
treatment decisions involving defective
newborn infants when the statute was enacted in 1973, when it was amended in
1974, or at any subsequent time." <i>Id.,</i> at
161. It therefore rejected "the far-reaching position advanced by the government in
this case" and concluded that until Congress had spoken, "it would be an
unwarranted exercise of judicial power to approve
the type of investigation that ha[d] precipitated this lawsuit." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

Judge Winter dissented. He pointed out
that  504 was patterned after  601 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race in federally funded programs, and asserted that a
refusal to provide medical treatment because of a person's handicapping condition
is as clearly covered by  604 as a refusal
based on a person's race is covered by  601:<p>

<blockquote>
"A judgment not to perform certain surgery because a person is black is not a
<i>bona fide</i> medical judgment. So too, a
decision not to correct a life threatening
digestive problem because an infant has
Down's Syndrome is not a <i>bona fide</i>
medical judgment. The issue of parental
authority is also quickly disposed of. A
denial of medical treatment to an infant
because the infant is black is not legitimated by parental consent."
<i>Id,</i> at 162.<p>
</blockquote>

The Government did not file a certiorari
petition in <i>University Hospital.</i> It did,
however, seek review of the judgment in
this case. We granted certiorari, 472 U.S.
1016, 105 S.Ct. 3475, 87 L.Ed.2d 611 (1985),
and we now affirm.<p>

<h2 align=center>IV</h2>

[1-4] The Solicitor General is correct
that "handicapped individual" as used in
 504 includes an infant who is born with a
congenital defect. If such an infant is
"otherwise qualified" for benefits under a
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,  504 protects him from
discrimination "solely by reason of his 
handicap."<sup>9</sup> It follows, under our decision
in <i>Alexander v. Choate,</i> 469 U.S. 287, 301,
105 S.Ct. 712, 720, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985),
that handicapped infants are entitled to
"meaningful access" to medical services
provided by hospitals, and that a hospital
rule or state policy denying or limiting such
access would be subject to challenge under
 504.<p>

However, no such rule or policy is challenged, or indeed has been identified, in
this case. Nor does this case, in contrast
to the <i>University Hospital</i> litigation, involve a claim that any specific individual
treatment decision violates  504. This
suit is not an enforcement action, and as a
consequence it is not necessary to determine whether  504 ever applies to
individual medical treatment decisions involving
handicapped   infants.   Respondents
brought this litigation to challenge the four
mandatory components of the Final Rules
on their face,<sup>10</sup> and the Court of Appeals'
judgment which we review merely affirmed
the judgment of the District Court which
"declared invalid and enjoined enforcement
of [the final] regulations, purportedly
promulgated pursuant to section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  794
(1982)." App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.<sup>11</sup> The
specific question presented by this case,
then, is whether the four mandatory provisions of the Final Rules are authorized by
 504.<p>

<h2 align=center>V</h2>

[5-7] It is an axiom of administrative
law that an agency's explanation of the
basis for its decision must include "a 'rational connection between the facts found
and the choice made.'" <i>Motor Vehicle
Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct.
2856, 2866, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (quoting
<i>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United
States,</i> 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246,
9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962)).<sup>12</sup> Ageney deference
has not come so far that we will uphold
regulations whenever it is possible to "conceive a basis" for administrative action.
To the contrary, the "presumption of
regularity afforded an agency in fulfilling its statutory mandate" is not equivalent
to "the minimum rationality a statute
must bear in order to withstand analysis
under the Due Process Clause." <i>Motor
Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mut.
Automobile Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S., at 43, n. 9,
103 S.Ct., at 2866, n. 9. Thus, the mere
fact that there is "some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the
[regulators]," <i>United States v. Carolene

concluded" that the regulation was necessary to discharge their statutorily
authorized mission, <i>Williamson v. Lee Optical
Co.,</i> 348 U.S. 483, 487, 76 S.Ct. 461, 464, 99
L.Ed. 563 (1965), will not suffice to validate
agency decisionmaking. See <i>Industrial
Union Dept. u American Petroleum

Lines, Inc v. United States,</i> 371 U.S. 166,
169, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962).
Our recognition of Congress' need to vest
administrative agencies with ample power
to assist in the difficult task of governing a
vast and complex industrial Nation carries
with it the correlative responsibility of the
agency to explain the rationale and factual
basis for its decision, even though we show
respect for the agency's judgment in both.<p>

Before examining the Seeretary's reasons for issuing the Final Rules, it is essential to understand the pre-existing state-law framework governing the provision of
medical eare to handicapped infants. In
broad outline, state law vests decisional
responsibility in the parents, in the first
instance, subject to review in exceptional
cases by the State acting as <i>parens
patriae.</i><sup>13</sup> Prior to the regulatory aetivity culminating in the Final Rules, the Federal
Government was not a participant in the
process of making treatment decisions for
newborn infants. We presume that this
general framework was familiar to Congress when it enacted
 504. See <i>Cannon
v. University of Chicago,</i> 441 U.S. 677,
696-697, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1957-1958, 60
L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). It therefore provides
an appropriate background for evaluating
the Secretary's action in this case.<p>

[8] The Secretary has identified two
possible categories of violations of  504 as
justifieations for federal oversight of handicapped infant care. First, he contends
that a hospital's refusal to furnish a handicapped infant with medically beneficial
treatment "solely by reason of his handicap" constitutes unlawful discrimination.
Second, he maintains that a hospital's failure to report cases of suspected medical
neglect to a state child proteetive services agency may
also violate the statute.
We separately eonsider these two possible
bases for the Final Rules.<sup>l4</sup><p>

<h2 align=center>VI</h2>

[9,10] In the immediate aftermath of
the Bloomington Baby Doe incident, the
Secretary apparently proceeded on the assumption that a hospital's statutory duty to
provide treatment to handicapped infants
was unaffected by the absence of parental
consent. See <i>supra,</i> at 2107-2108. He has
since abandoned that view. Thus, the
preamble to the Final Rules correctly
states that when "a non-treatment decision,
no matter how discriminatory, is made by
parents, rather than by the hospital, section 504 does not mandate that the hospital
unilaterally overrule the parental decision
and provide treatment notwithstanding the
lack of consent." 49 Fed.Reg. 1631 (1984).
A hospital's withholding of treatment when
no parental consent has been given cannot
violate  504, for without the consent of
the parents or a surrogate decisionmaker
the infant is neither "otherwise qualified"
for treatment nor has he been denied care
"solely by reason of his handicap."<sup>16</sup>
Indeed, it would almost certainly be a tort as
a matter of state law to operate on an
infant without parental consent. This
analysis makes clear that the Government's
heavy reliance on the analogy to race-based
refusals which violate  601 of the Civil
Rights Act is misplaced. If, pursuant to its
normal practice, a hospital refused to operate on a black child whose parents had
withheld their consent to treatment, the
hospital's refusal would not be based on
the race of the child even if it were assumed that the parents based their decision entirely on a mistaken assumption that the race of the child made the operation inappropriate.<p>

Now that the Secretary has acknowledged that a hospital has no statutory treatment obligation in the absence of
parental consent, it has become clear that the
Final Rules are not needed to prevent hospitals from denying treatment to handicapped infants. The Solicitor General
concedes that the administrative record contains no evidence that hospitals have ever
refused treatment authorized either by the
infant's parents or by a court order. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 8. Even the Secretary never
seriously maintained that posted notices,
"hotlines," and emergency on-site investigations were necessary to process complaints against hospitals that might refuse treatment requested by parents. The parental interest in calling such a refusal to
the attention of the appropriate authorities
adequately vindicates the interest in enforcement of  504 in such cases, just as
that interest obviates the need for a special
regulation to deal with refusals to provide
treatment on the basis of race which may
violate  601 of the Civil Rights Act.<p>

The Secretary's belated recognition of
the effect of parental nonconsent is important, because the supposed need for federal
monitoring of hospitals' treatment decisions rests entirely on instances in which
parents have refused their consent. Thus,
in the Bloomington, Indiana, case that precipitated the Secretary's enforcement efforts in this area,<sup>16</sup> as well as in the
<i>University Hospital</i> case that provided the
basis for the summary affirmance in the
case now before us,<sup>17</sup> the hospital's failure
to perform the treatment at issue rested on
the lack of parental consent. The Secretary's own summaries of these cases establish beyond doubt that the respective hospitals did not withhold medical care on the
basis of handicap and therefore did not
violate  504; as a result, they provide no
support for his claim that federal regulation is needed in order to forestall comparable cases in the future.<p>

The Secretary's initial failure to recognize that withholding of consent by <i>parents</i> does not equate with discriminatory
denial of treatment by <i>hospitals</i> likewise
undermines the Secretary's findings in the
preamble to his proposed rulemaking. In
that statement, the Secretary cited four
sources in support of the claim that "Section 504 [is] not being uniformly followed."
48 Fed.Reg. 30847 (1983). None of the
cited examples, however, suggests that recipients of federal financial assistance, as
opposed to parents, had withheld medical
care on the basis of handicap.<sup>l8</sup><p>

Notwithstanding the ostensible recognition in the preamble of the effect of
parental nonconsent on a hospital's obligation to provide care, in promulgating the
Final Rules the Seeretary persisted in relying on instances in which parents had refused consent to support his claim that,
regardless of its "magnitude," there is sufficient evidence of "illegality" to justify
"establishing basic mechanisms to allow
for effective enforcement of a clearly applicable statute." 49 Fed.Reg. 1645 (1984).
We have already discussed one source of
this evidence -- "the several specific cases
cited in the preamble to the proposed rule."
<i>Ibid.</i> Contrary to the Secretary's belief,
these cases do <i>not</i> "support the proposition
that handicapped infants may be subjected
to unlawful discrimination." <i>Ibid.</i> In addition to the evidence relied on in prior notices, the Secretary included a summary of
the 49 "Infant Doe cases" that the Department had processed before December
1, 1983.<sup>19</sup> Curiously, however, by the Secretary's own admission none of the 49
cases had "resulted in a finding of discriminatory withholding of medical care." <i>Id,</i>
at 1649. In fact, in the entire list of 49
cases there is no finding that a hospital
failed or refused to provide treatment to a
handicapped infant for which parental consent had been given.<sup>20</sup><p>

Notwithstanding this concession, the Secretary "believes three of these cases demonstrate the utility of the procedural mechanisms called for in the final
rules." <i>Ibid.</i> Accord, <i>ibid.</i> ("[T]hese cases
provide additional documentation of the
need for governmental involvement and the
appropriateness of the procedures established by the final rules"). However, these
three cases, which supposedly provide the
strongest support for federal intervention,
fail to disclose any discrimination against
handicapped newborns in violation of
 504. For example, in Robinson, Illinois,
the Department conducted an on-site investigation when it learned that the "hospital
(<i>at the parents' request</i>) failed to perform
necessary surgery." <i>Id,</i> at 1646 (emphasis
added). After "[t]he parents refused consent for surgery," "the hospital referred the matter to state authorities, who accepted custody of the infant and arranged for
surgery and adoption," all "in compliance
with section 504." <i>Ibid.</i> The Secretary
concluded that "the involvement of the
state child protective services agency," at
the behest of the hospital, "was the most
important element in bringing about corrective surgery for the infant. ... Had there
been no <i>governmental</i> involvement in the
case, the outcome might have been much
less favorable." <i>Id.,</i> at 1649 (emphasis
added).<sup>21</sup><p>

The Secretary's second example illustrates with even greater force the effective
and nondiscriminatory functioning of state
mechanisms and the consequent lack of
support for federal intervention. In Daytona Beach, Florida, the Department's hotline
received a complaint of medical neglect of a
handicapped infant; immediate contact
with the hospital and state agency revealed
that "the parents did not consent to surgery" for the infant. <i>Id.,</i> at 1648. Notwithstanding this information, which was
confirmed by both the hospital and the
state agency, and despite the fact that the
state agency had "obtained a court order to
provide surgery" the day before HHS was
notified, the Department conducted an
on-Site investigation. <i>Ibid.</i> In the third
case, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the
Department intervened so soon after birth
that "the decisionmaking process was in
progress at the time the OCR [Office of
Civil Rights] inquiry began," and "it is
impossible to say the surgery would not
have been provided without this involvement." <i>Id.,</i> at 1649. "However," the Secretary added, "the involvement of OCR and
the OCR medical consultant was cooperatively received by the hospital and apparently constructive." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

In sum, there is nothing in the administrative record to justify the Secretary's belief that "discriminatory withholding of
medical care" in violation of  504 provides
any support for federal regulation: In two
of the cases (Robinson, Illinois, and Daytona Beach, Florida), the hospital's refusal
was based on the absence of parental consent, but the parents' decision was overridden by state authorities and the operation
was performed; in the third case (Colorado
Springs, Colorado) it is not clear whether
the parents would have given their consent
or not, but the corrective surgery was in
fact performed.<sup>22</sup><p>

<h2 align=center>VII</h2>

As a backstop to his manifestly incorrect
perception that withholding of treatment in
accordance with parental instructions necessitates federal regulation, the Secretary
contends that a hospital's failure to report
parents' refusals to consent to treatment
violates  504, and that past breaches of
this kind justify federal oversight.<p>

[11, 12] By itself,  504 imposes no
duty to report instances of medical neglect
-- that undertaking derives from state-law
reporting obligations or a hospital's own
voluntary practice. Although a hospital's
selective refusal to report medical neglect
of handicapped infants might violate
 504,<sup>23</sup> the Secretary has failed to point
to any specific evidence that this has occurred. The 49 actual investigations summarized in the preamble to the Final Rules
do not reveal <i>any</i> case in which a hospital
either failed, or was accused of failing, to
make an appropriate report to a state agency.<sup>24</sup> Nor can we accept the Solicitor General's invitation to infer discriminatory
nonreporting from the studies cited in the
Secretary's proposed rulemaking. Even
assuming that cases in which parents have
withheld consent to treatment for handicapped infants have gone unreported, that
fact alone would not prove that the hospitals involved had discriminated on the
basis of handicap rather than simply failed
entirely to discharge their state-law reporting obligations, if any, a matter which lies
wholly outside the nondiscrimination mandate of  504.<p>

[13] The particular reporting mechanism chosen by the Secretary -- indeed the
entire regulatory framework imposed on
state child protective services agencies --
departs from the nondiscrimination mandate of  504 in a more fundamental way.
The mandatory provisions of the Final
Rules omit any direct requirement that hospitals make reports when parents refuse
consent to recommended procedures.<sup>25</sup>
Instead, the Final Rules command <i>state
agencies</i> to require such reports, regardless of the state agencies' own reporting
requirements (or lack thereof). 45 CFR
 84.55(c)(1)(i) (1985). Far from merely
preventing state agencies from remaining
calculatedly indifferent to handicapped infants while they tend to the needs of the
similarly situated nonhandicapped, the Final Rules command state agencies to utilize
their "full authority" to "prevent instances
of unlawful medical neglect of handicapped
infants."  84.55(c)(1). The Rules effectively make medical neglect of handicapped
newborns a state investigative priority,
possibly forcing state agencies to shift
scarce resources away from other enforcement activities -- perhaps even from programs designed to protect handicapped
children outside hospitals. The Rules also
order state agencies to "immediate[ly]" re-
view   reports   from   hospitals,
 84.55(c)(1)(iii), to conduct "on-site investigation[s]," <i>ibid.,</i> and to take legal action
"to compel the provision of necessary nourishment and  medical  treatment,"
 84-55(c)(1)(iv) -- all without any regard
to the procedures followed by state agencies in handling complaints filed on behalf
of nonhandicapped infants. These operating procedures were imposed over the objection of several state child protective services agencies that the requirement that
they turn over reports to HHS "conflicts
with the confidentiality requirements of
state child abuse and neglect statutes," 49
Fed.Reg. 1627 (1984) -- thereby requiring
under the guise of nondiscrimination a service which state law denies to the nonhandicapped.<sup>26</sup><p>

The complaint-handling process the Secretary would impose on unwilling state
agencies is totally foreign to the authority
to prevent discrimination conferred on him
by  504. "Section 504 seeks to assure
evenhanded treatment," <i>Alexander v.
Choate,</i> 469 U.S., at 304, 105 S.Ct., at 721
(1985); "neither the language, purpose, nor
history of  504 reveals an intent to impose
an affirmative-action obligation" on recipients of federal financial assistance, <i>Southeastern Community Collepe v. Davis,</i> 442
U.S. 397, 411, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L.Ed.
2d 980 (1979).<sup>27</sup> The Solicitor General also
recognizes that  504 is concerned with
discrimination and with discrimination
alone. In his attempt to distinguish the
Secretary's 1976 determination that it "is
beyond the authority of section 504" to
promulgate  regulations  "concerning
adequate and appropriate psychiatric
care or safe and humane living conditions
for persons institutionalized because of
handicap or concerning payment of fair
compensation to patients who perform
work," 41 Fed.Reg. 29548, 29559, the Solicitor General explains:

<blockquote>
"This conclusion of course was consistent with the fact that, as relevant here,
Section 504 is essentially concerned only
with discrimination in the <i>relative</i> treatment of handicapped and nonhandicapped persons and does not confer any <i>absolute</i> right to receive particular services or benefits under federally assisted
programs." Brief for Petitioner 40, n.
33.<p>
</blockquote>

See also 48 Fed.Reg. 30846 (1983) ("Section
504 is in essence an equal treatment, non-discrimination standard").<sup>38</sup><p>

The Final Rules, however, impose just
the sort of absolute obligation on state
agencies that the Secretary had previously
disavowed. The services state agencies are
required to make available to handicapped
infants are in no way tied to the level of
services provided to similarly situated non-handicapped infants. Instead, they constitute an "<i>absolute</i> right to receive particular services or benefits" under a federally
assisted program. Even if a state agency
were scrupulously impartial as between the
protection it offered handicapped and non-handicapped infants, it could still be denied
federal funding for failing to carry out the
Secretary's mission with sufficient zeal.<p>

[14] It is no answer to state, as does
the Secretary, that these regulations are a
necessary " 'metho[d] ... to give reasonable assurance' of compliance." 49 Fed.
Reg. 1627 (1984) (quoting 45 CFR  80.4(b),
which requires state agencies to report
on their compliance with Title VI). For
while the Secretary can require state agencies to document their <i>own</i> compliance with
 504, nothing in that provision authorizes
him to commandeer state agencies to enforce compliance by <i>other</i> recipients of federal funds (in this instance, hospitals).
State child protective services agencies are
not field offices of the HHS bureaucracy,
and they may not be conscripted against
their will as the foot soldiers in a federal
crusade.<sup>39</sup> As we stated in <i>Alexander v.
Choate,</i> 469 U.S., at 307, 105 S.Ct., at 723,
"nothing in the pre- or post-1973 legislative
discussion of  504 suggests that Congress
desired to make major inroads on the
States' longstanding discretion to choose
the proper mix" of services provided by
state agencies.<p>

<h2 align=center>VIII</h2>

Section 504 authorizes any head of an
Executive Branch agency -- regardless of
his agency's mission or expertise -- to
promulgate regulations prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped. See
S.Rep. No. 93-1297, pp. 39-40 (1974), U.S.
Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. 6373.<sup>30</sup>
As a result of this rulemaking authority,
the Secretary of HHS has "substantial
leeway to explore areas in which discrimination against the handicapped pos[es] particularly significant problems and to devise regulations to prohibit such discrimination." <i>Alexander v. Choate,</i> 469 U.S., at
304, n. 24, 105 S.Ct., at 722, n. 24.<p>

Even according the greatest respect to
the Secretary's action, however, deference
cannot fill the lack of an evidentiary foundation on which the Final Rules must rest.
The Secretary's basis for federal intervention is perceived discrimination against
handicapped infants in violation of  504,
and yet the Secretary has pointed to no
evidence that such discrimination occurs.
Neither the fact that regulators generally
may rely on generic information in a particular field or comparable experience gained
in other fields, nor the fact that regulations
may be imposed for preventative or prophylactic reasons, can substitute for evidence supporting the Secretary's own chosen rationale. For the principle of agency
accountability recited earlier means that
"an agency's action must be upheld, if at
all, on the basis articulated by the agency
itself." <i>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v.
State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,</i> 463
U.S., at 50, 103 S.Ct., at 2870 (citations
omitted).<sup>31</sup><p>

[15] The need for a proper evidentiary
basis for agency action is espeeially acute
in this case because Congress has failed to
indicate, either in the statute or in the
legislative history, that it envisioned federal superintendence of treatment decisions
traditionally entrusted to state governance.
"[W]e must assume that the implications
and limitations of our federal system constitute a major premise of all congressional
legislation, though not repeatedly recited
therein." <i>United States v. Gambling Devices,</i> 346 U.S. 441, 450, 74 S.Ct. 190, 195,
98 L.Ed. 179 (1953) (opinion of Jackson,
J)<sup>32</sup> Congress therefore "will not be
deemed to have significantly changed the
federal-state balance," <i>United States v.
Bass,</i> 404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523,
30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) -- or to have authorized its delegates to do so -- "unless otherwise the purpose of the Act would be defeated," <i>FTC v. Bunte Bros, Inc.,</i> 312 U.S.
349, 351, 61 S.Ct. 580, 582, 85 L.Ed. 881
(1941).<sup>33</sup> Although the nondiscrimination
mandate of  504 is cast in language sufficiently broad to suggest that the question
is "not one of authority, but of its appropriate exercise[,] [t]he propriety of the exertion of the authority must be tested by its
relation to the purpose of the [statutory]
grant and with suitable regard to the principle that whenever the federal power is
exerted within what would otherwise be
the domain of state power, the justification
of the exercise of the federal power must
clearly appear." <i>Florida v. United States,</i>
282 U.S. 194, 211-212, 51 S.Ct. 119, 123-
124, 75 L.Ed. 291 (1931). Accord, <i>Chicago,
M., St. P. &amp; P.R. Co. v. Illinois,</i> 355 U.S.
300, 306, 78 S.Ct. 304, 308, 2 L.Ed.2d 292
(1958). That is, "it must appear that there
are findings, supported by evidence, of the
essential facts ... which would justify [the
Secretary's] conclusion." <i>Florida v. United States,</i> 282 U.S., at 212, 51 S.Ct., at 124.
The administrative record does not contain
the reasoning and evidence that is necessary to sustain federal intervention into a
historically state-administered decisional
process that appears -- for lack of any evidence to the contrary -- to be functioning in
full compliance with  504.<p>

The history of these regulations exposes
the inappropriateness of the extraordinary
deference -- virtually a <i>carte blanche</i> -- requested by the Government. The Secretary's present reading of  504 has evolved only after previous, patently erroneous interpretations had been found wanting.<sup>34</sup> The checkered history of these regulations began in 1982, when the Department notified hospitals that they would violate  504 if they "allow[ed] an infant" to
remain in their care after "the infant's
parents or guardian [had withheld consent
to] treatment or nourishment discriminatorily." 47 Fed.Reg. 26027. By the time the
Proposed Rules were announced one year
later, the Seeretary had abandoned that
construction. But the Department substituted the equally untenable view that "the
basic provision of nourishment; fluids, and
routine nursing care" was "not an option
for medical judgment" and that "[t]he decision to forego medical treatment of a correctable life-threatening defect beeause an
infant also suffers from a permanent irremediable handicap that is not life-threatening, such as mental retardation, is a violation of Section 504," insinuating by omission that lack of parental consent did not
alter the hospital's obligation to provide
corrective surgery. 48 Fed.Reg. 30852,
30847 (1983). Although the preamble to
the Final Rules correets the prior erroneous signals from the Department that
 504 authorizes it to override parental decisions and to save the lives of handicapped
infants, it persists in advocating federal
regulation on the basis of treatment denials
precipitated by refusals of parental consent
and on the ground that its experience with
the Baby Doe hotline has demonstrated
that "the assumption that handicapped infants will receive medically beneficial treatment is not always justified." 49 Fed.Reg. 1646 (1984).<p>

This response, together with its previous
remarks, makes irresistible the inference
that the Department regards its mission
as one prineipally eoneerned with the quality of medical eare for handicapped infants
rather than with the implementation of
 504. We could not quarrel with a decision by the Department to concentrate its
finite compliance resources on instances of
life-threatening discrimination rather than
instances in which merely elective care has
been withheld. Cf. <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> 470
U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714
(1985). But nothing in the statute authorizes the Secretary to dispense with the
law's focus on discrimination and instead to
employ federal resources to save the lives
of handicapped newborns, without regard
to whether they are victims of discrimination by recipients of federal funds or not.
Section 504 does not authorize the Secretary to give unsolicited advice either to
parents, to hospitals, or to state officials
who are faced with difficult treatment decisions concerning handicapped children.
We may assume that the "qualified professionals" employed by the Secretary may
make valuable contributions in particular
cases, but neither that assumption nor the
sincere conviction that an immediate "on-site investigation" is "necessary to protect
the life or health of a handicapped individual" can enlarge the statutory powers of the
Secretary.<p>

The administrative record demonstrates
that the Secretary has asserted the authority to conduct
on-site investigations, to inspect hospital records, and to participate in
the decisional process in emergency cases
in which there was no colorable basis for
believing that a violation of  504 had occurred or was about to occur. The District
Court and the Court of Appeals correctly
held that these investigative actions were
not authorized by the statute and that the

1. "Handicapped individual" is defined in
 7(7)(B) of the Act, as amended, as "any person who (i) has a physical or mental
impairment which substantially limits one or more of
such person's major life activities, (ii) has a
record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment."
92 Stat. 2985, 29 U.S.C.  706(7)(B).<p>

2. Respondents include the Hospital Association
of New York State. the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Association
of American Medical Colleges, the American
Academy of Family Physicians, and certain individual physicians.<p>

3. Margaret Heckler occupied the position of Secretary throughout the rulemaking
period. On December 13, 1985, after certiorari had been
granted, Dr. Otis Bowen assumed that position.
Despite the fact tht Dr. Bowen was not responsible for promulgation of the
Final Rules, for the sake of continuity our references assume
tht he was. For ease of reference we refer to
the Secretary, the Department, and HHS interchangeably.<p>

4. In subsection (a) the Department "encourages
each recipient health care provider that provides health care services to infants" to establish
an "Infant Care Review Committee (ICRC)" to
assist in the development of treatment standards for handicapped infants and to provide
assistance in making individual treatment decisions. 45 CFR  84.55(a) (1985). In subsection
(f), the Department describes its version of a
model ICRC.<p>

Subsection (f) also provides that "[t]he activities of the ICRC will be guided by ... [t]he
interpretative guidelines of the Department."
45 CFR  84.55(f)(1)(ii)(A) (1985). These guidelines, which are "illustrative" and "do not independently establish rules of conduct," pt. 84
Appendix C, &#182;(a), set forth the Department's
interpretation of  504. Although they do not
contain any definition of "discrimination," they
do state that  504 is not applicable to parents
and that the regulation applies to only two categories of activities of hospitals: (1) refusals to
provide treatment or nourishment to handicapped infants whose parents have consented
to, or requested, such treatment; and (2) the
failure or refusal to take action to override a
parental decision to withhold consent for medically beneficial treatment or nourishment.
With respect to the second category, the guidelines state that the hospital may not "solely on
the basis of the infant's present or anticipated
future mental or physical impairments, fail to
follow applicable procedures on reporting such
incidents to the child protective services agency
or to seek judicial review." 45 CFR pt. 84,
Appendix C, &#182;(a)(4) (1985).<p>

With respect to the first category, the guidelines do not state that  504 categorically prohibits a hospital from withholding requested
treatment or nourishment "solely on the basis of
present or anticipated pkYsical or mental impairments of an infant." 45 CFR pt. 84, Appendix C, &#182;(a)(l). Rather, the substantive guidelines and two of the illustrative examples recognize that the etiology of and prognosis for particular handicapping conditions may justify "a
refusal to treat solely on the basis of those
handicapping conditions." &#182;(a)(2) ( 504 does
not require "futile treatment"); &#182;(a)(5)(iii)
( 504 does not require treatment of anencephaly because it would "do no more than temporarily prolong the act of dying"); &#182;(a)(iv) (same with severely premature and low birth weight
infants). In general, the guidelines seem to
make a hospital's liability under  504 dependent on proof that (1) it refused to provide requested treatment or nourishment soldy on the
basis of an infant's handicapping condition, and
(2) the treatment or nourishment would have
been medically beneficial. See &#182;(a)(1)-(3),
(5)<p>

The guidelines also describe how HHS will
respond to "complaints of suspected life threatening noncompliance" with  504 in this context, progressing from telephone inquiries to the
hospital to obtain information about the condition of the infant, to requests for access to
records, and finally to onsite investigations and
litigation in appropriate cases. &#182;(b). The
guidelines do not draw any distinction between
cases in which parental consent has been withheld and those in which it has been given. Nor
do they draw any distinction between cases in
which hospitals have made a report of parental
refusal to consent to treatment and those in
which no report to a state agency has been
made. They do announce that the "Department
will also seek to coordinate its investigation
with any related investigations by the state child
protective services agency so as to minimize
potential disruption," &#182;(b)(4), indicating that
the Department's investigations may continue
even in cases that have previously been referred
to a state agency.<p>

5. At the instance of the local prosecutor, the Indiana courts on April 13 held another hearing at which the court concluded that "Baby Doe" had not been neglected under Indiana's Child in
Need of Services statute. Additional attempts to seek
judicial intervention were rebuffed the same day. On the
following day, the Indiana Court of Appeals denied a request for
an immediate hearing. <i>In re Infant Doe,</i> No. GU 8204-004A
(Monroe County Cir. Ct., Apr. 12, 1982). The Indiana Supreme
Court, by a vote of 3 to 1, rejected a petition for a writ of mandamus.
<i>State ex rel. Infant Doe v. Baker,</i> No. 482 S 140 (May 27,
1982). the infant died while a stay was being sought in this Court,
and we subsequently denied certiorari. <i>Infant Doe v Bloomington
Hospital,</i> 464 U.S. 961, 104 S.Ct. 394, 78 L.Ed.2d 337 (1983).<p>

6. The notice maintained that hospitals would violate  504 if they "allow[ed] [an] infant" to remain in their care after "the infant's parents
or guardian [had withheld consent to] treatment or nourishment
discriminatorily." 47 Fed.Reg. 26027 (1982). The Secretary no longer
subscribes to this reading of the statute. See 49 Fed.Reg. 1631 (1984).<p>

7. ln explaining the need for the Proposed Rules,
the preamble, although mentioning "parental
rights over their children," insisted that physicians' "acquiescence in nontreatment of Down's
children is apparently <i>because</i> of the handicap,"
rather than, it must be supposed, lack of parental consent. 48 Fed.Reg. 30848 (1983).<p>

The effect of parental nonconsent was not
even mentioned in the appendix to the Proposed
Rules. That section, which set forth the Department's view of "the manner in which Section
504 applies to the provision of health care services to handicapped infants," <i>id,</i> at 30851, declared that  504 mandated "the basic provision
of nourishment, fluids, and routine nursing
care." <i>Id,</i> at 30852. The provision of sustenance, according to the Department, was "not
an option for medical judgment." <i>Ibi.d</i> Thus,
"[e]ven if a handicapped infant faces imminent
and unavoidable death, no health care provider
should take upon itself to cause death by starvation or dehydration." <i>Ibid.</i><p>

In addition to its unqualified endorsement of
nourishment as required by  504, the appendix
announced that "[a]ny decision not to correct
intestinal atresia in a Down's Syndrome child,
unless an additional complication medically
warrants such decision, <i>must</i> be deemed a denial of services based on the handicap of Down's
Syndrome. The same reasoning applies to a
case of Down's Syndrome [infant] with esophogeal atresia, and the denial of surgery to correct
atresia." <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). The Department did not discuss the relevance of parental
nonconsent to the hospital's treatment obligation under  504, presumably because it was
irrelevant given its understanding of the provision at that time.<p>

8. Indeed, although the Government took an appeal from the District Court's judgment, it filed
a motion for summary disposition after the
Court of Appeals denied its motion for initial
consideration en banc. Its motion expressly
acknowledged that an affirmance was compelled by the decision in <i>University Hospital.</i>

9. As the case comes to us, we have no reason to
review the Court of Appeals' assumption that
the provision of health care to infants in hospitals reciving Medicare or Medicaid payments is
a part of a "program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." See <i>Consolidated Rail
Corp. v. Darrone,</i> 465 U.S. 624, 635-636, 104
S.Ct. 1248, 1255, 79 L.Ed.2d 568 (1984).<p>

10. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief in Opposition for Respondents
American Medical Assn. et al. 7-8 n. 8; Record
Doc. No. 4, Memorandum of Poinis and Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction 12 ("The Final Regulation
which is challenged in this action contains four
mandatory provisions" (citations omitted); <i>id.,</i>
at 28 ("After University Hospital ... must fall all
of the mandatory obligations imposed by the
Final Regulation"). Cf. App. 138-140 (complaint of American Medical Association et al.).<p>

11. It is true that the District Court, in addition
to declaring "[t]he Final Regulation ... invalid
and unlawful as exceeding"  504 and enjoining
petitioner from "any further implementation of
the Final Regulation," also declared invalid and
enjoined "[a]ny other actions" of the Secretary
"to regulate treatment involving impaired newborn infants taken under authority of Section
504, including currently pending investigation
and other enforcement actions." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 51a. This language must, however, be
given a limited construction. The complaints in
this case did not challenge the Department's
authority to regulate all treatment decisions, but
more precisely the mandatory provisions of the
Final Rules and enforcement activity along
those lines but undertaken pursuant to the Department's "general authority" to enforce  504,
as occurred in the <i>University Hospital</i> litigation
and in 41 of the 49 full-scale investigations conducted by the Secretary up to that point in time.
See App. 138-139 (complaint of American Medical Association et al.); <i>id.,</i> at 145 (same); <i>id.,</i> at
159 (complaint of American Hospital Association et al.). See also Record, Doc. No. 4, Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of
Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction
10-11. From these pleadings, the Court of Appeals apparently interpreted the District Court's
use of the word "any" to forbid "[a]ny other
actions" resembling the "currently pending investigation and other enforcement actions"
specified in the injunction, App. to Pet. for Cert.
51a, rather than all possible regulatory and investigative activity that might involve the provision of health care to handicapped Infants.
Thus, as will become clear from our analysis of
the Final Rules below, the injunction forbids
continuation or initiation of regulatory and investigative activity directed at instances in
which parents have refused consent to treatment and, if the Secretary were to undertake
such action, efforts to seek compliance with
affirmative requirements imposed on state child
protective services agencies. "Because of the
rightly serious view courts have traditionally
taken of violations of injunctive orders, and
because of the severity of punishment which
may be imposed for such violation," <i>Pasadena
City Bd of Education v. Spangler,</i> 427 U.S. 424,
439, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2706, 49 L.Ed.2d4599 (1976);
see <i>Longshoremen v. Marine Trade Assn.,</i> 389
U.S. 64, 76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 208, 19 L.Ed.2d 236
(1967); <i>Gunn v. University Committee,</i> 399 U.S.
383, 389, 90 S.Ct. 2013, 2016-2017, 26 L.Ed.2d
684 (1970), the Court of Appeals properly construed the District Court's judgment as pertaining to the regulations challenged in this litigation (and enforcement activity independent of
the Final Rules but paralleling the procedures
set forth therein). Cf. <i>Schmidt v. Lessard,</i> 414
U.S. 473, 477, 94 S.Ct. 713, 715, 38 L.Ed.2d 661
(1974) (per curiam ) (noting desirability of precise construction of injunction orders to facilitate appellate review). It is, of course, the Court
of Appeals' judgment that we are called on to
review, not the District Court's. See <i>Union Pacific R. Co. v. Chicago, R.L &amp; P.R. Co.,</i> 163 U.S.
564, 593, 16 S.Ct. 1173, 1184, 41 L.Ed. 265
(1896). Cf. Davis v. Packard, 6 Pet. (31 U.S.) 41,
49, 8 L.Ed. 312 (1832). Accordingly, we give
great weight to the Court of Appeals' construction of the judgment it affirmed. Cf. <i>United
States v. Colgate &amp; Co.,</i> 250 U.S. 300, 301-302, 39
S.Ct. 465, 466, 63 L.Ed. 992 (1919). For purposes of comparison, the dissent's expansive
reading of the judgment is supported neither by
the Court of Appeals nor by the parties. See
Brief for Respondents American Medical Assn.
et al. 14, 48. n. 60. Cf. Brief for Respondents
American Hospital Assn. et al. 4 (quoting final
judgment of the District Court). In view of the
fact that we affirm this judgment on reasoning
narrower than that employed by the lower
courts, it bears repetition that this Court "reviews judgments, not opinions." <i>Chevron U.S.A.

13. The basic pattern of decisionmaking is well
summarized in the 1983 report of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical
Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research:<p>

"The paucity of directly relevant cases makes
characterization of the law in this area somewhat problematic, but certain points stand out.
First, there is a presumption, strong but rebuttable, that parents are the appropriate decisionmakers for their infants. Traditional law concerning the family, buttressed by the emerging
constitutional right of privacy, protects a substantial range of discretion for parents. Second, as persons unable to protect themselves,
infants fall under the <i>parens patriae</i> power of
the state. In the exercise of this authority, the
state not only punishes parents whose conduct
has amounted to abuse or neglect of their children but may also supervene parental decisions
before they become operative to ensure that the
choices made are not so detrimental to a child's
interests as to amount to neglect and abuse.<p>

"... [A]s long as parents choose from professionally accepted treatment options the choice
is rarely reviewed in court and even less frequently supervened. The courts have exercised
their authority to appoint a guardian for a child
when the parents are not capable of participating in the decisionmaking or when they have
made decisions that evidence substantial lack of
concern for the child's interests. Although societal involvement usually occurs under the auspices of governmental instrumentalities -- such
as child welfare agencies and courts -- the American legal system ordinarily relies upon the private initiative of individuals rather than continuing governmental supervision, to bring the
matter to the attention of legal authorities." Report, at 212-214 (1983) (footnotes omitted).
This summary accords with the Secretary's
understanding of the state-law framework, at
least in other contexts. See 50 Fed.Reg. 14880
(1985) (final rule implementing Child Abuse
Amendments of 1984) ("The decision to provide
or withhold medically indicated treatment is,
except in highly unusual circumstances, made
by the parents or legal guardian").<p>

14. Rather than address these issues, Justice
WHITE's dissent would remand to the Court of
Appeals. See <i>post,</i> at 2128. In light of its willingness to address the broader hypothetical
question whether  504 ever authorizes regulation of medical treatment decisions -- "even if
the judgment below were limited to invalidation
of these regulations," <i>post</i> at 2124, n. 4 -- it
comes as something of a surprise to read the
references to the Solicitor General's argument
that "this claim in its current form is not properly in the case," <i>post,</i> at 2128, n. 9. The procedural objections are plainly without substance.
Respondents AMA et al. raised the lack of factual support in their brief in opposition to the
petition for certiorari. See Brief in Opposition
for Respondents American Medical Assn. et al.
20 ("First, the fundamental problem with the
Secretary's position is that it is based on a
situation that has not occurred -- and will not
occur -- in real life. ... Not surprisingly, the
Secretary cites no case where [his hypothetical
problem] has occurred"); <i>id,</i> at 20-21; <i>id.,</i> at 26 ("B. The Secretary Has Shown No Problem
With the Historic State Law Framework That
Warrants Direct Federal Investigation and Regulation"); <i>id,</i> at 26-29. The Solicitor General,
although responding that such evidence exists,
see Reply Memorandum for Petitioner 9, did
not raise a procedural bar. As a result, the
objection is waived. See <i>Oklahoma City v.
Turtle,</i> 471 U.S. 808, 815-8t6, 105 S.Ct. 2427,
2431-2432, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985). Although
further discussion of this objection is therefore
unnecessary, the dissent is also wrong in suggesting that respondents' complaints did not
raise "the lack of a factual basis involving situations in which parents have consented to treatment." <i>Post,</i> at 2128, n. 9. In fact, the complaint of respondents AMA et al. alleged
"COUNT II: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act," App. 146, and incorporated by reference the allegation that "None of the mandatory provisions of the Final Regulation have a basis in fact or are designed to meet a documented problem," <i>id.,</i> at 140. Accord, <i>id.,</i> at
158 (complaint of respondents AHA et al.). The
fact that our decision rests on grounds narrower
than that relied on by the lower courts is surely
not an infirmity. We can only add that the lack
of factual support for these regulations was fully briefed in this Court, see especially Brief for
Respondents American Medical Assn. et al. 39-41; Brief for Respondents American Hospital
Assn. et al. 48-49, and the fact that the Solicitor
General responds with so little, so late bespeaks
the absence of evidentiary support for the regulations, not an inadequate opportunity to direct us to it.<p>

The Solicitor General also contends, for the
first time in his reply brief on the merits, see
Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, n. 6, that the Final
Rules are "interpretative guidelines" which
"merely explained the Secretary's construction
of Section 504 in this setting," <i>ibid.</i> This assertion was rejected the only occasion on which it
was tendered, see <i>American Academy of Pediatrics v. Heckler,</i> 561 F.Supp. 395, 401 (DC 1983)
is belied by the Secretary's own decision to
provide notice and request comment on the
regulations, cf. 5 U.S.C.  553(b), and is patently
without merit. To its credit, the dissent does
not ultimately rely on either of these arguments.
See <i>post,</i> at 2128, n. 9.<p>

15. Just as "[t]he failure of the hospital to itself
provide the treatment" because of the unavailability of medical equipment or expertise would
not be "on the basis of the handicap" but "on the
fact that the hospital is incapable of providing
the treatment," according to the Secretary's regulations, 49 Fed.Reg. 1637 (1984), it is equally
clear that a refusal to provide care because of
the absence of parental consent would not be
"solely by reason of [the infant's] handicap."<p>

16. The Secretary's summary of this case makes it clear that the hospital's failure to perform surgery was based on the parents' refusal of consent:<p>

"<i>Bloomington, Indiana.</i> Investigation into April 1982 death of infant with Down's syndrome and esophageal atresia from whom surgery was withheld <i>on the instructions of the parents."</i> <i>Id.,</i> at 1646 (emphasis added).<p>

As recounted earlier, the hospital initiated judicial review to override the parents' decision, but its efforts proved unavailing. The Solicitor General now acknowledges that there was no basis for finding a violation of  504 in this
case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.<p>

17. Notwithstanding that the Secretary's summary of this case demonstrates that treatment was withheld because of refusal of parental consent and that state-court proceedings to override 
the parents' decision had been instituted before
the Department intervened, the Department pro-
ceeded with its own investigation anyway:

"<i>Long Island, New York.</i> October 19, 1983,
complaint, based on newspaper article, that infant with spina bifida not receiving surgery <i>due to refusal of parents to consent; legal proceedings ha[d] been initiated in State court.</i> Inquiry
initiated October 19. On October 27, HHS
asked Department of Justice to commence legal 
action to overcome refusal of hospital to permit
review of pertinent records." 49 Fed.Reg. 1649
(1984) (emphasis added).<p>

18. The Secretary first cited a 1973 survey by Raymond Duff and A.G.M. Campbell calculating that 14% of deaths in the special nursery of the Yale-New Haven hospital "were related to withholding treatment." 48 Fed.Reg. 30847 (1983). The Secretary's solitary quotation from this study, accurately illustrating the locus of the treatment decisions reviewed by the authors, involved refusal of parental consent:<p>

"'An infant with Down's syndrome and intestinal atresia, like the much publicized one at
Johns Hopkins Hospital, was not treated <i>because his parents thought the surgery was wrong
for their baby and themselves.</i> He died several days
after birth.'" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added)
(quoting Duff &amp; Campbell, Moral and Ethical
Dilemmas in the Special-Care Nursery, 289 New
Eng. J.M. ed. 890, 891 (1973)).<p>

The Secretary next referred to an incident at
Johns Hopkins Hospital which, as the above quotation
intimates, also concerned parental refusal of consent. Then followed brief mention of the "Bloomington Baby Doe" incident, in which the parents, as the Secretary now admits,
refused consent to treatment despite the hospital's
insistence that it be provided. The Secretary's
fourth and final example involved a 1979
death of an infant with Down's syndromne and
an intestinal obstruction at the Kapliolani Children's Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, 48 Fed.Reg. 30847
(1983), which again appears to have
resulted from "a lack of parental consent,"
<i>id.,</i> at 30848.<p>

Generalizing from these examples, the Secretary
reported the results of a survey of physician
attitudes. He faulted "[t]heir acquiescence in nontreatment of Down's children" which he surmised was "apparently <i>because of </i> the handicap represented by Down's syndrome." <i>Ibid.</i> See n. 22, <i>infra.</i><p>

19. The Secretary also reprinted selected quotations from various commenters reporting the
existence of "discriminatory" decisions denying
sustenance and care to handicapped infants.
None of these comments disclosed whether
those "discriminatory" decisions were made by
parents or by hospitals.<p>

20. The Secretary's repeated inability to identify
a single treatment decision in violation of  504
lends an aura of unreality to Justice WHITE's
criticism of the Court of Appeals' decision in
<i>University Hospital.</i> In explaining why he believes "the stated basis for the Court of Appeals'
holding in <i>University Hospital</i> was incorrect,"
<i>post,</i> at 2128; see <i>post,</i> at 2127, n. 8, Justice
WHITE completely ignores the fact that the case
involved a specific treatment decision made by
parents. Since Justice WHITE elsewhere agrees
that parental decisions are not covered by  504
<i>post,</i> at 2128-2129, n. 10, and that the infant
involved in the <i>University Hospital</i> case was
therefore not "otherwise qualified" for treatment, <i>post</i> at 2126, n. 7, he implicitly acknowledges that the judgment in <i>University Hospital</i> is
correct; only by ignoring the actual facts of that
case -- as well as the actual facts of the 49 cases
that were investigated by the Secretary -- and
speculating about nonexistent hypothetical cases
in which a hospital might refuse to provide
ntreatment requested by parents, does the dissent
offer any basis for questioning the decision in
<i>University Hospital.</i><p>

Indeed, even the dissent's criticism of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals' decision is based
on a hypothetical situation that the Court of
Appeals did not address. That court was concerned with the treatment of cases in which "the
handicapping condition is <i>related</i> to the condition(s) to be treated," 729 F.2d, at 157 (emphasis
added); see id., at 147, whereas Justice WHITE
has carefully limited his hypothetical discussion
to cases in which "the treatment is <i>completely
unrelated</i> to the baby's handicapping condition."
<i>Post,</i> at 2127 (emphasis added). Thus, like bishops of opposite colors, the opinions of Justice
WHITE and the Court of Appeals do not even
touch one another.<p>

21. The preamble repeatedly makes the assumption that evidence showing the need for <i>governmental</i> involvement provides a basis for <i>federal</i>
involvement. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 49 Fed.Reg. 1649 (1984).<p>

22. Justice WHITE's dissent suggests that regulation of health care providers can be justified on
a theory the Secretary did not advance -- a supposed need to curtail discriminatory advice by biased physicians. See <i>post,</i> at 2128-2130. After observing that at least some handicapped
infants have not been treated, the dissent identifies physician attitudes as a likely explanation
and concludes that mandated informational notices were presumably designed to "foste[r] an
awareness by health care professionals of their
responsibility not to act in a discriminatory
manner with respect to medical treatment decisions for handicapped infants." <i>Post,</i> at 2130.<p>

The dissent's theory finds no support in the
text of the reglation, the reasoning of the Secretary, or the briefs filed on his behalf in this
Court. The reglations in general -- and the informational notices in particular -- do not purport to place any constraints on the advice that
physicians may give their patients. Moreover,
since it is now clear that parental decisionmaking is not covered by  504, <i>supra,</i> at 2114-2115,
the dissents theory rests on the unstated premise that the statute may prevent the giving of
advice to do something which  504 does not
itself prohibit. It is hardly obvious that the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits physicians
from "aiding and abetting" a parental decision
which parents admittedly have a right to make.
And if Congress did intend this counterintuitive
result, one might expect an explanation from
the Secretary as to how the hotlines and emergency on-site inspections contemplated by the
Final Rules square with the constitutional doctrines on reglation, direct or indirect, of
speech in general and of decisionmaking by
health professionals in particular.<p>

In reality, the Secretary neither found nor
implied that physicians' predispositions against
treating handicapped infants had resulted in
parental refusals to consent to treatment. Indeed, he principally relied on attitudinal surveys
for the converse proposition that regulation is
necessary because parents refuse consent to
treatment and physicians will "acquiesce in parental refus[als] to treat." 48 Fed.Reg. 30848
(1983). To the extent any theory may be discerned in the Secretary's two-column summary
of physician surveys, it is that doctors would not
<i>correct</i> "bad" parental decisions, not that they
were responsible for helping them to make such
choices in the first place. Moreover, even if the
Secretary had relied on this evidence to insinuate that doctors imposed their own value judgments on parents by lobbying them to refuse
consent, he never explains that the parental
decisionmaking process is one in which doctors
exercise the decisive influence needed to force
such results. Compare <i>ibid,</i> with <i>post,</i> at 2129.
The Secretary, in short, has not even adumbrated a theog of "discrimination" remotely resembling the one invented by the dissent, and therefore has not made the essential connection between the evidence of physician attitudes and
the regulatory choice made here.<p>

23. Of course,  504 would be violated only if
the hospital failed to report medical neglect of a
handicapped infant when it would report such
neglect of a similarly situated nonhandicapped
infant. Because respondents have challenged
the Secretary's reulations on their face, we
have no occasion to address the question whether infants with birth defects are similarly situated with infants in need of blood transfusions
(the paradigm case in which hospitals have reported or have sought to override parental decisions, according to the Solicitor General, Brief for Petitioner 28, and n. 16), or whether a hospital could legitimately distinguish between the
two situations on the basis of the different risks
and benefits inhering in certain operations to
correct birth defects, on the one hand, and
blood transfusions, on the other hand.<p>

24. To the contrary, the Secretary's case summaries reveal numerous instances in which hospitals have voluntarily reported instances of suspected medical neglect and have even initiated
legal proceedings themselves. In the Bloomington, Indiana, case which prompted these regulations, and in the <i>University Hospital</i> case which
supported the summary affirmance now before
us, the parents' decision was the subject of judicial review in the state courts. In the Robinson,
Illinois, case on which the Secretary relies as
one of three examples illustrating the need for
federal regulation, the hospital reported the parents' refusal to consent to state authorities who
arranged for surgery and adoption. 49 Fed.
Reg. 1646 (1984). Most dramatically, in the
Daytona Beach, Florida, case HHS received its
hotline complaint the day <i>after</i> the state agency
had already obtained a court order overriding
the parents' refusal to consent to surgery. <i>Id,</i>
at 1648. Notwithstanding the Department's "immediate contact" with the hospital and the state
agency -- which surely must have made it clear
that the case had already been reported to that
agency and that there was no colorable basis for
suspecting a violation of  504 -- the Department
conducted an on-site investigation. <i>Ibid.</i> In the
third case on which the Secretary placed special
emphasis, the Department intervened before the
parents had decided whether to authorize treatment or not, so that no reporting obligation
could have been triggered. <i>Ibid.</i><p>

25. The interpretative guidelines appended to the
Final Rules do impose on hospitals and other
health care providers the duty not to discriminate against handicapped infants in reporting
instances of parental neglect. We do not address the question whether reporting, either as a
hospital practice or as a requirement of state
law, constitutes a "program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance" under  504. See
<i>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone,</i> 465 U.S., at
635-636, 104 S.Ct., at 1255-1256. Cf. <i>Grove City
College v. Bell,</i> 465 U.S. 555, 570-574, 104 S.Ct.
1211, 1220-1222, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984).<p>

26. Justice WHITE's dissent, quoting the Secretary's explanation for these requirements, concludes that they form, in "substance," a nondiscrimination requirement. <i>Post,</i> at 2131. This
assertion is repetitive, not responsive. The rules
governing state child protective services agencies operate independently of any provisions of
state law; they go further than them in several
respects; they flatly contradict them in others
(<i>e.g.,</i> confidentiality); and they do not accommodate the revision, modification, or repeal of
state laws. To say that the Secretary can give
detailed marching orders to state agencies upon
discovering that both the agericies and HHS are
working toward the same general objective -- at
least when defined with sufficient abstractness
-- would countenance a novel and serious intrusion on state autonomy.<p>

27. See <i>Southeastern Community College v.
Davis,</i> 442 U.S., at 410, 99 S.Ct., at 2369 (language and structure of 1973 Rehabilitation Act
recognizes "the distinction between ... evenhanded treatment ... and affirmative efforts").<p>

28. The Secretary notes that "by enacting section
504 Congress intended to eliminate all of the
'many forms of potential discrimination' against
handicapped people through 'the establishment
of a broad governmental policy.' S.Rep. No.
1297, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 38 (1974)." 49 Fed.
Reg. 1636 (1984). But no matter how broad the
prohibition contained in  504 may be, what it
prohibits is discrimination.<p>

29. Important principles of federalism are implicated by any "federal program that compels
state agencies ... to function as bureaucratic
puppets of the Federal Government." <i>FERC v.
Mississippi,</i> 456 U.S. 742, 783, 102 S.Ct. 2126,
2150, 72 L.Ed.2d 532 (1982) (opinion of O'CON-
NOR, J.).<p>

30. Twenty-seven agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, have promulgated regulations forbidding discrimination on the basis of handicap in
programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Department of Housing
and Urban Development has issued a proposed
rulemaking. See Jones &amp; Wolfe, Regulations
Promulgated Pursuant to Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973: A Brief History and
Present Status 8-9 (Congressional Research Service, Feb. 28, 1986). There is thus not the same
basis for deference predicated on expertise as
we found with respect to the Environmental
Protection Agency's interpretation of the 1977
Clean Air Act Amendments in <i>Chevron USA.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>
467 U.S., at 842-845, 104 S.Ct., at 2781-2783

construction of the Bank Holding Act in <i>Board
of Governors, FRS u Investment Company Inst.</i>

[of statutes in derogation of sovereignty] serves
a quasi-constitutional purpose in our federal
system of split sovereignty by helping to secure
both levels of sovereign power against encroachment by each other" (footnote omitted)).<p>

The legislative history of the Rehabilitation
Act does not support the notion that Congress
intended intervention by federal officials into
treatment decisions traditionally left by state
law to concerned parents and the attending physicians or, in exceptional cases, to state agencies
charged with protecting the welfare of the infant. As the Court of Appeals noted, there is
nothing in the legislative history that even remotely suggests that Congress contemplated the
possibility that "section 504 could or would be
applied to treatment decisions, involving defective newborn infants." 729 F.2d 144, 159 (1984).<p>

"'As far as can be determined, no congressional
committee or member of the House or Senate
ever even suggested that section 504 would be
used to monitor medical treatment of defective
newborn infants or establish standards for preserving a particular quality of life. No medical group appeared alert to the intrusion into medical practice which some doctors apprehend from such an undertaking, nor were representatives of parents or spokesmen for religious beliefs that would be affected heard.'" <i>Id.,</i> at 158
(quoting <i>American Academy of Pediatrics v.
Heckler,</i> 561 F.Supp., at 401).<p>

34. The fact that the agency's interpretation "has
been neither consistent nor longstanding ...
substantially diminishes the deference to be given to HEW's [now HHS's] present interpretation
of the statute." <i>Southeastern Community College v.
Davis, </i> 442 U.S., at 412, n. 11, 99 S.Ct., at
2370, n. 11 (citing <i>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,</i>
429 U.S. 125, 143, 97 S.Ct. 401, 411, 50 L.Ed.2d
343 (1976)).<p>

Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins and with whom
Justice O'CONNOR joins as to Parts I, II, IV, and V, dissenting.<p>

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Aet of
1973 forbids discrimination solely on the
basis of handicap in programs or activities
receiving federal financial assistance. The
issue before us is whether the Seeretary of
Health and Human Services has any authority under the Act to regulate
medical treatment decisions concerning handicapped newborn infants.
Relying on its prior decision in <i>United States v. University
Hospital,</i> 729 F.2d 144 (CA2 1984), the
Court of Appeals held that the Secretary
was without power in this respect and affirmed a decision of the
District Court that
 504 does not extend so far and that the
Secretary may not regulate such decisions in any manner.<p>

Although it is my view that we granted certiorari to address this issue,
the plurality avoids it by first erroneously reading the
decision below as enjoining only the enforcement of specific regulations
and by then affirming on the basis that the promulgation of the regulations
did not satisfy established principles of administrative
law, a matter that the Court of Appeals
had no occasion to, and did not, discuss.
With all due respeet, I dissent.<p>

<h2 align=center>I</h2>

The plurality's initial and fundamental
error is its statement that the only question
presented here is the speeific question
whether the four mandatory provisions of
the Final Rules issued by the Secretary are
authorized by  504. This conclusion misconstrues the opinion and judgment
of the Court of Appeals. The plurality concedes
that the Distriet Court's judgment on its
face did not stop with enjoining the
enforcement of the final regulations.
<i>Ante,</i> at 2111-2112, n. 11. In fact, the District Court permanently
enjoined the Secretary from implementing the final regulations
and also from "continuing or undertaking
any other aetions to investigate or regulate
treatment decisions involving impaired
newborn infants taken under authority of
Section 504, including pending investigation
and other enforcement actions." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 51a-52a. This broad injunction ousted the Secretary from the
field entirely and granted the precise relief
sought by the complaint, which was filed
after <i>University Hospital</i> and which
sought to take full advantage of that decision.<sup>1</sup>
The Court of Appeals affirmed and
in no way modified the injunction that the
District Court had entered. In doing so,
the Court of Appeals relied on its previous
determination in <i>University Hospital</i> that
the Secretary had no statutory authority to
regulate medical treatment decisions regarding newborn infants.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a-3a.<sup>2</sup><p>

It is true that the regulations themselves were invalidated and their
enforcement enjoined. This result, however, was
directly compelled by the <i>University Hospital</i> conclusion that the
Secretary was without power to issue any regulations
whatsoever that dealt with infants' medical
care, and it did not comprise the whole
relief awarded by the District Court and
affirmed by the Court of Appeals. I thus
see no justification for the plurality's distortion of the Court of
Appeals' affirmance
of the District Court's all-inclusive injunction, which, like <i>University
Hospital,</i> now represents the law in the Second Circuit.<sup>3</sup>
We should resolve the threshold statutory
question that this case and <i>University Hospital</i> clearly pose --
namely, whether the Secretary has any authority at all under
the Act to regulate medical care decisions
with respect to the handicapped newborn.<sup>4</sup><p>

<h2 align=center>II</h2>

Section 504 of the Act, whieh was construed in <i>University Hospital,</i>
provides:<p>

<blockquote>
"No otherwise qualified handicapped
individual in the United States, as defined in section 706(7) of this
title, shall, solely by reason of his handicap,
be excluded from the participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance." 29 U.S.C.  794.<p>
</blockquote>

After determining that  706(7), which defines handicapped persons, is not
limited to adults and includes the newborn, the Court
of Appeals in <i>University Hospital</i> construed the "otherwise
qualified" language of  504 to limit the reach of the section to
situations in which the handicap is "unrelated to, and thus improper to
consideration of, the services in question." 729
F.2d, at 156.5 This, concluded the Court of
Appeals, would exclude most handicapped
newborns because their handicaps are not
normally irrelevant to the need for medical
serviees. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals thought that the "otherwise
qualified" limitation should not be applied in the
"comparatively fluid context of medical
treatment decisions" because "[w]here the
handicapping condition is related to the
condition(s) to be treated, it will rarely,
if ever, be possible to say with certainty
that a partieular decision was 'discriminatory.'" <i>Id.,</i> at
156-157.<p>

Having identified these perceived incongruities between the language of
 504 and
the potential regulation of medical decisions regarding handicapped
newborns, the
Court of Appeals concluded that "[b]efore
ruling that congress intended to spawn this
type of litigation under section 504, we
would want more proof than is apparent
from the face of the statute." <i>Id.,</i> at 157.
Thus, the Court of Appeals turned to the
legislative history, where it again found
nothing to persuade it that Congress intended  504 to apply to medical
treatment of handicapped infants and hence to enter a
field so traditionally occupied by the States.
Neither did it consider the current administrative interpretation of
 504 to be a long-standing agency construction calling for
judicial deference. In the Court of Appeals' view, therefore, the section
was inapplicable to medical treatment decisions regarding the newborn
absent some further indication of congressional intent.<p>

I disagree with this conclusion, which the
Court of Appeals adhered to in the case
before us now. Looking first at the language of the statute, I agree with
the Court of Appeals' preliminary conclusion
that handicapped newborns are handicapped individuals covered by the Act.
There is no reason for importing an age
limitation into the statutory definition, and
this Court has previously stated that
" 504 protects handicapped persons of all
ages from discrimination in a variety of
programs and activities receiving federal
financial assistance." <i>Smith v. Robinson,</i>
468 U.S. 992, 1016-1017, 104 S.Ct. 3457,
3472, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984).<sup>6</sup> This leaves
the critical question whether a
handicapped infant can ever be "otherwise qualified" for medical treatment
and hence possibly subjected to unlawful discrimination when he or she is
denied such treatment.<sup>7</sup><p>

It may well be that our prior consideration of this language has implied
that the Court of Appeals' construction is correct.
In <i>Southeastern Community College v.
Davis,</i> 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S.Ct. 2361,
2367, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979), we held that
"[a]n otherwise qualified person is one who
is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap."
This formulation may be read as implying that
where a handicapped person meets all of
the requirements normally necessary to receive a program's benefits
regardless of his or her handicap, he or she is otherwise
qualified because that handicap does not
interfere with and is thus irrelevant to his
or her qualification for the program.
Thus, the Court of Appeals' view -- that refusing treatment that is called
for only because of the handicapping condition cannot constitute
discrimination on the basis of
handicap since there will be no similarly
situated nonhandicapped newborn, <i>i.e.,</i> one
who needs the same treatment -- draws support from our holding in
<i>Davis</i> since it turns on the same underlying perception
that discrimination occurs only when the
handicapping condition is irrelevant to the
qualification for the program.<p>

Even under the Court of Appeals' interpretation of "otherwise qualified,"
however, it does not follow that  504 may
never apply to medical treatment decisions
for the newborn. An esophageal obstruction, for example, would not be part
and parcel of the handicap of a baby suffering
from Down's syndrome, and the infant
would benefit from and is thus otherwise
qualified for having the obstruction removed in spite of the handicap.
In this case, the treatment is completely unrelated
to the baby's handicapping condition. If an
otherwise normal child would be given the
identical treatment, so should the handicapped child if discrimination
on the basis of the handicap is to be avoided.<sup>8</sup><p>

It would not be difficult to multiply examples like this. And even if it
is true that in the great majority of cases the handicap
itself will constitute the need for treatment, I doubt that this
consideration or any
other mentioned by the Court of Appeals
justifies the wholesale conclusion that
 504 never applies to newborn infants
with handicaps. That some or most failures to treat may not fall within
 504, that discerning which failures to treat are
discriminatory may be difficult, and that
applying  504 in this area may intrude
into the traditional functions of the State
do not support the categorical conclusion
that the section may never be applied to
medical decisions about handicapped infants. And surely the absence in the
legislative history of any consideration of handicapped newborns does not
itself narrow the reach of the statutory language. See <i>Jefferson County
Pharmaceutical Assn. v.
Abbott Laboratories,</i> 460 U.S. 150, 159-162, and n. 18, 103 S.Ct. 1011,
1017-1019, and n. 18, 74 L.Ed.2d 882 (1983). Furthermore, the broad
remedial purpose of the section would be undermined by excluding
handicapped infants from its coverage; and
if, as the plurality indicates, <i>ante,</i> at 2120,
the Secretary has substantial leeway to
explore areas in which discrimination
against the handicapped poses serious
problems and to devise regulations to prohibit the discrimination, it is
appropriate to take note of the Secretary's present view
that  504 properly extends to the subject
matter at issue here. Thus, I believe that
the Court of Appeals in <i>University Hospital</i> incorrectly concluded
that  504 may never apply to medical treatment decisions
concerning handicapped newborn infants.
Where a decision regarding medical treatment for a handicapped newborn
properly falls within the statutory provision, it
should be subject to the constraints set
forth in  504. Consequently, I would reverse the judgment below.<p>

<h2 align=center>III</h2>

Having determined that the stated basis
for the Court of Appeals' holding in <i>University Hospital</i> was
incorrect and that the
decision below cannot be supported by
<i>University Hospital's</i> blanket prohibition,
I would remand the case to the Court of
Appeals. Respondents have, as the plurality's opinion itself demonstrates,
raised significant issues aside from the threshold
statutory issue presented here. There are,
for example, substantial questions regarding the scope of the Secretary's
statutory authority in this area and whether these
particular regulations are consistent with
the statute. I would decline to reach and
decide these questions for the first time in
this Court without the benefit of the
lower courts' deliberations.<sup>9</sup> The plurality, however, has
chosen to reach out and address one of those subsidiary issues.
Because the plurality has resolved that issue in a manner that I find
indefensible on its own terms, I too address it.<p>

The plurality concludes that the four mandatory provisions of the final
regulations are invalid because there is no "'rational connection between
the facts found and the choice made.'" <i>Motor Vehicle
Mfrs. Assn., Inc. v. State Farm Mutual
Automobile Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103
S.Ct. 2856, 2866, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983)
(quoting <i>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.
United States,</i> 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct.
239, 24S246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962)). The
basis for this conclusion is the plurality's perception that two and only
two wholly
discrete categories of decisions are the object of the final regulations:
(1) decisions made by hospitals to treat or not treat
where parental consent has been given and
(2) decisions made by hospitals to refer or
not to refer a case to the state child protective services agency where
parental consent has been withheld.<sup>10</sup> Since the Secretary has
not specifically pointed to discriminatory actions that provably resulted
from either of these two specific types of
decisions, the plurality finds that the Secretary's conclusion that
discrimination is occurring is unsupported factually. The plurality's
characterization of the Secretary's rationale, however, oversimplifies
both the complexity of the situations to which the
regulations are addressed and the reasoning of the Secretary.<p>

First, the Secretary's proof that treatment is in fact being withheld
from handicapped infants is unquestioned by the plurality. It is
therefore obvious that whoever is making them, decisions to withhold
treatment from such infants are in fact
being made. This basic understanding is
critical to the Secretary's further reasoning, and the discussion
accompanying the proposed regulations clearly indicates that
this was the Secretary's starting point.
See 48 Fed.Reg. 30847-30848 (1983). Proceeding with this factual
understanding, the next question is whether such withholding of treatment
constitutes prohibited discrimination under  504 in some or all
situations. It is at this point that the plurality errs. In the
plurality's view, only two narrow paradigmatic types of decisions were
contemplated by the Secretary as potentially constituting discrimination
in violation of
the statute. See <i>ante,</i> at 2113. The plurality does not explain,
however, precisely what in the Secretary's discussion gives
rise to this distillation, and my reading of
the explanation accompanying the regulations does not leave me with so
limited a view of the Secretary's concerns.<p>

The studies cited by the Seeretary in
support of the regulations and other literature concerning medical
treatment in this
area generally portray a decisionmaking
process in which the parents and the doctors and often other concerned
persons as well are involved -- although the parental
decision to consent or not is obviously the
critical one.<sup>11</sup> Thus, the parental consent
decision does not occur in a vacuum. In
fact, the doctors (directly) and the hospital
(indirectly) in most cases participate in the
formulation of the final parental decision
and in many cases substantially influence
that decision.<sup>l2</sup> Consequently, discrimination against a
handicapped infant may assume guises other than the outright refusal to
treat once parental consent has been
given. Discrimination may occur when a
doctor encourages or fails to discourage a
parental decision to refuse consent to treatment for a handicapped child
when the doctor would discourage or actually oppose
a parental decision to refuse consent to the
same treatment for a nonhandicapped child.
Or discrimination may occur when a doctor
makes a discriminatory treatment recommendation that the parents simply
follow.
Alternatively, discrimination may result
from a hospital's explicit laissez-faire attitude about this type of
discrimination on the part of doctors.<p>


Contrary to the plurality's constrained
view of the Secretary's justification for the
regulations, the stated basis for those regulations reveals that the
Secretary was cognizant of this more elusive disrimination. For example,
the evidenee cited most
extensively by the Secretary in his initial
proposal of these regulations was a study
of attitudes of practicing and teaching pediatricians and pediatric
surgeons. See 48 Fed.Reg. 30848 (1983) (citing Shaw, Randolph, &amp;
Manard, Ethical Issues in Pediatrie Surgery: A National Survey of
Pediatricians and Pediatric Surgeons, 60 Pediatrics 588 (1977)). This
study indicated that a substantial number of these doctors
(76.8% of pediatrie surgeons and 49.5% of
pediatricians) would "acquiesce in parents' decision to refuse consent
for surgery
in a newborn with intestinal atresia if the
infant also had ... Down's syndrome."
<i>Id.,</i> at 590. It also indicated that a substantial minority
(23.6% of pediatric surgeons and 13.2% of pediatricians) would in
fact encourage parents to refuse consent to
surgery in this situation and that only a
small minority (3.4% of pediatric surgeons
and 15.8% of pediatricians) would attempt
to get a court order mandating surgery if
the parents refused consent. In comparison, only a small minority
(7.9% of pediatric surgeons and 2.6% of pediatricians) would
acquiesce in parental refusal to treat intestinal atresia in an infant
with no other anomaly. And a large majority (78.3% of
pediatric surgeons and 88.4% of pediatricians) would try to get a court
order directing surgery if parental consent were
withheld for treatment of a treatable malignant tumor. The Secretary thus
recognized that there was evidence that doctors
would act differently in terms of attempts
to affect or override parental decisions depending on whether the infant
was handicapped.<p>

Based on this evidenee, the Seeretary
conceded that "[t]he full extent of discriminatory and life-threatening
practices toward handicapped infants is not yet
known" but concluded "that for even a
single infant to die due to lack of an adequate notice and complaint
procedure is unacceptable." 48 Fed.Reg. 30847 (1983).
Thus, the Secretary promulgated the regulations at issue here. These
regulations, in relevant part, require that a notice of the 
federal policies against discrimination on
the basis of handicap be posted in a place
where a hospital's health care professionals
will see it. This requirement is, as the
Secretary concluded, "[c]onsistent with the
Department's intent to target the notice to
nurses and other health care professionals." App. 25. The notice
requirement, therefore, may reasonably be read as
aimed at fostering an awareness by health
care professionals of their responsibility
not to act in a discriminatory manner with
respect to medical treatment decisions for
handicapped infants. The second requirement of the regulations, that
state agencies provide mechanisms for requiring
and reporting medical neglect of handicapped children, is also consistent
with the Seeretary's focus on discrimination in the
form of discriminatory reporting.<sup>13</sup><p>

I therefore perceive a rational connection
between the faets found by the Secretary
and the regulatory choice made. The Secretary identified an existing
practice that there was reason to believe resulted from
discrimination on the basis of handicap.
Given this finding, the amorphous nature
of much of the possible discrimination, the
Secretary's profession that the regulations
are appropriate no matter how limited the
problem,<sup>14</sup> and the focus of the regulations
on loci where unlawful discrimination
seems most likely to occur and on persons
likely to be responsible for it, I conclude
that these regulations are not arbitrary and
capricious and that the Court errs in striking them down on that basis.
Although the Secretary's path here may be marked
with "'less than ideal clarity,'" we will
uphold such a decision "'if the agency's
path may reasonably be discerned.'" <i>Motor Vehicles Mfrs Assn.,</i>
463 U.S., at 43,
103 S.Ct., at 2867 (quoting <i>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight
System, Inc.,</i> 419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct.
438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974)).<p>

The plurality also objects to the regulations' requirement concerning the
state
protective agencies' reporting procedures
on another ground. Specifically, the plurality finds that this requirement
is in  fact
a substantive prescription rather than a
prohibition of discrimination. The plurality
bases this conclusion on the fact that the
regulation sets forth specific procedures
that must be adopted by state agencies.<p>

The plurality's conclusion disregards the
Secretary's explanation for this requirement. In the preamble to the
proposed regulations, the Secretary explicitly stated:<p>

<blockquote>
"The Department has determined that
under every state's law, failure of parents to provide necessary,
medically indicated care to a child is either explicitly
cited as grounds for action by the state
to compel treatment or is impiicitly covered by the state statute.
These state
statutes also provide for appropriate administrative and judicial
enforeement authorities to prevent such instances of
medical neglect, including requirements
that medical personnel report suspected
cases to the state child protective services agency, agency access to
medical files, immediate investigations and authority
to compel treatment." 48 Fed.Reg.
30848 (1983).<p>
</blockquote>

This finding was repeated in the statement
accompanying the final regulations:<p>

<blockquote>
"Although there are some variations
among state child protective statutes, all
have the following basic elements: a requirement that health care
providers report suspected cases of child abuse or
neglect, including medical neglect; a
mechanism for timely receipt of such reports; a process for
administrative inquiry and investigation to determine the
facts; and the authority and responsibility to seek an appropriate court
order to
remedy the apparent abuse and neglect,
if it is found to exist." 49 Fed.Reg. 1627
(1984).<p>
</blockquote>

The regulations, in turn, require that the
State provide these same serviees with respect to medical neglect of
handicapped
infants. See 45 CFR  84.55(c) (1985).
The only additional requirements imposed by the regulations involve
provisions enabling the Department itself to review
for compliance with the nondiscrimination
requirements. Consequently, the regulations simply track the existing
state procedures found to exist by the Secretary, requiring that funded
state agencies provide
those same procedures for handicapped
children. The fact that the regulations
specify the procedures that are necessary
to ensure an absence of discrimination and
do not instead speak in "nondiscrimination"
terms is irrelevant. The substance of the
requirement is nondiscrimination. The plurality's conclusion in this
regard, however,
apparently rests on a determination that
implementation of a nondiscrimination mandate may be accomplished in
only one form -- even if the same result may be accomplished by another
route. See <i>ante,</i> at
2119, n. 26. I would not elevate regulatory
form over statutory substance in this manner. In sum, the plurality's
determination
that the regulations were inadequately supported and explained as a
matter of administrative law does not withstand examination of the
Secretary's discussion of the
underlying problem and of the contours of
the regulations themselves.<p>

<h2 align=center>IV</h2>

My disagreement with the plurality in
this case does not end here, however. For
even under its chosen rationale, I find its
ultimate conclusion dubious. Having assiduously restricted its discussion
to the validity of the regulations only, the plurality
ends up concluding expansively that not
only the regulations but also other investigations taken by the Secretary
independent of the regulations are invalid. Thus, the
Court apparently enjoins the Secretary's
on-site investigations as well as "the regu-
lations which purport to authorize a continuation of them." <i>Ante,</i>
at 2123. And the plurality rests this action on the conclusion
that the lower eourts "correctly held that
these investigative actions were not authorized by the statute."
<i>Ibid.</i><p>

I am at a loss to understand the plurality's reasoning in this respect.
In construing the judgment below, the plurality
appears to conclude that, although the injunction entered by the Distriet
Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals did not
purport to prohibit all actions by the Secretary under the statute,
the injunetion did in
faet extend beyond merely these particular
regulations. Thus, the plurality indicates
that the judgment below applied as well to
actions that "resemble," "parallel," or are
"along [the] lines [of]" the regulations.
<i>Ante,</i> at 2111-2112, n. 11. The plurality
further defines what actions it believes the
Court of Appeals and District Court contemplated: "[T]he injunction
forbids continuation or initiation of regulatory and investigative
activity directed at instances in
which parents have refused consent to
treatment and, if the Secretary were to
undertake such action, efforts to seek compliance with affirmative
requirements imposed on state child protective services
agencies." <i>Ante,</i> at 2111, n. 11.<p>

Aside from the fact that I see absolutely
nothing in either the District Court's or the
Court of Appeals' judgment that would
support a constrained reading of the broadly phrased relief awarded by
the District Court and affirmed without modification by
the Court of Appeals,<sup>16</sup> I have some doubt
as to how different the Court's holding
today is from a holding that  504 gives
HHS no authority whatsoever over decisions to treat handicapped infants.
The plurality's lack of coherence on this crucial
point raises substantial doubts as to the
reach of the holding and as to the basis for
that holding.<p>

Finally, I am puzzled as to how and why
the plurality's determination that the regulations are invalid because
they are arbitrary and capricious extends to other actions not taken
under the regulations. The
plurality apparently would enjoin all enforcement actions by the
Secretary in situations in which parents have refused to consent to
treatment. See <i>ante,</i> at 2111, n. 11.
Yet it is not clear to me that the
plurality's basis for invalidating these
regulations would extend to all such situations. I do not see, for
example, why the
plurality's finding that the Secretary did
not adequately support his conclusion that
failures to report refusals to treat likely
result from discrimination means that such
a conclusion will <i>never</i> be justified. The
Secretary might be able to prove that a
particular hospital generally fails to report
nontreatment of handicapped babies for a
specific treatment where it reports nontreatment of nonhandicapped
babies for the same treatment. In essence, a determination that these
regulations were inadequately supported factually would not
seem to be properly extended beyond actions taken pursuant to these
regulations:
The fact that the Secretary has not adequately justified generalized
action under
the regulations should not mean that individualized action in
appropriate circumstances is precluded.<p>

<h2 align=center>V</h2>

In sum, the plurality today mischaracterizes the judgment below and,
based on that mischaracterization, is sidetracked from
the straightforward issue of statutory construction that this case
presents. The plurality incorrectly resolves an issue that was
not fully addressed by the parties, gives no
guidance to the Secretary or the other parties as to the proper
construction of the governing statute, and fails adequately to
explain the precise scope of the holding or
how that holding is supported under the
plurality's chosen rationale. From this
misguided effort, I dissent.<p>

<hr>

<h2>Footnotes:</h2>

1. I disagree with the plurality's conclusion that
"[t]he complaints in this case did not challenge
the Department's authority to regulate all treatment decisions, but more
precisely the mandatory provisions of the Final Rules and enforcement
activity along those lines but undertaken
pursuant to the Department's 'general authority'
to enforce  504." <i>Ante,</i> at 2111, n. 11. Although focusing most
extensively on the regulations and pending HHS investigations, the
complaint specifically cited the <i>University Hospital</i>
holding that "Section 504 [does] not apply to
'treatment decisions involving defective newborn infants.'" App. 138.
The complaint also
specifically requested that the District Court "issue a preliminary
and permanent injunction
prohibiting the defendant from enforcing her
final rule embodied in 45 CFR  84.55, 49 Feds
Reg. 1622, et seq. (Jan. 12, 1984), and prohibiting defendant from
otherwise acting pursuant
to the claimed authority of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in regard to the medical treatment of
infants with birth defects." <i>Id,</i>
at 159. The complaint thus requested both invalidation of the
regulations and an injunction against all other actions by the Secretary
in this area.<p>

2. The Court of Appeals' brief order affirming
the District Court's judgment, although characterizing that judgment
generally as having
struck down the regulations, cited <i>University
Hospital</i> and made no changes in the broad
relief awarded by the District Court. The Court
of Appeals gave absolutely no indication that it
was construing the District Court's judgment
one whit less broadly than that judgment's language indicated. Nowhere,
therefore, is there a
justification for the plurality's reconstructive
reading of the Court of Appeals' judgment.<p>

3. I note in this regard that the parties as well do
not appear to have contemplated the more limited reading of the judgment
below adopted by the plurality. See Brief for Petitioner 9; Brief
for Respondents American Hospital Association
et al. 4; Brief for Respondents American Medical Association et al. 14.<p>

4. I would not avoid the issue of the validity of
<i>University Hospital</i> even if the judgment below
were limited to invalidation of these regulations. Given that the
judgment below, whether
it extends as far as <i>University Hospital</i> or not,
was based on the <i>University Hospital</i> view that
all regulation of medical treatment decisions is
outside the Secretary's  504 authority because
of the nature of those decisions, I believe that
the better approach here would be for the Court
to determine the correctness of <i>University Hospital</i> in any case.<p>

5. The Court of Appeals first addressed and reserved the question
whether the hospital or its
functions comprised a program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance. Noting that
this was a fact-specific inquiry, cf. <i>Grove City
College v. Bell,</i> 465 U.S. 555, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 79
L.Ed.2d 516 (1984), the Court of Appeals assumed that the entire hospital
was covered by  504 and proceeded to consider "whether, assuming the
entire hospital is covered by section
504, the statute authorizes the type of investigation initiated here."
729 F.2d, at 151.<p>

I also do not consider whether or under what
circumstances hospitals or hospital neonatal
programs may constitute programs or activities
receiving federal financial assistance. The judgment of the District
Court which was affirmed
by the Court of Appeals does not set forth guidelines for interpreting
this language in this context: It merely enjoins actions directed at such
programs or activities. The regulations as well
simply adopt the statutory language without interpreting it. Thus,
I assume here that the
 504 strictures would be applied only to appropriate programs or
activities, and I therefore
would leave discussion of this fact-specific issue
for further proceedings. I would not now hold
that  504 may never apply on this basis.<p>

6. Although infants with birth defects are clearly<
handicapped individuals covered by  504,
there is one manner in which they may differ
from most other handicapped individuals for
 504 purposes. Specifically, they may have a
combination of conditions -- some of which are
medically correctable and some of which are
not. In older handicapped individuals, medically correctable conditions
may have been corrected so that only irreparable handicapping
conditions remain. In a newborn infant, however, both correctable and
incorrectable conditions may exist. Thus, since both of these may
interfere with major life activities, both types of
conditions may be considered to be handicaps.
In this context, however, it might make more
sense to consider as handicaps only those conditions that cannot be
medically treated to the
point that they will not impair major life activities. For such
correctable conditions would not
be likely to cause the infant to be regarded as
handicapped. In any case, I believe that defining an infant's handicap
may well be a delicate
problem and one that deserves some consideration.<p>

7. It would appear that for an infant to be qualified for treatment his
or her parents must have
consented to such treatment. For the purposes
of this discussion of whether the Court of Appeals was correct that
medical treatment decisions may never be regulated by  504, I assume
that parental consent has been given and that
the arguably discriminatory treatment decision
is being made by the hospital or doctor. The
Court of Appeals in <i>University Hospital</i> concentrated on the nature of
these decisions in concluding that  504 may not properly be applied,
and I concentrate on that as well. That a situation in which treatment
is refused where parental consent has been given may not have been
shown to have arisen does not undermine this
assumption here. The critical question is
whether the operative provisions of  504 may
ever apply here given the nature of the decision.<p>

For the purposes of addressing the Court of
Appeals' <i>University Hospital</i> analysis, the most
straightforward fact situation to consider is one
in which the benefit provided is the medical
treatment itself and in which a hospital refuses
treatment in the face of parental consent. In
this context, the Court of Appeals' conclusion
that the nature of the decisions themselves precludes application of
 504 may be addressed
with maximum simplicity. I note, however,
that it may well be that the benefits provided by
hospitals and doctors and covered by  504 extend beyond treatment
itself. For example, one benefit provided by hospitals and doctors to
patients who cannot make their own medical
treatment decisions may be medical advice in
those patients' best interest to those who must
ultimately make the relevant medical treatment
decisions. To the extent that the provision of
this benefit is a program or activity covered by
the statute, I would think that the statute requires that the same
advice be given to parents
of a handicapped baby as to the parents of a
similarly situated nonhandicapped baby. Another benefit provided may be
the reporting of nontreatment to the relevant state agency in the
case of a parental decision not to treat. Again,
to the extent that the provision of this benefit is
a program or activity covered by the statute, see
n. 13, <i>infra,</i> I would think that  504 requires
that the hospital or doctor report nontreatment
of a handicapped baby when it would report the
denial of the same treatment for a nonhandicapped baby.<p>

My conclusions in this regard are buttressed
by my view of  504's coverage in the case of a
medical treatment decision regarding a black
baby. If a hospital or doctor advised different
or less efficacious treatment for a black baby
than for a white baby, I believe that this would
be discrimination under the statute. Similarly,
a failure to report a parental decision not to
treat because of race would seem to me to be
illegally discriminatory -- assuming that this decision otherwise came
within the statute.<p>

In sum, although these additional situations
present the same issue as to when a handicapped baby is otherwise
qualified and when such a baby is subjected to discrimination as
does the direct example of a refusal to treat and
although it may well be that it would be in these
contexts that the statute would most likely be
given effect, for simplicity's sake I have centered my discussion of
<i>University Hospital</i> on
the refusal-to-treat example.<p>

8. There are substantial arguments that could be
made that the Court of Appeals too narrowly
read the statute. It could be argued, for example, that the benefit
provided by hospitals is not
defined in terms of specific treatments. Rather
the benefit is "general medical care for whatever happens to need
treating." If this is the
benefit, then a much broader application of the
statute in this context is reasonable. Alternatively, even if the
benefit is defined more narrowly, "reasonable accommodation" might
require more than mere impartial dispensing of
identical treatment. See <i>Alexander v. Choate,</i>
469 U.S. 287, 299-300, and nn. 19, 20, 105 S.Ct.
712, 719-720, and nn. 19, 20, 83 L.Ed.2d 661
(1985). I need not resolve this issue of the exact
meaning of  504 and <i>Davis</i> in this context,
however, because my conclusion that <i>University
Hospital's</i> broad reasoning was incorrect does
not depend on it. Although I do not resolve
these issues, I note that while the more expansive interpretations
seem consistent with the
interpretation adopted by the Secretary in the
regulations, the more restrictive one does not.
See 45 CFR pt. 84, Appendix C, &#182;(a) (1985).<p>

9. In addition, although the Secretary did not
brief the merits of respondents' claim that the
regulations are invalid because arbitrary and
capricious, the Secretary did indicate his view
that this claim in its current form is not properly in the case and that
it is inadequate on its
face. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, n. 6.
Specifically, the Secretary first asserts that
respondents' argument as to the lack of factual
basis involving situations in which parents have
consented to treatment was not raised in the
complaint. See App. 146 (challenging lack of
showing of instances where "erroneous" parental decisions were made
and where medical
authorities did not take proper measures under
state law). Thus, the Secretary contends that
the first major claim addressed and relied on by
the plurality was never properly raised. Second, the Secretary contends
that these are interpretative regulations that impose no new
substantive duties, see 49 Fed.Reg. 1628 (1984), and
that no factual basis for their issuance need
therefore be given. Cf. 5 U.S.C.  553(b).<p>

These contentions, although not perhaps representing a procedural bar
to our reaching this
claim, see <i>ante,</i> at 2113, n. 14, do provide an
additional sign that the plurality's resolution of
this case rests on shaky ground.<p>

10. At this point in the case, as the plurality
observes, all parties concerned agree that parental decisions are not
included in  504's application. See <i>ante,</i> at 2114.<p>

11. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Duff &amp; Campbell, Moral and Ethical
Dilemmas in the Special-Care Nursery, 289
N.Eng.J.Med. 890 (1973). See also Gross, Cox,
Tatyrek, Pollay, &amp; Barnes, Early Management
and Decision Making for the Treatment of Myelomeningocele,
72 Pediatrics 450 (1983).<p>

12. Presumably, the program or activity that
 504 would apply to in this context would be
the hospital's neonatal program of medical care
or the hospital's program of medical care generally. In either case,
actions of both doctors and
hospitals that cause or permit discriminatory
decisions that are taken as part of the program
or activity would be subject to  504's constraints.<p>

13. The plurality reserves the question whether
reporting would be a program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance, ante, at 2118-2119, n. 25, and I follow that course.<p>

14. The plurality itself says that "regulations may
be imposed for preventative or prophylactic reasons," <i>ante,</i> at
2121, but concludes that the Secretary here proceeded based on the
perception of an actual problem rather than a need for
prophylactic rules. To me, however, the Secretary's statement that
the rules are appropriate if
necessary for even one problem situation makes
the plurality's distinction in this respect questionable: The line
between a prophylactic rule and a rule that draws its justification
from the likely existence of even one unlawful action
seems to me a very fine one.<p>

15. See nn. 1-2, supra, and accompanying text.<p>

Justice O'CONNOR, dissenting.<p>

I fully agree with Justice WHITE's conclusion that the only question properly
before us is whether the Court of Appeals
correctly concluded that the Secretary has
no power under 29 U.S.C.  794 to regulate
medical treatment decisions concerning
handicapped newborn infants. I also agree
that application of established principles of
statutory construction and of the appropriate standard for judicial
review of agency action leads inescapably to the conclusion that the
Secretary has the authority to
regulate in this area. Because, however, I
see no need at this juncture to address the
details of the regulations or to assess
whether they are sufficiently rational to
survive review under 6 U.S.C.  706(2)(A), I
join only parts I, II, IV, and V of Justice
WHITE's dissent.<p>

<h2>DOE et al v. BOLTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF GEORGIA, et al.</h2>

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA<p>

No. 70-40. Argued December 13, 1971 -- Reargued October 11,
1972 -- Decided January 22, 1973<p>

Georgia law proscribes an abortion except as performed by a duly
licensed Georgia physician when necessary in "his best clinical
judgment" because continued pregnancy would endanger a pregnant woman's life or
injure her health; the fetus would likely be
born with serious defect; or the pregnancy resulted from rape.
 26-1202 (a) of Ga. Criminai Code. In addition to a requirement
that the patient be a Georgia resident and certain other requirements, the
statutory scheme poses three procedural conditions in
 26-1202 (b): (1) that the abortion be performed in a hospital
accredited by the Joint Committee on Accreditation of Hospitals
(JCAH); (2) that the procedure be approved by the hospital
staff abortion committee; and (3) that the performing physician's
judgment be confirmed by independent examinations of the patient
by two other licensed physicians. Appellant Doe, an indigent
married Georgia citizen, who was denied an abortion after eight
weeks of pregnancy for failure to meet any of the  26-1202 (a)
conditions, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, contending
that the Geogia laws were unconstitutional. Others joining in
the complaint included Georgia-licensed physicians (who claimed
that the Georgia statutes "chilled and deterred" their practices),
registered nurses, clergymen, and social workers. Though holding
that all the plaintiffs had standing, the Distriet Court ruled that
only Doe presented a justiciable controversy. In Doe's case the
court gave declaratory, but not injunctive, relief, invalidating as an
infringement of privacy and personal liberty the limitation to the
three situations specified in  26-1202 (a) and certain other provisions but
holding that the State's interest in health protection
and the existence of a "<i>potential</i> of independent human existence"
justified regulation through  26-1202 (b) of the "manner of performance as
well as the quality of the final decision to abort."
The appellants, claiming entitlement to broader relief, directly
appealed to this Court. <i>Held:</i><p>

1. Doe's case presents a live, justiciable controversy and she has
standing to sue, <i>Roe v. Wade, ante,</i> p. ----, as do the
physician-appellants (who, unlike the physician in <i>Wade</i>, were not
charged with abortion violations), and it is therefore unneccesary to resolve
the issue of the other appellants' standing. Pp. 7-9.<p>

2. A woman's constitutional right to an abortion is not absolute.
<i>Roe v. Wade, supra.</i> P. 9.<p>

3. The requirement that a physician's decision to perform an
abortion must rest upon "his best clinical judgment" of its necessity is not
unconstitutionally vague, since that judgment may be
made in the light of <i>all</i> the attendant circumstances. <i>United
States v. Vuitch,</i> 402 U.S. 62, 71-72. Pp. 10-12.<p>

4. The three procedural conditions in  26-1202 (b) violate the
Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 12-19.<p>

___(a) The JCAH accreditation requirement is invalid, since
the State has not shown that only hospitals (let alone those with
JCAH accreditation) meet its interest in fully protecting the patient; and a
hospital requirement failing to exclude the first trimester of pregnancy would
be invalid on that ground alone, see
<i>Roe v. Wade, supra.</i> Pp. 12-15.<p>

___(b) Tbe interposition of a hospital committee on abortion,
a procedure not applicable as a matter of state criminal law to
other surgical situations, is unduly restrictive of the patient's
rights, which are already safeguarded by her personal physician.
Pp. 15-17.<p>

___(c) Required acquiescence by two co-practitioners also has
no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes
on her physicians right to practice. Pp. 17-19.<p>

5. The Georgia residence requirement violates the Privileges
and Immunities Clause by denying protection to persons who enter
Georgia for medical services there. Pp. 19-20.<p>

6. Appellants' equal protection argument centering on the three
procedural conditions in  26-1202 (b), invalidated on other
grounds, is without merit. P. 20.<p>

7. No ruling is made on the question of injunctive relief. Cf.
<i>Roe v. Wade, supra.</i> P. 20.<p>

319 F. Supp 1048, modified and affirmed.<p>

<h1 align=center>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</h1>

<p align=center>
No. 70-40<p>

<p align=center>
Mary Doe et al., Appellants,<br>
v.<br>
Arthur K. Bolton, as Attorney General of the State    
of Georgia, et al.<p>

On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia.<p>

<p align=center>
[January 22, 1973]<p>

Mr JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the
Court.<p>

In this appeal the criminal abortion statutes recently
enacted in Georgia are challenged on constitutional
grounda The statutes are  26-1201 through 26-1203
of the State's Criminal Code, formulated by Georgia
Laws, 1968 Session, 1249, 1277-1280. In <i>Roe v. Wade,
ante,</i> we today have struck down, as constitutionally
defective, the Texas criminal abortion statutes that are
representative of provisions long in effect in a majority of
our States. The Georgia legislation, however, is different
and merits separate consideration.<p>

<p align=center>
<b>I</b><p>

The statutes in question are reproduced as Appendix A,
post ____.<a name="ref1"><a href="#foot1">(1)</a> As the appellants
acknowledge,<a name="ref2"><a href="#foot2">(2)</a> the 1968
statutes are patterned upon the American Law Institute's
Model Penal Code,  230.3 (Proposed Official Draft,
1962), reproduced as Appendix B, post ____. The ALI
proposal has served as the model for recent legislation
in approximately one-fourth of our States.<a name="ref3"><a
href="#foot3">(3)</a> The new
Georgia provisions replaced statutory law that had been
in effect for more than 90 years. Georgia Laws 1876,
No. 130,  2, at 113.<a name="ref4"><a href="#foot4">(4)</a> The predecessor
statute paralleled
the Texas legislation considered in <i>Roe v. Wade, ante,</i>
and made all abortions criminal except those necessary
"to preserve the life" of the pregnant woman. The new
statutes have not been tested on constitutional grounds
in the Georgia state courts.<p>

Section 26-1201, with a referenced exception, makes
abortion a crime, and  26-1203 provides that a person
convicted of that crime shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one
nor more than 10 years. Section 26-1202 (a) states the exception and removes
from
1201's definition of criminal abortion, and thus makes
noncriminal, an abortion "performed by a physician duly
licensed" in Georgia when, "based upon his best clinical
judgment . . . an abortion is necessary beause<p>

"(1) A continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the pregnant
woman or would
seriously and permanently injure her health, or<p>

"(2) The fetus would very likely be born with
a grave, permanent, and irremediable mental or
physical defect, or<p>

"(3) The pregnancy resulted from forcible or
statutory rape."<a name="ref5"><a href="#foot5">(5)</a><p>

Section 26-1202 also requires, by numbered subdivisions
of its subsection (b), that, for an abortion to be authorized or performed as a
noncriminal procedure, additional
conditions must be fulfilled. These are (1) and (2) residence of the woman in
Georgia; (3) reduction to writing
of the performing physician's medical judgement that an
abortion is justified for one or more of the reasons specified by 26-1202 (a),
with written concurrence in that
judgment by at least two other Georgia-licensed physicians, based upon their
separate personal medical examinations of the woman; (4) performance of the
abortion
in a hospital licensed by the State Board of Health and
also accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; (5)
advance approval by an abortion
committee of not less than three members of the hospital's staff; (6)
certifications in a rape situation; and
(7), (8), and (9) maintenance and confidentiality of
records. There is a provision (subsection (e)) for judicial determination of
the legality of a proposed abortion
on petition of the judicial circuit law officer or of a close
relative, as therein defined, of the unborn child, and for
expeditious hearing of that petition. There is also a
provision (subsection (e)) giving a hospital the right not
to admit an abortion patient and giving any physician
and any hospitial employee or staff member the right, on
moral or religious grounds, not to participate in the
procedure.<p>

<p align=center>
<b>II</b><p>

On April 16, 1970, Mary Doe,<a name="ref6"><a href="#foot6">(6)</a> 23 other
individuals
(nine described as Georgia-licensed physicians, seven as
nurses registered in the State, five as clergymen, and two
as social workers), and two nonprofit Georgia corporations that advocate
abortion reform, instituted this federal action in the Northern District of
Georgia against
the State's attorney general, the district attorney of
Fulton County, and the chief of police of the city of
Atlanta. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment
that the Georgia abortion statutes were unconstitutional
in their entirety. They also sought injunctive relief
restraining the defendants and their successors from enforcing the statutes.<p>

Mary Doe alleged:<p>

"(1) She was a 22-year-old Georgia citizen, married, and nine weeks pregnant.
She had three living
children. The two older ones had been placed in a
foster home because of Doe's poverty and inability
to care for them. The youngest, born July 19, 1969,
had been placed for adoption. Her husband had
recently abandoned her and she was forced to live
with her indigent parents and their eight children.
She and her husband, however, had become reconciled. He was a construction
worker employed only
sporadically. She had been a mental patient at the
State Hospital. She had been advised that an abortion could be performed on her
with less danger to
her health than if she gave birth to the child she
was carrying. She would be unable to care for or
support the new child.<p>

"(2) On March 25, 1970, she applied to the Abortion Committee of Grady Memorial
Hospital, Atlanta, for a therapeutic abortion under  26-1202.
Her application was denied 16 days later, on April
10, when she was eight weeks pregnant, on the
ground that her situation was not one described in
 26-1202 (a).<a name="ref7"><a href="#foot7">(7)</a><p>

"(3) Because her application was denied, she was
forced either to relinquish 'her right to decide when
and how many children she will bear' or to seek an
abortion that was il]egal under the Georgia statutes.
This invaded her rights of privacy and liberty in
matters related to family, marriage, and sex, and
deprived her of the right to choose whether to
bear children. This was a violation of rights guaranteed her by the First,
Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and
Fourteenth Amendments. The statutes also denied
her equal protection and procedural due process and,
because they were unconstitutionally vague, deterred hospitals and doctors from
performing abortions. She sued 'on her own behalf and on behalf
of all others similarly situated.'"<p>

The other plaintiffs alleged that the Georgia statutes
"chilled and deterred" them from practicing their respective professions and
deprived them of rights guaranteed
by the First, Fourth, snd Fourteenth Amendmients.
These plaintiffs also purported to sue on their own behalf
and on behalf of others similarly situated.<p>

A three-judge district court was convened. An offer
of proof as to Doe's identity was made, but the court
deemed it unnecessary to receive that proof. The case
was then tried on the pleadings and interrogatories.<p>

The District Court, <i>per curiam,</i> 319 F. Supp. 1048
(ND Ga. 1970), held that all the plaintiffs had standing
but that only Doe presented a justiciable controversy.
On the merits, the court concluded that the limitation
in the Georgia statute of the "number of reasons for
which an abortion may be sought," <i>id.,</i> at 1056, improperly restricted
Doe's rights of privacy articulated in
<i>Griswold v. Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965), and of
"personal liberty," both of which it thought "broad
enough to include the decision to abort a pregnancy,"
<i>id.,</i> at 1055. As a consequence, the court held invalid
those portions of 26-1202 (a) and (b)(3) limiting
legal abortions to the three situations speeified; 26-1202 (b)(6) relating to
certifications in a rape situstion;
and  26-1202 (c) authorizing a court test. Declaratory
relief was granted accordingly. The court, however, held
that Georgia's interest in protection of heslth, and the
existence of a "<i>potential</i> of independent human existence" (emphasis in
original), <i>id.,</i> at 1055, justified state
regulation of "the manner of performanee as well a
the quality of the final deeision to abort," <i>id.,</i> at 1056,
and it refused to strike down the other provisions of
the statutes. It denied the request for an injunction,
<i>id.,</i> at 1057.<p>

Claiming that they were entitled to an injunction and
to broader relief, the plaintiffs took a direct appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C.
1253. We postponed decision on
jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 402 U. S. 941
(1971). The defendants also purported to appeal, pursuant to  1253, but their
appeal was dismissed for want
of jurisdiction. 402 U. S. 936 (1971). We are advised
by the defendant-appellees, Brief 42, that an alternative
appeal on their part is pending in the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The extent,
therefore, to which the District Court decision was adverse to the defendants,
that is, the extent to which portions of the Georgia statutes were held to be
unconstitutional, technically is not now before
us.<a name="ref8"><a href="#foot8">(8)</a>
<i>Swarb v. Lennox,</i> 405 U. S. 191, 201 (1972).<p>

<p align=center>
<b>III</b><p>

Our decision in <i>Roe v. Wade, ante ____,</i> establishes
(1) that, despite her pseudonym, we may accept as true,
for this case, Mary Doe's existence and her pregnant
state on April 16, 1970; (2) that the constitutional issue
is substantial; (3) that the interim termination of Doe's
and all other Georgia pregnancies in existence in 1970
has not rendered the case moot; and (4) that Doe presents a justiciable
controversy and has standing to maintain the action.<p>

Inasmuch as Doe and her class are recognized, the
question whether the other appellant physicians,
nurses, clergymen, social workers, and corporations
present a justiciable controversy and have standing is
perhaps a matter of no great consequence. We conclude,
however, that the physician-appellants, who are Georgia-licensed doctors
consulted by pregnant women, also present a justiciable controversy and do
have standing despite the fact that the record does not disclose that any
one of them has been prosecuted, or threatened with
prosecution, for violation of the State's abortion statutes.
The physician is the one against whom these criminal
statutes directly operate in the event he procures an
abortion that does not meet the statutory exceptions
and conditions. The physician-appellants, therefore,
assert a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment.
They should not be required to await and undergo a
criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.
<i>Crossen v. Breckenridge,</i> 446 F. 2d 833, 839-840 (CA6
1971); <i>Poe v. Menghini,</i> 339 F. Supp. 986, 990-991
(Kans. 1972).<p>

In holding that the physicians, while theoretically possessed of standing, did
not present a justiciable controversy, the District Court seems to have relied
primarily on <i>Poe v. Ullman,</i> 367 U. S. 497 (1961). There a
sharply divided Court dismissed an appeal from a state
court on the ground that it presented no real controversy justifying the
adjudication of a constitutional issue.
But the challenged Connecticut statute, deemed to prohibit the giving of
medical advice on the use of contraceptives, had been enacted in 1879, and,
apparently with
a single exception, no one had ever been prosecuted under
it. Georgia's statute, in contrast, is recent and not
moribund. Furthermore, it is the successor to another
Georgia abortion statute under which, we are told,<a name="ref9"><a
href="#foot9">(9)</a>
physicians were prosecuted. The present case, therefore,
is closer to <i>Epperson v. Arkansas,</i> 393 U. S. 97 (1968),
where the Court recognized the right of a school teacher,
though not yet charged criminally, to challenge her
State's anti-evolution statute. See also <i>Griswold v.
Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S., at 481.<p>

The parallel claims of the nurse, c]ergy, social worker,
and corporation-appellants are another step removed and
as to them, the Georgia statutes operate less directly.
Not being licensed physicians, the nurses and the others
are in no position to render medical advice. They would
be reached by the abortion statutes only in their capacity
as accessories or as counselor-conspirators. We conclude
that we need not pass upon the status of these additional appellants in this
suit, for the issues are sufficiently and adequately presented by Doe and the
physician-appellants, and nothing is gained or lost by the
presence or absence of the nurses, the clergymen, the
social workers, and the corporations. See <i>Roe v. Wade,
ante,</i> at ____.<p>

The appellants attack on several grounds those portions of the Georgia
abortion statutes that remain after
the District Court decision: undue restriction of a right
to personal and marital privacy; vagueness; deprivation
of substantive and procedural due process; improper restriction to Georgia
residents; and denial of equal protection.<p>

A. <i>Roe v. Wade, ante,</i> sets forth our conclusion that
a pregnant woman does not have an absolute constitutional right to an abortion
on her demand. What is
said there is applicable here and need not be repeated.<p>

B. The appellants go on to argue, however, that the
present Georgia statutes must be viewed historically,
that is, from the fact that prior to the 1968 Act an
abortion in Georgia was not criminal if performed to
"preserve the life" of the mother. It is suggested that
the present statute, as well, has this emphasis on the
mother's rights, not on those of the fetus. Appellants
eontend that it is thus clear that Georgia has given little,
and certainly not first, consideration to the unborn child.
Yet it is the unborn child's rights that Georgia asserts
in justification of the statute. Appellants assert that
this justification cannot be advanced at this late date.<p>

Appellants then argue that the statutes do not adequately protect the woman's
right. This is so because
it would be physically and emotionally damaging to Doe
to bring a child into her poor "fatherless"<a name="ref10"><a
href="#foot10">(10)</a> family, and
because advances in medicine and medical techniques
have made it safer for a woman to have a medically
induced abortion than for her to bear a child. Thus, "a
statute which requires a woman to carry an unwanted
pregnancy to term infringes not only on a fundamental
right of privacy but on the right to life itself." Brief 27.<p>

The appellants reeognize that a century ago medical
knowledge was not so advanced as it is today, that the
techniques of antisepsis were not known, and that any
abortion procedure was dangerous for the woman. To
restrict the legality of the abortion to the situation where
it was deemed neeessary, in medical judgment, for the
preservation of the woman's life was only a natural conclusion in the exercise
of the legialative judgment of that
time. A State is not to be reproached, however, for a
past judgmental determination made in the light of then-existing medical
knowledge. It is perhaps unfair to
argue, as the appellants do, that because the early focus
was on the preservation of the woman's life, the State's
present professed interest in the protection of embryonic
and fetal life is to be downgraded. That argument denies the State the right to
readjust its views and emphases in the light of the advanced knowledge and
techniques of the day.<p>

C. Appellants argue that  26-1202 (a) of the Georgia
statute, as it has been left by the District Court's decision, is
unconstitutionally vague. This argument centers
in the proposition that, with the District Court's having
stricken the statutorily specified reasons, it still remains
a crime for a physician to perform an abortion except
when, as  26-1202 (a) reads, it is "based upon his best
clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary." The
appellants contend that the word "necessary" does not
warn the phisician of what conduct is proscribed; that
the statute is wholly without objective standards and is
subject to diverse interpretation; and that doctors will
choose to err on the side of caution and will be arbitrary.<p>

The net result of the District Court's decision is that
the abortion determination, so far as the physician is
concerned, is made in the exercise of his professional, that
is, his "best clinical" judgment in the light of all the
attendant circumstances. He is not now restricted to
the three situations originally specified. Instead, he may
range farther afield wherever his medical judgment, properly and professionally
exercised, so dictates and directs
him.<p>

The vagueness argument is set at rest by the decision
in <i>United States v. Vuitch,</i> 402 U. S. 62, 71-72 (1971),
where the issue was raised with respect to a District of
Columbia statute making abortions criminal "unless the
same were done as necessary for the preservation of the
mother's life or health and under the direction of a
competent licensed practitioner of medicine." That statute has been construed
to bear upon psychological as
well as physical well-being. This being so, the Court
concluded that the term "health" presented no problem
of vagueness. "Indeed, whether a particular operation
is necessary for a patient's physical or mental health is
a judgment that physicians are obviously called upon
to make routinely whenever surgery is considered." 402
U. S., at 72. This conclusion is equally applicable here.
Whether, in the words of the Georgia statute, "an abortion is necessary," is a
professional judgment that the
Georgia physieian will be called upon to make routinely.<p>

We agree with the District Court, 319 F. Supp., at
1058, that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors --
physical, emotional, psychological,
familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of the patient.
All these factors
may relate to
health. This allows the attending physician the room he
needs to make his best medical judgment. And it is
room that operates for the benefit, not the disadvantage,
of the pregnant woman.<p>

D. The appellants next argue that the District Court
should have declared unconstitutional three procedural
demiands of the Georgia statute: (1) that the abortion
be performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Hospitals;<a name="ref11"><a href="#foot11">(11)</a> (2) that the
procedure be approved by the hospital staff abortion
committee; and (3) that the performing physician's
judgment be confirmed by the independent examinations
of the patient by two other licensed physicians. The
appellants attack these provisions not only on the ground
that they unduly restrict the woman's right of privacy,
but also on procedural due process and equal protection
grounds. The physician-appellants also argue that, by
subjecting a doctor's individual medical judgment to
committee approval and to confirming consultations, the
statute impermissibly restricts the physician's right to
practice his profession and deprives him of due process.<p>

1. <i>JCAH Accreditation.</i> The Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Hospitals is an organization without
governmental sponsorship or overtones. No question
whatever is raised concerning the integrity of the organization or the high
purpose of the accreditation process.<a name="ref12"><a
href="#foot12">(12)</a><p>

That process, however, has to do with hospital standards
generally and has no present particularized concern with
abortion as a medical or surgical procedure.<a name="ref13"><a
href="#foot13">(13)</a> In Georgia there is no
restriction of the performance of non-abortion surgery in a hospital not yet
accredited by the
JCAH so long as other requirements imposed by the
State, such as licensing of the hospital and of the operating surgeon, are met.
See Georgia Code  88-1901 (a)
and 88-1905 (1971) and 84-907 (Supp. 1971). Furthermore, accreditation by the
Commission is not granted
until a hospital has been in operation at least one year.
The Model Penal Cede,  230.3, Appendix B hereto, contains no requirement for
JCAH accreditation. And the
Uniform Abortion Act (Final Draft, August 1971),<a name="ref14"><a
href="#foot14">(14)</a> approved by the American
Bar Association in February
1972, contains no JCAH accredited hospital specification.<a name="ref15"><a
href="#foot15">(15)</a> Some courts have
held that a JCAH accreditation requirement is an overbroad infringement of
fundamental rights because it does not relate to the particular
medical problems and dangers of the abortion operation.
<i>Poe v. Menghini,</i> 339 F. Supp. 986, 993-994 (Kan.
1972); <i>People v. Barksdale,</i> 96 Cal. Rptr. 265, 273-274
(Cal. App. 1971).<p>

We hold that the JCAH accreditation requirement does
not withstand constitutional scrutiny in the present context. It is a
requirement that simply is not "based on
differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of
the Act in which it is found." <i>Morey v. Dood,</i> 354 U. S.
457, 465 (1957).<p>

This is not to say that Georgia may not or should not
from and after the end of the first trimester, adopt
standards for licensing all facilities where abortions may
be performed so long as those standards are legitimately
related to the objective the State seeks to accomplish.
The appellants contend that such a relationship would
be lacking even in a lesser requirement that an abortion
be performed in a licensed hospital, as opposed to a facility, such as a
clinic, that may be required by the State
to possess all the staffing and services necessary to perform an abortion
safely (including those adequate to
handle serious complications or other emergency, or arrangements with a nearby
hospital to provide such services). Appellants and various <i>amici</i>
have presented us
with a mass of data purporting to demonstrate that some
facilities other than hospitals are entirely adequate to
perform abortions if they possess these qualifications.
The State, on the other hand, has not presented persuasive data to show that
only hospitals meet its acknowledged interest in insuring the quality of the
operation
and the full protection of the patient. We feel compelled
to agree with appellants that the State must show more
than it has in order to prove that only the full resources
of a licensed hospital, rather than those of some other
appropriately licensed institution, satisfy these health interests. We hold
that the hospital requirement of the
Georgia law, because it fails to exclude the first trimester
of pregnancy, see <i>Roe v. Wade, ante,</i> p. ____, is also
invalid. In so holding we naturally express no opinion
on the medical judgment involved in any particular case,
that is, whether the patient's situation is such that an
abortion should be performed in a hospital rather than
in some other facility.<p>

2. <i>Committee Approval.</i> The second aspect of the
appellants' proeedural attack relates to the hospital abortion committee and to
the pregnant woman's asserted
lack of access to that committee. Relying primarily on
<i>Goldberg v. Kelly,</i> 397 U.S. 254 (1970), concerning the
termination of welfare benefits, and <i>Wisconsin
v. Constantineau,</i> 400 U.S. 433
(1971), concerning the posting
of an alcoholic's name, Doe first argues that she was denied
due proeess because she could not make a presentation
to the committee. It is not clear from the record, however, whether Doe's own
consulting physician was or was
not a member of the committee or did or did not present her case, or, indeed,
whether she herself was or was
not there. We see nothing in the Georgia statute that
explicitly denies access to the committee by or on behalf
of the woman. If the access point alone were involved,
we would not be persuaded to strike down the committee
provision on the unsupported assumption that access is
not provided.<p>

Appellants attack the discretion the statute leaves to
the committee. The most concrete argument they advance is their suggestion that
it is still a badge of infamy
"in many minds" to bear an illegitimate child, and that
the Georgia system enables the committee members' personal views as to
extramarital sex relations, and punishment therefor, to govern their decisions.
This approach obviously is one founded on suspicion and one that discloses a
lack of confidence in the integrity of physicians.
To say that physicians will be guided in their hospital
committee decisions by their predilections on extramarital
sex unduly narrows the issue to pregnancy outside marriage. (Doe's own
situation did not involve extramarital
sex and its product.) The appellants' suggestion is necessarily somewhat
degrading to the conscientious physician,
particularly the obstetrician, whose professional activity
is concerned with the physical and mental welfare, the
woes, the emotions, and the concern of his female patients.
He, perhaps more than anyone else, is knowledgeable in
this ares of patient care, and he is aware of human frailty,
so-called "error," and needs. The good physician -- despite the presence of
rascals in the medical profession, as
in all others, we trust that most physicians are "good" --
will have a sympathy and an understanding for the
pregnant patient that probably is not exceeded by those
who participate in other areas of professional counseling.<p>

It is perhaps worth noting that the abortion committee
has a function of its own. It is a committee of the hospital and it is composed
of members of the institution's
medical staff. The membership usually is a changing
one. In this way its work burden is shared and is more
readily accepted. The committee's function is protective.
It enables the hospital appropriately to be advised that
its posture and activities are in accord with legal requirements. It is to be
remembered that the hospital
is an entity and that it, too, has legal rights and legal
obligations.<p>

Saying all this, however, does not settle the iesue of
the constitutional propriety of the committee requirement. Viewing the Georgia
statute ae a whole, we see
no constitutionally justifiable pertinence in the structure
for the advance approval by the abortion committee.
With regard to the protection of potential life, the medical judgment is
already
completed prior to the committee
stage, and review by a committee once removed from diagnosis is basically
redundant. We are not cited to any
other surgieal procedure made subject to committee approval as a matter of
state criminal law. The woman's
right to receive medical care in accordance with her licensed physician's best
judgment and the physician's right
to administer it are substantially limited by this statutorily imposed
overview.
And the hospital itself is otherwise fully protected.
Under  26-1202 (e) the hospital is free not to admit a patient for an
abortion. It is
even free not to have an abortion committee. Further,
a physician or any other employee has the right to refrain,
for moral or religious reasons, from participating in the
abortion procedure. These provisions obviously are in
the statute in order to afford appropriate protection to the
individual and to the denominational hospital. Section
26-1202 (e) affords adequate protection to the hospital
and little more is provided by the committee prescribed
by  26-1202 (b)(5).<p>

We conclude that the interposition of the hospital abortion committee is unduly
restrictive of the patient's rights
and needs that, at this point, have already been medically
delineated and substantiated by her personal physician.
To ask more serves neither the hospital nor the State.<p>

3. <i>Two-Doctor Concurrence</i>. The third aspects of the
appellants' attack centers on the "time and availability
of adequate medical facilities and personnel." It is said
that the system imposes substantial and irrational roadblocks and "is patently
unsuited" to prompt determination of the abortion decision. Time, of course, is
critical
in abortion. Risks during the first trimester of pregnancy are admittedly lower
than during later months.<p>

The appellants purport to show by a local study<a name="ref16"><a
href="#foot16">(16)</a> of
Grady Memorial Hospital (serving indigent residents in
Fulton and DeKalb Counties) that the "mechanics of
the system itself forced ... discontinuation of the abortion process" because
the median time for the workup
was 15 days. The sarne study shows, however, that 27%
of the candidates for abortion were already 13 or more
weeks pregnant at the time of application, that is, they
were at the end of or beyond the first trimester when they
made their applications. It is too much to say, as appellants do, that these
particular persons "were victims
of [a] system over which they [had] no control." If
higher risk was incurred because of abortions in the
seeond rather than the first trimester, much of that risk
was due to delay in application, and not to the alleged
cumbersomeness of the system. We note, in passing,
that appellant Doe had no delay problem herself; the
decision in her case was made well within the first
trimester.<p>

It should be manifest that our rejection of the accredited hospital requirement
and, more important, of
the abortion committee's advance approval eliminates the
major grounds of the attack based on the system's delay
and the lack of facilities. There remains, however, the
required confirmation by two Georgia-licensed physicians
in addition to the recommendation of the pregnant woman's own consultant
(making under the statute, a total
of six physicians involved, including the three on the
hospital's abortion committee). We conclude that this
provision, too, must fall.<p>

The statute's emphasis, as has been repetitively noted,
is on the attending physician's "best clinical judgment
that an abortion is necessary." That should be sufficient.
The reasons for the presence of the confirmation step in
the statute are perhaps apparent, but they are insufficient
to withstand constitutional challenge. Again, no other
voluntary medical or surgical procedure for which Georgia
requires confirmation by two other physicians has been
cited to us. If a physician is licensed by the State, he
is recognized by the State as capable of exercising acceptable clinical
judgment. If he fails in this, professional
censure or deprivation of his license are available remedies. Required
acquiescence by co-practitioners has no
rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly
infringes on the physician's right to practice. The attending physician will
know when a consultation is advisable the doubtful situation, the need for
assurance
when the medical decision is a delicate one, and the like.
Physicians have followed this routine historically and
know its usefulness and benefit for all concerned. It is
still true today that "[rleliance must be placed upon the
assurance given by his license, issued by an authority
competent to judge in that respect, that he [the physician] possesses the
requisite qualifications." <i>Dent v.
West Virginia,</i> 129 U.S. 114, 122-123 (1889). See <i>United
States v. Vuitch,</i> 402 U.S., at 71.<p>

E. The appellants attack the residency requirement
of the Georgia law,  26-1202 (b)(1) and (b)(2), as
violative of the right to travel stressed in <i>Shapiro v.
Thompson,</i> 394 U.S. 618, 629-631 (1969), and other
cases. A requirement of this kind, of course, could be
deemed to have some relationship to the availability
of post-procedure medical care for the aborted patient.<p>

Nevertheless, we do not uphold the constitutionality of
the residence requirement. It is not based on any policy
of preserving state-supported facilities for Georgia residents, for the bar
also applies to private hospitals and
to privately retained physicians. There is no intimation,
either, that Georgia facilities are utilized to capacity in
caring for Georgia residents. Just as the Privileges and
Immunities Clause, Const. Art. IV,  2, protects persons
who enter other States to ply their trade, <i>Ward v. Maryland,</i>
79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 418, 430 (1870); <i>Blake v.
McClung,</i> 172 U. S. 239, 248-256 (1898), so must it protect persons who
enter Georgia seeking the medical services that are available there. See
<i>Toomer
v. Witsell,</i> 334
U.S. 385, 396-397 (1948). A contrary holding would
mean that a State could limit to its own residents the
general medical care available within its borders. This
we could not approve.<p>

F. The last argument on this phase of the case is one
that often is made, namely, that the Georgia system is violative of equal
protection because it discriminates against
the poor. The appellants do not urge that abortions
should be performed by persons other than licensed physicians, so we have no
argument that because the wealthy
can better afford physicians, the poor should have non-physicians made
available to them. The appellants acknowleged that the procedures are
"nondiscriminatory
in ... express terms" but they suggest that they have produced invidious
discriminations. The District Court rejected this approach out of hand. 319 F.
Supp., at 1056.
It rests primarily on the accreditation and approval and
confirmation requirements, discussed above, and on the
assertion that most of Georgia's counties have no accredited hospital. We have
set aside the accreditation,
approval, and confirmation requirements, however, and
with that, the discrimination argument collapses in all
significant aspects.<p>

<p align=center>
<b>V</b><p>

The appellants complain, finally, of the District Court's
denial of injunctive relief. A like claim was made in
<i>Roe v. Wade, ante.</i> We declined decision there insofar
as injunctive relief was concerned, and we decline it here.
We assume that Georgia's prosecutorial authorities will
give full reeognition to the judgment of this Court.<p>

In summary, we hold that the JCAH accredited hospital provision and the
requirements as to approval by
the hospital abortion committee, as to confirmation by
two independent physicians, and as to residence in
Georgia are all violative of the Fourteenth Aanendment.
Speeifically, the following portions of  26-1202 (b), remaining after the
District Court's judgment, are invalid:<p>

(1) Subsections (1) and (2).<p>

(2) That portion of Subsection (3) following the words
"such physician's judgment i8 reduced to writing."<p>

(3) Subsections (4) and (5).<p>

The judgment of the District Court is modified accordingly and, as so modified,
is affirmed. Costs are allowed to the appellants.

Tbe Manual's Introduction states the organization's purpose to establish
standards and conduct accreditation programs that will afford
quality medical care "to give patients tbe optimal benefits that medical
science has to offer." This ambitious and admirable goal is
illustrated by JCAH's decision in 1966 "to raise and strengthen the
standards from their present level of minimum
essential to tbe level
of optimum achievable ...." Some of these "optimum achievable"
standards required are: disclosure of hospital ownership and control; a
dietetic service and written dietetic policies; a written disaster plan for
mass emergencies; a nuclear medical services program;
facilities for hematology, chemistry, microbiology, clinical microscopy,
and sero-immunology; a professiorial library and document delivery
service; a radiology program; a social services plan administered by
a qualified social worker; and a special care unit.<p>

<p align=center>
Criminal Code of Georgia<p>

<p align=center>
(The italicized portions are those held unconstitutional by the
Distict Court)<p>

<h2 align=center>CHAPTER 26-12. ABORTION.</h2>

26-1201. Criminal Abortion. Except as otherwise
provided in section 26-1202, a person commits criminal
abortion when he administers any medicine, drug or
other substance whatever to any woman or when he uses
any instrument or other means whatever upon any woman
with intent to produce a miscarriage or abortion.<p>

26-1202. Exception. (a) Section 26-1201 shall not
apply to an abortion performed by a physician duly
licensed to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to
Chapter 84-9 or 84-12 of the Code of Georgia of 1933,
as amended, based upon his best clinical judgment that
an abortion is necessary <i>because:</i><p>

<i>(1) A continuation of the pregnancy would endanger
the life of the pregnant woman or would seriously and
permanently injure her health; or</i><p>

<i>(2) The fetus would very likely be born with a grave,
permanent, and irremediable mental or physical defect;
or</i><p>

<i>(3) The pregnancy resulted from forcible or statutory
rape.</i><p>

(b) No abortion is authorized or shall be performed
under this section unless each of the following conditions
is met;<p>

(1) The pregnant woman requesting the abortion certifies in writing under oath
and subject to the penalties
of false swearing to the physician who proposes to perform the abortion that
she is a bona fide legal resident
of the State of Georgia.<p>

(2) The physician certifies that he believes the woman
is a bona fide resident of this State and that he has no
information which should lead him to believe otherwise.<p>

(3) Such physician's judgment is reduced to writing
and concurred in by at least two other physicians duly
licensed to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to
Chapter 84-9 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended,
who certify in writing that based upon their separate
personal medical examinations of the pregnant woman,
the abortion is, in their judgment, necessary because of
one or more of the reasons enumerated above.<p>

(4) Such abortion is performed in a hospital licensed
by the State Board of Health and accredited by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.<p>

(5) The performance of the abortion has been approved in advance by a committee
of the medical staff
of the hospital in which the operation is to be performed.
This committee must be one established and maintained
in accordance with the standards promulgated by the
Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, and
its approval must be by a majority vote of a membership
of not less than three members of the hospital's staff;
the physician proposing to perform the operation may
not be counted as a member of the committee for this
purpose.<p>

<i>(6) If the proposed abortion is considered necessary
because the woman has been raped, the woman makes a
written statement under oath, and subject to the penalties
of false swearing, of the date, time and place of the rape
and the name of the rapist, if known. There must be
attached to this statement a certified copy of any report
of the rape made by any law enforcement officer or
agency and a statement by the solicitor general of the
judicial circuit where the rape occured or allegedly occurred that, according
to his best information, there is
probable cause to believe that the rape did occur.</i><p>

(7) Such written opinions, statements, certificates, and
concurrences are maintained in the permanent files of
such hospital and are available at all reasonable times
to the solicitor general of the judicial circuit in which
the hospital is located.<p>

(8) A copy of such written opinions, statements, certificates, and concurrences
is filed with the Director of
the State Department of Public Health within ten (10)
days after such operation is performed.<p>

(9) All written opinions, statements, certificates, and
concurrences filed and maintained pursuant to paragraphs
(7) and (8) of this subsection shall be confidential records and shall not be
made available for public inspection at any time.<p>

<i>(c) Any solicitor general of the judicial circuit in
which an abortion is to be performed under this section,
or any person who would be a relative of the child within
the second degree of consanguinity, may petition the superior court of the
county in which the abortion is to be
performed for a declaratory judgment whether the performance of such abortion
would violate any constitutional or other legal rights of the fetus. Such
solicitor
general may also petition such court for the purpose of
taking issue with compliance with the requirements of
this section. The physician who proposes to perform the
abortion and the pregnant woman shall be respondents.
The petition shall be heard expeditiously and if the court
adjudges that such abortion would violate the constitutional or other legal
rights of the fetus, the court shall
so declare and shall restrain the physician from performing the
abortion.</i><p>

(d) If an abortion is performed in compliance with
this section, the death of the fetus shall not give rise to
any claim for wrongful death.<p>

(e) Nothing in this section shall require a hospital to
admit any patient under the provisions hereof for the
purpose of performing an abortion, nor shall any hospital
be required to appoint a committee such as contemplated
under subsection (b)(5). A physician, or any other
person uho is a member of or associated with the staff
of a hospital, or any employee of a hospital in which an
abortion has been authorized, who shall state in writing
an objection to such abortion on moral or religious
grounds shall not be required to participate in the medical
procedures which will result in the abortion, and the
refusal of any such person to participate therein shall
not form the basis of any claim for damages on account
of such refusal or for any disciplinary or recriminatory
action against such person.<p>

26-1203. Punishment. A person convicted of criminal abortion shall be punished
by imprisonment for not
less than one nor more than 10 years.<p>

<p align=center>
American Law Institute<p>

<h2 align=center>MODEL PENAL CODE</h2><p>

Section 230.3. Abortion.

(1) <i>Unjustified Abortion.</i> A person who purposely
and unjustifiably terminates the pregnancy of another
otherwise than by a live birth commits a felony of the
third degree or, where the pregnancy has continued beyond the twenty-sixth
week, a felony of the second degree.<p>

(2) <i>Justifiable Abortion.</i> A licensed physician is justified in
terminating a pregnancy if he believes there is substantial risk that
continuance of the pregnancy would
gravely impair the physical or mental health of the
mother or that the child would be born with grave
physical or mental defect, or that the pregnancy resulted
from rape, incest, or other felonious intercourse. All
illicit interourse with a girl below the age of 16 shall be
deemed felonious for purposes of this subsection. Justifiable abortions shall
be performed only in a licensed
hospital except in case of emergency when hospital facilities are unavailable.
[Additional exceptions from the
requirement of hospitalization may be incorporated here
to take account of situations in sparsely settled areas
where hospitals are not generally accessible.]<p>

(3) <i>Physicians' Certificates; Presumption from Non-Compliance.</i>
No abortion
shall be performed unless two
physicians, one of whom may be the person performing
the abortion, shall have certified in writing the circumstances which they
believe to justify the abortion. Such
certificate shall be submitted before the abortion to the
hospital where it is to be performed and, in the case of
abortion following felonious intercourse, to the prosecuting attorney or the
police. Failure to comply with any
of the requirements of this Subsection gives rise to a
presumption that the abortion was unjustified.<p>

(4) <i>Self-Abortion.</i> A woman whose pregnancy has
continued beyond the twenty-sixth week commits a felony
of the third degree if she purposely terminates her own
pregnancy otherwise than by a live birth, or if she uses
instruments, drugs or violence upon herself for that purpose. Except as
justified under Subsection (2), a person
who induces or knowingly aids a woman to use instruments, drugs or violence
upon herself for the purpose of
terminating her pregnancy otherwise than by a live birth
commits a felony of the third degree whether or not the
pregnancy has continued beyond the twenty-sixth week.<p>

(5) <i>Pretended Abortion.</i> A person commits a felony
of the third degree if, representing that it is his purpose
to perform an abortion, he does an act adapted to cause
abortion in a pregnant woman although the woman is
in fact not pregnant, or the actor does not believe she is.
A person charged with unjustified abortion under Subsection (1) or an attempt
to commit that offense may be

No. 70-40<p>

<p align=center>
Mary Doe et al., Appellant<br>
v.<br>
Arthur K. Bolton, as Attorney General of the State   
of Georgia, et al.<p>

On Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of

<p align=center>
[January 22, 1973]<p>

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.<p>

The holding in <i>Roe v. Wide, ante,</i> that state abortion
laws can withstand constitutional scrutiny only if the
States can demonstrate a compelling state interest apparently compels the
Court's close scrutiny of the various
provisions in Georgia's abortion statute. Since, as indicated by my dissent in
<i>Wade,</i> I view the compelling state
interest standard as an inappropriate measure of the
constitutionality of state abortion laws, I respectfully
dissent from the majority's holding.<p>

DRED SCOTT, Plaintiff in Error,<br>
v<br>
JOHN F. A. SANFORD.</h2>

<h3 align=center>(See S. C. 19 How. 393-633.)</h3>

Plea in abatement, when may be reviewed --
the word "citizen" in the Constitution does
not embrace one of the negro race -- negro
cannot become a citizen -- slave not made free
by residence in a free state or territory --
Declaration of Independence does not include
slaves as part of the people -- the rights and
privileges conferred by the Constitution upon
citizens do not apply to the negro race -- Constitution should have the
meaning intended when it was adopted -- court may examine
other errors besides plea in abatement --
Constitution expressly affirms right of property
in slaves -- Missouri compromise unconstitutional
and void.<p>

Where a plea in abatement, by defendant, to the
jurisdiction of the court below is overruled on demurrer, and the defendant
thereupon pleads in bar
upon which issues were joined and the trial and
verdict were in his favor, and the plaintiff thereupon brought the case
into this court by writ of error, and the plea and demurrer below upon it are
part of the record; held,
that thls court has power to review the decision of
the court below upon the plea in abatement.<p>

It is therefore the duty of the court to decide
whether the facts stated in the plea, are or are not
sufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled
to sue as a citizen in the court of the United States.<p>

The provisions of the Constitution of the United
States in relation to the personal rights and privileges
to which the citizens of a state should be entitled do not embrace the negro
African race, at
that time in this country, or who might afterwards
be imported, who had then been or should afterwards be made free in any
state.<p>

Such provisions of the Constitution do not put it
in the power of a single state to make out one of
the negro African race a citizen of the United
States, and to endue him with the full rights of
citizenship in every other state without their consent.<p>

The Constitution of the United States does not
act upon one of the negro race whenever he shall
be made free under the laws of a state, and raise
him to the rank of a citizen, and immediately
clothe him with all the privileges of a citizen of
any other state, and in its own courts.<p>

The plaintiff in error was a negro slave, and
brought into a free State (Illinois), and in the free
territory of the United States for about four years,
during which time he was married to another negro
slave who also was in said free territory. One of
their children (Eliza) was born on the River Mississoppi, and another of their
children was born in the State of
Missouri, to which state he had returned.<p>

Held, that the plaintiff in error could not be and
was not a citizen of the State of Missouri, within
the meaning of the Constitution of the United
States, and consequently was not entitled to sue
in its courts.<p>

The legislation and histories of the times, and the
language used in the Declaration of Independence,
show that neither the class of persons who had been
imported as shaves nor their decendents, whether
they had become free or not, where then acknowledged as part of the people,
nor intended to be included in the general words used in that instrument.<p>

The decendents of Africans who were imported
into this country and sold as slaves, when they shall
become emancipated, or who are born of parents
who had become free before their birth, are not
citizens of a state in the sense in which the word
"citizen" is used in Constitution of the United States.<p>

The enslaved African race was not intened to
be included in, and formed no part of, the people
who formed and adopted the Declaration of Independence.<p>

When the framers of the Constitution were conferring special rights and
privileges upon the citizens of a state in every other part of the
Union, it
is impossible to believe that these rights and privilges
were intended to be extended to the negro race.<p>

The words of the Constitution should be given the meaning they were intended to
bear, when that instrument was framed and adopted.<p>

Where this court has decided against the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court on a plea of abatement, it
has still the right to examine any questoin presented
by excelption or by the record, and may reverse
the judgment for errors committed, and remand
the case to the Cirucit Court for it to dismiss
the case for want of jurisdiction.<p>

The right of property in a slave is distinctly and
expressly affirmed in the Constitution.<p>

The Act of Congress which prohibited a citizen
from holding and owning property of this kind in
the territory of the United States north of the line
therein mentioned (thirty-six degrees thirty minutes
north latitude), is not warranted by the Constitution, and is therefore
void.<p>

Neither Dred Scott himself, nor any of his family
were made free by being carried into such territory;
even if they had been carried their by their
owner with the intention of becoming permanent
residents.<p>

Scott was not made free by belng taken to Rock
Island in the State of Illinois.<p>

As Scott was a slave when taken into the State of
Illinois by his owner, and was there held as such,
and brought back into Missouri in that character,ehlhlY
his status, as free or slave, depended on the laws of
Missouri and not of Illinois. He and his family
were not free, but were, by the laws of Missouri, the
property of defendant.<p>

Argued Feb. 11, 12, 13 and 14, 1856. May 12,
1856, ordered to be re-argued at the next
term. Re-argued Dec. 15. 16, 17 and 18,
1856. Decided March 6, 1857.<p>

IN ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Missouri.<p>

On November 2, 1853, Dred Scott, by his
attorney, filed in the clerk's office of the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of
Missouri, the following declaration against the
defendant, John F. A. Sanford:<p>

Dred Scott, of St. Louis, in the State of
Missouri, and a citizen of the State of Missouri,
complains of John F. A. Sandford, of
the City of New York, and a citizen of the
State of New York, in the plea of trespass for
that the defendant heretofore, to wit: on the
1st day of January, A. D. 1853, at St. Louis
in the County of St. Louis and State of Missouri,
with force and arms assaulted the plaintiff,
and without law or right held him as a
slave, and imprisoned him for the space of six
hours and more, and then and there did threaten to beat the plaintiff and to
hold him in prison, and restrained of his lberty, so that by
means of such threats the plaintif was put in
fear and could not attend to his business, and
thereby lost great gains and profits which he
might have made and otherwise would have
made in the proseention of his business, to wit:
$2,500, and other wrongs to the plaintiff then
and there did, against the peace and to the damage of the plaintiff $3,000.<p>

And also for that the defendent heretofore
on the 1st day of January A. D. 1853, with
force and arms at St. Louis aforesaid, an assault
did make on 
Harriet Scott, then and still
the wife of the plaintiff, and then and there did imprision Harriet, and hold
her as a slave, without law or right, for the space of six hours,
and then and there did threaten to beat said
Harriet and hold her as a slave, so that by
means of the premises said Harriet was put in
great fear and pain and could not and did not
attend to the plaintiff's business, and the plaintiff
lost and was deprived of the society, comfort
and assistance of said wife, and thereby
lost great gains and profits, of the value, to
wit: of $2,500, and other wrongs to the plaintiff,
the defendent then and there did, against
the peace and to the plaintiff's damage, $3,000.<p>

And also for that the defenden heretofore,
to wit: on the 1st day of January, A. D. 1853,
with force and arms at St. Louis aforesaid
made an assault on Eliza Scott and Lizzie
Scott, then and still infant daughters and servants
of the plaintiff, and then and there imprisoned
and held as slaves said Eliza and
Lizzie, for a long space of time, to wit: six
hours, and then and there did threaten to beat
said Eliza and Lizzie and hold them as slaves
and restrained of their liberty, so that by
means of the premises, said Eliza and Lizzie
were put in great fear and coud not and did
not attend to plaintiff's business as otherwise
they might and would have done, and the plaintiff
thereby lost the comfort, society, service
and assistance of his said children and servants,
of great value, to wit: $2,500, and other wrongs
to the plaintiff $3,000, and the plaintiff on account of
the aforesaid several grievances, brings suit,
etc. by his attorney.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. M. Field<p>

The defendendent, by his attorney, filed the following plea:<p>

Plea to the jurisdiction of the court. April Term, 1854.<p>

And the said John F. A. Sandford, in his own proper person, comes and says that
this court ought not to have or take further cognizance
of the action aforesaid, because he says that said cause of action, and each
and every of them, if any such have accrued to the said
Dred Scott, accrued to the said Dred Scott out of the jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of Missouri; for that, to wit: the said
plaintiff Dred Scott is not a citizen of the
State of Missouri, as alleed in his declaration,
because he is a negro of African descent, his
ancestors were of pure African blood, and were
brought into this country and sold as negro
slaves, and this the said Sandford is ready to
verify; wherefore he prays judgment whether
this court can or will take further cognizance
of the action aforesaid.<p>

The plea was verified.<p>

The plaintiff filed the following demurrer to this plea:<p>

And now comes the plaintiff and demurs in law to the plea of the defendant to
the jurisdiction of the court and says that the said plea
and the matters therein contained are not sufficient in law to preclude the
court of its jurisdiction of this case, and that the plaintiff is
not bound by law to reply to said plea. Wherefore the plaintiff
prays judgment of said plea, and that the defendant answer further to the
plaintiff's said action, etc.<p>

On April 24, 1854, the matters of law arising upon the demurrer were argued and
submitted to the court. On April 25, the court rendered a decision that the law
was for plaintiff on said demurrer, and that the said demurrer be, and
the same is hereby sustained.<p>

On May 4, 1854, in acceordance with an
agreement by the attorneys, the defendant filed
pleas, Nos. 1, 2 and 3, to all of which pleas the
plaintiff filed replications. Said attorneys also
filed an agreement upon the statement of the
facts in this case. The pleas are as follows:<p>

1. And the said John F. A. Sandford, by
H. A. Garland, his attorney, comes and defends
the wrong and injury, when, etc., and says
that he is not guilty of the said supposed trespass above laid to his charge or
any part thereof in manner and form as the said Dred
Scott hath above thereof complained against
him and of this he, the said Sandford, putteth
himself upon the country.<p>

2. And for a further plea in this behalf as
to the making of said assault on said Dred
Scott in the first count in said declration mentioned, impisoning him and
keeping and detaining him in prison etc., the said Sandford
by leave of the court first obtained, says that
the said Dred Scott ought not have or maintain his aforesaid action thereof
against him,
because he says that before and at the time
when, etc., in the said first count mentioned
the said Dred Seott was a negro slave, the lawful property of the defendant,
and as such slave
he gently laid his hands upon him and only
restrained him of such liberty as he had a
right to do, and this the said Sandford is ready
to verify wherefore he prays judgment whether
the said Scott ought to have or maintain his
aforesaid action thereof against him.<p>

3. And for a further plea in this behalf, as to
making the said assault upon Harriet, the wife,
and Eliza and Lizzie, the daughters of the said
Dred Scott, in the second and third events of
the said declaration mentioned, and imprisoning them and keeping and detaining
them in prison, etc., the said John F. A. Sandford, by
leave of the court obtained, says that said Dred
Scott ought not to have or maintain his aforesaid action thereof against him
because he says
that before and at the said time, etc., when,
etc., in the said second and third counts mentioned, the said Harriet, wife of
said Scott, and
Eliza and Lizzie, his daughters, were the lawful slaves of the said Sandford
and as such
slaves he gently laid his hands upon them and
restrained them of their liberty as he had a
right to do. And this he is ready to verify.
Wherefore he prays judgement, etc.<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garland, for defendant.<p>

The replications are as follows:<p>

The plaintiff, as to ths plea of the defendant
firstly above pleaded, and whereof he has put
himself on the country, doth do like. Field.<p>

And the plaintiff as to the plea of the defendant secondly above pleaded as to
said several trespasses in the introdutory part of that
plea mentioned and therein attempted to be
justified says that the plaintiff by reason of
anything in that plea alleged ought not to be
barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action against the defendant,
because he
says that said defendant at said time, when,
etc., of his own wrong, and without the cause
by him in his said second plea alleged, committed the said several trespasses in
the introductory part of that plea mentioned, in manner and form as the
plaintiff has above in his
declaration complained, and this the plaintiff
prays may be inquired of by the country.<p>

The replication to the third plea was similar
to the second.<p>

The agreed statement of facts was as follows:<p>

In the year 1834 the plaintiff was a negro
slave belonging to Doctor Emerson, who was a
surgeon in the Army of the United States. In
that year 1834 said Doctor Emerson took the
plaintiff from the State of Missouri to the military post at Rock Island in the
State of Illinois and held him there as a slave until the
month of April or May, 1836. At the time last
mentioned, said Doctor Emerson removed the
plaintiff from said military post at Rock lsland
to the military post at Fort Snelling, situate on
the west bank of the Mississippi River in the
Territory known as Upper Louisiana, acquired
by the United States of France and situate
north of the latitude of 36 degrees 30 minutes
north, and north of the State of Missouri. Said
Doctor Emerson held the plaintiff in slavery at
said fort Snelling, from said last mentioned
date until the year 1838.<p>

In the year 1835 Harriet, who is named in
the second count of the plaintiff's declaration,
was the negro slave of Major Taliaferro, who
belonged to the Army of the United States. In
that year 1835 said Major Taliaferro took said
Harriet to said Sort Snelling, a military post
situated as hereinbefore stated, and kept her
there as a slave until the year 1831; and then
sold and delivered her as a slave at said Fort
Snelling unto the said Doctor Emerson hereinbefore named. Said Doctor Emerson
held said
Harriet in slavery at said Fort Snelling until
the year 1838.<p>

In the year 1836 the plaintiff and said Harriet, at said Fort Snelling with the
consent of said Doctor Emerson, who then claimed to be
their master and owner, intermarried and took
eaeh other for husband and wife. Eliza and
Lizzie, named in the third connt of the plaintiff's declaration, are the fruit
of that marriage.
Eliza is about fourteen years old, and was born
on board of the steamboat Gipsey, north of the
north line of the State of Missouri, and upon
the River Mississippi. Lizzie is about seven
years old and was born in the State of Missouri at the military post called
Jellerson Barracks.<p>

In the year 1838 said Doctor Emerson removed the plaintiff and said Harriet
and their said daughter Eliza from said Fort Snelling to
the State of Missouri where they have ever
since resided.<p>

Before commencement of this suit, said
Doctor Emerson sold and conveyed the plaintiff, said Harriet,
Eliza and Lizzie to
the defendant as slaves and the defendant has ever
since claimed to hold them, and each of them
as slaves.<p>

At the times mentioned in the plaintiff's declaration, the defendant, claiming
to be owner
as aforesaid, laid his hands upon said plaintiff,
Harriet, Eliza and Lizzie and imprisoned them,
doing in this respect, however, no more than
what he might lawfully do if they were of
right his slaves at sueh time.<p>

Further proof may be given on the trial for
either party.<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. R. M. Field, for plaintiff.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. H. A. Garland, for defendant.<p>

The case was tried at the Circuit Court held
for the District of Missouri at St. Louis on
May 15, 1854, before the court and a jury.<p>

The jury found the following verdict, viz.:<p>

"As to the first issue joined in this case we
of the jury find the defendant not guilty; and
as to the issue secondly above joined, we of the
jury find that before and at the time when,
etc., in the first count mentioned the said
Dred Scott was a negro slave, the lawful property of the defendant. And as to
the issue
thirdly above joined, we the jury find, that before and at the time when, etc.,
in the second and third counts mentioned, the said Harriet,
wife of said Dred Scott, and Eliza and Lizzie
the daughters of the said Dred Scott were negro slaves, the lawful property of
the defendant." Whereupon it is now considered by the
court that the plaintiff take nothing by his
writ in this case, and that the defendant John
F. A. Sandford go hence without day and recover against said plaintiff, Dred
Scott, the
costs by him expended in the defense of this
suit.<p>

A motion for a new trial was made by the
attorneys for the plaintiff, which the court overruled. Thereupon the said
plaintiff filed a bill of exception which is as follows:<p>

<center>
Dred Scott<br>
v.<br>
John F. A. Sandford<p>
April Term 1864<p>
</center>

On the trial of this cause by the jury, the
plaintiff, to maintain the issues on his part,
read to the jury the following agreed statement of facts.<p>

"It is agreed that Dred Scott brought suit
for his freedom in the Circuit Court of St.
Louis County; that there was a verdict and
judgement in his favor; that on a writ of error
to the Supreme Court, the judgment below was
reversed, and the same remamded to the Circuit
Court, where it has been continued to await the
decision of this case.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Field, for plaintiff.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Garland, for defendant.<p>

No further testimony was given to the jury
by either party. Thereupon the plaintiff moved
the court to give the jury the following instructions:<p>

<center>
Plaintiff's Instruction.<p>
</center>

The jury are instructed that upon the facts
agreed to by the parties, they ought to find for
the plaintiff.<p>

The court refused to give such instruction to
the jury and the plaintiff to such refusal then
and there duly excepted. The court then gave
the following instruction to the jury on motion of the defendant:<p>

<center>
Defendant's Instruction.<p>
</center>

The jury are instructed that upon the facts
in this case the law is with the defendant.<p>

To the giving of such instruction the plaintiff then and there duly
excepted.<p>

The jury found the verdict as above. The
plaintiff thereupon immediately filed in court
the following motion for a new trial:<p>

And now, after verdict and before judgment
the plaintiff comes and moves the court to set
aside the verdict and grant a new trial, because
the court misdirected the jury in matter of
law on said trial.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field.<p>

The court overruled the said motion and
gave judgment on verdict for the defendant;
and to such action of the court the plaintiff
then and there duly excepted.<p>

The plaintiff writes this bill of exceptions
and prays that it may be allowed, and signed
and sealed.<p>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field.<p>

Allowed and signed and sealed, May 15, 1854.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. W. Wells. [seal.]<p>

A writ of error was issued, and in the Supreme Court of the United States,
December Term, 1854, the following was filed:<p>

And now comes said plaintiff in error and
says that in the record of the proceedings and
in the giving of judgment below there is manifest error because the court
below, in the trial
of the cause, misdirected the jury in matter of
law, and because the court below gave judgment for the defendant below, when the
judgment should have been for plaintiff below,
wherefore for said errors and others the plaintiff prays judgment of reversal
here, and that he may be restored to all he has lost.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his attorney, Nathaniel Holmes.<p>

Filed Dec. 30, 1854.<p>

Messrs. M. Blair and Curtis, for the plaintiff
in error:<p>

1. The first question is, whether this court
will consider the question raised in the Circuit
Court by the plea to the jurisdiction, no final
judgment having been rendered on the demurrer to that plea, and the defendant
having pleaded over after the demurrer was sustained,
and the final judgment assigned for error having
been rendered on the issue on the merits.<p>

2. Whether, if the ruling of the Circuit
Court on the demurrer to the plea in abatement
is subject to be reviewed here, the judgment
of the court, in holding the plaintiff to be "a
citizen" in such sense as to enable him to maintain
an action in that character in the courts of
the United States, was erroneous.<p>

3. Whether the facts stated in the agreed
case entitle the plaintiff and his family to freedom, supposing the 8th section
of the Act of 1820, known as the Missouri Compromise, to
be constitutional.<p>

4. Whether the said Act is constitutional.<p>
Upon the first point the counsel cited, Shepard v. Graves, 14 How 519;
U. S. v. Boyd,
6 How. 51; Smith v. Kernochen, 7 How. 216;
Sims v. Hundley, 6 How. 1; Bailey v. Dozier,
6 How. 23; Conard v. Atlantic Ins. Co. 1 Pet.
386; De Wolf v. Rabaud, 1 Pet 476; Evans v.
Gee, 11 Pet. 89; 1 Wash. C. C. 70, 80; 2
Sumn. 251; 2 Dall. 341, 4 Dall. 330, and then
said: In this case, as in those cited, the declaration gives jurisdiction,
and the facts alleged in
support of it can only be contested by making
an issue as in other cases. If that issue be not
made, or be waived in the conduct of the cause
according to a well-settled practice of the court,
there is no reason in this case more than in any
other why the objection should be available at
a later stage of the case. If the fact had been
that plaintiff was not a resident of Missouri,
and that was the reason why he was not a citizen, no advantage could be taken
of the fact at
any subsequent stage of the ease. What difference does it make that another
fact is relied on
to show that he is not a citizen? It is the right
to sue as "a citizen" of Missouri, which is
questioned: and it is immaterial whether the
right be questioned on account of residence, or
on account of any other circumstance which
deprives him of the character of a citizen of
Missouri.<p>

2. But if the court should be of opinion
that the question raised by the plea in abatement, and the demurrer thereto, is
not waived,
and that the judgment of the Circuit Court
therein must be maintained before it will consider the questions affecting his
right to freedom, I submit the following considerations in
support of the judgment on the demurrer:<p>

The opinion of the court in Amy v Smith, 1
Litt. 326, 4 Ga. 68, that free negroes are not
citizens within the meaning of the 2d section
of the 4th article of the Constitution, delivered
in the spring of 1822, displays no research, logic or learning. On the other
hand, the dissenting opinion of Judge Mills, p. 337, is sustained
by the views of Judge Washington in Corfield v.
Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 71.<p>

21 Ala. 434; State v. Manuel, 4 Dev. &amp; Bat.
24.<p>

The other decisions relied on, Meigs, 339;
1 English, 509, are to the same effect as the decision in Amy v. Smith, and
simply follow that.<p>

The argument most relied on by those who
deny the citizenship of free colored men is, that
the Acts of Congress on the subject of naturalization provide for naturalizing
white persons
only. But even naturalization was not limited
to the whites by the Constitution, and it has
been extended repeatedly by treaty and Act of
Congress to Indians and negroes.<p>

Treaty with Choctaws, art. 14, 20th September, 1830; Treaty with the
Cherokees, 12th art.,
Vol. V. U. S. Laws, 647; Treaties of 1803 for
Louisiana, 1819 for Florida, 1847 for California; 21 Ala. 454; and as Judge
Gaston says, 4
Dev. &amp; Bat. 24, there is no connection between
the subject of citizenship as acquired by birth
and that acquired under the laws of Congress,
and it would be a dangerous mistake to confound them. That citizenship is
acquired by
birth, is a well settled common law principle.<p>

Vattel, ch. 19, secs. 212, 313, 314; Justinian,
Lib. 1, Tit. 5, sec. 3; Constitution, sec. 5, art. 2.<p>

The Constitution of the United States recognizes but two kinds of free
persons, citizens and aliens. Nobody supposes that free negroes are
aliens. They must therefore be citizens.<p>

Opinions Atty.-Gen. Vol. IV. p. 417; 3d sec.
Act March 6, 1820; 6th sec. Act of 1812, to
form a territorial government in Missouri;
Militia Act, May 17, 1792; Constitutions of
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Connecticut
and Missouri.<p>

All of the above define the qualifications of
electors in terms, "free white male citizens;"
and thus show that it is as a class of citizens
that the negroes are excluded. These considerations would authorize the
conclusion that
the framers of the Constitution and the patriots of that era regarded this
class of persons
as citizens, and included them in that character in the provisions of the
Constitution; and
this is fully confirmed by reference to the laws
and records of that day.<p>

Act of Mass. 6th March, 1788, Proposal of
South Carolina, Jan. 25, 1778, to amend the 4th
article; Journals, Vol. II. p. 606; Journals,
Vol. IV. p. 183; Organization of the Western
Territory, Resolutions, April 23, 1784; Ordinance 1787, art. 4; 2 Kent's Com.
p. 268, note b.<p>

Missouri Rev. Laws of 1845, p. 755, and Code
of 1835, allude to free negroes who were "citizens."<p>

No reason can be imagined for permitting a
suit between free white persons of different
states, for wrongs which the local tribunals
were deemed inadequate to redress, which will
not apply with equal force to controversies to
which a free negro may be a party. They have
equal capacity with other citizens to hold property and carry on business,
and therefore to
create the mischief against which the national judiciary was provided. The
words of a law
are to be construed with reference to the object
of the law.<p>

16 Pet. 640; 12 Wheat. 441; 16 Pet. 104.<p>

In l Paine, C. C. 394, the courts say that a
person need not have acquired political rights;
it is only necessary that he should have acquired a domicil, to enable him to
sue as a citizen; and in 3 Wash. C. C. 546, that "citizenship means nothing but
residence."<p>

3. The next question to be considered is,
whether Dred and his family, or either of them,
was emancipated by being taken to Illinois, and
to that part of Louisiana Territory lying north
of 36 degrees 30 minutes, and being detained
there in the manner described in the agreed
case. The eldest child, Eliza, having been born
north of the Missouri line, on the boat whilst
descending the Mississippi, was free under the
Constitution of Illinois, and well settled legal
principles.<p>

Constitution of Illinois, art. 6, secs. 1 and 2;
3 U. S. Stat. at L. p. 544; Spotts v. Gillaspie, 6
Rand. (Va.), 572; Commonwealth v. Holloway,
2 S. & R. 305.<p>

The Circuit Court decided against the plaintiff on the strength of Scott v.
Emerson, 15 Mo. 586.<p>

But the question depends on general principles, and the courts of the United
States,
whilst they will respectfully consider the decisions of the State Court, decide
such questions
according to their own judgment of the law.<p>

Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1; Carpenter v. Ins.
Co. 16 Pet. 511; Lane v. Vick, 3 How. 476;
Foxcroft v. Mallett, 4 How. 379.<p>

During the time that Dr. Emerson kept Dred
at his station at Rock Island, and Harriet at
Fort Snelling, there is no evidence that he had
or claimed a residence elsewhere, and this
court, in Ennis v. Smith, 14 How. 423, "where
a party lives, is taken prima facie to be his
domicil."<p>

See, also, Sylvia v. Kirby, 17 Mo. 434.<p>

In the case of Scott v. Emerson, 15 Mo. 576,
the court base their decision on two grounds:<p>

1st. That by returning to Missouri to reside
the master's right, which was suspended during
the residence in Illinois, and in the Territory,
is revived.<p>

2d. The Constitution of Illinois, and the 8th
sec. of the Act of 1820, are penal statutes
which the courts of other States were not
bound to enforce.<p>

In support of the first position, Ex parte
Grace, 2 Hagg. 90; Commonwealth v. Aves, 18
Pick. 193, and Mahoney v. Ashton, 4 H. & McH.
295, were cited.<p>

These decisions are inapplicable to the case
at bar, for in the present case the Constitution
and Statute of Illinois expressly provide that
emancipation shall be the effect of the violation
of the provision. The laws under which the
above decisions were made were different.<p>

David v. Porter, 4 H. & McH. 418; Betty v.
Horton, 1 Lee, 615.<p>

The second ground relied upon by the court
was equally untenable. See opinion of Judge
Gambles, of the same case of Emerson v. Scott,
"in this State it has been recognized from the
beginning of the government as a correet position in law, that the master who
takes his
slave to reside in a state or territory where
slavery is prohibited, emancipates his slave.<p>

Also McMicken v. Amos, 4 Rand. 134; Bank
v Earle, 13 Pet. 590; Spencer v. Dennis, 8 Gill
321.<p>

4. The freedom of Harriet and her daughter
Lizzie depends on the validity of the 8th section of the Act of March 6, 1820,
entitled "An Act to authorize the people of Missouri Territory to form a
constitution and state government," etc.<p>

The section is as follows:<p>

That in all that territory ceded by France to
the United States which lies north of 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude,
not included
within the limits of the State contemplated by
this Act, slavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than in the
punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,
shall be, and the same is hereby forever prohibited.<p>

Provided, always, that any person escaping
into the same, from whom labor or service is
lawfully claimed in any State or Territory of
the United States, such fugitive may be lawfully
reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as
aforessaid.<p>

The validity of this section is denied, on the
ground that Congress possessed no power to
prohibit slavery in the Territories.<p>

It is not the power to govern the Territories,
but the extent of the power which is questioned.
Even those who deny any constitutional power
to govern the Territories, admit the power on
the ground of necessity; but they say where
the necessity stops, there the power ceases.
But this concedes the whole question; for if it
be lawful to legislate at all, the quantum which
may be necessary is purely a legislative
question; and indeed, whether the Constitution confers
directly the legislative power in question
or not is immaterial, seeing that it owns the
lands and has power to pass what laws it may
deem expedient to dispose of and make them
available.<p>

Undoubtedly, for temporary purposes, it is
indispensable that provision be made to govern
the people in order that the lands shall possess
any value, or that what remains after part is
sold, may not be seized and confiscated. What
would be proper provisions to this end, is not
within the scope of judicial inquiry. If it were,
it is demonstrable that the provision in question
is most judicious, as a mere regulation to
facilitate the disposition of public lands.<p>

But it is alleged that the particular provision
prohibiting slavery is violative of some part of
the Constitution, which establishes the equality
of the States and the rights of slave holders to
take that species of property into the Territories
of the United States. I admit that whether
the power of Congress to legislate be given expressly
or by implication, it is given with the limitation that it shall be
exercised in subordination to the Constitution, and that if it be
exercised in violation of any provisions of the
Constitution, the Act wouid be void. Subject
to this limitation, Congress is at liberty to
adopt any means to accomplish its object.<p>

McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316.<p>

But where is it written in the Constitution
that no law shall be passed prohibiting slavery in
the territories? Not only was this measure
adopted as one deemed advisable and proper to
the well government of the territories under
both the Confederation and the Constitution,
but when the Mississippi Territory was ceded
in 1798, it was deemed necessary to stipulate
that slavery should not be prohibited, in order
to limit the discretion of Congress. The limitation sought to be imposed is one
dependent altogether upon state laws, and subjects Congress
to the State Legislatures. The Act is now
claimed as unconstitutional, because a species
of property recognized in the laws of the States
cannot be held in the Territories; but it would
become constitutional if the States should cease
to recognize such property; and again unconstitutional if the States should
recognize it
again. How the law in question affects the
States as States, in any respeet, is not perceived; it is not pretended that
any State has
legislative rights in the Territories.<p>

Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 322.<p>

On other subjects, there are difficutlties in
adjusting the rights of the general and state
governments; but there can be no conflict on
this. Over the Territories, the general government
alone has any power; and in the exercise
of that, as of all other powers, is a government
of the people. "In form and substance (this
court says), it emanates from them, its powers
are granted by them, and are to be exercised on
them and for their benefit."<p>

On this branch of the subject, the counsel
cited the following authorities: Story's Com.

Messrs. H. S. Geyer and R. Johnson, for the
defemdent in error:<p>

This cause was argued hefore this court at
the Decmber Term, 1855, when it was ordered
to be re-argued by counsel for their respective
parties, at a next term of court, and espeeially
upon the following points:<p>

1. Whether or not the facts being admitted
by the demurrer to the plea to the jurisdiction,
the judgment on the demurrer being that the
defendant answer over, and the submission of
the defendant to that judgmnent, by pleading
over to the merits, the appellate court can take
notice of these facts thus admitted upon the
record, in determining the question of the
jurisdiction to the court below, to hear and fully
dispose of the case.<p>

2. Whether or not, assuming that the appellate court is bound to take notice
of the facts
thus appearing upon the record, the plaintiff is
a citizen of the State of Missouri within the
meaning of the 11th section of the Judiciary
Act of 1789.<p>

1. The averment that the plaintiff is a citizen of the State of Missouri is a
necessary
averment. If it had been omitted or defectively stated, it would have been
error in the Circuit Court to entertain jurisdiction, even
though the defendent had not traversed the
averment, but pleaded to the merits.<p>

3 Dall. 382; 2 Cranch, 1, 126; Sullivan v.
Fulton Steamboat Co. 6 Wheat. 450; Turner v.
Enrille, 4 Dall. 7; Capron v. Van Noorden, 2
Cranch, 126.<p>

If the plea demurred to, is to be regarded as
a traverse or averment of citizenship of the
plaintiff, then the fact on which the plaintiff
claims a right to sue in the Circuit Court does
not appear by the record; on the contrary, it
appears affirmatively that he had no right to
sue in that court. The whole question, whether
the court could entertain jurisdiction and allow
the defendant to plead over, depends on the decision on the demurrer. lf that
was erroneous,
it was error to proeeed further, and the defendants pleading over could not
give jurisdiction.<p>

2. It appears by the record that the defendant is a negro, born a slave and
therefore,
whether he is entitled to freedom or not, by his
temporary residence at Rock Island or Fort
Snelling, or both, he is not and cannot be a
citizen of the State of Missouri, within the
meaning of the Constitution, or sec. 11 of the
Judiciary Act.<p>

Citizens, within the meaning of art. 3, sec. 2,
are citizens of the United States, who are citizens of the state in which they
respeetively reside.<p>

Read v. Bertrand, 4 Wash. C. C. 516; Knox
v. Greenleaf, 4 Dall. 360; 3 Story on Const.
565, secs. 1687, 1688; 6 Pet. 761.<p>

Citizens are natives or naturalized. All persons born in the United States
are not citizens.<p>

Exceptions are:<p>

First. Children of foreign ambassadors.<p>

Second. Indians.<p>

Third. In general, persons of color.<p>

1 Bouv. Inst. pp. 16, 64; Amy v Smith, 1
Lit. Ky. 334; 2 Kent's Com. p. 258, note b.<p>

Free blacks are not citizens within the provision of the Constitution, art. 4,
sec. 2; so held by Dagget, Ch. J., in Connecticut. See note Kent's Com.
supra.<p>

See, also, State v. Claiborne, 1 Meigs, 331;
Opinions Atty.-Gen. Vol. I. 382, ed. 41; Vol.
I. p. 506, ed 52. "An inquiry into the political grade of the free colored
population, under
the Constithtion of the United States." by
John P. Denny.<p>

Persons who are not citizens of the United
States by birth, can become such only by virtue
of a treaty, or in pursuance of some law of the
United States.<p>

The power of naturalization is exclusively
vested in Congress.<p>

U. S. v. Villato, 2 Dall. 370; Chirac v.
Chirac, 2 Wheat. 269; Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 48.<p>

A slave cannot become a citizen merely by a
discharge from bondage.<p>

3. Assuming that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, the facts, as agreed by
the parties,
do not establish the right of the plaintiff, his
wife and children, or either of them, to freedom.<p>

Sec. I of art. 5 of the Constitution of Illinois, and sec. 8 of the Act of 6
March, 1820, do
not declare the consequence of bringing a slave
within the Territory, embraced. There is no
exception or saving in respect to the rights of
travelers. The effect of the provision is, in
terms, the same, whether a slave is introduced
to reside there or for some temporary purpose.
Neither clause changes the condition of the
slave brought into the Territory embraced by it.
The slave is held to be free while he remains
within such State or country, only because his
owner has not the authority of law to restrain
him of his liberty.<p>

The owner'a authority is restored if the slave
is found within a State or country where slavery exists by law.<p>

The Slave Grace, 2 Hagg. Adm. 94; Willard v.
The People, 4 Seam. 461; Graham v. Strader,
6 B. Mon. 181; 7 B. Mon. 633, Collins v.
America, 9 B. Mon. 565, Mercer v. Gilman, 11
B. Mon. 210; Maria v. Kirby, 12 B. Mon. 542;
Lewis v. Fullerton, 1 Rand. 16.<p>

It has been held that where an owner of a
slave brings him into a State or country in
which slavery does not exist, or is prohibited
by law, with the intention to make it his
domicil, it operates as an emancipation, and the
master cannot resume domain, though the slave return to, or is found in a
country where slavery exists by law.<p>

Rankin v. Lydia, 2 A. K. Marsh. 467; Griffith
v. Fanny, Gilm. (Va.) 143; Lunsford v.
Coquillon, 2 Mart N. S. 405; Josephine v.
Poultney, 1 La. Ann. 329; Winney v. Whitesides, 1 Mo. 472; Milly v. Smith, 2
Mo. 172;
Nat v. Ruddle, 8 Mo. 282; Rachel v. Walker, 4
Mo. 350; overruled in Scott v. Emerson, 15
Mo. 570; Sylvia v. Kirby, 17 Mo. 434.<p>

These are cases of emancipation by the voluntary act of the master, binding
upon him
everywhere, as would be emancipation upon
any other proof recognized by law. Slaves, however, attending their owners
temporarily
sojourning in, or traveling through a State
wherein slavery does not exist by law, are not
thereby emancipated.<p>

2 A. K. Marsh. 467, Graham v. Strader, 5
B. Mon. 181; Mercer v. Gilman, 11 B. Mon.
210; Maria v. Kirby, 12 B. Mon 542; Lewis v.
Fullerton, 1 Rand. 15; Henry v. Ball, 1 Wheat.
1; Spragg v. Mary, 3 Harr. & J.; Pocock v.
Hendricks, 8 Gill & J. 421; The Slave Grace,
2 Hagg. 94; Commonwealth v. Aves, 18 Pick.
193; Mahoney v. Ashton, 4 H. & McH. 295.<p>

The present plaintiff in error was held not
entitled to his freedom, on the same state of
facts as is now in evidence, in Scott v. Emerson, 15 Mo. 434.<p>

This decision was affirmed in Sylvia v. Kirby, 17 Mo. 434.<p>

By the laws of Missouri, therefore, the claimants are slaves, and these laws
must determine
their condition in the courts of the United
States.<p>

Strader v. Graham, 10 How. 93.<p>

4. No residence of a slave at Fort Snelling
could change his condition or divest the title
of his owner.<p>

Slavery existed by law in all the territory
ceded by France to the United States, and Congress has not the constitutional
power to repeal that law, or abolish or prohibit slavery,
within any part of that Territory.<p>

Sec. 8 of the Act of March 6, 1820, is the
first, and almost the only instance of an assumption by Congress of tho power
to abolish
slavery in the Territory. lt has never been recognized by this court. It is
understood to be
claimed that authority of Congress to erect
territorial governments is confirmed by art.
4, sec. 3, of the Constitution, which gives the
"power to dispose of and make all needful rules
and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
United States," or
to resul from the power to acquire territory;
and in either case, it comprehends a power of
legislation exclusive, universal, absolute and
unlimited.<p>

3 Story, Const. secs. 1314, 1315, 1318, 1319,
1320, 1322; 1 Kent's Com. 423.<p>

The clause of the Constitution, however, has
been judicially interpreted to be a power to dispose of and make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the lands and other property
of the United States.<p>

U. S. v. Gratiot, 14 Pet. 526, 537; Am. Ins.
Co. v. Carter, 1 Pet. 342; see, also, Federalist, No. 43.<p>

The subject of the power conferred by art. 4,
sec. 3, is property, and the property only of
the United States. This power is over unappropriated lands.<p>

To organize a municipal government or corporation for the district or
countly, to prohibit
slavery, or to interfere in any way with the law
of property, is not to make needful rules and
regulations respecting the territory or other
property belonging within such distlict; therefore, the power to institute
such a government,
and more especially an unlimited power to legislate in all cases over the
inhabitants in a territory and their property, cannot be deduced
from the clause under consideration.<p>

The power of Congress to institute temporary
government over any territory, results necessarily from the fact that it is
not within the jurisdiction of any particular State, and is within
the power and jurisdiction of the United States.
It is the power resulting from the necessity of
the State, and is limited to the necessity from
which it arises;
to change the law of property,
to emancipate slavery, to abolish slavery where,
by the law it exists, to confiscate property, or
devest vested rights, cannot be necessary or
proper to the institution of a temporary
governmnent. The power of Congress over the territory
belonging to the United
States cannot
authorize legislation which practically excludes
from such territory the people of any portion of
the Union, or prevents them from taking and holding in such territory any
property recognized by the Constitution, and the
local laws of the territory.<p>

Mr. Chief Justice Taney delivered the opinion of the court:<p>

This case has been twice argued. After the
argument at the last term, differences of opinion were found to exist among
the members of the court; and as the questions in controversy
are of the highest importance, and the court
was at that time much pressed by the ordinary
business of the term, it was deemed advisable
to continue the case and direct a re-argument
on some of the points, in order that we might
have an opportunity of giving to the whole subject a more deliberate
consideration.
lt has accordingly been again argued by counsel, and considered by the court,
and I now
proceed to deliver its opinion.<p>

There are two leading questions presented by
the record:<p>

1. Had the Circuit Court of the United
States jurisdiction to hear and determine the
case between these parties? And,<p>

2. If it had jurisdiction, is the judgment it
has given erroneous or not?<p>

The plaintiff in error, who was also the
plaintiff in the court below, was, with his wife
and children, held as slaves by the defendant,
in the State of Missouri, and he brought this
action in the Circuit Court of the United States
for that district to assert the title of himself
and his family io freedom.<p>

The declaration is in the form usually adopted in that State to try questions
of this description, and contains the averment necessary to
give the court jurisdiction: that he and the
defendant are citizens of diferent States; that is,
he is a citizen of Missouri, and the defendant a
citizen of New York.<p>

The defendant pleaded in abatement to the
jurisdiction of the court, that the plaintiff was
not a citizen of the State of Missouri, as alleged in his declaration, being a
negro of African descent, whose ancestors were of pure
African blood, and who were brought into this
country and sold as slaves.<p>

To this plea the plaintiff dernurred, and the
defendant joined in demurrer. The court overruled the plea, and gave
judgment that the defendant should answer over. And he
thereupon put in sundry pleas in bar, upon which issues were joined, and
at the trial the verdict
and judgment were in his favor. Whereupon
the plaintiff brought this writ of error.<p>

Before we speak of the pleas in bar, it will be
proper to dispose of the questions which have
arisen on the plea in abatement.<p>

That plea denies the right of the plaintiff to
sue in a court of the United States, for the
reasons therein stated.<p>

If the question raised by it is legally before
us, and the court should be of opinion that the
facts stated in it disqualify the plaintiff from
becoming a citizen, in the sense in which that
word is used in the Constitution of the United
States, then the judgment of the Circuit Court
is erroneous, and must be reversed.<p>

It is suggested, however, that this plea is
not before us; and that as the judgment in
the court below on this plea was in favor of
the plaintiff, he does not seek to reverse it, or
bring it before the court for revision by his
writ of error; and also that the defendant
waived this defense by pleading over, and
thereby admitted the jurisdiction of the court.
But in making this objection, we
think the peculiar and limited jurisdiction of
courts of the United States has not been adverted to. This peculiar and limited
jurisdiction has made it necessary, in these courts
to adopt different rules and principles of pleading, so far as jurisdiction is
concerned, from
those which regulate courts of common law in
England and in the different States of the
Union which have adopted the common law
rules.<p>

In these last mentioned courts, where their
character and rank are analogous to that of a
circuit court of the United States; in other
words, where they are what the law terms
courts of general jurisdiction, they are presumed to have jurisdiction unless
the contrary
appears. No averment in the pleadings of the
plaintiff is necessary, in order to give jurisdiction. If the defendant
objects to it, he must
plead it specially, and unless the fact on which
he relies is found to be true by a jury, or admitted to be true by the
plaintiff, the jurisdiction cannot be disputed in an appellate court.<p>

Now, it is not necessary to inquire whether in
courts of that deseription a party who pleads
over in bar, when a plea to the jurisdiction has
been ruled against him, doos or does not waive
his plea; nor whether upon a judgment in his
favor on the pleas in bar, and a writ of error
brought by the plaintiff, the question upon the
plea in abatement would be open for revision in
the appellate court. Cases that may have been
decided in such courts, or rules that may have
been laid down by common law pleaders, can
have no influence in the decision in this court.
Because, under the Constitution and laws of
the United States, the rules which govern the
pleadings in its courts, in questions of jurisdiction, stand on different
principles and are
regulated by different laws.<p>

This difference arises, as we have said, from
the pecular character of the government of the
United States. For although it is sovereign
and supreme in its appropriate sphere of action,
yet it does not possess all the powers which
usually belong to the sovereignty of a nation.
Certain specified powers, enumerated in the
Constitution, have been conferred upon it; and
neither the Legislative, Executive nor Judicial
Departments of the Government can lawfully
exercise any authority beyond the limits
marked out in the Constitution. And in regulating the Judicial Department,
the cases in
which the courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction are particularly
and specifcally enumerated and defined; and they are not authorized to take
cognizance of any case which does not come within the description therein
specified. Hence, when a plaintiff sues in a
court of the United States, it is necessary that
he should show, in his pleading, that
the suit he brings is within the jurisdiction of
the court, and that he is entitled to sue there.
And if he omits to do this, and shouldd, by an
oversight of the Circuit Court, obtain a judgment in his favor, the judgment
would be reversed in the appeilate court for want of jurisdiction in the court
below. The jurisdiction
would not be presumed, as in the case of a
common law, English, or state court, unless the contrary appeared. But the
record, when it
comes before the appellate court, must show
affirmatively, that the inferior court had authority, under the Constitution,
to hear and
determine the case. And if the plaintiff claims
a right to sue in a circuit court of the United
States, under that provision of the Constitution which gives jurisdiction in
controversies
between citizens of different states, he must
distinctly aver in his pleading that they are
citizens of different states, and he cannot
maintain his suit without showing that fact in
the pleading.<p>

This point was decided in the case of Bingham v. Cabot, in 3 Dall. 382, and
ever since adhered to by the court. And in Jackson v.
Ashton, 8 Pet. 148, it was held that the objection to which it was open could
not be waived
by the opposite party, because consent of parties could not give
jurisdiction.<p>

It is needless to accumulate cases on this subject. Those already referred to,
and the cases
of Capron v. Van Noorden, in 2 Cranch, 126,
and Montalet v. Murray, 4 Cranch, 40, are sufficient to show the rule of which
we have
spoken. The case of Capron v. Van Noorden
strikingly illustrates the diference between a
common law court and a court of the United
States.<p>

If however, the fact of citizenship is averred
in the declaration, and the defendant does not
deny it, and put it in issue by plea in abatement, he cannot offer evidence at
the trial to
disprove it, and consequently cannot avail himself of the objection in the
appellate court, unless the defect should be apparent in some other
part of the record. For if there is no plea in
abatement, and the want of jurisdiction does
not appear in any other part of the transcript
brought up by the writ of error, the undisputed
averment of citizenship in the declaration must
be taken in this court to be true. In this case
the citizenship is averred, but it is denied by
the defendant in the manner required by the
rules of pleading, and the fact upon which the
denial is based is admitted by the demurrer.
And if the plea and demurrer, and judgmemt of
the court below upon it, are before us upon this
record, the question to be decided is, whether
the facts stated in the plea are sufficient to
show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue
as a citizen in a court of the Untied States.<p>

We think they are before us. The
plea in abatement and the judgment of the
court upon it, are a part of the judicial proceedings in the Circuit Court, and
are there recorded as such; and a writ of error always
brings up to the superior court the whole record
of the pleedings in the court below. And in
the case of The Bank of the U. S. v. Smith, 11
Wheat. 172, this court said, that the case being
brought up by writ of error, the whole record
was under the consideration of this court. And
this being the case in the present instance, the
plea in abatement is necessarily under consideration; and it becomes,
therefore, our duty
to decide whether the facts stated in the plea
are or are not sufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as
a citizen in a court
of the United States.<p>

This is certainly a very serious question, and
one that now for the first time has been brought
for decision before this court. But it is brought
here by those who have a right to bring it, and
it is our duty to meet it and decide it.<p>

The question is simply this: can a negro,
whose ancestors were imported into this country and sold as slaves, become a
member of
the political community formed and brought
into existence by the Constitution of the United
States, and as such become entitled to all the
rights, and privileges, and immunities, guarantied by that Instrument to the
citizen. One of
these rights is the privilege of suing in a court
of the United States in the cases specified in
the Constitution.<p>

It will be observed, that the plea applies to
that class of persons only whose ancestors were
negroes of the African race, and imported into
this country, and sold and held as slaves. The
only matter in issue before the court, therefore,
is, whether the descendants of such slaves,
when they shall be emancipated, or who are
born of parents who had become free before
their birth, are citizens of a state, in the sense
in which the word "citizen" is used in the
Constitution of the United States. And this
being the only matter in dispute on the pleadings, the court must be
understood as speaking
in this opinion of that class only; that is, of
those persons who are the descendants of Africans who were imported into this
country and sold as slaves.<p>

The situation of this population was altogether unlike that of the Indian
race. The
latter, it is true, formed no part of the colonial
communities, and never amalgamated with them
in social conneetions or in government. But
although they were uncivilized, they were yet
a free and independent people, associated together in nations or tribes, and
governed by
their own laws. Many of these political communities were situated in
territories to which
the white race claimed the ultimate
right of dominion. But that claim was
acknowledged to be subject to the right of the
Indians to occupy it as long as they thought
proper, and neither the English nor Colonial
governments claimed or exercised any dominion
over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied, nor claimed the right to the
possession
of the territory, until the tribe or nation consented to cede it. These Indian
governments
were regarded and treated as foreign governments, as much so as if an ocean had
separated
the red man from the white; and their freedom
has constantly been acknowledged, from the
time of the first emigration to the English
Colonies to the present day, by the different
governments which suceeded each other.
Treaties have been negotiated with them, and
their alliance sought for in war; and the people
who compose these Indian political communities have always been treated as
foreigners not
living under our government. It is true
that
the course of events has brought the Indian
tribes within the limits of the United States
under supjection to the white race; and it has
heen found necessary, for their sake as well as
our own, to regard them as in a state of pupilage, and to legislate to a
certain extent over
them and the territory they occupy. But they
may, without doubt, like the subjects of any
other foreign govemment, be naturalized by the
authority of Congress, and become citizens of
a State and of the United States; and if an
individual should leave his nation or tribe, and
take up his abode among the white population,
he would be entitled to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an
emigrant from
any other foreign people.<p>

We proceed to examine the case as presented
by the pleadings.<p>

The words "people of the United States" and
"citizens" are synonymous terms, and mean the
same thing. They both deseribe the political
body, who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and
who hold the
power and conduct the government through
their representatives. They are what we
familiarly call the "sovereign people," and
every citizen is one of this peoples and a constituent member of this
sovereignty. The
question before us is, whether the class of persons deseribed in the plea in
abatement compose
a portion of this people, and are constituent
members of this sovereignty. We think they
are not, and that they are not included, and
were not intended to be included, under the
word "citizens" in the Constitution, and can,
therefore, claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument
provides for and
secures to citizens of the United States. On
the contrary, they were at that time considered
as a subordinate and inferior class of
beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and whether emancipated
or not,
yet remained subject to their anthority, and
had no rights or privileges but such as those
who held the power and the government might
choose to grant them.<p>

It is not the province of this court to decide
upon the justice or injustice, the policy or impolicy of these laws. The
decision of that question belonged to the political or policy-making
power; to those who formed the sovereignty
and framed the Constitution. The duty of the
court is to interpret the instument they have
framed, with the best lights we can obtain on
the subject, and to administer it as we find it,
according to its true intent and meaning when
it was andopted.<p>

In discussing this question we must not confound the rights of citizenship
which a state may confer within its own limits, and the
rights of citizenship as a member of the Union.
It does not by any means follow, because he
has all the rights and privileges of
a State, that he must be a citizen of the United
States. He may have all the rights and privileges of the citizen of a State,
and yet not be
entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen
in any other State. For, previous to the adoption of the Constitution of the
United States,
every State had the undoubted right to confer
on whomever it pleased the character of a
citizen, and to endow him with all its rights.
But this character, of course, was confined to
the bourders of the State and gave him no
rights or privileges in other States beyond those
secured to him by the laws of nations and the
comity of States. Nor have the several States
surrendered the power of conferring these
rights and privileges by adopting the Constitution of the United Stales. Each
State may still
confer them upon an alien, or any one it thinks
proper, or upon any class or description of persons; yet he would not be a
citizen in the sense
in which that word is used in the Constitution
of the United States, nor entitled to sue as such
in one of its courts, nor to the privileges and
immunities of a citizen in the other States.
The rights which he would acquire would be
restricted to the State which gave them. The
Constitution has conferred on Congress the
right to establish an uniform rule of naturalization, and this right is
evidently exclusive, and
has always been held by this court to be so.
Consequently no State, since the adoption of
the Constitution, can, by naturalizing an alien,
invest him with the rights and privileges secured to a citizen of a State
under the federal
government, although, so far as the State alone
was concerned, he would undoubtedly be entitled to the rights of a citizen,
and clothed
with all the rights and immunities
which the Constitution and laws of the State
attached to that character.<p>

It is very clear, therefore, that no State can,
by any Act or law of its own, passed since the
adoption of the Constitution, introduce a new
member into the political community created by
the Constitution of the United States. It cannot make him a member of this
community by
making him a member of its own. And for the
same reason it cannot introduce any person,
or description of persons, who were not intended to be embraced in this new
political family,
which the Constitution brught into existence,
but were intended to be excluded from it.<p>

The question then arises, whether the provisions of the Constitution, in
relation to the
personal rights and privileges to which the
citizen of a state should be entitled, embraced
the negro African race, at that time in this
country, or who might afterwards be imported,
who had then or should afterwards be made
free in any Slate; and to put it in the power
of a single State to make him a citizen of the
United States, and endue him with the full
rights of citizenship in every other State without their consent. Does the
Constitution of
the United Slates act upon him whenever he
shall be made free under the laws of a State,
and raised there to the rank of a citizen, and
immediately clothe him with all the privileges
of a citizen in every other State, and in its
own courts?<p>

The court thinks the affirmative of these propositions cannot be maintained.
And if it cannot, the plaintiff in error could not be a citizen
of the State of Missouri, within the meaning of
the Constitution of the United States, and
consequetls was not entitled to sue in its
courts.<p>

It is true, every person, and every class and
description of persons, who were at the time of
the adoption of the Constitution recognized as
citizens in the several States, becamne also
citizens of this new political body; but none
other; it was formed by them, and for them
and their posterity, but for no one else. And
the personal rights and privileges guaranteed to
citizens of this new sovereignty were intended
to embrace those only who were then members
f the several state communities or who should
afterwards, by birthright or otherwise, become
members according to the provisions of the
Constitution and the principles on which it was
founded. It was the union of those who were
at that time members of distinct and separate
political communities into one political family,
whose powers for certain specified purposes was
to extend over the whole territory of the United States. And it gave to each
citizen rights
and privileges outside of his State, which
he did not before possess, and placed him in
every other State upon a perfect equality with
its own citizens as to rights of person and
rights of property; it made him a citizen of
the United States.<p>

It becomes necessary, therefore, to determine
who were citizens of the several States when
the Constitution was adopted. And in order
to do this, we must recur to the governments
and institutions of the thirteen Colonies, when
they separated from Great Britain and formed
new sovereignties, and took their places in the
family of independent nations. We must inquire who, at that time, were
recognized as the
people or citizens of a State, whose rights and
liberties had been outraged by the English Government; and who declared their
independence,
and assumed the powers of government to defend
their rights by force of arms.<p>

In the opinion of the court, the legislation
and histories of the times, and the language
used in the Declaration of Independence, show,
that neither the class of persons who had been
imported as slaves, nor their descendents,
whether they had become free or not, were then
acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the
general words used
in that memorable instrument.<p>

It is difficult at this day to realize the state
of public opinion in relation to that unfortunate
race, which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at
the time of
the Declaration of Independence, and when
the Constitution of the United States was
written and adopted. But the public history of
every European nation displays it, in manner too plain to be mistaken.<p>

They had for more than a century before
been regarded as beings of an inferior order
and altogether unfit to associate with the
white race, either in social or politieal relations; and so far inferior, that
they had no
rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might
justly and
lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.
He was bonght and sold, and treated as an
ordinary article of merchandise and traffic,
whenever a proflt could be made by it. This
opinion was at that time fixed and universal in
the civilized portion of the white race. It was
regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in
politics, which no one thought of disputing, or
supposed to be open to dispute; and men in
every grade and position in society daily and
habitually acted upon it in their private pursuits, as well as in matters of
public concern,
without doubting for a moment the correctness of this opinion.<p>

And in no nation was this opinion more firmly fixed or more uniformly acted
upon
than by the English government and English
people. They not only seized them on the coast
of Africa, and sold them or held them in
slavery for their own use, but they took them
as ordinary articles of merchandise to every
country where they could make a profit on
them, and were far more extensively engaged
in this commerce than any other nation in the
world.<p>

The opinion thus entertained and acted upon
in England was naturnlly impressed upon the
colonies they founded on this side of the
Atlantic. And, accordingly, a negro of the
African race was regarded by them as an
article of property, and held, and bought and
sold as such, in every one of the thirteen
Colonles which united in the Declaration of Independence, and afterwards formed
the Constitution of the United States. The slaves were
more or less numerous in the different Colonies,
as slave labor was found more or less profitable. But no one seems to have
doubted the
correctness of the prevailing opinion of the
time.<p>

The legislation of the different Colonies furnishes positive and indisputable
proof of this fact.<p>

It would be tedious, in this opinion, to
enumerate the various laws they passed upon
this subject. It will he sufficient, as a sample
of the legislation which then generally prevailed throughont the British
Colonies, to give
the laws of two of them; one being still a
large slaveholding State, and the other the
first State in which slavery ceased to exist.<p>

The Province of Maryland, in 1717 (ch. 13,
sec. 5), passed a law declaring "that if any
free negro or mulatto intermarry with any
white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto
woman, such
negro or mulatto shall become a slave during
life, excepting mulattoes born of white women
who, for such intermarriage, shall only become
servants for seven years, to be disposed of as
the Justices of the County Court, where such
marriage so happens, shall think fit; to be applied
by them towards the support a public
school within the said county. And any white
man or white woman who shall intermarry as
aforesaid, with any negro or milatto, such
white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven
years, and shall
be disposed of by the justiees aforesaid, and
be applied to the uses aforesaid."<p>

The other colonial law to which we refer was
passed by Massachusetts in 1705 (chap. 6).
It is entitled "An Act for the better preventing
of a spurious and mixed issue," etc.; and it
provides, that "if any negro or milatto shall
presume to smite or strike any person of the
English or other Christian nation, such negro
or mulatto shall he severely whipped, at
the diseretion of the justices before
whom the offender shall be convicted."<p>

And "that none of Her Majesty's English
or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian
nation, within this province, shall contract
matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor
shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize
marriage, presume to join any such in marriage,
on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds;
one moiety thereof to Her Majesty, for and
towards the support of the government within
this province, and the other moiety to him or
them that shall inform and sue for the same
in any of Her Majesty's courts of record within the Province, by will, plaint,
or information."<p>

We give both of these laws in the words used
by the respective legislative bodies, because the
language in which they are framed, as well as
the provisions contained in them, show, too
plainly to be misunderstood, the degraded condition of this unhappy race. They
were still
in force when the Revolution began, and are a
faithful index to the state of feeling towards
the class of persons of whom they speak, and
of the position they occupied throughout the
thirteen colonies, in the eyes and thoughts of
the men who framed the Declaration of Independence and established the State
constitutions and governments. They show that a perpetual and impassable
barrier was intended to
be erected between the white race and the one
which they had reduced to slavery, and governed as subjects with absolute and
despotic
power, and which they then looked upon as so
far below them in the scale of created beings,
that intermarriages between white persons and
negroes or mulattoes were regarded as unnatural and immoral, and punished as
crimes, not
only on the parties, but in the person who
joined them in marriage. And no distinction in
this respect was made between the free negro
or mulatto and the slave, but this stigma, of
the deepest degradation, was fixed upon the
whole race.<p>

We refer to these historieal facts for the
purpose of showing the fixed opinions concerning this race, upon which the
statesmen of
that day spoke and acted. It is necessary to
do this, in order to determine whether the general terms used in the
Constitution of the
United States, as to the rights of man and the
rights of the people, was intended to include
them, or to give to them or their posterity the
benefit of any of its provisions.<p>

The language of the Declaration of Independence is equally conclusive.<p>

It begins by declaring that, "when in the
course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
political bands
which have connected them with another, and
to assume among the powers of the
earth the separate and equal station to which
the laws of nature and nature's God entitle
tem, a decent respect for the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation."<p>

It then proceeds to say: "We hold these
truths to be self-evident: that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among them is life, liberty, and pursuit of
happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted, deriving
their just powers
from the consent of the governed."<p>

The general words above quoted woould seem
to embrace the whole human family, and if
they were used in a similar instrument at this
day, would be so understood. But it is too
clear for dispute, that the enslaved African
race were not intended to be included, and
formed no part of the people who framed and
adopted this Declaration; for if the language,
as understood in that day, would embrace
them, the conduct of the distinguished men
who framed the Declaration of lndependence
would have been utterly aud flagranty inconsistent with the principles they
asserted; and
instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which
they so confidently appealed, they would have
deserved and received universal rebuke and
repropation.<p>

Yet the men who framed this Declaration
were great men -- high in literary acquirements --
high in their sense of honor, and incapable
of asserting principles inconsistent with those
on which they were acting. They perfectly
understood the meaning of the language they
used, and how it would be understood by
others; and they knew that it would not, in
any part of the civilized world, be supposed to
embrace the negro race, which, by common consent, had been excluded from
civilized governments and the family of nations, and doomed
to slavery. They spoke and acted according to
the then established doctrines and principles,
and in the ordinary language of the day, and
no one misunderstood them. The unhappy
black race were separated from the white by
indelible marks, and laws long before established, and were never thought of
or spoken of
except as property, and when the claims of the
owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection.<p>

This state of public opinion had undergone
no change when the Constitution was adopted,
as is equally evident from its provisions and
language.<p>

The brief preamble sets forth by whom it
was formed, for what purposes, and for whose
benefit and protection. It declares that
it is formed by the people of the United
States, that is to say, by those who were
members of the different political communities
in the several States; and its great object is declared to be to secure the
blessings of liberty
to themselves and their posterity. It speaks
in general terms of the people of the United
States and of citizens of the several States,
when it is providing for the exercise of the
powers granted or the privileges secured to the
citizen. It does not define what description
of persons are intended to be included under
these terms, or who shall be regarded as a
citizen and one of the people. It uses them as
terms so well understood that no further description or definition was
necessary.<p>

But there are two clauses ln the Constitution which point directly and
specifically to the
negro race as a separate class of persons, and
show clearly that they were not regarded as a
portion of the people or citizens of the government then formed.<p>

One of these clauses reserves to each of the
thirteen states the right to import slaves until
the year 1808, if it thinks proper. And the importation which it thus
sanctions was unquestionably of persons of the race of which
we are speaking, as the traffic in slaves in the
United States had alwnys been confined to
them. And by the other provision the states
pledge themselves to each other to maintain
the right of property of the master, by delivering up to him any slave who may
have escaped
from his service, and be found within their respective territories. By the
first above-mentioned clause, therefore, the right to purchase
and hold this property is directly sanctioned
and authorized for twenty years by the people
who framed the Constitution. And by the
second, they pledge themselves to maintain and
uphold the right of the master in the manner
specified, as long as the government they then
formed should endure. And these two provisions show, conclusively, that neither
the description of persons therein referred to, nor
their descendents, were embraced in any of the
other provisions of the Constitution; for certainly these two clauses were not
intended to
confer on them or their posterity the blessings
of liberty, or any of the personal rights so
carefully provided for the citizen.<p>

No one of that race had ever migrated to the
United States voluntarlly; all of them had
been brought here as articles of merchandise.
The number that had been emancipated at
that time were but few in comparison with
those held in slavery; and they were identified
in the public mind with the race to which they
belonged, and regarded as a part of the slave
population rather than the free. It is obvious
that they were not even in the minds
of the framers of the Constitution when they
were conferring special rights and privileges
upon the citizens of a State in every other part
of the Union.<p>

Indeed, when we look to the condition of this
race in the several States at the time, it is
impossible to believe that these rights and
privileges were intended to be extended to
them.<p>

It is very true, that in that portion of the
Union where the labor of the negro race was
found to be unsuited to the climate, and unprofitable to the master, but few
slaves were
held at the time of the Declaration of Independence; and when the Constitution
was
adopted, it had entirely worn out in one of
them, and measures had been taken for its
gradual abolition in several others. But this
change had not been produeod by any change
of opinion in relation to this race; but because
it was discovered, from experience, that slave
labor was unsuited to the climate and productions of those States: for some of
the States,
where it had ceased or nearly ceased to exist,
were actively engaged in the slave trade, procuring cargoes on the coast of
Africa, and
transportlng them for sale to those parts of the
Union where their labor was found to be
profitable, and suited to the climate and productions. And this traffic was
openly carried
on, and fortues accumulated by it, without
reproach from the people of the States where
they resided. And it can hardly be supposed
that, in the states where it was then countenanced in its worst form -- that
is,
in the
seizure and transportation -- the people could
have regarded those who were emancipated as
entitled to actual rights with themselves.<p>

And we may here again refer, in support of
this proposition, to the plain and unequivocal
language of the laws of the several States,
some passed after the Declaration of Independence and before the
Constitution was adopted,
and some since the government went into operation.<p>

We need not refer. on this point, particularly,
to the laws of the present slaveholding States.
Their statue books are full of provisions in
relation to this class, in the same spirit with
the Maryand law which we have before quoted. They
have continued to treat them as
an inferior class, and to subject them to strict
police regulation, drawing a broad line of distinction between the citizen
and the slave races,
and legislating in relation to them upon the
same principle which prevailed at the time of
the Declaration of Independence. As relates to
these states, it is too plain for argument, that
they have never been regarded as a part of the
people or citizens of the State, nor supposed
to possess any political rights which the dominant
race might not withhold or
grant at their
pleasure. And as long ago as 1822, the
Court of Appeals of Kentucky decided that
free negroes and mulattoes were not citizens
within the meaning of the Constitution of the
United States; and the correctness of this decision is recognized, and the
same doctrine affirmed, in 1 Meigs' Tenn. 321.<p>

And if we turn to the legislation of the
States where slavely had worn out, or
measures taken for its speedy abolition, we
shall find the same opinions and principles
edually fixed and equally acted upon.<p>

Thus, Massachusetts, in 1786, passed a law
similar to the colonial one of which we have
spoken. The Law of 1786, like the Law of
1705, forbids the marriage of any white person
with any negro, Indian or mulatto, and inflicts
a penalty of &#163;50 upon anyone who shall join
them in marriage, and declares all such marriages absolutely null and void, and
degrades
thus the unhappy issue of the marriage by
fixing upon it the stain of bastardy. And this
mark of degradation was renewed, and again
implressed upon the race, in the careful and deliberate preparation of their
Revised Code publisped in 1836. This Code forbids any person
from joining in marriage any white person
with any Indian, negro or mulatto, and subjects the party who shall offend in
this respect
to imprisonment, not exceeding six months, in
the common jail, or to hard labor, and to a fine
of not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars; and, like the Law of
1780, it deelares the marriage to be absolutely null and
void. It will be seen that the punishment is
increased by the Code upon the person who
shall marry them, by adding imprisonment to
a pecuniary penalty.<p>

So, too, in Connecticut. We refer more particularly to the legislation of this
State, because it was not only among the first to put
an end to slavery within its own territory, but
was the first to fix a mark of reprobation upon
the African slave trade. The law last mentioned was passed in October, 1788,
about nine
months after the State had ratified and adopted the present Constitution of
the United
States; and by that law it prohibited its own
citizens, under severe penalties, from engaging
in the trade, and declared all policies of insurance on the vessel or cargo
made in the State
to be null and void. But, up to the time of the
adoption of the Constitution, there is nothing
in the legislation of the State indicating any
change of opinion as to the relative rights and
position of the white and black races in this
country, or indicating that it meant to place
the latter, when free, upon a level with its
citizens. And certainly nothing which would
have led the slaveholding States to suppose
that Conectcut designed to claim for them,
under the new Constitution, the equal
rights and privileges and rank of citizens in
every other state.<p>

The first step takon by Connecticut upon
this subject was as early as 1774, when it
passed an Act forbidding the further importation of slaves into the State.
But the section
containing the prohibition is introduced by the following preamble:<p>

"Andt whereas the increase of slaves in this
State is injurious to the poor, and inconvenient."<p>

This recital woould appear to have been carefully introduced, in order to
prevent any
misunderstanding of the motive which induced the
Legislature to pass the law, and places it distinctly upon the interest and
convenience of
the white population -- excluding the inference
that it might have been intended in any degree
for the benefit of the other.<p>

And in the Act of 1784, by which the issue
of slaves born after the time therein mentioned, were to be free at a certain
age, the section is again introduced by a preamble assigning a similar
motive for the Act. It is in these words:<p>

"Whereas sound policy requires that the
abolition of slavery should be effected as soon
as may be consistent with the rights of individuals, and the public safety
and welfare" --
showing that the right of property in the
master was to be protected, and that the
measure was one of policy, and to prevent the
injury and inconvenience, to the whites, of a
slave population in the State.<p>

And still further pursuing its legislation, we
find that in the same Statute passed in 1774,
which prohibited the further importation of
slaves into the State, there is also a provision
by which any negro, Indian or mulatto servant,
who was found wandering out of the town or
place to which he belonged, without a written
pass such as is therein described, was made
liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before
the next authority to be examined and delivered
up to his master -- who was required to pay the
charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law
provides, that
if any free negro shall travel without such
pass, and shall be stopped, seized or taken up,
be shall pay all charges arising thereby. And
this law was in full operation when tne Constitution of the United States was
adopted,
and was not repealed until 1797. So that up to
that time free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves
in the police
regulations established by the laws of the
State.<p>

And again, in 1833, Connecticut passed another law, which made it penal to
set up or
establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the
African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach
in any such school or institution, or
board or harbor for that purpose any such person, without the previous
consent in writing of
the civil authority of the town in which such
school or institution might be.<p>

And it appears by the case of Crandall v.
The State, reported in 10 Conn. 340, that upon
an information filed against Prudence Crandall
for a violation of this law, one of the points
raised in the defense was, that the law was a
violation of the Constitution of the United
States; and that the persons instructed, although of the African race, were
citizens of
other States, and therefore entitled to the
rights and privileges of citizens in the State of
Connecticut. But Chief Justice Daggett, before whom the case was tried, held,
that persons of that, description were not citizens of a
State, witbin the meaning of the word "citizen"
in the Constitution of the United Slates, and
were not, therefore, entitled to the privileges
and immunities of citizens in other States.<p>

The case was carried up to the Supreme
Court of Errors of the State, and the question
fully argued there. But the case went off
upon another point, and no opinion was expressed on this question.<p>

We have made this particular examination
into the legislative and judicial action of Connecticut, because, from the
early hostility it
displayed to the slave trade on the coast of
Africa, we may expect to find the laws of that
State as lenient and favorable to the subject
race as those of any other State in the Union;
and if we find that at the time the Constitution was adopted, they were not
even there
raised to the rank of citizens, but were still
held and treated as prpperty, and the laws relating to them passed with
reference altogether to the interest and convenience of the
white race, we shall hardly find them elevated
to a higher rank anywhere else.<p>

A brief notice of the laws of two other
States, and we shall pass on to other considerations.<p>

By the laws of New Hampshire, collected
and finally passed in 1816, no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia
of the
State but free white citizens, and the same
provision is found in a subsequent collection of
the laws made in 1856. Nothing could more
strongly mark the entire repudiation of the
African race. The alien is excluded, because,
being born in a foreign country he cannot be
a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African
race, born in
the State, not permitted to share in one of the
highest duties of the citizen? The answer is
obvious; he is not by the institutions and laws
of the State numbered among its people. He
forms no part of the sovereignty of the State,
and is not, therefore, called on to uphold and
defend it.<p>

Again in 1822, Rhode Island in its
Revised Code, passed a law forbidding persons
who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any
white person with any negro, Indian or mulatto, under
the penalty of $200, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void,
and the same
law was again re-enacted in its Revised Code
of 1844. So that, down to the last mentioned
period, the strongest mark of inferiority and
degradation was fastened upon the African
race in that State.<p>

It would be impossible to enumerate and
compress, in the space usually allotted to an
opinion of a court, the various laws, marking
the condition of this race, which were passed
from time to time after the Revolution, and
before and since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. In
addition to those
already referred to, it is sufficient to say that
Chancellor Kent, whose accuracy and research
no one will question, states in the sixth edition
of his Commentaries, published in 1848, 2d vol.
258, note b, that in no part of the country, except Maine, did the African
race, in point of
fact, participate equally with the whites in
the exercise of civil and political rights.<p>

The legislation of the States therefore shows,
in a manner not to be mistaken, the inferior
and subject condition of that race at the time
the Constitution was adopted, and long afterwards, throughout the thirteen
States by
which that instrument was framed; and it is
hardly consistent with the respect due to these
States, to suppose that they regarded at that
time, as fellow citizens and members of the
sovereignty, a class of beings whom they had
thus stigmatized; whom, as we are bound, out
of respect to the State sovereignties, to assume
they had deemed it just and necessary thus to
stigmatize, and upon whom they had impressed
such deep and enduring marks of inferiority
and degradation; or that when they met in
convention to form the Constitution, they
looked upon them as a portion of their constituents, or designed to include
them in the
provisions so carefully inserted for the security
and proteetion of the liberties and rights of
their citizens. It cannot be supposed that they
intended to secure to them rights and privileges, and rank, in the new
polilical body
throughot the Union, which every one of
them denied within the limits of its own dominion.
More especially, it cannot be believed
that the large slaveholding States regarded
them as included in the word "citizens," or
would have consented to a Constitution which
might compel them to receive them in that
character from another State. For if they were
so received, and entitled to the privileges and
immunities of citizens, it would exempt them
from the operation of the special laws and
from the police regulations which they
considered to be necessary for their own safety.
It would give to persons of the negro race, who
were recognized as citizens in any one State
of the Union, the right to enter every other
State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or
passport, and without
obstructions to sojourn there as long as they
pleased, to go where they pleased at every
hour of the day or night without molestation,
unless they comitted some violation of law
for which a white man would be punished;
and it would give them the full liberty of
speach in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens
might speak;
to hold public meetings upon political affairs,
and to keep and earry arms wherever they
went. And all of this would be done in the
face of the subject race of the same color, both
free and slaves, inevitably producing discontent and insubordination
among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.<p>

It is impossible, it would seem, to believe
that the great men of the slaveholding States,
who took so large a share in framing the Constitution of the United States,
and exercised so
much influence in procuring its adoption, could
hsave been so forgetful or regardless of their
own safety and the safety of those who trusted
and confided in them.<p>

Besides, this want of foresight and care
would have heen utterly inconsistent with the
caution displayed in providing for the admission of new members into this
political family.
For, when they gave to the citizens of each
State the privileges and immunities of citizens
in the several States, they at the same time
took from the several States the power of naturalization, and confined that
power exclusively to the Federal government. No state was
willing to permit another State to determine
who should or shou]d not be admitted as one of
its citizens, and entitled to demand equal rights
and privileges with their own people, within
their own territories. The right of naturalization was therefore, with one
accord, surrendered by the States, and confined to the Federal
Government. And this power granted to Congress to establish an uniform rule of
naturalization is, by the well-understood meaning of
the word, confined to persons born in a foreign
country, under a foreign government. It is
not a power to raise to the rank of a citizen
anyone born in the United States, who, from
birth or parentage, by the laws of the country,
belongs to an inferior and subordinate class.
And when we find the States guarding themselves from the indiscreet or
improper admission by other states of emigrants from other
countries by giving the power exclusively to
Congress, we cannot fail to see that they could
never have left with the States a much
more important power -- that is, the
power of transforming into citizens a numerous class of persons who in that
character
would be much more dangerous to the peace
and safety of a large portion of the Union than
the few foreignors one of the States might improperly naturalize. The
Constitution, upon
its adoption, obviously took from the States all
power by any subsequent legislation to introduce as a citizen into the
political family of
the United States anyone, no matter where he
was born, or what might be his character or
condition; and it gave to Congress the power to
confer this character upon those only who were
born outside of the dominions of the United
States. And no law of a State, therefore,
passed since the Constitution was adopted, can
give any right of citizenzllip outside of its own territory.<p>

A clause similar to the one in the Constitution, in relation to the rights and
immunities
of citizens of one State in the other States, was
contained in the Articles of Confederation.
But there is a difference of language, which is
worthy of note. The provision in the Articles
of Confederation was, "that the free inhabitants of each of the States,
paupers, vagabonds,
and fugitives from justice excepted, should be
entitled to all the privileges and immunities of
free citizens, in the several States."<p>

It will be observed, that under this Confed-
eration each State had the right to decide for
itself, and in its own tribunals, whom it would
acknowledge as a free inhabitant of another
State. The term "free inhabitant," in the
generality of its terms, would certainly include
one of the African race who had been manumitted. But no example, we think, can
be
found of his admisslon to all the privileges of
citizenship in any State of the Union after
these Articles were formed, and while they continued in force. And
notwithstanding the generality of the words "free inhabitants," it is
very clear that, according to their accepted
meaning in that day, they did not include the
African race, whether free or not; for the 5th
section of the 9th article provides that Congress
should have the power "to agree upon the number
of land forces to be raised, and to make
requisitions from each State for its quota in
proportion to the number of white inhabitants
in such State, which requisition shall be
binding."<p>

Words could hardly have been used which
more strongly mark the line of distinction between the citizen and the
subject -- the free and
the subjugated races. The latter were not even
counted when the inhabitants of a State were
to be embodied in proportion to its numbers for
the general defense. And it cannot for a moment be supposed, that a class of
persons thus separated and rejected from those
who formed the sovereignty of the States
were yet intended to be included under the
words "free inhabitants," in the preceding article, to whom privileges and
immunities were
so carefully secured in every State.<p>

But although this clause of the Articles of
Confederation is the same in principle with
that inserted in the Constitution, yet the comprensive word "inhabitant,"
which might be
construed to include an emancipated slave, is
omitted, and the privilege is confined to "citizens" of the State. And this
alteration in
words would hardly have been made unless a
different meaning was intended to be conveyed,
or a possible doubt removed. The just and fair
inference is, that as this privilege was about
to be piaced under the protection of the general
government, and the words expounded by
its tribunals, and all power in relation to it
taken from the State and its courts, it was
deemed prudent to describe with precision and
caution the persons to whom this high privilege
was given -- and the word "citizen" was on that
account substituted for the words "free in-
habitant." The word "citizen" excluded, and
no doubt intended to exclude, foreigners who
had not become citizens of some one of the
States when the Constitution was adopted; and
also every descrption of persons who were not
fully recognized as citizens in the several
States. This, upon any fair construction of
the instruments to which we have referred,
was evidently the object and purpose of this
change of words.<p>

To all this mass of proof we have still to
add, that Congress has repeatedly legislated
upon the same construction of the Constitution that we have given. Three laws,
two of
which were passed almost immediately after
the government went into operntion, will be
abundantly sufficient to show this. The first
two are particularly worthy of notice, because
many of the men who assisted in framing the
Constitution, and took an active part in procuring its adoption, were then in
the halls of legislation, and certainly understood what they
meant when they used the words "people of
the United States" and "citizen" in that well
considered instrument.<p>

The first of these Acts is the Naturalization
Law, which was passed at the second session of
the first Congress, March 26, 1790, and confines
the right of becoming citizens "to aliens being
free white persons."<p>

Now, the Constitution does not limit the
power of Congress in this respect to white persons. And they may, if they
think proper, authorize the naturalization of anyone, of any
color, who was born under allegiance to another government. But the language
of the law
above quoted shows that citizenship at
that time was perfectly understood to be confined to the white race; and that
they alone constituted the sovereignty in the government.<p>

Congress might, as we before said, have authorized the naturalization of
Indians, because they were aliens and foreigners. But, in their
then untutored and savage state, no one would have thought of admitting them as
citizens in a civilized commullity. And, moreover the
atrocities they had but recently committed, when they were the allies of Great
Britain in the Revolutionary War, were yet fresh in the
recollection of the peopie of the United States, and they were even then
guarding themselves against the threatened renewal of Indian hostilities. No
one supposed then that any Indian would ask for, or was capable of enjoying,
the privileges of an American citizen, and the word "white" was not used with
any particular reference to them.<p>

Neither was it used with any reference to
the African race imported into or born in
this country, because Congress had no power
to naturalize them, and therefore there was no
necessity for using particular words to exclude
them.<p>

It would seem to have been used merely because it followed out the line of
division which
the Constitution has drawn between the citizen
race, who formed and held the government, and
the African race, which they held in subjection
and slavery, and governed at their own pleasure.<p>

Another of the early laws of which we have
spoken, is the first Militia Law, which was
passed in 1792, at the first session of the second
Congress. The language of this law is equally
plain and significant with the one just mentioned. It directs that every "free
able-bodied
white male citizen" shall be enrolled in the
militia. The word "white" is evidently used
to exclude the African race, and the word
"citizen" to exclude unnaturalized foreigners,
the latter forming no part of the sovereignty,
owing it no allegianee, and therefore under no
obligation to defend it. The African race
however, born in the country, did owe allegiance to the government, whether
they were
slave or free; but it is repudiated, and rejected from the duties and
obligations of citizenship in marked language.<p>

The third Act to which we have alluded is
even still more decisive; it was passed as late
as 1813 (2 Stat. 809), and it provides: "that
from and after the termination of the war in
which the United States are now engaged with
Great Britain, it shall not be lawful to employ
on board of any public or private vessels of the
United States, any person or persons except
citizens of the United States, or persons of
color, natives of the United States.<p>

Here the line of distinction is drawn
in express words. Persons of color, in the judgment of Congress, were not
included in the
word "citizen," and they are described as another and different class of
persons, and authorized to be employed, if born in the United
States.<p>

And even as late as 1820 (chap. 104, sec. 8),
in the charter to the City of Washington, the
Corporation is authorized "to restrain and prohibit the nightly and other
disorderly meetings
of slaves, free negroes, and mulattoes," thus
associating them together in its legislation;
and after prescribing the punishment that may
be initiated on the slaves, proceeds in the following words: "And to punish
such free negroes and mulattoes by penalties not exceeding twenty dollars for
any one offense, and in
case of the inability of any such free negro or
mulatto to pay any such penalty and cost
thereon, to cause him or her to be confined to
labor for any time not exceeding six calendar
months." And in a subsequent part of the
same section, the Act authorizes the Corporation "to prescribe the terms and
conditions
upon which free negroes and mulattoes may reside in the city."<p>

This law, like the laws of the States, shows
that this class of persons were governed by
special legislation directed expressly to them,
and always connected with provisions for the
government of slaves, and not with those for
the government of free white citizens. And
after such an uniform couree of legislation as
we have stated, by the Colonies, by the States,
and by Congress, running through a period of
more thnn a century, it would seem that to call
persons thus marked and stigmatized, "citizens" of the United States, "fellow
citizens,"
a constituent part of the sovereignty, would be
an abuse of terms, and not calculated to exalt
the character of an American citizen in the
eyes of other nations.<p>

The conduct of the Executive Department
of the government hns been in perfect harmony
upon this subject with this course of legislation.
The question was brought officially before the
late William Witt when he was the Attorney-General of the United States, in
1821, and he
decided that tho words "citizen of the United
States" were used in the Acts of Congles in
the same sense as in the Constitution; and that
free persons of color were not citizens, within
the meaning of the Constitution and iaws; and
this opinion has been confirmed by that of the
late Attorney-General, Caleb Cushing, in a recent case, and acted upon by
the Secretary of
State, who refused to grant passports to them
as "citizens of the United States."<p>

But it is said that a perzon may be a citizen, and entitled to that character,
although he does not possess all the rights which
may belong to other citizens; as, for example,
the right to vote, or to hold particular office;
and that yet, when he goes into another State,
he is entitled to be recognized there as a citizen, although the State may
measure his
rights by the rights which it allows to persons
of a like character or class, resident in the
State, and refuse to him the full rights of citizenship.<p>

This argument overlooks the language of the
provision in the Constitution of which we are
speaking.<p>

Undoubtedly, a person may be a citizen, that
is, a member of the community who from the
sovereignty, although he exercizes no share of
the political power, and is incapacitated from
holding particular offices. Women and minors, who form a part of the political
family,
cannot vote; and when a property qualification
is required to vote or hold a particular office,
those who have not the necessary qualification
cannot vote or hold the office, yet they are citizens.<p>

So, too, a person may be entitled to vote by
the law of the State, who is not a citizen even
of the State itself. And in some of the States
of the Union foreigners not naturalized are allowed
to vote. And the State may give the right to free negroes and mulattoes, but
that does not make them citizens of the State, and still less of the United
States. And the provision in the Constitution giving privileges and immunities
in other States, does not apply to them.<p>

Neither does it apply to a person who, being
the citizen of a State, migrates to another
State. For then he becomes subject to the
laws of the State in which he lives, and he is
no longer a citizen of the State from which
he removed. And the State in which
he resides
may then, unquestionably, determine his
status or condition, and place him among the
class of persons who are not recognized as
citizens, but belong to an inferior and subject
race; and may deny him the privileges and immunities enjoyed by its
citizens.<p>

But so far as mere rights of person are concerned, the provision in question
is confined to
citizens of a State who are temporarily in another State without taking
up their residence
there. It gives them no political rights in the
state as to voting or holding office, or in any
other respect. For a citizen of one State has
no right to participate in the government of
another. But if he ranks as a citizen of the
State to which he belongs, within the meaning
of the Constitution of the United States, then,
whenever he goes into another State, the Constitution clothes him, as to
the rights of person, with all the privileges and immunities
which belong to citizens of the State.
And if persons of the African race are citizens
of a state, and of the United States, they
would be entitled to all of these privileges and immunities in every State, and
the State could not restrict them; for they would hold
these privileges and immunities, under the
paramount authority of the Federal Government, and its courts would be bound
to maintain and enforce them, the Constitution and
laws of the State to the contrary notwithstanding. And if the State could
limit or restrict them, or place the party in an inferior
grade, this clause of the Constitution would be unmeaning,
and could have no operation; and would
give no rights to the citizen when in
another State. He would have none but what
the State itself chose to allow him. This is
evidently not the construction or meaning of
the clause in question. It guarantees rights to
the citizen, and the State cannot withhold
them. And these rights are of a character and
would lead to consequences which make it absolutely
certain that the African race were not
intended under the name of citizens of a State,
and were not in the contemplation of the
framers of the Constitution when these privileges and immunities were
provided for the citizens of other States.<p>

The case of Legrand v Darnall, 2 Pet. 664,
has been referred to for the purpose of showing
that this court has decided that the descendant
of a slave may sue as a citizen in a court of
the United States; but the case itself shows
that the question did not arise and could not
have arisen in the case.<p>

It appears from the report that Darnall was
born in Maryland and was the son of a white
man by one of his slaves, and his father executed certain instruments
to manumit him, and
devised to him some landed property in the
State. This property Darnall afterwards sold to Legrand, the appellant, who
gave his notes
for tha puchase money. But becoming afterwards
apprehensive that the appellee had not
been emancipated according to the laws of
Maryland, he refused to pay the note until he could be better satisfied as to
Darnall's right
to convey. Darnall in the meantime, had
taken up his residence in Pennsylvania, and
brought suit on the notes and recovered judgment in the Circuit Court for the
District of Maryland.<p>

The whole proceeding, as appears by the report, was an amicable one;
Legrand being perfectly willing to pay the money if he could
obtain a title, and Darnall not wishing him to
pay unless he could make him a good one. In
point of fact, the whole proceeding was under
the direction of the counsel who argued the
case for the appellee, who was the mutual
friend of the parties, and confided in by both of
them, and whose only object was to
have the rights of both parties established by
judicial decision in the most speedy and least
expensive manner.<p>

Legrand, therefore, raised no objection to the
jurisdiction of the court in the suit at law, because
he was himself anxios to obtain the
judgment of the court upon his title. Consequently
there was nothing in the record before
the court to show that Darnall was of African
descent, and the usual judgment and award of
execution was entered. And Legrand thereupon filed his bill on the equity side
of the Circuit Court, stating that Darnall was born a slave, and had not been
legally emancipated, and could not, therefore, take the land devised to him,
nor make Legrand a good title; and praying an injuction to restrain Darnall
from proceeding to execution on the judgment, which
was granted. Darnall answered, averring in his answer that he was a free man,
and capable of conveying a good title. Testimony was taken on this point, and
at the hearing the Circuit Court was of opinion that Darnall was a free man and
his title good, and disolved the injunction and dismissed the bill;
and that decree was affirmed here, upon the appeal of Legrand.<p>

Now, it is difficult to imagine how any question about citizenship
of Darnell, or his right to sue in that character,
can be supposed to have arisen or been decided
in that case.
The fact that he was of African descent was
first brought before the court upon the bill in
equity. The suit at law had then passed into
judgment and award of execution, and the
Circuit Court, as a court of law, had no longer
any authority over it. It was a valid and
legal judgment, which the court that rendered
it had not the power to reverse or set aside.
And unless it had jurisdiction as a court of
equity to restrain him from using its process as
a court of law, Darnall, if he thought proper,
would have been at liberty to proceed on his
juddgment, and compel the payment of the
money, although the allegations in the bill
were true, and he was incapable of making a
title. No other court could have enjoined him,
for certainly no State equity court could interfere in that way with the
judgment of a circuit court of the United States.<p>

But the Circuit Court as a court of equity
certainly had equity jurisdiction over its own
judgment as a court of law, without regard to
the character of the parties; and had not only
the right, but it was its duty -- no matter who
were the parties in the judgment -- to prevent
them from proceeding to enforce it by execution, if the court was satisfied
that the money
was not justly and equitably due. The ability
of Darnall to convey did not depend upon his
citizenship, but upon his title to freedom. And
if he was free, he could hold and convey property, by the laws of Maryland,
although he was not a citizen. But if he was by
law still a slave, he could not. It was, therefore, the duty of the court,
sitting as a court
of equity in the latter case, to prevent him from
using its process, as a court of common law,
to compel the payment of the purchase money, when it was evident that the
purchaser must lose the land. But if he was free, and could
make a title, it was equally the duty of the
court not to suffer Legrange to keep the land,
and refuse the payment of the money, upon the
ground that Darnall was incapable of suing or
being sued as a citizen in a court of the United
States. The character or citizenship of the parties had no connection with the
question of
jurisdiction, and the matter in dispute had no
relation to the citizenship of Darnall. Nor is
such a question alluded to in the opinion of
the court.<p>

Besides, we are by no means prepared to say
that there are not many cases, civil as well as
criminal, in which a circuit court of the United
States may exercise jurisdiction, although one
of the African race is a party; that broad question
is not before the court.
The question
with which we are now dealing is, Whether a
person of the African race can be a citizen of
the United States, and become thereby entitled
to a special privilege, by virtue to his title to
that character, and which, under the Constitution, no one but a citizen can
claim. It is manifest that the case of Legrange v. Darnall has no
bearing on that question, and can have no application to the case now before
the court.<p>

This case, however, strikingly illustrates the
consequences that would follow the construction of the Constitution which would
give the power contended for, to a State. It would, in
effect, give it also to an individual. For if the
father of young Darnall had manumitted him in his lifetime, and
sent him to reside in a
State which recognized him as a citizen, he
might have visited and sojourned in Maryland
when he pleased, and as long as he pleased, as
a citizen of the United States; and the state
officers and tribunals would be compelled, by
the paramount authority of the Constitution,
to receive him and treat him as one of its
citizens, exempt from the laws and police of
the state in relation to a person of that description, and allow him to enjoy
all the rights and privileges of citizenship, without respect
to the laws of Maryland, although such laws
were deemed by it absolutely essential to its
own safety.<p>

The only two provisions which point to them
and include them, treat them as property, and
make it the duty of the government to protect
it; no other power, in relation to this race, is
to be found in the Constitution; and as it is a
government of special, delegated powers, no authority beyond these two
provisions
can be constitutionally exercised. The Government of the United
States had no right to interfere in any other purpose but that of protecting
the rights of the owner, leaving it altogether with the several States to
deal with
this race, whether emancipated or not, as each
State may think justice, humanity, and the interests and safety of society,
require. The
States evidently intended to reserve this power exclusively to themselves.<p>

No one, we presume, supposes that any
change in public opinion or feeling in relation
to this unfortunate race, in the civilized nations of Europe or in this
country, should induce the court to give to the words of the Constitution a
more liberal construction in their
favor than they were intended to bear when the instrument was framed and
adopted. Such an argument would be altogether inadmissible in any tribunal
called on to interpret it. If
any of its provisions are deemed unjust, there
is a mode prescribed in the instrument itself by
which it may be amended; but while it remains unaltered, it must be construed
now as
it was understood at the time of its adoption.
It is not only the same in words, but the same
in meaning, and delegates the same powers to
the government, and reserves and secures the
same rights and privileges to the citizen; and
as long as it continues to exist in its present
form, it speaks not only in the same words,
but with the same meaning and intent with
which it spoke when it came from the hands
of its framers, and was voted on and adopted
by the people of the the United States. Any other
rule of construction would abrogate the judicial
character of this court, and make it the mere
reflex of the popular opinion or passion of the
day. This court was not created by the Constitution for such purposes.
Higher and graver
trusts have been confided to it, and it must not
falter in the path of duty.<p>

What the construction was at that time, we
think can hardly admit of doubt. We have
the language of the Declration of Independence and of the Articles of
Confederation, in
addition to the plain words of the Constitution
itself; we have the legislation of the different
States, before, about. the time, and after the
Constitution was adopted; we have the legislation of Congres, from the
time of its adoption
to a recent period; and we have the constant
and uniform action of the Executive Department,
all concurring together, and leading to
the same result. And if anything in relation
to the construction of the Constitution can be
regarded as settled, it is that which we now
give to the word "citizen" and the word "people."<p>

And upon a full and careful consideration
of the subject, the court is of opinion
that, upon the facts stated in plea in
abatement, Dred Scott is not a citizen of
Missouri within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and not
entitled as such to sue in its courts; and consequently, that 
the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of
the case, and that the judgment on the plea in
abatement is erroneous.<p>

We are aware that doubts are entertained
by some of the members of the court, whether
the plea in abatement is legally before the
court upon this writ of error, but if that plea
is regarded as waived, or out of the case upon
any other ground, yet the question as to the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is presented
on the face of the bill of exception itself,
taken by the plaintiff at the trial; for he admits that he and his wife were
born slaves, but
endeavors to make out his title to freedom and
citizenship by showing that they were taken
by their owner to certain places, hereinafter
mentioned, where slavery could not by law exist, and that they thereby became
free, and
upon their return to Missouri became citizens
of that State.<p>

Now if the removal of which he speaks did
not give them their freedom, then by his own
admission he is still a slave; and whatever
opinions may be entertained in favor of the
citizenship of a free person of the African
race, no one supposes that a slave is a citizen
of the State or of the United States. If, therefore, the acts done by his owner
did not make
them free persons, he is still a slave, and certainly incapable of suing in
the character of a citizen.<p>
 
The principle of law is too well settled to be
disputed that a court can give no judgment
for either party, where it has no jurisdiction;
and if upon the showing of Scott himself, it
appeared he was still a slave, the case
ought to have been dismissed, and the judgment against him and in favor of
the defendant for costs is, like that on the plea in abatement, erroneous and
then suit ought to have
been dismissed by the Circuit Court for
want of jurisdiction in that court.<p>

But, before we proceed to examine this part
of the case, it may he proper to notice an objection taken to the judicial
authority of this
court to decide it; and it has been said, that as
this court has decided against the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court on the plea in abatement,
it has no right to examine any question presented by the exception; and that
anything it
may say upon that part of the case will be extrajudicial and mere obiter
dicta.<p>

This is a manifest mistake; there can be no
doubt as to the jurisdiction of this court to revise the judgment of a
ciruit court, and to reverse it for any error apparent on the record,
whether it be the error of giving judgment in a case over which it had no
jursdiction, or any other material error; and this too,
whether there is a plea in abatement or not.<p>
 
The objection appears to have arisen from
confounding writs of error to a state court
with writs of error to a circuit court of the
Unied States. Undoubtedly, upon a writ of
error to a state court, unless the record shows
a case that gives jurisdiction, the case must be
dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court.
And if it is dismissed on that ground, we have
no right to examine and decide upon any question presented by the bill of
exceptions or any
other part of the record. But writs of error to
a state court, and to a circuit court of the United States, are regulated by
different laws, and stand upon entirely different principles.
And in a writ of error to a circuit court of the
United States, the whole record is before this
cout for examination and decision; and if the
sum in controversy is large enough to give jurisdiction, it is not only the
right but it is the
judicial duty of the court, to examine the
whole case as presented by the record, and if
it appears upon its face that any material error
or errors have been committed by the court
below, it is the duty of this court to reverse
the judgment, and remand the case. And certainly
an error in passing a judgment upon
the merits in favor of either party, in a case
whih it was not authorized to try and over
which it had no jurisdiction, is as grave an
error as a court can commit.<p>
 
The plea in abatement is not a plea to the
jurisdiction of this court, but to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. And
it appears by
the record before us, that the Circuit Court
committed an error, in deciding that it had
jurisdiction, upon the facts in the case, admitted by the pleadings.
It is the duty of the 
appellate tribunal to correct this error; but
that could not be done by dismissing the case
for want of jurisdiction here -- for that would
leave the erroneous judgment in full force, and
the injured party without remedy. And the
appellate court, therefore, exercises the power
for which alone appellate courts are constituted by reversing the judgment
of the court below for this error. It exercises its proper and
appropriate jurisdiction over the judgment and
proceedings of the Circuit Court as they appear
upon the record brought up by the writ of error.<p>

The correction of one error in the court below does not deprive the appellate
court of the
power of examining further into the record,
and correcting any other material errors which
may have been committed by the inferior
court. There is certainly no rule of law -- nor
any practice -- nor any decision of a court -- which even questions this
power in the appellate tribunal. On the contrary, it is
the daily practice of this court, and
of all appellate courts where they reverse the
judgment of an inferior court for error, to correct by
its opinions whatever errors may appear on the record
material to the case; and
they have always held it to be their duty to
do so where the silence of the court might lead
to misconstruction or future controversy, and
the point has been relied on by either side, and
argued before the court.<p>

In the case before us we have already decided that the
Circuit Court erred in deciding
that it had jurisdiction upon the facts admitted
by the pleadings. And it appears that, in the
further progress of the case, it acted upon the
erroneous principle it had decided on the pleadings,
and gave judgment for the defendant,
where, upon the facts admitted in the exception, it had
no jurisdiction.<p>

We are at a loss to understand upon what
principle of law applicable to appellate jurisdiction
it can be supposed that this court has
not judicial authority to correct the last mentioned
error because they had before corrected
the former; or by what process of reasoning
it can be made out, that the error of an inferior court in actually pronouncing
judgment
for one of the parties in a case in which it had
no jurisdiction cannot be looked into or corrected by this court, because we
have decided a
similar question presented in the pleadings.
The last point is distinctly presented by the
facts contained in the plaintiff's own bill of exceptions, which he himself
brings here by this
writ of error. It was the point which chiefly
occupied the attention of the counsel on both
sides in the argument -- and the judgment
which this court must render upon both errors
is precisely the same. It must, in ech of
them, exercise jurisdiction over the judgment
and reverse it for the errors committed by the
court below; and issue a mandate to the Circuit
Court to conform its judgment to the opinion
pronounced by this court, by dismissing the case
for want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.
This is the constant and invariable practice of
this court where it reverses a judement for
want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.<p>

It can scarcely be necessary to pursue such
a question further. The want of jurisdiction in
the court below may appear on the record
without any plea in abhatement. This is familiarly the case where a court of
chancery
has exercised jurisdiction in a case where the
plaintiff had a plain and adequate remedy at
law, and it so appears by the transcript when
brought here by appeal. So also where it
appears that a court of admiralty has exercised
jurisdiction in a case belonging exclusively
to a court of common law. In these
cases there is no plea in abatement. And for
the same reason and upon the same principles
where the defect of jurisdiction is patent on
the record, this court is bound to reverse the
judgment although the defendant has not
pleaded in abatement to the jurisdiction of the
inferior court.<p>

The cases of Jackson v. Aspton, 8 Pet. 148,
and of Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch, 126,
to which we have referred in a previous part of
this opinion, are directly in point. In the last
mentioned case, Capron brought an action
against Van Noorden in a circuit court of the
United States without showing, by the usual
averments of citizenship, that the court had
jurisdiction. There was no plea in abatement
put in and the parties went to trial upon the
merits. The court gave judgment in favor of
the defendant with costs. The plaintiff thereupon brought his writ of error,
and this court
reversed the judgment given in favor of the
defendant, and remanded the case with directions to dismiss it, because it did
not appear
by the transcript that the Circuit Court had
jurisdiction.<p>

The case before us still more strongly imposes upon this court the duty of
examining
whether the court below has not committed an
error, in taking jurisdiction and giving a judgment for costs in favor of the
defendant; for in
Capron v. Vnn Noorden the judgment was reversed, because it did not appear that
the parties were citizens of different States. They
might or might not be. But in this case it
does appear that the plaintiff was born a slave;
and if the facts upon which he relies have not
made him free, then it appears affirmatively
on the record that he is not a citizen and
consequently his suit against Sandford was not
a suit between citizens of different States, and
the court had no authority to pass any judgment between the parties. The suit
ought in
this view of it, to have been dismissed by the
Circuit Court, and its judgment in favor of
Sandford is erroneous and must be reversed.<p>

It is true that the result either way, by dismissal or by a judgment for the
defendant,
makes very little, if any difference in a pecuniary
or personal point of view to either
party. But the fact that the result would be
very nearly the same to the parties in either
form or judgment, would not justify this court
in sanctioning an error in the judgment which
is patent on the record, and which, if sanctioned, might be drawn into
precedent, and
lead to serious mischief and injustice in some
other suit.<p>

We proceed, therefore, to inquire whether
the facts relied on by the plaintiff entitled him
to his freedom.<p>

The case, as he himself states it,
on the record, brought here by his writ of error,
is this:<p>

The plaintiff was a negro slave, belonging
to Dr. Emerson, who was a surgeon in the
Army of the United States. In the year 1834
he took the plaintiff from the State of Missouri
to the military post at Rock Island, in the
State of Illinois, and held him there as a slave
until the month of April or May, 1836. At the
time last mentioned, said Dr. Emerson removed
the plaintilf from said mililary post at Rock
Island to the military post at Fort Snelling,
situate on the west bank of the Mississippi
River, in the Territory known an Upper Louisiana, acquired
by the United States of France,
and situate north of the latitude of thirty-six
degrees thirty minutes north and north of the
State of Missouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the
plaintiff in slavery at said Fort Snelling, from
said last mentioned date until the year 1838.<p>

In the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in
the second count of the plaintiff's declaration,
was a negro slave of Major Taliaferro, who belonged to the Army of the United
States. In
that year, 1835, said Major Taliaferro took said
Harriet to said Fort Snelling, a military post,
situated as hereibefore stated, and kept her
there as a slave until the year 1836, and then
held and delivered her as a slave, at said Fort
Snelling, unto the said Dr. Emerson hereinbefore
named. Said Dr. Emerson held said
Harriet in slavery at said Fort Snelling, until the year 1838.<p>

In the year 1836, the plaintiff and Harriet
intermarried, at Fort Snelling, with the consent of Dr. Emerson, who then
claimed to be
their master and owner. Eliza and Lizzie,
named in the third count of the plaintiff's
declaration, are the fruit of that marriage.
Eliza is about fourteen years old, and was
born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of
the north line of the State of Missouri, and
upon the River Mississippi. Lizzie is about
seven years old and was born in the State of
Missouri at the military post called Jefferson
Barracks.<p>

In the year 1838 said Dr. Emerson removed
the plaintiff and said Harriet, and their said
daughter Eliza, from said Fort Snelling, to the
State of Missouri, where they have ever since
resided.<p>

Before the commencement of this suit, said
Dr. Emerson sold and conveyed the plaintiff
and Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, to the defendant, as slaves, and the defendant
has ever since claimed to hold them,
and each of them, as slaves.<p>

In considering this part of the controversy, two questions arise: 1st. Was he,
together with his family, free in Missouri by reason of the stay in the
territory of the United States hereinbefore mentioned? And 2d. If they were
not, is Scott himself free by reason of his removal to Rock Island, in the
State of Illinois, as stated in the above admissions?<p>

We proceeed to examine the first question.<p>

The Act of Congress, upon which the plaintiff relies, declares
that slavery and involuntary
servitude, except as a punishment for crime,
shall be forever prohibited in all that part of
that territory ceded by France under the name
of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty six
degrees thirty minutes north lattitude, and not
included within the limits of Missouri. And
the difficulty which meets us at the threshold
of this part of the inquiry is whether Congress
was authorized to pass this law under
any of the powers granted to it by the Constitution; for if the authority is
not given by
that instrument, it is the duty of this court to
declare it void and inoperative, and incapable
of conferring freedom upon one who is held
as a slave under the laws of any one of the
States.<p>

The counsel for the plaintiff has laid much
stress upon that article in the Constitution
which confers on Congress the power "to dispose of and make all necessary rules
and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
United States," but in
the judgment of the court, that provision has
no bearing on the present controversy, and the
power there given, whatever it may be, is confined, and was intended to be
confined, to the
territory which at that time belonged to, or
was claimed by, the United States, and was
within their boundaries as settled by the
Treaty with Great Britain, and can have no
influence upon a territory afterwards acqduired
from a foreign government. It was a special
provision for a known and particular Territory, and to meet a present
emergency, and nothing more.<p>

A brief summary of the history of the times,
as well as the careful and measured terms in
which the article is framed, will show the correctness
of this proposition.<p>

It will be remembered that, from the commencement
of the Revolutionary War, serious
difficulties existed between the States, in relation
to the disposition of large and unsettled
territores which were included in the chartered
limits of some of the States. And some
of the other States, and more especially Maryland,
which had no unsettled lands, insisted
insisted that as the unoccupied lands, if wrested from
Great Britain, would owe their preservation
to the common purse and the common sword, the
money arising from them ought to be applied
in just proportion among the several States,
to pay the expenses of the war, and ought not
to be appropriated to the use of State in
whose chartered limits they might happen
to lie, to the exclusion of the other
States by whose combined efforts and common
expense the territory was defended and
preserved against the claim of the British
Government.<p>

These difficulties caused much uneasiness
during the War, while the issue was in some
degree doubtful, and the future boundaries of
the United States yet to he defined by treaty,
if we achieved our independence.<p>

The majority of the Congress of the Confederation obviously
concurred in opinion with the
State of Maryland, and desired to obtain from
the States which claimed it a cession of this
territory, in order that Congress might raise
money on this security to carry on the War.
This appears by the resolution passed on the
6th of September, 1780, strongly urging the
States to cede these lands to the Uinted States,
both for the sake of peace and union among
themselves, and to maintain the public credit;
and this was followed by the resolution of
October 10th, 1780, by which Congress pledged
itself, that if the lands were ceded, as recommended by the resolution
above mentioned,
they should be disposed of for the common
benefit of the United States, and be settled
and formed into distinct republican States,
which should become members of the Federal
Union, and have the same rights of soveregnty, and freedom, and independence
as other States.<p>

But these difficulties became much more
serious after peace took place, and the boundaries of the United States were
established.
Every State, at that time, felt severely the
pressure of its war debt; but in Virginia, and
some other States there were large territories
of unsettled lands, the sale of which would enable them to discharge their
obligations without much inconvenience; while other States
which had no such resource, saw before them
many years of heavy and burdensome taxation, and the latter insisted, for
the reasons
before stated, that these unsettled lands should
be treated as the common property of the
States, and the proceeds applied to their common benefit.<p>

The Ietters from the statesman of that day
will show how much this controversy occupied
their thoughts, and the dangers that were apprehended from it. It was the
disturbing element of the time, and fears were entertained
that it might dissolve the Confederation by
which the States were then united.<p>

These fears and dangers were, however, at
once removed, when the State of Virginia, in
1784, voluntarily ceded to the, United States the
immense tract of country lying northwest of
the River Ohio, and which was within the acknowledged limits of the
State. The only object of the State, in making this cession,
was to put an end to the threatening and
exciting controversy, and to enable the Congress
of that time to dispose of the lands, and
appropriate the proceeds as a common fund for
the common benefit of the States. It was not
ceded because it was inconvenient to the State
to hold and govern it,. nor from any expectation
that it could be better or more conveniently
governed by the United States.<p>

The example of Virginia was soon afterwards followed by other States, and,
at the
time of the adoption of the Constitution, all of
the States similarly situated had ceded their
unappropriated lands, except North Carolina
and Georgia. The main object for which these
cessionis were desired and made, was on account of their money value,
and to put an end
to a dangerous controversy, as to who was
justly entitled to tje proceeds when the lands
should be sold. It is necessary to bring this
part of the history of these cessions thus
distinctly into view, because it will enable us
the better to comprehend the phraseology of
the Article of the Constitution so often referred to in the argument.<p>

Undoubtedly the powers of Sovereignty and
the eminent domain were ceded with the land.
This was essential in order to make it effectual,
and to accomplish its ojbects. But it
must be remembered that, at that time, there
was no Government of the United States in
existence with enumerated and limited powers; what was then called the United
States, were thirteen separate, sovereign, independent States, which had
entered into a league or confederation for their mutual protection and
advantage, and the Congress of the United States was composed of the
representatives of these separate sovereignties, meeting together, as equals,
to discuss and decide on certain measures
which the States, by the Articles of Confederation,
had Iiiid agreed to submit to their decision. But this Confederation had
none of the
attrbutes of sovereignty in legislative, executive, or judicial power. It
was little more
than a congress of ambassadors, authorized to
represent separate nations, in matters in which
they had a common concern.<p>

It was this Congress that accepted the cession from Virginia. They had no
power to accept it under the Articles of Confederation.
But they had an undoubted right, as independent sovereignties, to accept any
cession of territory for their common benefit, which all of
them assented to; and it is equally clear, that
as their common property, and having no superior to control them, they had
the right to
exercise absolute dominion over it, subject only
to the restrictions which Virginia had imposed
in her Act of Cession. There was, as we
have said, no Government of the United States
then in existence with special enumerated
powers. The territory belonged to sovereignties, who, subject to the
limitations above mentioned, had a right to
establish any form of government they pleased,
by compact or treaty among themselves, and
to regulate the rights of person and property in
the territory as they might deem proper. It
was by a Congress, representing the authority
of these, several and separate sovereighnties,
and acting under their authority and command,
(but not from any authority derived
from the Articles of Confederation), that the
instrument, usually called the Ordinance of
1787, was adopted; regulating in much detail
the principles and the laws by which this
Territory should be governed; and among other
provisions, slavery is prohibited in it. We
do not question the power of the States, by
agreement among themselves, to pass this
Ordinance, nor its obligatory force in the Territory, while the
confederation or league of
the States in their separate sovereign character continued to exist.<p>

This was the state of things when the Constitution of the United States
was formed.
The territory ceded by Virginia belonged to
the several confederated States as common
property, and they had united in establishing in it a system of government and
jurisprudence, in order to prepare it for admission as
States, accordding to the terms of the cession.
They were about to dissolve this federative
Union, and to surrender a portion of their independent sovereignty to a new
government,
which, for certain purposes, would make the
people of the several States one people, and
which was to be supreme and controlling, within
its sphere of action throughout the United
States; but this government was to be carefully limited in its powers, and to
exercise no
authority beyond those expressly granted by
the Constitution, or necessarily to be implied
from the language of the instrument, and the
objects it was intended to accomplish; and as
this league of States would, upon the adoption
of the new government, cease to have any
power over the territory, and the Ordinance
they had all agreed upon be incapable of execution,
and a mere nullity, it was obvious that some
provision was necessary to give the new government
sufficient power to enable it to carry
into effect the objects for which it was ceded,
and the compacts and agreements which the
States had made each other in the exercise of
their powers of sovereignty. It was necessary
that the lands should be sold to pay the war
debt; that a government and system of jurisprudence should be maintained in
it, to protect
the citizens of the United States, who should
migrate to the Territory, in their rights of
person and of property. It was also necessary
that the new government, about to be
adopted, should be authorized to maintain the claim of the United
States to the
unappropriated lands in North Carolina and
Georgia, which had not then been ceded, but
the cession of which was confidently anticipated upon some terms that
would be arranged between the general government and
these two States. And, moreover, there were
many articles of value besides this property
in land, such as arms, military stores, munitions, and ships of war, which
were the common property of the States, when acting in
their independent characters as confederates,
which neither the new government nor anyone
else would have a right to take possession of,
or control, without authority from them; and
it was to place these things under the guardianship and protection of the
new government, and
to clothe it with the necessary powers, that the
clause was inserted in the Constitution which
gives Congress the power "to dispose of and
make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other
property belonging
to the Unitied States." It was intended for a
specific purpose, to provide for the things we
have mentioned. It was to transfer to the new
government the property then held in common by the States, and to give to
that government power to apply it to the objects for
which it had been destined by mutual agreement among the States before their
league was desolved. It applied only to the property
which the States held in common at that time,
and has no reference whatever to any territory or other property which the
new sovereignty might afterwards itself acquire.<p>

The language used in the clause, the arrangement and combination of the
powers, and the
somewhat unusual phraseology it uses, when
it speaks of the political power to be exercised
in this government of the territory, all indicate
the design and meaning of the clause to be
such as we have mentioned. It does not speak
of any Territory, nor of Territories, but uses
language which, according to its legitimate
meaning, points to a particular thing. The
power is given in relation only to the territory
of the United States -- that is, to a Territory
then in existence, and then known or claimed as
the territory of the United States. It begins
its enumeration of powers by that of disposing,
in other words, making sale of the lands, or
raising money from them, which, as we have
already said, was the main object of the cession, and which is accordingly
the first things
provided for in the Article. It then gives the
power which was necessarily associated with
the disposition and sale of the lands -- that is,
the power of making needful rules and regulations respecting the Territory. 
And whatever construction may now be given to these
words, everyone, we think, must admit
that they are not the words usually employed
by statesmen in giving supreme power of legislation. They are certainly
very unlike the
words used in the power granted to legislate
over territory which the new government
might afterwards itself obtain by cession from
a state, either for its seat of government, or
for forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and
other needful buildings.<p>

And the same power of making needful rules
respecting the Territory is, in precisely the
same language, applied to the other property
belonging to the United States -- associating the
power over the Territory in this respect with
the power over movable or personal property, that is, the ships, arms, and
munitions of war,
which then belonged in common to the State
sovereignties. And it will hardly be said, that
this power, in relation to the last mentioned
objects, was deemed necessary to be thus
specially given to the new government, in order
to authorize it to make needful rules and regulations respecting the ships
it might itself build,
or arms and munitions of war it might itself
manufacture or provide for the public service.<p>

No one, it is believed, would think a moment of deriving the power of
Congress to make
needful rules and regulations in relation to
property of this kind from this clause of the
Constitution. Nor can it, upon any fair construction, be applied to any
property but that
which the new government was about to receive
from the confederated States. And if this be
true as to this property, it must be equally
true and limited as to the territory, which is so
carefully and precisely coupled with it -- and
like it referred to as property in the power
granted. The concluding words of the clause
appear to render this construction irresistible;
for, after the provisions we have mentioned, it
proceeds to say, "that nothing in the Constitution shall be so construed as
to prejudice any
claims of the United States, or of any particular State."<p>

Now, as we have before said, all of the States
except North Carolina and Georgia, had made
the cession before the Constitution was adopted,
according to the resolution of Congress of
October 10, 1780. The claims of other States
that the unappropriated lands in these two
States should be applied to the common benefit, in like manner, was still
insisted on, but refused by the States. And this member of
clause in question evidently applies to them,
and can apply to nothing else. It was to exclude the conclusion that
either party, by
adopting the Constitution, would surrender
what they deemed their rights. And when
the latter provision relates so obviously to the
unapropriated lands not yet ceded by the
States, and the first clause makes provision for
those then actually ceded, it is imposible, by any just rule of
construction, to make
the first provision general, and extend to all
territories, which the Federal Government
might in any way afterwards acquire, when
the latter is plainly and unequivocally confined
to a particular territory; which was a part of
the same controversy, and involved in the same
dispute, and depended upon the same principles.
The union of the two provisions in the same
clause shows that they were kindred subjects,
and that the whole clause is local, and relates
only to lands, within the limits of the United
States, which had been or then were claimed by
a State; and that no other Territory was in
the mind of the framers of the Constitution, or
intended to be embraced in it. Upon any other
construction it would be impossible to account
for the insertion of the last provision in the
place where it is found, or to comprehend why,
or for what object, it was associated with the
previous provision.<p>

This view of the subject is confirmed by the
manner in which the present Government of
the United States dealt with the subject as
soon as it came into existence. It, must be
borne in mind that the same States that adopted
the Confederation also formed and adopted the
new government, to which so large a portion
of their former sovereign powers were surrendered. It must also be borne in
mind that all of these same States which had then ratified
the new Constitution were represented in the
Congress which passed the first law for the
government of this territory; and many of the
members of that legislative body had been
deputies from the States under the Confederation -- had united in adopting the
Ordinance of
1787, and assisted in forming the new government under which they were then
acting, and
whose powers they were then exercising. And
it is obvious from the law they passed to carry
into effect the principles and provisions of the
Ordinance, that they regarded it as the Act of
the States done in the exercise of their legitimate powers at the time. The
new government
took the territory as it found it, in the condition in which it was
transferred, and did not
attempt to undo anything thnt had been done.
And among the earliest laws passed under the
new government, is one reviving the Ordinance
of 1787, which had become inoperative and a
nullity upon the adoption of the Constitution.
This law introduces no new form or principle
for its government, but recites, in the preample,
that it is passed in order that this Ordinance
may continue to have full effect, and proceeds
to make only those rules and regulations which
were needful to adopt it to the new govern ment, into whose hands the power
had fallen.<p>

It appers, therefore, that this Congress regarded the purposes to which
the land in
this territory was to be applied, and the form
of government and principles of jurisprudence
which were to prevail there, while it remained
in the territorial state, as already determined
by the States when they had full power and
right to make the decision; and that the new
government, having received it in this condition, ought to carry substanially
into effect the
pIans and principles which had been previously
adopted by the States, and which no doubt the
States anticipated when they surrendered their
power to the new government. And if we regard this clause of the
Constitution as pointing
to this Territory, with a teritorial government
already established in it, which had been ceded
to the States for the purposes hereinbefore
mentioned -- every word in it is perfectly appropriate and easily
understood, and the provisions it contains are in perfect
harnony with
the objects for which it was ceded, and with the
condition of its government as a Territory at
the time. We can, then, casily account for the
manner in which the first Congress legislated
on the subject -- and can also understand why
this power over the Territory was associated
in the same clause with the other property of
the United States, and subjected to the like
power of making needful rules and regulations.
But if the clause is construed in the expanded
sense contended for, so as to embrace any territory acquired from a
foreign nation by the
present government, and to give it in such territory a despotic and
unlimited power over persons and property, such as the confedreated States
might exercise in their common property, it would be difficult to account for
grants of power -- and also for its association
with the other provisions in the same clause.<p>

The Constitution has alwavs been remarkable
for the felicity of its arrangement of different
subjects, and the perspicuity and appropriateness
of the language it uses. But if this clause
is construed to extend to territory acquired by
the present government from a foreign nation,
outside of the limits of any charter from the
British Government to a Colony, it would be
dificult to say, why it was deemed necessary
to give the government the power to sell any
vacant lands belonging to the sovereignty
which miglit be found within it; and if this
was necessary, why, the grant of this power
should precede the power to legislate over it
and establish a government there, and still
more difficult to say, why it was deemed necessary so specially and
partictilarly to grant the
power to make needful rules and regulations in
relation to any person or movable property
it might acquire, there. For the words, "other
property," necessarily, by every known rule of
interpretation, must mean property of
a different description from territory or land.
And the difficulty would perhaps be insurmountable
in endeavoring to accunt for the
last member of the sentence, which provides
that "nothing in this Constitution shall be so
contstrued as to prejudice any claims of the
United States or any particular State," or to
say how any particular State cou]d have claims
in or to a Territory ceded by a foreign government, or to account for
associating this provision with the preceding provisions of the clause,
with which it would appear to have no connection.<p>

The words "needful rules and regulations"
would seem, also, to have been cautiously used
for some definite object. They are not the
worda usually employed by statesmen, when
they mean to give the powers of sovereignty, or
to establish a government, or to authorize its
establishment. Thus, in the law to renew and
keep alive the Ordinance of 1787, and to re-establish the government, the
title of the law is: "An Act to provide for the government of
the territory northwest of the River Ohio." And
in the Constithtion, when granting the power
to legislate over the territory that may be
selected for the seat of government, independently of a State, it does not
say Congress shall
have power "to make all needful rules and
regulations respecting the territory;" but it
declares that "Congress shall have power to
exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such District
(not exceeding ten
miles square) as may, by cession of particular
States and the acceptance of Congress, become
the seat of the Governmnent of the United
States."<p>

The words "rules and regulations" are ustually employed in the
Constitution in speaking
of some particular specified power which it
means to confer on the government, and not, as
we have seen, when granting general powers of
legislation. As, for example, in the particular
power of Congress "to make rules for the government and regulation of
the land and naval
forces, or the particular and specific power
to regulate commerce;" "to establish an uniform
rule of naturalization;" "to coin money
and regulate the value thereof." And to
constru the words of which we are speaking as
a general and unlimited grant of sovereignty
over territories which the government might
afterwards acquire, is to use them in a sense
and for a purpose for which they were not
used in any other part of the instument. But
if confined to a particular territory, in which
a government and laws have already been established, but which would
require some alterations to adopt it to the new government, the
words are peculiarly applicable appropriate
for that purpose.<p>

The necessity of this special provision in relation to property and the
rights or property held in common by the confederated
States, is illustrated by the 1st clause of the
6th article. This clause provides that "all
debts, contracts and engagements entered into
before the adoption of this Constitutition, shall
be as valid against the United States under this
government as under the Confederation." This
provision, like the one under consideration, was
indispensable if the new Constitution was
adopted. The new government was not a mere
change in a dynasty, or in a form of governmen, leaving the nation
or sovereignty same,
and clothed with all the same rights, and
bound by all the obligations of the preceding
one. But, when the presenit United States came
into existence under the new government, it
was a new political body, a new nation, then
for the first time taking its place in the
family of nations. It took nothing by succession
from the Confederation. It had no right, as its
successor, to any property or rights of property
which it had acquired, and was not liable for
any of its obligations. It was evidently viewed
in this light by the framers of the Constitution.
And as the several States would cease to exist
in their former confederated character upon
the adoption of the Constitution, and could not,
in that character, again assemble together,
special provisions were indispensable to transfer to the new government
the property and
rights which at that time they held in common; and at the same time to 
authorize it to
lay taxes and appropriate money to pay the
common debt which they had contracted; and
this power could only be given to it by special
provisions in the Constitution.<p>

The clause in relation to the territory and
other property of the United States provided
for the first, and the clause last quoted provided for the other.
They have no connection
with the general powers and rights of sovereignty delegated to the new
government, and
can neither enlarge nor diminish them. They
were inserted to meet a present emergency, and
not to regulate its powers as a government.<p>

Indeed, a similar provision was deemed necessary, in relation to treaties
made by the Confederation; and when in the clause next succeeding
the one of which we have last spoken,
it is declared that treaties shall be the supreme
law of the land, care is taken to include, by express words, the Treaties
made by the confederation and States. The language is: "and all treaties
made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United
States, shall be the supreme law of the land."<p>

Whether, therefore, we take the particular
clause in question, by itself, or in connection
with the other provisions of the Constititution,
we think it clear, that it applies only to the
particular territory of which we have
spoken, and cannot, by any just rule of interpretation, be extended to
a territory which
the new government might afterwards obtain
from a foreign nation. Consequently, the power which Congress may
have lawfully exercised
in this territory, while it remained under a territorial
government, and which may have
been sanctioned by judicial decision, can furnish no
justification and no argument to support a similar
exercise of power over territory afterwards
acquired by the Federal government. We put
aside, therefore, any argument, drawn from precedents,
showing the extent of the power
which the general government exercised over slavery in this territory, as
altogether inapplicable in the case before us.<p>

But the case of the American and Ocean Insurance
Companies v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, has
been quoted as establishing a different construction
of this clause of the Constitution. There
is, however, not the slightest coflict between
the opinion now given and the one referred to;
and it is only by taking a singe sentence out of
the latter and separating it from the context,
that even an appearance of conflict can be
shown. We need not comment on such a mode
of expounding an opinion of the court. Indeed it most commonly
misrepresents instead of
expounding it. And this is fully exemplified
in the case referred to, where, if one sentence is taken by itself, the
opinion would
appear to be in direct conflict with that now
given; but the words which immediately follow
that sentence show that the court did not mean
to decide the point, but merely affirmed the
power of Congress to establish a government in
the Territory, leaving it an open question,
whether that power was derived from this
clause in the Constitution, or was to be necessarily inferred from a power
to acquire territory by cession from a foreign government.
The opinion on this part of the case is short,
and we give the whole of it to show how well
the selection of a single sentence is calculated
to mislead.<p>

The passage referred to is in page 542, in
which the court, in speaking of the power of
Congress to establish a territorial govenment
in Florida until it should become a State, uses
the following language:<p>

"In the meantime Florida continues to be a
Territory of the United States, governed by
that clause of the Constitution which empowers
Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory
or other property
of the United States. Perhaps the power of
governing a territory belonging to the United
States, which has not, by becoming a State, acquired the means of
self-government, may result necessarily from the facts that it is not
within the jurisdiction of any
State, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the United States.
The right to govern may be the inevitable consequence of
the right to acquire territory. Whichever may
be the source from which the power is derived,
the possession of it is unquestionable."<p>

It is thus clear, from the whole opinion on
this point, that the court did not mean to decide whether the power was
derived from the
clause in the Constitution or was the necessary
consequence of the right to acquire. They do
decide that the power in Congress is unquestionable, and in this we
entirely concur, and
nothing will be found in this opinion to the contrary. The power stands
firmly on the latter
alternative put by the court, that is, as "the
inevitable consequence of the right to acquire
territory."<p>

And what still more clearly demonstrates
that the court did not mean to decide the question, but leave it open for
future consideration, is the fact that the case was decided in
the Circuit Court by Mr. Justice Johnson, and
his decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court.
His opinion at the Circuit is given in full in
a note to the case, and in that opinion he states,
in explicit terms, that the clause of the Constitution applies only to the
territory then within
the limits of the United States, and not to Florida, which had been acquired by
cession from
Spain. This part of his opinion will be found
in the note in page 517 of of the report. But he
does not dissent from the opinion of the Supreme Court; thereby showing
that, in his judgment, as well as that of the court, the case before them did
not call for a decision on that
particular point, and the court abstained from
deciding it. And in a part of its opinion subsequent to the passage we have
quoted, where
the court speak of the legislative power of Congress in Florida, they still
speak with the same
reserve. And in page 546, speaking of the power of Congress to authorize
the Territorial
legislature to establish courts there, the court
say: "They are legislative courts, created in
virtue of the general right of sovereignty which
exists in the government, or in virtue of that
clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory belonging to the United States."<p>

It has been said that the construction given
to this clause is new, and now for the first
time brought forward. The case of which we
are speaking, and which has been so much discussed, shows that the fact is
otherwise. It
shows that precisely the same question came
before Mr. Justice Johnson, at his circuit, thirty years ago -- was fully
considered by him,
and the same construction given to the clause
in the Constitution which is now given by this
court. And that upon an appeal from
his decision the same question was brought before this court, but, was
not decided because a
decision upon it was not required by the case
before the court.<p>

There is another sentence in the opinion
which has been commented on, which even in
a still more striking manner shows how one
may mislead or be misled by taking out a
single sentence from the opinion of a court,
and leaving out of view what precedes and follows. It is in page 546,
near the close of the
opinion, in which the court say: "In legislating
for them" (the Territories of the United
States), "Congress exercises the combined powers of the general and of a
state government."
And it is said, that as a State may unquestionably prohibit slavery within
its territory,
this sentence decides in effect that Congress
may do the same in a Territory of the United
States, exercising there the powers of a State
as well as the power of the general government.<p>

The examination of this passage in the case
referred to, would be more appropriate when
we come to consider in another part of this
opinion what power Congress can constitutionally exercise in a Territory,
over the rights of
person or rights of property of a citizen. But
as it is in the same case with the passage we
have before commented on, we dispose of it now,
as it will save the court from the necessity of
referring again to the case. And it will be
seen upon reading the page in which this sentence is found, that it has no
reference whatever to the power of Congress over rights of
person or rights of property -- but relates altogether to the power of
establishing judicial
tribunals to administer the laws constitutionally passed, and defining the
jurisdiction they may exercise.<p>

The law of Congress establishing a territorial
government in Florida, provided that the legislature of the Territory should
have legislative
powers over "all rightful objects of legislation;
but no law should be valid which was inconsistent with the laws and
Constitution of the United States."<p>

Under the power thus conferred, the Legislature of Florida passed an Act,
erecting a
tribunal at Key West to decide cases of salvage.
And in the case of which we are speaking, the
question arose whether the Territorial Legislaure could be authorized by
Congress to establish such a tribunal, with such powers; and one
of the parties, among other objections, insisted
that Congress could not under the Constitution
authorize the Legislature of the Territory to establish such a tribunal with
such powers, but
that it must be established by Congress itself;
and that a sale of cargo made under its order,
to pay salvors, was void, as made without legal
authority, and passed no property to the purchaser.<p>

It is in disposing of this objection that
the sentence relied on occurs, and the court begin that part of the opinion
by stating with
great precision the point which they are about
to decide.<p>

They say: "It has been contended that by
the Constitution of the United States, the judicial power of the United
Strifes extends to
all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and that the whole of
the judicial power
must be vested 'in one Supreme Court, and in
such inferior courts as Congress shall from time
to time ordain and establish.' Hence it has
been argued that Congress cannot vest admiralty jurisdiction in courts
created by the
Territorial Legistature."<p>

And after thus clearly stating the point before them, and which they were
about to decide, they proceed to show that these territorial
tribunals were not constitutional courts, but
merely legislative, and that Congress might,
therefore, delegate the power to the territorial
government to establish the court in question;
and they conclude that part of the opinion in
the following words: "Although admiralty jurisdiction can be exercised in the
states in those
courts only which are established in pursuance
of the 3d article of the Constitution, the same
limitation does not extend to the Territories.
In legislating for them, Congress exercises the
combined powers of the general and state governments."<p>

Thus it will be seen by these quotations from
the opinion, that the court, after stating the
question it was about to decide, in a manner too
plain to be misunderstood, proceeded to decide
it, and announced, as the opinion of the tribunal, that in organizing the
Judicial Department of the government in a Territory of the
United States, Congrtess does not act under,
and is not restricted by, the 3d article in the
Constitution, and is not bound, in a Territory,
to ordain and establish courts in which the
judges hold their offices during good behavior;
but may exercise the discretionary power which
a state exercises in establishing its judicial department, and regulating the
jurisdiction of its
courts, and may authorize the territorial government to establish, or may
itself establish,
courts in which the judges hold their offices for
a term of years only, and may vest in them judicial power upon subjects
confided to the judiciary of the United States. And in doing
this, Congress undoubtedly exercises the combined power of the general and a
state government. It exercises the discretionary power
of a state government in authorizing the establishment of a court in which
the judges
hold their appointments for a term of years
only, and not during good behavior; and it exercises the power of the
general government
in investing that court with admiralty
jurisdiction, over which the general government
had executive jurisdiction in the Territory.<p>

No one, we presume, will question the correctness
of that opinion; nor is there anything
in conflict with it in the opinion now given.
The point decided in the case cited has no relation to the question now before
the court. That
depended on the constructiont of the 3d article
of the Constitution, in relation to the judiciary
of the United States, and the power which Congress
might exercise in a territory in organizing
the Judicial Department of the government.
The case before us depends upon other and different provisions of the
Constitution, altogether
separate and apart from the one above mentioned. The question as to what
courts Congress may ordain or establish in a territory to
administer laws which the Constitution authorizes it to pass, and what laws
it is or is not
authorized by the Constitution to pass, are
widely different -- are regulated by different and
separate articles of the Constitution, and stand
upon different principles. And we are satisfied
that no one who reads attentively the page in
Peters' Reports to which we have referred, can
suppose that the attention of the court was
drawn for a moment to the quesion now before
this court, or that it meant in that case to say
that Congress had a right to prohibi a citizen
of the United States from taking any property
which he, lawfully held, into a Territory of
the United States.<p>

This brings us to examine by what provision of the Constitution
the present Federal
Government under its delegated and restricted
powers, is authorized to acquire territory outside of the original
limits ot the United States,
and what powers it may exercise therein over
the person or property of a citizen of the
United States, while it remans a territory, and
until it shall be admitted as one of the States
of the Union.<p>

There is certainly no power given by the
Constitution to the Federal Government to establish or maintain
Colonies bordering on the
United States or at a distance, to be ruled and
governed at its own pleasure; nor to enlarge its
territorial limits in any way, except by the admission of new
States. That power is plainly
given; and if a new State is admitted it needs
no further legislation by Congress, because the
Constitution itself defines the relative rights
and powers and duties of the State, and the
citizens of the State, and the Federal Government. But no power is
given to acquire
Territory to be held and governed permanently
in that character.<p>

And indeed the power exercised by Conress
to acquire territory and establish a government
there, according to its own unlimited discretion,
was viewed with great jealously by the
leading statesmen of the day. And in
the Federalist, No. 38, written by Mr. Madison,
he speaks of the acquisition of the Northwestern Territory by the
confederated States, by
the cession from Virginia and the establishment
of a government there, as an exercise of power
not warranted by the Articles of Confederation,
and dangerous to the liberties of the people.
And he urges the adoption of the Constitution
as a security and safeguard against such an
exercise of power.<p>

We do not mean, However, to question the
power of Congress in this respect. The power
to expand the territory of the United Stafes by
the admission of new States is plainly given;
and in the construction of this power by all the
departments of the government, it has been
held to authorize the acquisition of territory,
not fit for admission at the time, but to be admitted as soon as its
population and situation
would entitle it to adimision. It is acquired
to become a State, and not to be held as a colony and governed by
Congress with absolute
authority; and as the propriety of admiting a
new State is committed to the sound discretion of Congress, the
power to acquire territory
for that purpose, to be held by the United States
until it is in a suitable condition to become a
state upon an equal footing with the other
States, must rest upon the same discretion. It
is a question for the Political Department of
the government, and not the judicial; and
whatever the Political department of the government shall recognize
as within the limits of
the United States the Judicial Department is
also bound to recognize, and to administer in it
the laws of the UniLed States, so far as they
apply, and to maintain in the territory the authority and rights of the
government; and also
the personal rights and rights of property of individual citizens, as
secured by the Constitution. All we mean to say on this point is, that,
as there is no express regulation in the Constitution defining the power
which the general
government may exercise over the person or
property of a citizen in a territory thus acquired, the court must
necessarily look to the
provisions and principles of the Constitution,
and its distribution of powers, for the rues and
principles by which its decision must be governed.<p>

Taking this rule to guide us, it may be safely
assumed that citizens of the United States who
migrate to a territory belonging to the people
of the United States, cannot be ruled as mere
colonists, dependent upon the will of the general government, and to be
governed by any
laws it may think proper to impose. The principle upon which our
governments rest, and upon which alone they continue to exist, is the
union of States, sovereign and independent
within their own limits in their internal and domestic concerns, and bound
together
as one people by a general government, possesing certain enumerated and
restricted powers,
delegated to it by the people of the several
States and exercising supreme authority within the scope of the powers
granted to it,
throughout the dominion of thc United States.
A power, therefore, in the general government to obtain and hold
Colonies and dependent Territories, over which they might legislate without
restriction, would be inconsistent
with its own existence in its present form.
Whatever it acquires, it acquires for the benefit
of the people of the several States who created
it. It is their trustee acting for them, and
charged with the duty of promoting the interests of the whole people of the
Union in the
exercise of the powers specifically granted.<p>

At the time when the Territory in question
was obtained by cession from France, it contained no population
fit to be associated to gether and admitted as a State; and it therefore
was abolutely necessary to hold possession of it as a Territory belonging
to the United
States until it was settled and inhabited by a
civilized community capable of self-government,
and in a condition to be admitted on equal
terms with the other States as a member of the
Union. But, as we have before said, it was
acquired by the general government as the representative and trustee of the
people of the
United States, and it must, therefore, be held in
that character for their common and equal
benefit; for it was the people of the several
States, acting through the agent and representative, the Federal
Government, who in fact acquired the territory in question, and the
government holds it for their common use until it
shall be associated with the other States as a
member of the Union.<p>

But until that time arrives, it is undoubtedly
necessary that some government should be established, in order to organize
society, and to
protect the inhabitants in their persons and
property; and as the people of the United
States could act in this matter only through the
government which represented them and
through which they spoke and acted when the
territory was obtained, it was not only within
the scope of its powers, but it was its duty to
pass such laws and establish such a government
as would enable those by whose authority they
acted to reap the advantages anticipated from
its acquisition, and to gather there a population
which would enable it to assume the position
to which it was destined among the States of
the Union. The power to acquire, necessarily
carries with it the power to preserve and apply
to the purposes for which it was acquired. The
form of government to be established necessarily rested in
the discetion of
Congress. It was their duty to establish the
one that would be best suited for the protection
and security of the citizens of the United States
and other inhabitants who might be authorized
to take up their abode there, and that must
always depend upon the existing condition of
the Territory, as to the number and character
of its inhabitants, and the situation in the Territory. In some cases a
government, consisting
of persons appointed by the Federal Government, would best subserve the
interests of the
Territory, when the inhabitants were few and
scattered, and new to one another. In other
instances, it would be more advisable to commit the powers of self-government
to the people who resided in the territory, as being
the most competent to determine what was
best for their own interests. But some form of
civil authority would he absolutely necessary
to organize and preserve civilized society, and
prepare it to become a state; and what is the
best form mus always depend on the condition
of the territory at the time, and the choice of
the mode must depend upon the exercise of a
discretionary power by Congress acting within
the scope of its constitutional authority, and
not infringing upon the rights of person or
rights of property of the citizen who might go
there to reside or for any other lawful purpose.
It was acquired by the exercise of this discretion and it must be held and
governed in like
manner, until it is fitted to be a state.<p>

But the power of Congress over the person
or property of a citizen can never be a mere
discretionary power under our Constitution and
form of government. The powers of the
government and the rights and privileges of the
citizen are regulated and plainly defined by the
Constitution itself. And when the territory becomes a part of the United
States, the Federal
government enters into possession in the character impressed upon it by those
who created it.
It enters upon it with its powers over the citizen strictly 
limited by the Constitution, from which it derives its own existence,
and by virtue of which alone it continues to
exist and act as a government and sovereignty.
It has no power of any kind beyond it; and it
cannot, when it enters a territory of the United
States, put off its charterer, and assume discretionary or despotic powers
which the Constitiition has denied to it. It cannot create for
itself a new character separated from the citizens
of the United States, and the duties it
owes them under the provisions of the Constitution. The territory being a
part of the United States, the government and the citizen both
enter it under the authority of the Constitution,
with their respective rights defined and marked
out; and the Federal Government can
exercise no power over his person or property,
beyond what that instrument confers, nor lawfully deny any right
which it has reserved.<p>

A reference to a few of the provisions of the
Constitution will illustrate this proposition.
For no one, we presume, will contend that Congress can make
any law in a
territory respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or
the right of the people of the territory peaceably to assembple and to
petition the government for the redress of grievances.<p>

Nor can Congress deny to the people the
right to keep and bear arms, nor the right to
trial by jury, nor compel anyone to be a witness against himself in a
criminal proceeding.<p>

These powers, and others in relation to rights
of person, which it is not necessary here to
enumerate, are, in express and positive terms,
denied to the general government; and the
rights of private property have been guarded
with equal care. Thus the rights of property
are united with the rights of person, and placed
on the same ground by the fifth amendment to
the Constitution, which provides that no person shall be deprived of
life, liberty and property, without due process of law. And an Act
of Congress which deprives a citizen of the
United States of his liberty or property, merely
because he came himself or brought his property into a particular Territory of
the United
States, and who had committed no offense
against the laws, could hardly be dignified with
the name of due process of law.<p>

So, too, it will hardly be contended that
Congress could by law quarter a soldier in a
house in a territory without the consent of the
owner, in time of peace; nor in time of war, but
in a manner prescribed by law. Nor could they
by law forfeit the property of a citizen in a territory who was convicted of
treason, for a
longer period than the life of the person convicted; nor take private property
for public use
without just compensation.<p>

The powers over person and property of
which we speak are not only not granted to
Congress, but are in express terms denied, and
they are forbidden to exercise them. And this
prohibition is not confined to the States, but
the words are general, and extend to the whole
territory over which the Constitution gives it
power to legislate, including those portions of
it remaining under territorial government, as
well as that covered by States. It is a total
absence of power everywhere within the dominion of the United States, and
places the citizens of a territory, so far as these rights are
concerned, on the same footing with
citizens of the States, and guards them as firmly and plainly against any
inroads which the
general government might attempt, under the
plea of implied or incidental powers. And if
Congress itself cannot do this -- if it is beyond
the powers conferred on the Federal Government -- it will be admitted, we
presume, that it
could not authorize a territorial government to
exercise them. It could confer no power on any
local government, established by its authority,
to violate the provisions of the Constitution.<p>

It seems, however, to be supposed, that there
is a difference between property in a slave and
other property, and that different rules may
be applied to it in expounding the Constitution
of the United States. And the laws and usage
of nations, and the writings of eminent jurists
upon the relation of master and slave and their
mutual rights and duties, and the power
which governments may exercise over it, have
been dwelt upon in the argument.<p>

But in considering the question before us, it
must be borne in mind that there is no law of
nations standing between the people of the
United States and their government and interfering with their relation to
each other. The
powers of the government, and the rights of the
citizen under it, are positive and practical regulations plainly written
down. The people of
the United States have delegated to it certain
enumerated powers, and forbidden it to exercise others. It has no power
over the peerson or
property of a citizen but what the citizens of
the United States have granted. And no law
or usages of other nations, or reasoning of
statesmen or jurists upon the relations of master and slave, can enlarge the
powers of the government, or take from the citizens the rights
they have reserved. And if the Constitution
recognizes the right of property of the master
in a slave, and makes no distinction between
that description of property and other property
owned by a citizen, no tribunal, acting under
the authority of the United States, whether it
be legislative, executive, or judicial, has a right
to draw such a distinction, or deny to it the
benefit of the provisions and guarantees which
have been provided for the protection of private
property against the encroachments of the governments.<p>

Now, as we have already said in an earlier
part of this opinion, upon a different point, the
right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the
Constitution. The right
to traffic in it, like an ordinary article of merchandise and property,
was guaranteed to the
citizens of the United States, in every State
that might desire it, for twenty years. And
the government in express terms is pledged to
protect it in all future time, if the
slave eacapes from his owner. This is done in
plain words -- too plain to be misunderstood.
And no word can be found in the Constitution
which gives Congress a greater power over slave
property, or whicb entitles property of that
kind to less protection then property of any
other description. The only power conferred
is the power coupled with the duty of guarding and protecting the owner in
his rights.<p>

Upon these considerations, it is the opinion
of the court that the Act of Congress which
prohibited a citizen from holding and owning
property of this kind in the territory of the
United States north of the line therein mentioned, is not warranted by the
Constitution,
and is therefore void; and that neither Dred
Scott himself, nor any of his family, were
made free by being carried into this territory;
even if they had been carried there by the owner, with the intention of
becoming a permanent resident.<p>

We have so far examined the case, as it
stands under the Constitution of the United
States, and the powers thereby delegated to
the Federal Government.<p>

But there is another point in the case which
depends on state power and state law. And it
is contended, on the part of the plaintiff, that
he is made free by being taken to Rock Island,
in the State of Illinois, independently of his
residence in the territory of the United States;
and being so made free he was not again reduced to a state of slavery by
being brought bak to Missouri.<p>

Our notice of this part of the case will be
very brief; for the principle on which it depends was decided in this
court, upon much
consideration, in the case of Strader et al. v.
Graham, reported in 10th Howard, 82. In that
case, the slaves had been taken from Kentucky
to Ohio, with the consent of the owner, and
afterwards brought back to Kentucky. And
this court held that their status or condition,
as free or slave, depended upon the laws of
Kentucky, when they were brought back into
that State, and not of Ohio; and that this
court had no jurisdiction to revise the judgment of a state court upon its
own laws. This
was the point directly before the court, and
the decision that this court had not jurisdiction,
turned upon it, as will be seen by the report of
the case.<p>

So in this case: as Scott was a slave when
taken into the State of Illinois by his owner,
and was there held as such, and brought back
in that character, his status, as free or slave,
depended on the laws of Missouri, and not of
Illinois.<p>

It has, however, been urged in the argument,
that by the laws of Missouri he was
free on his return, and that this case,
therefore, cannot be governed by the
case of Strader et al. v. Graham, where it appeared, by the laws of
Kentucky, that the
plaintiffs continued to be slaves on their return
from Ohio. But whatever doubts or opinions
may, at one time, have been entertained upon
this subject, we are satisfled, upon a careful
examination of all the cases decided in the
State courts of Missoiiri referred to, that it is
now firmly settled by the decisions of the
highest court in the State, that Scott and his
family upon their return were not free, but
were, by the laws of Misouri, the property of
the defendant; and that the Circuit Court of
the United States had no jurisdiction, when, by
the laws of the State, the plaintiff was a slave
and not a citizen.<p>

Moreover, the plaintiff, it appears, brought a
similar action against the defendtent in the
State court of Missouri, claiming the freedom
of himself and his family upon the same
grounds and the same evidence upon which he
now relies in the case before the court. The
case was carried before the Supreme Court of the
State; was fully argued there; and that court
decided that neither the plaintiff nor his family were entitled to
freedom, and were still the
slaves of the defendant; and reversed the judgment of the inferior State
court, which had
given a different decision. If the plaintiff
supposed that this judgment of the Supreme
Court of the State was erroneous, and that this
court had jurisdiction to revise and reverse it,
the only mode by which he could legally bring
it before this court was by writ of error directed to tho Supreme Court of
the State, requiring it to transmit the record to this court. If
this had been done, it is too plain for argument that the writ must have
been dismissed
for want of jurisdiction in this court. The
case of Strader et al. v. Graham is directly in
point; and, indeed, independent of any decision, the language of the 25th
section of the
Act of 1789 is too clear and precise to admit of
controversy.<p>

But the plaintiff did not pursue the mode
prescribed by law for bringing the judgment
of a state court before this court for revision,
but suffered the case to be remanded to the inferior State court, where it
is still continued,
and is, by agreement of parties, to await the
judgment of this court on the point. All of
this appears on the record before us and by
the printed report of the case.<p>

And while the case is yet open and pending,
in the inferor State court, the plaintiff goes
into the Circuit Court of the United States,
upon the same case and the same evidence, and
against the same party, and proceeds to judgment, and then brings here the
same case from
the Circuit Court, which the law would not
have permitted him to bring directly from the
State court. And if this court takes
jurisdiction in this form, the result, so far as
the rights of the respective parties are concerned, is in every respect
substantially the
same as if it had, in open violation of law, entertained jurisdiction over
the judgment of the
State court upon a writ of error, and revised
and reversed its judgment upon the ground that
its opinion upon the question of law was erroneous. It would ill become
this court to
sanction such an attempt to evade the law, or
to exercise an appellate power in this circuitous
way, which it is forbidden to exercise in the
direct and regular and invariable forms of judicial proceedings.<p>

Upon the whole, therefore, it is the judgment
of this court, that it appears by the record before us that the plaintiff in
error is not a citizen of Missouri, in the sense in which that
word is used in the Constitution; and that
the Circuit Court of the United States, for that
reason, had no jurisdiction in the case, and
could give no judgment in it.<p>

Its judgment for the defendant must, consequently, be reversed, and a mandate
issued directing the suit to be dismissed for want of
jurisdiction.<p>

Mr. Justice Wayne:<p>

Concurring as I do entirely in the opinion of
the court, as it has been written and read by
the Chief Justice -- without any qualification of
its reasoning or its conclusions -- I shall neither
read nor file an opinion of my own in this
case which I prepared when I supposed it might
be necessary and proper for me to do so.<p>

The opinion of the court meets fully and decides every point which was made
in the argument of the case by the counsel on either
side of it. Nothing belonging to the case has
been left undecided, nor has any point been
discussed and decided which was not called for
by the record, or which was not necessary for
the judicial disposition of it, in the way that
it has been done, by more than a majority of
the court.<p>

In doing this the court neither sought nor
made the case. It was brought to us in the
course of the administration of the laws which
Congress has enacted for the review of cases
from the circuit courts by the Supreme Court.<p>

In our action upon it, we have only discharged our duty as a distinct and
efficient department of the government, as the framers of
the Constitution meant the judiciary to be,
and as the States of the Union and the people
of those States intended it should be, when
they ratified the Constitution of the United
States.<p>

The case involves private rights of value,
and constitutional principles of the highest importance, about which there
had become such a difference of opinion, that the
peace and harmony of the country required the
settlement of them by judicial decision.<p>

It would certainly be a subject of regret,
that the conclusions of the court have not been
assented to by all of its members, if I did not
know from its history and my own experience
how rarely it has happened that the judges
have been unanimous upon constitutional questions of moment, and if our
decision in this
case had not been made by as large a majority
of them as has been usually had on constitutional questions of importance.<p>

Two of the judges, Mr. Justices McLean and
Curtis, dissent from the opinion of the court.
A third, Mr. Justice Nelson, gives a separate
opinion upon a single point in the case, with
which I concur, assuming that the Circuit
Court had jurisdiction; but he abstains altogether from expressing any 
opinion upon the
8th section of the Act of 1820, known commonly as the Missouri Compromise Law,
and six of us declare that it was unconstitutional.<p>

But it has been assumed, that this court has
acted extrajudicially in giving an opinion upon
the 8th section of the Act of 1820, because, as
it has decided that the Circuit Court had no
jurisdiction of the case, this court has no jurisdiction to examine the case
upon its merits.<p>

But the error of such an assertion has arisen
in part from a misapprehension of what has
been heretofore decided by the Supreme Court,
in cases of a like kind with that before us; in
part, from a misapplication to the circuit courts
of the United States, of the rules of pleading
concerning pleas to the jurisdiction which prevail in common law courts; and
from its having
been forgotten that this case was not brought
to this court by appeal or writ of error from a
state court, but by a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United
States.<p>

The cases cited by the Chief Justice to show
that this court has now only done what it has
repeatedly done before in other cases, without
any question of its correctness, speak for themselves. The differences
between the rules concerning pleas to the jurisdiction in the courts
of the United States and common law courts
have been stated and sustained by reasoning
and adjudged cases; and it has been shown that
writs of error to a state court and to the circuit courts of the United States
are to be determined by different laws and principles. In
the first, it is our duty to ascertain if this court
has jurisdiction, under the 25th section of the
Judiciary Act, to review the case from the
State court; and if it shall be found that it has
not, the case is at end, so far as this court is
concerned; for our power to review the
case upon its merits has been made, by the
25th section, to depend upon its having jurisdiction; when it has not, this
court cannot criticise, controvert, or give any opinion upon the
merits of a case from a state court.<p>

But in a case brought to this court, by appeal
or by writ of error from a circuit court of the
United States, we begin a review of it, not by
inquiring if this court has jurisdiction, but if
that court has it. If the case has been decided
by that court upon its merits, but the record shows it to be deficient in
those averments which by the law of the United States
must be made by the plaintiff in the action, to
give the court jurisdiction of his case, we send
it back to the court from which it was brought,
with directions to be dismissed, though it has
decided there upon its merits.<p>

So, in a case containing the averments by the
plaintiff which are necessary to give the Circuit
Court jurisdiction, if the defendant shall file his
plea in abatement denying the truth of them,
and the plaintiff shall demur to it, and the
court should erroneously sustain the plaintiff's
demurrer, or declare the plea to be insufficient,
and doing so require the defendant to answer over by a plea to the merits,
and shall
decide the case upon such pleading, this court
has the same authority to inquire into the jurisdiction of that court to do
so, and to correct
its error in that regard, that it had in the other
case to correct its error, in trying a case in
which the plaintiff had not made those averments which were necessary to
give the court
jurisdiction. In both cases the record is resorted to, to determine the
point of jurisdiction,
but, as the power of review of cases from a
federal court, by this court, is not limited by
the law to a part of the case, this court may
correct an error upon the merits; and there is
the same reason for correcting an erroneous
judgment of the Circuit Court, where the want
of jurisdiction appears from any part of the
record, that there is for declaring a want of
jurisdiction for a want of necessary averments.<p>

Any attempt to control the court from doing so
by the technical common law rules of pleading
in cases of jurisdiction, when a defendant has
been denied his plea to it, would tend to enlarge the jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court, by
limiting this court's review of its judgments
in that particular. But I will not argue a
point already so fully discussed. I have every
confidence in the opinion of the court upon the
point of jurisdiction, and do not allow myself
to doubt that the error of a contrary conclusion will be fully understood
by all who shall
read the argument of the Chief Justice.<p>

I have already said that the opinion of the
court has my unqualified assent.<p>

<hr>

Mr. Justice Nelson:<p>

I shall proceed to state the grounds upon
which I have arrived at the conclusion that the
judgment of the court below should be affirmed. The suit was brought in
the court below by the plaintiff, for the purpose of asserting his freedom,
and that of Harriet, his wife,
and two children.<p>

The defendant pleaded, in abatement to the
suit, that the cause of action, if any, accrued
to the plaintiff out of the jurisdiction of the
court, and exclusively within the jurisdiction
of the courts of the State of Missouri; for that
the said plaintiff is not a citizen of the State
of Missouri as alleged in the declaration, because he is a negro of African
descent; his ancestors were of pure African blood, and were
brought into this country and sold as negro
slaves.<p>

To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the
defendant joined in demurrer. The court below sustained the demurrer, holding
that the
plea was insufficient in law to abate the suit.<p>

The defendant then pleaded over in bar of the
action.<p>

1. The general issue. 2. That the plaintiff
was a negro slave, the lawful property of the
defendant. And 3. That Harriet, the wife of
said plaintiff, and the two children, were the
lawful slaves of the said defendant. Issue was
taken upon these pleas, and the cause went
down to trial before the court and jury, and
an agreed state of facts was presented, upon
which the trial proceeded, and resulted in a
verdict for the defendant, under the instructions of the court.<p>

The facts agreed upon were substantially as
follows:<p>

That In the year 1831, the plaintiff, Scott,
was a negro slave of Dr. Emerson, who was a
surgeon in the Army of the United States; and
in that year he took the plaintiff from the
State of Missouri to the military post at Rock
Island, in the State of Illinois, and held him
there as a slave until the month of April or
May, 1836. At this date, Dr. Emerson removed,
with the plaintiff, from the Rock Island post to
the military post at Fort Snelling, situate on
the west bank of the Mississippi River, in the
Territory of Upper Louisianna, and north of the
latitude thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, and
north of the State of Missouri. That he held
the plaintiff in slavery at Fort Snelling, from
the last mentioned date until the year 1838.<p>

That in the year 1835, Harriet, mentioned
in the declaration, was a negro slave of Major
Taliaferro, who belonged to the Army of the
United States; and in that year he took her to
Fort Snelling, already mentioned, and kept her
there as a slave until the year 1836, and then
sold and delivered her to Dr. Emerson, who
held her in slavery, at Fort Snelling, until the
year 1838. That in the year 1836 the plaintiff
and Harriet were married, at Fort
Snelling, with the consent of their master. The
two children, Eliza and Lizzie, are the fruit of
this marriage. The first is about fourteen
years of age, and was born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of the
State of Missouri,
and upon the Mississippi River; the other,
about seven years of age, was born in the State
of Missouri, at the military post called Jeferson
Barracks.<p>

In 1838 Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff,
Harriet, and their daughter Eliza, from Fort
Snelling to the State of Missouri, where they
have ever since resided. And that before the
commencement of this suit, they were sold by
the Doctor to Sandford, the defendant, who has
claimed and held them as slaves ever since.<p>

The agreed case also states that the plaintiff
brought a suit for his freedom, in the Circuit
Court of the State of Missouri, on which a
judgment was rendered in his favor; but that,
on a writ of error from the Supreme Court of
the State, the judgment of the court below was
reversed, and the cause remanded to the circuit
for a new trial.<p>

On closing the testimony on the court below,
the counsel for the pllititiff prayed the court
to instruct the jury, upon the agreed state of
facts, that they ought to find for the plaintiff;
when the court refused, and instructed them
that, upon the facts, the law was with the defendant.<p>

With respect to the plea in abatement, which
went to the citizenship of the plaintiff, and his
competency to bring a suit in the federal courts,
the common law rule of pleading is, that upon
a judgment against the plea of demurrer, and
that the defendant answer over, and the defendant submits to the
judgment, and pleads
over to the merits, the plea in abatement is
deemed to be waived, and is not afterwards to
be regarded as a part of the record in deciding
upon the rights of the parties. There is some
question, however, whether this rule of pleading applies to the
peculiar system and jurisdiction of the federal courts. As, in these courts,
if the facts appearing on the record show that
the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction, its judgment will be reversed
in the appeIlate court for
that cause, and the case remanded with directions to be dismissed.
In the view we have taken of the case, it will
not be necessary to pass upon this question,
and we shall therefore proceed at once to an
examination of the case upon its merits. The
question upon the merits, in general terms, is
whether or not the removal of the plaintiff,
who was a slave, with his master, from the
State of Missouri to the State of Illinois, with
a view to a temporary residence, and after such
residence and return to the slave State,
such residence in the free State works an emancipation.<p>

As appears from an agreed statement of facts,
this question has been before the highest court
of the State of Missouri, and a judgment rendered that this residence
in the free State has
no such effect; but, on the contrary, that his
original condition continued unchanged.<p>

The court below, the Circuit Court of the
United States for Missouri, in which this suit
was afterwards brought, followed the decision
of the State court, and rendered a like judgment against the
plaintiff.<p>

The argument against these decielona is, that
the laws of Illinois, forbidding slavery within
her territory, had the effect to set the slave free
while residing in that Sthte, and to impress
upon him the condition and status of a freeman; and that, by force of
these laws, this status and condition accompanied him on his return to
the slave State, and of consequene he
could not be there held as a slave.<p>

This question has been examined in the
courts of several of the slaveholding States, and
different opinions expressed and conclusions arrived at. We shall
hereafter refer to some of
them, and to the principles upon which they are
founded. Our opinon is, that the question is
one which belongs to each State to decide for
itself, either by its Legislature or courts of justice; and thence, in
respect to the case before
us, to the State of Missouri -- a question exclusively of Missouri law,
and which, when determined by that State, it is the duty of the
federal courts to follow it. In other words, except in cases where the
power is restrained by,
the Constitution of the United States, the law
of the State is supreme over the subject of
slavery within its jurisdiction.<p>

As a practical illustration of the principle,
we may refer to the legislation of the free
States in abolishing silvery, and prohibiting
its introduction into their territories. Confessedly, except as
restrained by the Federal Constitution, they exercised, and rightfully,
complete and absolute power over the subject.
Upon what principle, then, can it be denied to
the State of Missouri? The power flows from
the sovereign character of the States of this
Union; sovereign, not merely as respects the
federal government -- except as they have consented to its
limitation -- but sovereign as respects each other. Whether, therefore,
the
State of Missouri will recognize or give effect
to the laws of Illinois within her territories,
on the subject of slavery, is a question for her
to determine. Nor is there any constitutional
power in this government that can rightfully
control her.<p>

Every State or nation possesses an
exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction within
her own territory; and her laws effect and bind
all property and persons residing within it. It
may regulate the manner and circumstances
under which property is held, and the condition,
capacity and state, of all persons therein; and,
also, the remedy and modes of administering
justice. And it is equally true, that no State
or nation can affect or bind peoperty out of its
territory, or persons not residing within it. No
State, therefore, can enact laws to operate beyond its own dominions, and, if
it attempts to
do so, it may be lawfully refused obedience.
Such laws can have no inherent authority extraterritorially. This is the
necessary result of
the independence of distinct and separate sovereignties.<p>

Now, it follows from these principles, that
whatever force or effect the laws of one Stat3
or nation may have in the territories of another, must depend solely upon
the laws and municipal regulations of the latter, upon its own jurisprudence
and polity, and upon its own express or tacit consent.<p>

Judge Story observes, in his Conflict of Laws,
p. 24, "that a State may prohibit the operation
of all foreign laws, and the rights growing out
of them, within its territories." "And that
when its code speaks positively on the subject,
it must be obeyed by all persons who are within
reach of its sovereignty; when its customary
unwritten or common law speaks directly on
the subject, it is equally to be obeyed."<p>

Nattions, from convenience and comity, and
from mutual interest, and a sort of moral necessity to do justice, recognize
and administer
the laws of other countries. But, of the nature,
extent and utility, of them, respecting property, or the state and conditions
of persons
within her territories, each nation judges for
itself; and is never bound, even upon the ground
of comity, to recognize them, if prejudicial to
her own interests. The recognition is purely
from comity, and not from any absolute or paramount operation.<p>

Judge Story again observes (398), "that the
true foundation and extent of the obligation
of the laws of one nation within another is
the voluntatry consent of the latter, and is inadmissable when they are
contrary to its known
interests." And be adds, "in the silence of
any positive rule affirming or denying, or restraning the operation of the
foreign laws,
courts of justice presume the tacit adoption
of them by their own government, unless they
are repugnaint to its policy or prejudicial to its
interests." See, also, 2 Kent's Com. p. 457; 13
Pet. 519, 589.<p>

These principles fully establish that it belongs to the sovereign State
of Missouri to determine by her laws the question of
slavery within her jurisdiction, subject only to
such limitations as may be found in the Federal Constitution; and, further,
that the laws of
other States of the Confederacy, whether enacted by their Legislatures or
expounded by
their courts, can have no operation within her
territory, or affect rights growing out of her
own laws on the subject. This is the necessary
result of the independent and sovereign character of the State. The principle
is not peculiar
to the State of Missouri, but is equally applicable to each State belonging to
the Confederacy. The laws of each have no extraterritorial operation within
the jurisdiction of another, except such as may be voluntarily conceded by her
laws or courts of justice. To the
extent of such concession upon the rule of
comity of nations, the foreign law may operate,
as it then becomes a part of the municipal
law of the State. When determined that the
foreign law shall have effect, the municipal
law of the State retires, and gives place to the
foreign law.<p>

In view of these principles, let us examine a
little more closely the doctrine of those who
maintain that the law of Missouri is not to
govern the status and condition of the plaintiff.
They insist that the removal and temporary
residence with his master in Illinois, where
slavery is inhibited, had the effect to set him
free, and that the same effect is to be given to
the law of Illinois, within the State of Missouri,
after his return. Why was he set free in Illinois? Because the law of
Missouri, under
which he was held as a slave, had no operation by
its own force extraterritorially; and the State
of Illinois refused to recognize its effect within
her limits, upon principles of comity, as a state
of slavery was inconsistent with her laws, and
contrary to her policy. But, how is the case
different on the return of the plaintiff to the
State of Missouri? Is she bound to recognize
and enforce the law of Illinois? For, unless
she is, the status and condition of the slave
upon his return remains the same as originally
existed. Has the law of Illinois any greater
force within the jurisdiction of Missouri, than
the laws of the latter within that of the former? Certainly not. They stand
upon an
equal footing. Neither has any force extraterritorially, except what may be
voluntarily
conceded to them.<p>

It has been supposed, by the counsel for the
plaintiff, that a rule laid down by Huberus had
some bearing upon that question. Huberus observes that "personal qualities,
impressed by
the laws of any place, surround and accompany
the person wherever he goes, with this effect:
that in every place he enjoys and is subject to
the same law which other persons of his
class elsewhere enjoy or are subject
to." De Confl. Leg. lib. 1, tit. 3, sec. 12; 4 Dall.
375, n; 1 Story, Com. Laws, pp. 59, 60.<p>

The application sought, to be given to the
rule was this; that as Dred Scott was free
while residing in the State of Illinois, by the
laws of that State, on his return to the State
of Missouri he carried with him the personal
qualities of freedom, and that the same effect
must be given to his status there as in the former State. But the difficulty
in the case is in
the total misapplication of the rule.
These personal qualities, to which Huberus
refers, are those impressed upon the individual
by the law of the domicil; it is this that the
author claims should be permitted to accompany the person into whatever country
he might
go, and should supersede the law of the place
where he had taken up a temporary residence.
Now, as the domicil of Scott was in the State
of Missouri, where he was a slave, and from
whence he was taken by his master into Illinois
for a temporary residence, according to the
doctrine of Huberiis, the law of his domicil
would have accompanied him, and during his
residence there he would remain in the same
condition as in the State of Missouri. In order
to have given effect to the rule, as claimed in
the argument, it should have been first shown
that a domicil had been acquired in the free
State, which cannot be pretended upon the
agreed facts in the case. But the true answer
to the doctrine of Huberus is, that the rule, in
any respect in which it may be reviewed, has no
bearing upon either side of the question before
us, even if conceded to the extent laid down by
the author; for he admits that foreign governments give effect to these laws
of the domicil
no further than they are consistent with their
own laws, and not prejudicial to their own subjects; in other words, their
force and effect depend upon the law of comity of the foreign
government. We should add, also, that this
general rule of Huberus, referred to, has not
been admitted in the practice of nations, nor is
it sanctioned by the most approved jurists of
international law. Story, Com. secs. 91, 96, 103,
104; 2 Kent's Com. pp. 457, 458; 1 Burge, Con.
Laws, pp. 12, 127.<p>

We come now to the decision of this court In
the case of Strader et al. v. Graham, 10 How.
p. 82. The case came up from the Court of Appeals, in the State of Kentucky. 
The question
in the case was, whether certain slaves of Graham, a resident of Kentucky, who
had been
employed temporarily at several places in the
State of Ohio, with their master's consent, and
had returned to Kentucky into his service, had
thereby become entitled to their freedom. The Court of Appeals held that they
had
not. The case was brought to this court under
the 25th section of the Judiciary Act. This
court held that it had no jurisdiction, for the
reason, the question was one that belonged exclusively to the State of
Kentucky. The Chief
Justice, in delivering the opinion of the court,
observed thnt "every State has an undoubted
right to determine the status or domestic and
social condition of the persons domiciled within its territory, except in so
far as the power
of the States in this respect is restrained,
or duties and obligations imposed upon them
by the Constitution of the United States. There
is nothing in the Constitution of the United
States, he observes, that can in any degree
control the law of Kentucky upon this subject.
And the condition of the negroes, therefore, as
to freedom or slavery, after their return, depended altogether upon the
laws of that State,
and could not be influenced by the laws of
Ohio. It is exclusively in the power of Kentucky to determine,
for herself, whether their
employment in another State should or should
not make them free on their return."<p>

It has been supposed, in the argument on the
part of the plaintiff, that the 8th section of
the Act of Conress passed March 6, 1820 (3
Stat. at L. p. 544), which prohibited slavery
north of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes,
within which the plaintiff and his wife temporarily resided at Fort
Snelling, possessed
some superior virtue and effect, extraterritorially and within the state of
Missouri, beyond
that of the laws of Illinois, or those of Ohio in
the case of Strader et al. v. Graham. A similar
ground was taken and urged upon the court in
the case just mentioned, under the Ordinance of
1787, which was enacted during the time of the
Confederation, and re-enacted by Congress after the adoption of the
Constitution, with some
amendments adapting it to the new government. I Stat. at L. p. 50.<p>

In answer to this ground, the Chief Justice,
in delivering the opinion of the court, observed:
The argument assumes that the six articles
which that Ordinance declares to be perpetual,
are still in force in the States since formed
within the territory, and admitted into the
Union. If this proposition could be maintained,
it would not alter the question; for the Regulations of Congress,
under the old Confederation
or the present Constitution, for the government
of a particular territory, could have no force
beyond its limits. It certainly could not restrict the power of the States,
within their repective territories, nor in any manner interfere
with their laws and institutions, nor give this
court control over them.<p>

"The Ordinance in question," he observes, "if still in force, could have no
more
operation than the laws of Ohio, in the State
of Kentucky, and could not influence the decision upon the rights of the
master or the slaves
in that State."<p>

This view, thus authoritatively declared,
furnishes a conclusive answer to the distinction
attempted to be set up between the extraterritorial effect of a state law and
the Act of Congress in question.<p>

It must be admitted that Congress possesses
no power to regulate or abolish slavery within
the States; and that if this Act had attempted
any such legislation, it would have been a nullity. And yet 
the argument here, if there be
any force in it, leads to the result, that effect
may be given to such legislation; for it is only
by giving the Act of Congress operation within
the State of Missouri, that it can have any effect upon the question
between the parties.
Having no such effect directly, it will be difficult to maintain, upon any
consistent reasoning, that it can be made to operate indirectly
upon the subject.<p>

The argument, we think, in any aspect in
which it may be viewed, is utterly destitute
of support upon any principle of constitutional law, as, according to
that, Congress has no
power whatever over the subject of slavery
within the State; and is also subversive of the
established doctrine of international jurisprudence, as, according, to that, it
is an axiom that
the laws of one government have no force within the limits of another, or
extraterritorially,
except from the consent of the latter.
It is perhaps not unfit to notice, in this connection, that many of the most
eminent statesmen and jurists of the country entertain the
opinion that this provision of the Act of Congress, even within the territory
to which it relates, was not authorized by any power under
the Constitution. The doctrine here contended
for, not only upholds its validity in the territory, but claims for it effect
beyond and within the limits of a sovereign state -- an effect,
as insisted, that displaces the laws of the State,
and substitutes its own provisions in their
place.<p>

The consequences of any such construction
are apparent. If Congress possesses thie power,
under the Constitution, to abolish slavery in a
territory, it must necessarily possess the like
power to establish it. It cannot be a one sided
power, as may suit the convenience or particular views of the advocates. It is
a power, if it
exists at all, over the whole subject; and then,
upon the process of reasoning which seeks to
extend its influence beyond the territory, and
within the limits of a state, if Congress should
establish, instead of abolish, slavery, we do
not see but that, if a slave should be
removed from the territory into a free State
his status would accompany him, and continue,
notwithstanding its laws against slavery. The
laws of the free State, according to the argument, would be displaced, and the
Act of Congress, in its effect, be substituted in their place.
We do not see how this conclusion could be
avoided, if the construction against which we
are contending should prevail. We are satisfied, however, it is unsound, and
that the true
answer to it is, that even conceding, for the
purposes of the argument, that this provision
of the Act of Congress is valid within the territory for which it was enacted,
it can have no
operation or effect beyond its limits, or within
the jurisdiction of a state. It can neither displace its laws nor change the
status or condition of its inhabitants.
Our conclusion, therefore, is, upon this branch
of the case, that the question involved is one
depending solely upon the law of Missouri,
and that the federal court siting in the State,
and trying the case before us, was bound to
follow it.<p>

The remaining question for consideration is:
what is the law of the State of Missouri on
this subject. And it would be a sufficient answer to refer to the judgment
of the highest
court of the State in the very case, were it not
due to that tribunal to state somewhat at large
the course of decision and the principles involved, on account of some
diversity of opinion
in the cases. As we have already stated, this
case was originally brought in the Circuit Court
of the State, which resulted in a judgment for
the plaintiff. The case was carried up to the
Supreme Court for revision. That court reversed the judgment below, and
remanded the
cause to the Circuit, for a new trial. In that
state of the proceeding, a new suit was brought
by the plaintiff in the Circuit Court of the
United States, and tried upon the issues and
agreed case before us, and a verdict and judgment for the defendant, that
court following
the decision of the Supreme Court of the State.<p>

The judgment of the Supreme Court is reported in the 15 Mo. p. 576.
The court placed
the decision upon the temporary residence of
the master with the slaves in the state and
territory to which they removed, and their return to the slave State; and
upon the principles
of international law, that foreign laws
have no extraterritorial force, except such as
the State within which they are sought to be
enforced may see fit to extend to them, upon
the doctrine of comity of nations.<p>

This is the substance of the grounds of the
decision.<p>

The same question has been twice before that
court since, and the same judgment given. 15
Mo. 595; 17 Ib. 434. It must be admitted,
therefore, as the settled law of the State,
and, according to the decision in the
case of Strader et al. v. Graham, 10 How. 82,
is conclusive of the case in this court.<p>

It is said, however, that the previous cases
and course of decision in the State of Missouri
on this subject were different, and that the
courts had held the slave to be free on his return from a temporary residence
in the free
State. We do not see, were this to be admitted,
that the circumstance would show that the
settled course of decision at the time this case
was tried in the court below, was not to be
considered the law of the State. Certainly, it
must be, unless the first decision of a principle
of law by a state court is to be permanent and
irrevocable. The idea seems to be, that the
courts of a state are not to change their opinions,
or, if they do, the first decision is to be
regarded by this court as the law of the State.
It is certain, if this be so, in the case before us,
it is an cxception to the rule governing this
court in all other cases. But what court has
not changed its opinions? What judge has not
changed his?<p>

Waiving, however, this view, and turning
to the decisions of the courts of Missouri, it
will be found that there is no discrepancy between the earlier and the present 
cases upon
this subject. There are some eight of them
reported previous to the decision in the case before us, which was decided in
1852. The list
of the earlier cases was decided in 1836. In
each one of these, with two exceptions, the
master or mistress removed into the free State
with the slave, with a view to a permanent residence --
in other words, to make that his or
her domicil. And in several of the cases, this
removal and permanent residence were relied
on as the ground of the decision in flavor of the
plaintiff. All these cases, therefore, are not
necessarily in conflict with the decision in the
case before us, but consistent with it. In one
of the two excepted cases, the master had hired
the slave in the State of Illinois from 1817 to
1825. In the other, the master was an officer
in the army, and removed with his slave to the
military post of Fort Snelling, and at Prairie
du Chien, in Michigan, temporarily, while acting under the orders of his
government. It is
conceded the decision in this case was departed
from in the case before us, and in those that
have followed it. But it is to be observed that
these subsequent cases are in conformity with
those in all the slave States bordering on the
free -- in Kentucky, 2 Marsh. 476; 5 B. Monroe,
176; 9 Ib. 565, -- in Virginia, 1 Rand. 15; 1
Leigh, 172; 10 Grat. 495, -- in Maryland, 4 Harr.
& McH. 295, 322, 325. In conformity, also, with
the law of England on this subject, Ex parte
Grace, 2 Hagg. Adm. 94, and with the opinions
of the most eminent jurists of the
country. Story's Confl. 396 a; 5 Kent's Com.
258 n; 18 Pick. 193, Chief Justice Shaw. See
Corresp. between Lord Stowell and Judge Story, I vol. Life of Story, p. 552.
558.<p>

Lord Stowell, in communicating his opinion
in the case of The Slave Grace to Judge Story,
states, in his letter, what the question was before him, namely: "Whether the
emancipation
of a slave brought to England insured a complete emancipation to him on
his return to his
native country, or whether it only operated as a
suspension of slavery in England, and his original character devolved on
him again upon his return to his
return." He observed, "the question had never
been examined since an end was put to slavery
fifty years ago," having reference to the decision
of Lord Mansfield in the case of Somersett;
but the practise, he observed, "has regularly
been, that on his return to his own country,
the slave resumed his original character as a
slave." And so Lord Stowell held in the case.<p>

Judge Story, in his letter in reply, observes:
"I have read with great attention your judgment in the slave case, etc. Upon
the fullest consideration which I have been able to give
the subject, I entirely concur in your views. If
I had been called upon to pronounce a judgmient in a like case, I should
have certainly arrived
at the same result." Again he observes:
"In my native State (Massachusetts), the state
of slavery is not recognized as legal; and yet,
if a slave should come hither, and afterwards
return to his own home, we should certainly
think that the local law attached upon him,
and his servile character would be redintegrated."<p>

We may remark in this connection, that the
case before the Maryland court, already referred to, and which was decided in
1799, presented the same question as that before Lord Stowell and received a
similar decision. This was
nearly thirty years before the decision in that
case, which was in 1828. The Court of Appeals observed, in deciding the
Maryland case, that "however the laws of Great Britain in
such instances, operating upon such persons
there, might interfere so as to prevent the exercise of certain
acts by the masters, not permitted, as in the case of
Somersett, yet, upon
the bringing Ann Joice into this State (then
the Province of Maryland), the relation of
master and slave continued in its extent, as
authorized by the laws of this State." And
Luther Martin, one of the counsel in that case, stated,
on the argument, that the question had
been previously decided the same way in the
case of slaves returning from a residence in
Pennsylvania, where they had become free under her laws.<p>

The State of Louisiana, whose courts had
gone further in holding the slave free
on his return from a residence in a free State
than the courts of her sister States, has settled
the law, by an Act of her Legislature, in conformity with the law of the Court
of Missouri
in the case before us. Sess. Law, 1846.<p>

The case before Lord Stowell presented much
stronger features for giving effect to the law
of England in the case of The Slave Grace
than exists in the cases that have arisen in this
country, for in that case the slave returned to 
a colony of England over which the imperial 
government exercised supreme authority. Yet, on 
the return of the slave to the colony, from a 
temporary residence in England, he held that the 
original condition of the slave attached. The 
question presented in cases arising here, is as to the 
effect and operation to be given to the law of a 
foreign State, on the return of the slave within an
Independent sovereignty.<p>

Upon the whole, it must be admited that the
current of authority, both in England and in this
country, is in accordance with the law as declared
by the courts of Missouri in the case before us, and 
we think the court below was not only right, but 
bound to follow it.<p>

Some question has been made as to the 
character of the residence in this case in the free
State. But we regard the facts as set forth in the 
agreed case as decisive. The removal of Dr. Emerson 
from Missouri to the military posts was in the 
discharge of his duties as surgeon in the army, and 
under the orders of his government. He was liable 
at any moment to be recalled, as he was in 1839,
and ordered to another post. The same is also true 
as it respects Major Taliaferro. In such a case, the 
officer goes to his post for a temporary 
purpose, to remain there for an uncertain time,
and not for the purpose of fixing his permanent 
abode. The question we think too plain
to require argument. The case of The Attorney 
General v. Napier, 6 Welsb. H. & G. Exch. 216, 
illustrates and apllies the principle in the case of 
an officer of the English army.<p>

A question has been aliuded to, on the 
argument, namely: the right of the master with his 
slave of transit into or through a free State, on
business or commercial pursuits, or in the exercise 
of a federal right, or the discharge of a federal 
duty, being a citizen of the United States, which is 
not before us. This question depends upon 
different considerations and principles from the 
one in hand, and turns upon the rights and privileges 
secured to a common citizen of the republic, under the 
Constitution of the United States. When that 
question arises we shall be prepared to decide it.<p>

Our conclusion is, that the judgment of 
the court below should be affirmed.<p>

Mr. Justice Grier:<p>

I concur in the opinion delivered by Sir. Justice 
Nelson on the questions discussed by him.<p>

I also concur with the opinion of the court as 
delivered by the Chief Justice, that the Act of 
Congres of 6th March, 1820, is unconstitutional and void; and that, assuming
the facts as stated in 
the opinion, the plaintiff cannot sue as a citizen of 
Missouri in the courts of the United States. But, 
that the record shows a prima facie case of 
jurisdiction, requiring the court to decide all the 
questions properly arising in it; and as the 
decision of the pleas in bar shows that the 
plaintiff is a slave, and therefore not entitled 
to sue in a court of the United States, the form of 
the judgment is of little importantance; for whether the 
judgment be affirmed or dismissed for want of 
jurisdiction, it is justified by the decision of the 
court, and is the same in effect between the 
parties to the suit.<p>

<h3 align=center>February, 1803</h3>

<h2 align=center>WILLIAM MARBURY</h2>
<h2 align=center>v.</h2>
<h2 align=center>JAMES MADISON,</h2>
<h3 align=center>Secretary of State of the United States.</h3>

At the last term, viz., December term, 1801,
William Marbury, Dennis Ramsay, Robert
Townsend Hooe, nnd William Harper, by their
counsel, Charles Lee, Esq. late attorney general
of the United States, severally moved
the court for a rule to James Madison, Secretary
of State of the United States, to show cause why
a mandamus should not issue commanding him
to cause to be delivered to them respectively
their several commissions as justices of the peace
in the District of Columbia.
This motion
was supported by affidavits of the following
facts, that notice of this motion had been given
to Mr. Madison; that Mr. Adams, the late
President of the United States, nominated the
applicants to the senate for their advice and
consent to be appointed justices of the peace of
the District of Columbia; that the senate advised and consented to the
appointments; that commissions in due form were signed by the
said President appointing them justices, &c.;
and that the seal of the United States was in
due form affixed to the said commissions by the
Secretary of State; that the applicants have requested Mr. Madison to
deliver them their said commissions, who has not complied with that
request; and that their said commissions are
withheld from them; that the applicants have
made application to Mr. Madison, as Secretary
of State of the United States, at his office, for
information whether the commissions were
signed and sealed as aforesaid, that explicit
and satisfactory information has not been given
in answer to that inquiry, either by the Secretary of State or any officer in
the department
of state; that application has been made to the
secretary of the senate for a certificate of the
nomination of the applicants, and of the advice
and consent of the senate who has declined
giving such a certificate; whereupon a rule was
laid to show cause on the fourth day of this
term. This rule having been duly served, Mr.
Lee, in support of the rule, observed, that it
was important to know on what ground a justice of peace in the District of
Columbia holds
his office and what proceedures are necessary
to constitute an appointment to an office not
held at the will of the President. However
notorious the facts are, upon the suggestion of
which this rule has been laid, yet the applicants
have been much embarrassed in obtaining evidence of them. Reasonable
information has been denied at the office of the department of state.
Although a respectful memorial has been made
to the senate praying them to suffer their secretary to give extracts from
their executive journals respecting the nomination of the
applicants to the senate, and of their advice and
consent to the appointments, yet their request
bas been denied and their petition rejected.
They have therefore been compelled to summon
witnesses to attend in court, whose voluntary
affidavits they could not obtain. Mr. Lee here
read the affidavit of Dennis Ramsay, and the
printed journals of the senate of 31st January
1803 respecting the refusal of the senate to
suffer their secretary to give the information
requested. He then called Jacob Wagner and
Daniel Brent, who had been summoned to attend the court, and who had, as it is
understood,
declined giving a voluntary affidavit. They objected to being sworn, alleging
that they were clerks in the department of state and not
bound to disclose any facts relating to the business or transactions in the
office.<p>

Mr. Lee observed, that to show the propriety
of examining the witnesses, he would make a
few remarks on the nature of the office of Secretary of State.
His duties
are of two kinds, and
he exercises his functions in two different capacities; as a public
ministerial
officer of the United
States and as agent of the president. In the first
his duty is to the United States or its citizens;
in the other, his duty is to the President; in the
one, he is an independent and an accountable
officer; in the other he is dependent upon the
President, is his agent, and accountable to him
alone. In the former capacity he is compellable
by mandamus to do his duty; in the latter he is
not. This distinction is clearly pointed out by
the two acts of congress upon this subject. The
first was passed 27th July 1789, vol. 1, p. 369
entitled "An act for estabishing an executive
department to be denominated the department
of foreign affairs." The first section ascertains
the duties of the secretary so far as he is considered as a mere exeeutive
agent. It is in these
words, "Be it enacted, &c. that there shall be
an executive department to be denominated the
department of foreign affairs and that there
shall be a principal officer therein, to be called
the secretary of the department of foreign affairs, who shall perform and
execute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on,
or intrusted to him by the President of the
United States, agreeable to the constitution,
relative to correspondences, commissions,
or instructions to or with public ministers or consuls from the United
States; or to
negotiations with public ministers from foreign
states or princes, or to memorials or other applications from foreign
public ministers, or
other foreigners, or to such other matters respecting foreign affairs as
the President of the
United States shall assign to the said department; and furthermore that the
said principal
officer shall conduct the business of the said department in such manner as the
President of the United States shall from time to time order
or instruct."<p>

The second section provides for the appointment of a chief clerk; the third
section prescribes
the oath to be taken which is simply, "well
and faithfully to execute the trust committed to
him;" and the fourth and last section gives him
the eustody of the books and papers of the department of foreign affairs under
the old congress. Respecting the powers given, and the
duties imposed, by this act, no mandamus will
lie. The secretary is responsible only to the president. The other act of
congress respecting this
department was passed at the same session on
the 16th September, 1789, vol. 1, p. 41, c. 14,
and is entitled "An act to provide for the safe
keeping of the acts, records, and seal of the
United States, and for other purposes." The
first section changes the name of the department and of the secretary, calling
the one the
department and the other the Secretary of
State. The second section assigns new duties
to the secretary in the performance of which it
is evident, from their nature, he cannot be lawfully controlled by the
President, and for the
non-performance of which he is not more responsible to the President than to
any other
citizen of the United States. It provides that
he shall receive from the President all bills, orders, resolutions and votes,
of the senate and
house of representatives which shall have been
approved and signed by him, and shall cause
them to be published, and printed copies to be
delivered to the senators and representatives, and to the executives of the
several states; and
makes it his duty carefully to preserve the originals and to cause them to be
recorded in
books to he provided for that purpose. The
third section provides a seal of the United States. The fourth makes it his
duty to keep
the said seal, and to make out and record, and
to affix the seal of the United States to all civil
comissions, after they shall have been signed by the President. The fifth
section provides for a seal of office, and that all copies of
records and papers in his office, authenticated
under that seal, shall be as good evidence as
the originals. The sixth section establishes
fees for copies, &c. The seventh and last section
gives him the custody of the papers of the
office of the secretary of the old congress. Most
of the duties assigned by this act are of a public nature and the secretary is
bound to perform them; without the control of any person.
The President has no right to prevent him from
receiving the bills, orders, resolutions and votes
of the legislature, or from publishing and distributing them, or from
preserving or recording
them. While the secretary remains in office, the
President cannot take from his custody the seal
of the United States, nor prevent him from recording and affixing the seal to
civil commissions of such officers as hold not their offices at
the will of the President, after he has signed
them and delivered them to the secretary for
that purpose. By other laws he is to make out
and record in his office patents for useful discoveries, and patents of lands
granted under the
authority of the United States. ln the performance of all these duties he is
a public ministerial
officer of the United States. And the duties being enjoined upon him by law,
he is, in executing them, uncontrollable by the President; and
if he neglects or refuses to perform them, he
may be compelled by mandamus in the same
manner as other persons holding offices under
the authority of the United States. The President is no party to this case.
The secretary is
called upon to perform a duty over which the
President has no control, and in regard to which
he has no dispensing power, and for the neglect
of which he is in no manner responsible. The
secretary alone is the person to whom they are
intrusted, and he alone is answerable for their
due performance. The Secretary of State, therefore, being in the same
situation, as to these duties, as every other ministerial officer of the
United States, and equally liable to be compelled
to perform them, is also bound by the same rules
of evidence. These duties are not of a confidential nature, but are of a
public kind, and his
clerks can have no executive privileges. There
are undoubtedly facts, which may come to their
knowledge by means of their connection with
the Secretary of State, respecting which they
cannot be bound to answer. Such are
the facts concerning foreign correspondences
and confidential commnuications between the
head of the department and the President.
This, however, can be no objeetion to their being sworn, but may be a ground
of objection to
any particular question. Suppose I claim title
to land under a patent from the United States.
I demand a copy of it from the Secretary of State.
He refuses. Surely he may be compelled by
mandamus to give it. But in order to obtain a
mandamus, I must show that the patent is recorded in his office. My case would
be hard indeed if I could not call upon the clerks in the
office to give evidence of that fact. Again, suppose a private act of
congress has passed for my
benefit. It becomes necessary for me to have
the use of that act in a court of law. I apply
for a copy. I am refused. Shall I not be permitted, on a motion for a
mandamus, to call
upon the clerks in the office to prove that such
an act is among the rolls of the office or that it
is duly recorded? Surely it cannot be contended that although the laws are to
be recorded, yet no access is to be had to the records, and no
benefit to result therefrom.<p>

The Court ordered the witnesses to be sworn
and their answers taken in writing, but informed them that when the
questions were
asked they might state their objections to answering each particular question,
if they had any.<p>

Mr. Wagner being examined upon interrogatories, testified, that at this
distance of time he
could not recollect whether he had seen any
commission in the office, constituting the applicants, or either of them,
justices of the peace.
That Mr. Marbury and Mr. Ramsay called on
the Secretary of State respecting their commissions. That the secretary
referred them to him;
he took them into another room and mentioned
to them, that two of the commissions had been
signed, but the other had not. That he did not
know that fact of his own knowledge, but by
the information of others. Mr. Wagner declined answering the question "who
gave him
that information;" and the court decided that
he was not bound to answer it, because it was
not pertinent to this cause. He further testified
that some of the commissions of the justices,
but he believed not all, were recorded. He
did not know whether the commissions of the
applicants were recorded, as he had
not had recourse to the book for more than
twelve months past.<p>

Mr. Daniel Brent testified, that he did not
remember certainly the names of any of the
persons in the commissions of justices of the
peace signed by Mr. Adams; but he believed
and was almost certain, that Mr. Marbury's and
Col. Hooe's commissions were made out, and
that Mr. Ramsay's was not; that he made out
the list of names by which the clerk who filled
up the commissions was guided; he believed
that the name of Mr. Ramsay was pretermitted
by mistake, but to the best of his knowledge it
contained the names of the other two; he believed none of the commissions for
justices of
the peace, signed by Mr. Adams, were recorded.
After the commissions for justices of the peace
were made out, he carried them to Mr. Adams
for his signature. After being signed, he carried them back to the secretary's
office, where
the seal of the United States was affixed to
them. That commissions are not usually delivered out of the office before they
are recorded; but sometimes they are, and a note of them
only is taken, and they are recorded afterwards.
He believed none of those commissions of justices were ever sent out, or
delivered to the persons for whom they were intended; he did not
know what became of them, nor did he know
that they are now in the office of the Secretary
of State.<p>

Mr. Lincoln, attorney genernl, having been
summoned, and now called, objected to answering. He requested that the
questions might be
put in writing and that he might afterwards
have time to determine whether he would answer. On the one hand he respeeted
the jurisdiction of this court and on the other he felt
himself bound to maintain the rights of the
executive. He was acting as Secretary of State
at the time when this transaction happened.
He was of opinion, and his opinion was supported by that of others whom he
highly respected, that he was not bound, and ought not
to answer, as to any fact which came officially
to his knowledge while acting as Secretary of
State.<p>

The questions being written, were then read
and handed to him. He repeated the ideas he
had before suggested, and said his objections
were of two kinds.<p>

1st. He did not think himself bound
to disclose his official transactions while acting
as Secretary of State; and,<p>

2d. He ought not to be compelled to answer
anything which might tend to criminate himself.<p>

Mr. Lee, in reply, repeated the substance of
the observations he had before made in answer
to the objections of Mr. Wagner and Mr. Brent.
He stated tbat the duties of a Secretary of State
were two-fold. In discharging
one part of those duties he acted as a public ministerial officer
of the United States, totally independent of the
President, and that as to any facts which came
officially to his knowledge, while acting in that
capacity, he was as much bound to answer as a
marshal, a collector, or any other ministerial
officer. But that in the discharge of the other
part of his duties, he did not act as a public
ministerial officer, but in the eapacity of an
agent of the President, bound to obey his orders, and accountable to him for
his conduct.
And that as to any facts which came officially
to his knowledge in the discharge of this part
of his duties, he was not bound to answer. He
agreed that Mr. Lincoln was not bound to disclose any thing which might tend to
criminate himself.<p>

Mr. Lincoln thought it was going a great
way to say that every Secretary of State should
at all times be liable to be called upon to appear
as a witness in a court of justice, and testify
to facts which eame to his knowledge officially.
He felt himself delicately situated between his
duty to this court, and the duty he conceived
he owed to an executive department; and hoped
the court would give him time to consider of
the subject.<p>

The court said that if Mr. Lineoln wished
time to consider what answers he should make
they would give him time; but they had no
doubt he ought to answer. There was nothing
confidential required to be disclosed. If there
had been he was not obliged to answer it; and
if he thought that any thing was communicated
to him in confidence he was not
bound to disclose it; nor was he obliged to state any thing
which would criminate himself; but that the
fact whether such commissions had been in the
office or not, could not be a confidential fact;
it is a fact which all the world have a
right to know. If he thought any of the questions improper, he might state his
objections.<p>

Mr. Lincoln then prayed time till the next
day to consider of his answers under this opinion of the court.<p>

The court granted it, and postponed further
consideration of the cause till the next day.<p>

At the openlng of the court on the next morning, Mr. Lincoln said he had no
objection to answering the questions proposed, execpting
the last, which he did not think himself obliged
to answer fully. The question was, what has
been done with the commissions. He had no
hesitation in saying that he did not know that
they ever came to the possession of Mr. Madison, nor did he know that they
were in the office when Mr. Madison took possession of it.
He prayed the opinion of the court whether he
was obliged to disclose what had been done with
the commissions.<p>

The court were of opinion that he was not
bound to say what had become of them; if they
never came to the possession of Mr. Madison,
it is immaterial to the present cause what
had been done with them by others.<p>

To the other questions he answered that he
had seen commissions of justices of the peace
of the District of Columbia, signed by Mr.
Adams, and sealed with the seal of the United
States. He did not recollect whether any of
them constituted Mr. Marbury, Col. Hooe, or
Col. Ramsay, justices of the peace; there were,
when he went into the office, several commissions for justices of peace of the
district made
out, but he was furnished with a list of names
to he put into a general commission, which was done, and was considered
as superseding the
particular commissions; and the individuals
whose names were contained in this general
commission were informed of their being thus
appointed. He did not know that any one of
the commissions was ever sent to the person
for whom It was made out, and did not believe
that any one had been sent.<p>

Mr. Lee then read the affidavit of
James Marshall, who had been also summoned
as a witness. It stated that on the 4th of
March, 1801, having been informed by some
person from Alexandria that there was reason
to apprehend riotous proeeedings in that town
on that night, he was induced to return immediately home, and to call at the
office of the Secretary of State, for the commissions of the jusices of the
peace; that as many as 12, he believed, commissions of justices for that county
were delivered to him, for which he gave a receipt, which he left in the
office.
That finding
he could not conveniently carry the whole, he
returned several of them, and struck a pen
through the names of those, in the receipt,
which he returned. Among the commissions
he returned, according to the best of his knowledge and belief was one for
Col. Hooe, and
one for William Harper.<p>

Mr. Lee then observed, that having proved
the existence of the commission, he should confine such further remarks as he
had to make in
support of the rule to three questions:<p>

1st. Whether the Supreme Court can award
the writ of mandamus in any case?<p>

2d. Whether it will lie to a Secretary of State
in any case whatever?<p>

3d. Whether, in the present case, the court
may award a mandamus to James Madison, Secretary of State?<p>

The argument upon the first question is derived not only from the principles
and practice
of that country from whence we derive many of
the principles of our political institutions, but
from the constitution and laws of the United
States.<p>

This is the Supreme Court, and by reason of
its supremacy must have the superintendenee of
the inferior tribunals and officers, whether judicial or ministerial. In this
respect there is no
differenee between a judicial and a ministerial
officer. From this principle alone the court of
king's bench in England derives the power of
issuing the writs of mandamus and prohibition.
3. Inst. 70, 71. Shall it be said that the
court of king's bench has this power in consequence of its being the Supreme
Court of judicature, and shall we deny it to this court which
the constitution makes the Supreme Court? It
is a beneficial, and a necessary power; and it
can never be applied where there is another
adequate, specilic, legal remedy.<p>

The second section of the third article of the
constitution gives this court appellate jurisdiction in all cases in law and
equity arising under the constitution and laws of the United
States, (except the cases in which it has original jurisdiction,) with such
exceptions, and under such regulations, as congress shall make.
The term "appellate jurisdietion" is to be taken
in its largest sense, and implies in its nature
the right of superintending the inferior tribunals.<p>

Proceedings in nature of appeals are of various kinds, according to the
subject matter. 3 Bl. Com. 402. It is a settled and invariable principle, that
every right, when withheld, must have
a remedy, and every injury, its proper redress.
3 Bl. Com. 109. There are some injuries which
can only be redressed by a writ of mandamus
and others by a writ of prohibition. There
must, then, be a jurisdiction somewhere competent to issue that kind of
process. Where are
we to look for it but in that court which the
constitution and laws have made supreme, and
to which they have given appellate jurisdiction?
Blackstone, vol. 3, p. 110, says that a writ ot
mandamus is "a command issuing in the king's
name from the court of king's beneh, and directed to any person, corporation or
inferior court requiring them to do some particular
thing therein specified, which appertains to
their office and duty, and which the court has
previously determined, or at least supposes, to
be consonant to right and justice. It is a writ
of a most extensively remedial nature, and isues in all cases where the party
has a right to have any thing done, and has no other specific
means of compelling its performance."<p>

In the <i>Federalist</i>, vol. 2, p. 239, it is said, that
the word "appellate" is not to be taken in its
technical sense, as used in reference to appeal in the course of the civil law,
but in its
broadest sense, in which it denotes nothing
more than the power of one tribunal to review
the proceedings of another, either as to
law or fact, or both. The writ of mandamus
is in the nature of an appeal as to fact as
well as law. It is competent for congress to
prescribe the forms of process by which the Supreme Court shall exercise its
appellate jurisdiction, and they may well declare a mandamus to
be one. But the power does not depend upon
implication alone. It has been recognized by
legislative provision as well as in judicial decisions in this court.<p>

Congress, by a law passed at the very first
session after the adoption of the constitution,
vol. 1, p. 68, s. 13, have expressly given the Supreme Court the power of
issuing writs of mandamus. The words are, "the Supreme Court
shall also have appellate jurisdietion from the
circuit conrts, and courts of the several states,
in the cases hereinafter specially provided for;
and shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts,
when proceeding as
courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and
writs of mandamus, in cases
warranted by
the principles and usages of law, to any courts
appointed, or persons holding office, under the
authority of the United States.<p>

Congress is not restrained from conferring
original jurisdiction in other cases than those
mentioned in the constitution. 2 Dal. Rep. 298.<p>

This court has entertained jurisdiction on a
mandarmus in one case, and on a prohibition in
another. In the case of <i>The United States v.
Judge Lawrence,</i> 3 Dal. Rep. 42, a mandamus
was moved for by the attorney general at the instance
of the French minister, to
compel Judge
Lawrence to issue a warrant against Captain
Barre, commander of the French ship of war
Le Perdrix, grounded on an article of the consular convention with France. In
this case the
power of the court to issue writs of mandamus
was taken for granted in the arguments of
counsel on both sides, and seems to have been so
considered by the court. The mandamus was
refused, because the case in which it was required was not a proper one to
support the motion. In the case of <i>The United States v. Judge
Peters</i>, a writ of prohibition was granted. 3
Dal. Rep. 121, 129. This was the celebrated
case of the French corvette the Cassius,
which afterwards became a subject of diplomatic controversy between the two
nations. On the
5th Feb. 1794, a motion was made to the Supreme
Court, in behalf of one John Chandler, a citizen of Connecticut, for a mandamus
to the secretary of war, commanding him to place Chanler on the invalid
pension list. After argument,
the court refused the mandamus, because the
two acts of congress respecting invalids did not
support the case on which the applicant grounded his motion. The case of
<i>The United State v. Hopkins,</i> at February term,
1794, was a motion for a mandamus to Hopkins, loan officer for
the district of Virginia, to command him to admit a person to subscribe to
the United States' loan. Upon argument, the mandamus was refused because the
applicant had not sufficiently
established his title. In none of these cases
nor in any other, was the powrer of the court
to issue a mandamus ever denied. Hence it
appears there has been a legislative construction of the constitution upon this
point and a
judicial practice under it, for the whole time
since the formation of the government.<p>

2d. The second point is, can a mandamus go
to a secretary of state in any case? It certainly
cannot in all cases; nor to the president in any
case. It may not be proper to mention this
position; but I am compelled to do it. An idea
has gone forth, that a mandamus to a secretary
of state is equivalent to a mandamus to the
President of the United States. I declare it to
be my opinion, grounded on a comprehensive
review of the subjeet, that the president is not
amenable to any court of judicature for the
exercise of his high functional, but is responsible only in the mode pointed
out in the constitution. The secretary of state acts, as before
observed, in two capacities. As the agent of
the president, he is not liable to a mandamus;
but as a recorder of the laws of the United
States, as keeper of the Great Seal, as recorder
of deeds of land, of letters patent, and of commissions, &c., he is a
ministerial officer of the
people of the United States. As such he has
duties assigned him by law, in the execution of
which he is independent of all control but that
of the laws. It is true he is a higH officer, but
he is not above law. It is not consistent with
the policy of our political inititutions, or the
manners of the citizens of the United States,
that any ministerial officer having public duties
to perform, shouid be above the compulsion of law in the exercise of those
duties.
As a ministerial officer he is compellable to do
his duty, and if he refuses, he is liable to indictment. A prosecution of this
kind might
be the means of punishing the officer, but a
specific civil remedy to the injured party can
only be obtained by a writ of mandamus. If a
mandamus can be awarded by this court in any
case, it may issue to a secretary of state; for
the act of congress expressly gives the power to
award it, "in cases warranted by the principles
and usuages of law, to any persons holding
offices under the authority of the United
States."<p>

Many cases may be supposed, in which a
secretary of state ought to be compelled to perform his duty speeifically. By
the 5th and 6th
sections of the act of congress, vol. 1, p. 43,
copies under seal of the office of the department
of state are made evidenee in courts of law, and
fees are given for making them out. The intention of the law must have been,
that every
person needing a copy should be entitled to it.
Suppose the secretary refuses to give a copy;
ought he not to be compelled? Suppose I am
entitled to a patent for Iands purchased of the
United States; it is made out and signed by the
president, who gives a warrant to the secretary
to affix the great seal to the patent; he refuses
to do it; shall I not have a mandamus to compel him? Suppose the seal is
affixed, but the
secretary refuses to record it; shall he not be
compelled? Suppose it recorded, and he refuses to deliver it; shall I have no
remedy?<p>

In this respeet there is no differenee between
a patent for lands, and the commission of a
judicial officer. The duty of the secretary is
precisely the same.<p>

Judge Paterson inquired of Mr. Lee whether
he understood it to be the duty of tho secretary
to deliver a commission, unless ordered to do so
by the president.<p>

Mr. Lee replied, that after the president has
signed a commission for an office not held at
his will, and it comes to the Secretary to be
sealed, the president has done with it, and
nothing remains, but that the secretary perform
those ministerial acts which the law imposes
upon him. It immediately becomes his duty
to seal, record, and deliver it on demand. ln such a case the appointment
becomes complete by the signing and sealing; and the
secretary does wrong if he withbolds the commission.<p>

3d. The third point is, whether, in the present case, a writ of mandamus ought
to be awarded to James Madison, secretary of state.<p>

The justices of the peace in the District of
Columbia are judicial officers, and hold their
office for five years. The office is established by
the act of congress passed the 27th of February, 1801, entitled "An act
concerning the District of Columbia," c. 86, s. 11 and 14, p. 271,
273. They are authorized to hold courts, and
have cognizance of personal demands of the
value of 20 dollars. The act of May 3d, 1802,
c. 52, s. 4, considers them as judicial officers
and provides the mode in which execution shall
issue upon their judgments. They hold their
offices independent of the will of the president.
The appointment of such an officer is complete
when the president has nominated him to the
senate, and the senate having advised and consented, and the president has
signed the commission, and delivered it to the secretary to be
sealed. The president has then done with it;
it becomes irrevocable. An appointment of a
judge once completed, is made forever. He holds
under the constitution. The requisites to be performed by the secretary are
ministerial, ascertained by law, and he has no discretion, but
must perform them; there is no dispensing power. In contemplation of law
they are as if done.<p>

These justices exercise part of the judicial
power of the United States. They ought, therefore, to be independent. Mr.
Lee begged leave
again to refer to the Federalist, vol. 2, Nos. 78
and 79, as containing a correct view of his subject. They contained
observations and ideas
which he wished might be generally read and
understood. They contained the principles upon
which this branch of our constitution was
constructed. It is important to the citizens of
this district that the justices should be independent; almost all the
authority immediately
exercised over them is that of the justices.
Tbey wish to know whether the justices of this
district are to hold their commissions at the
will of a secretary of stnte. This cause
may seem trivial at first view, but it is important in principle. It is for
this reason that
this court is now troubled with it. The emoluments, or the dignity of the
office, are no objects with the applicants. They conceive themselves to be duly
appointed justices of the peace
and they believe it to be their duty to maintain
the rights of their office, and not to suffer them
to be violated by the hand of power. The citizens of this district have their
fears excited by
every streteh of power by a person so high in office as the secretary of
state.<p>

It only remains now to consider whether a
mandamus, to compel the delivery of a commission by a puplic ministerial
officer, is one of
"the cases warranted by the principles and
usages of law."<p>

It is the generaI principle of law that a mandarmus lies, if there be no other
adequate, specific, legal remedy. 3 Burr. 1267. <i>King v.
Barker at al</i>. This seems to be the result of a
view of all cases on the subject.<p>

The case of <i>Rex v. Borough of Midhurst,</i> 1
Wils. 283, was a mandamus to compel the presentment
of certain conveyances to purchasers
of burgage tenements, whereby they would be
entitled to vote for members of parliament. In
the case of <i>Rex v. Hay,</i> 1 W. Bl. Rep. 640,
a mandamus issued to admit one to administer
an estate.<p>

A mandamus gives no right, but only puts the
party in a way to try his right. Sid. 286.<p>

It lies to compel a ministerial act which concerns the public; 1 Wils. 283. 1
Bl. Rep. 640;
although there be a more tedious remedy. Str.
1082. 4 Burr. 2188. 2 Burr. 1046. So if there
be a legal right, and a remedy in equity. 3
Term Rep. 652. A mandamus lies to obtain admission into a trading company.
<i>Rex. v. Turkey Company,</i> 2 Burr. 1000. Carth. 448. 5 Mod.
402. So it lies to put the corporate seal to an
instrument. 4 Term Rep. 699. To commissioners of the excise to grant a permit.
2 Term
Rep. 381. To admit to an office. 3 Term Rep.
675. To deliver papers which concern the public. 2 Sid. 31. A mandamus will
sometimes
lie in a doubtful case, I Lev. 113, to be
further considered on the return. 2 Lev. 14. 1
Sid. 169.<p>

It lies to be admitted a member of a church.
3 Burr. 1265, 1043.<p>

The process is as ancient as the time of Edw.
II. 1 Lev. 23.<p>

The first writ of mandamus is not peremptory,
it only commands the officer to do the thing
or show cause why he should not do it. If the
cause returned be sufficient, there is an end of
the proceeding; if not, a peremptory mandamus
is then ordered.<p>

It is said to be a writ of discretion. But the
discretion of a court always means a sound, legal discretion, not an arbitrary
will. If the
applicant makes out a proper case, the courts
are bound to grant it. They can refuse justice
to no man.<p>

On a subsequent day, and before the court
had given an opinion, Mr. Lee read the affidavit
of Hazen Kimball, who had been a clerk in the
office of the Secretary of State, and had been to
a distant part of the United States, but whose
return was not known to the applicant till after
the argument of the case.<p>

It stated that on the third of Mnreh, 1801, he
was a clerk in the department of state. That
there were in the office, on that day, commissions made out and signed by the
president, appointing William Marbury a justice of peace
for the county of Washington; and Robert T.
Hooe a justice of the peace for the county of
Alexandria, in the District of Columbia.<p>

Afterwards, on the 24th February, the following opinion of the Court was
delivered by the <i>Chief Justice.</i><p>

<h3>Opinion of the court.</h3>

At the last term on the affidavits then read
and filed with the clerk, a rule was granted in
this case, requiring the secretary of state to
show cause why a mandamus should not
issue, directing him to deliver to William Marbury his commission as a justice
of the peace
for the county of Wasnlngton, in the District of
Columbia.<p>

No cause has been shown, and the present
motion is for a mandamus. The peculiar delicacy of this case, the novelty of
some of its circumstances, and the real difficulty attending the
points which occur in it require a complete exposition of the principles on
which the opinion
to be given by the court is founded.<p>

These principles have been, on the side of the
applicant very ably argued at the bar. In rendering the opinion of the court,
there will be some departure in form, though not in subtance, from the points
stated in that argument.<p>

In the order in which the court has viewed
this subject, the following questions have been
considered and decided.<p>

1st. Has the applicant a right to the commision he demands?<p>

2d. If he has a right, and that right has been
violated, do the laws of his country afford him
a remedy?<p>

3d. If they do afford him a remedy, is it a
mandamus issuing from this court?<p>

The first object of inquiry is,<p>

1st. Has the applicant a right to the commission he demands?<p>

His right originates in an act of congress
passed in February, 1801, coneerning tha District of Columbia.<p>

After dividing the district into two counties,
the 11th section of this law enacts, "tbat there
shall be appointed in and for each of the said
counties, such number of discreet persons to be
justices of the peace as the president of the
United States shall, from time to time, think
expedient, to continue in office for five years.<p>

It appears, from the addavits, that
in compliance with this law, a commission for
William Marbury, as a justice of the peace for
the county of Washington, was signed by John
Adams, then President of the United States;
after which the seal of the United States was
affixed to it; but the commission has never
reached the person for whom it was made out.<p>

In order to determine whether he is entitled
to this commission, it becomes necessary to inquire whether he has been
nppointed to the office. For if he has been appointed, the law continues him in
office for five years, and he is entitled to the possession of those evidences
of office, which, being completed, become his property.<p>

The 2d section of the 2d article of the constitution declares that "the
President shall
nominate, and, by and with the advice and
consent of the senate shall appoint, ambassadors, other public ministers and
consuls, and all
other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise
provided for."<p>

The 3d section declares, that "he shall commission all the officers
of the United States."<p>

An act of congress directs the secretary of
state to keep the seal of the United States, "to
make out and record, and affix the said seal to
all civil commissions to officers of the United
States, to be appointed by the president, by and
with the consent of the senate, or by the president alone; provided, that the
said seal shall
not be affixed to any commission before the
same shall have been signed by the President of
the United States."<p>

These are the clauses of the constitution and
laws of the United States, which affect this part
of the case. They seem to contemplate three
distinct operations:<p>

1st. The nomination. This is the sole act of
the president, and is completely voluntary.<p>

2d. The appointment. This is also the act of
the president, and is also a voluntary act,
though it can only be performed by and with
the advice and consent of the senate.<p>

3d. The commission. To grant a
commission to a person appointed, might, perhaps, be deemed a duty enjoined by
the constitution. "He shall," says that instrument,
"commission all the officers of the United
States."<p>

The acts of appointing to office, aud commissioning the person appointed, can
scarcely be considered as one and the same; sinee the power
to perform them is given in two separate and
distinct sections of the constitution. The distinction between the appointment
and the commission will be rendered more apparent by
averting to that provision in the second section
of the second article of the constitution, which
authorizes congress "to vest, by law, the appointment of such inferior
officers,
as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of
law, or in the heads of departments;" thus contemplating cases where the law
may direct the
president to commission an officer appointed by
the courts, or by the heads of departments. ln
such a case, to issue a commission would be
apparently a duty distinct from the appointment, the performanee of which,
perhaps, could not legally be refused.<p>

Although that clause of the constitution
which requires the president to commission all
the officers of the United States, may never
have been applied to officers appointed otherwise than by himself, yet it would
be diffilcult to deny the legislative power to apply it to such
cases. Of consequence, the constitutional distinction between the appointment
to an office and the commission of an officer who has been
appointed, remains the same as if in practice
the president had commissioned officers appointed by an authority other than
his own.<p>

It follows, too, from the existenee of this distinction, that if an appointment
was to be evidenced by any public act, other than the commission, the
performance of such public act would create the officer;
and if he was not removable at the will of the president, would
either give him a right to his commission, or
enable him to perform the duties without it.<p>

These observations are premised solely for the
purpose of rendering more intelligible those
which apply more directly to the particular
case under consideration.<p>

This is an appointment made by the
President, by and with the advice and consent
of the senate, and is evidenced by no act but
the commission itself. In such a case, therefore, the commission and the
appointment seem
inseparable, it being almost impossible to show
an appointment otherwise than by proving the
existence of a commission; still the commission
is not necessarily the appointment, though conclusive evidence of it.<p>

But at what stage does it amount to this conclusive evidence?<p>

The answer to this question seems an obvious
one. The appointment being the sole act of the
President, must be completely evidenced, when
it is shown that he has done everything to be
performed by him.<p>

Should the commission, instead of being evidence of an appointment, even be
considered as
constituting the appointment itself; still it
would be made when the last act to be done by
the president was performed, or, at furthest,
when the commission was complete.<p>

The last act to be done by the president is
the signature of the commission. He has then
acted on the advice and consent of the senate to
his own nomination. The time for deliberation
has then passed. He has decided. His judgment, on the advice and consent of the
senate
coneurring with his nomination, has been made
and the officer is appointed. This appointment
is evidenced by an open, unequivocal act; and
being the last act required from the person making it, necessarily excludes the
idea of its being
so far as respects the appointment, an inchoate
and incomplete transaction.<p>

Some point of time must be taken when the
power of the executive over an officer, not removable at his will, must cease.
That point of tme must be wben the constitutional power
of appoinitment has been exercised. And this
power has been exercised when the last act, required from the person possessing
the power,
has been performed. This last act is the signature of the commission. This idea
seems to have
prevailed with the legislature, when the
act passed converting the department of
foreign affairs into the department of state.
By this act it is enacted, that the secretary of
state shall keep the seal of the United States,
"and shall make out and record, and shall affix the said seal to all civil
commissions to officers of the United States, to be appointed by
the President;" "Provided, that the said seal
shall not be affixed to any commission before
the same shall have been signed by thr President of the United States; nor
to any other instrument or act, without the special warrant
of the president therefor."<p>

The signature is a warrant for affixing the
great seal to the commission: and the great seal
is only to he affixed to an instrument which is
complete. It attests, by an act supposed to be
of public notoriety, the verity of the presidential
signature.<p>

It is never to be affixed till the commission is
signed, because the signature, which gives force
and effect to the commission, is conclusive evidence that the appointment is
made.<p>

The commission being signed, the subsequent
duty of the secretary of state is prescribed by
law, and not to be guided by the will of the
president. He is to affix the senl of the United
States to the commission, and is to record it.<p>

This is not a proceeding which may be varied,
if the judgment of the executive shall suggest
one more eligible; but is a precise course as
acurately marked out by law, and is to be strictly pursued. It is the duty of
the secretary
of state to conform to the law, and in this he is
nn officer of the United States, bound to obey
the laws. He acts, in this respect, as has been
very properly stated at the bar, under the authority of law, and not by the
instructions of
the president. It is a ministerial act which the
law enjoins on a particular officer for a particular purpose.<p>

If it should be supposed, that the solemnity
of affixing the seal is necessary not only to the
validity of the commission, but even to the
completion of an appointment, still when the
seal is affixed the appointment is made, and
the commission is valid. No other
solemnity is required by law; no other act is to
be performed on the part of the government.
All that the executive can do to invest tho person with his office is done; and
unless the appointment be then made, the executive cannot
make one without the co-operation of others.<p>

After searching anxiously for the principles
on which a contrary opinion may be supported,
none have been found wbich appear of sufficient force to maintain the opposite
doctrine.<p>

Such as the imagination of the court could
suggest, have been very deliberately examined,
and after allowing them all the weight which
it appears possible to give them, they do not
shake the opinion which has been formed.<p>

In considering this question, it has been conjectured that the commission may
have been
assimilated to a deed, to the validity of which
delivery is essential.<p>

This idea is founded on the supposition that
the commission is not merely evidence of an
appointment, but is itself the actual appointment; a supposition by no means
unquestionable. But for the purpose of examining this
objection fairly, let it be conceded, that the
principle claimed for its support is established.<p>

The appointment being, under the constitution, to be made by the president
personally,
the delivery of the deed of appointment, if necessary to its completion, must
be made by the president also. It is not necessary that the
delivery should be made personally to the
grantee of the office; it never is so made. The
law would seem to contemplate that it should
be made to the Secretary of State since it directs the secretary to affix the
seal to the commission after it shall have been signed by the
President. If, then, the act of delivery be necessary to give validity to the
commission, it has
been delivered when executed and given to the
Secretary for the purpose of being sealed, recorded, and transmitted to the
party.<p>

But In all cases of letters patent, certain
solemnities are required by law, which solemnities are the evidenee of
the validity of
the instrument. A formal delivery to the person is not among them. In cases of
commissions, the sign manual of the President, and the
seal of the United States, are those solemnities.
This objection, therefore, doee not touch the
case.<p>

It has also occurred as possible, and barely
possible, that the transmission of the commission, and the acceptance thereof,
might be deemed necessary to complete the right of the
plaintiff.<p>

The transmission of the commission is a practice directed by convenience, but
not by law. It
cannot, therefore, be necessary to constitute
the appointment which must precede it, and
which is the mere act of the President. If the
executive required that every person appointed
to an office should himself take means to procure his commission, the
appointment would
not be the less valid on that account. The appointment is the sole act of the
President; the
transmission of the commission is the sole act
of the officer to whom that duty is assigned, and
may be accelerated or retarded by circumstances which can have no influenee on
the appointment. A commission is transmitted to a
person already appointed; not to a person to be
appointed or not, as the letter enclosing the
commission should happen to get into the post
office and reach him in safety, or to miscarry.<p>

It may have some tendeney to elucidate this
point, to inqulre whether the possession of the
original commission be indispensably necessary
to authorize a person, appointed to any office, to
perform the duties of that office. If it was necessary, then a loss of the
commission would
lose the office. Not only negligenee, but accident or fraud, fire or theft,
might deprive an
individual of his office. ln such a case, I presume it could not be doubted but
that a copy from the record of the office of the Secretary of
State would be, to every intent and purpose,
equal to the original. The act of congress has
expressly made it so. To give that copy validity, it would not be neeessary to
prove that the original had been transmitted and afterwards
Iost. The copy would be complete evidence
that the original had existed and that the appointment had been made, but not
that the original had been transmitted. If indeed it
should appear that the original had
been mislaid in the office of state, that circumstance would not affect the
operation of the
copy. When all the requisites have been performed which authorize a recording
officer to
record any instrument whatever, and the order
for that purpose has been given, the instrument
is, in law, considered as recorded, although the
manual labor of inserting it in a book kept for
that purpose may not have been performed.<p>

In the case of commissions, the law orders the
Secretary of State to record them. When, therefore, they are signed and sealed,
the order for
their being recorded is given; and whether inserted in the book or not, they
are in law recorded.<p>

A copy of this record is declared equal to the
original, and the fees to be paid by a person requiring a copy are ascertained
by law. Can a keeper of a public record erase therefrom a commission which has
been recorded? Or can he
refuse a copy thereof to a person demanding it
on the terms prescribed by law?<p>

Such a copy would, equally with the original,
authorize the justice of peace to proceed in the
performance of his duty, because it would,
equally with the original, attest his appointment.<p>

lf the transmission of a commission be not
considered as necessary to give va]idity to an appointment, still less is its
acceptance. The
appointment is the sole act of the President; the
acceptanee is the sole act of the officer, and he,
in plain common sense, posterior to the appointment. As
he may resign, so may he refuse to
accept, but neither the one nor the other is
capable of rendering the appointment a non-entity.<p>

That this is the understanding of the government, is apparent from the whole
tenor of its conduct.<p>

A commission bears date, and the salary of
the officer commences, from the appointment;
not from the transmission or acceptance of his commission. When a person
appointed to any
office refuses to accept that office, the sucessor
is nominated in the place of the percon who
has declined to accept, and not in the
place of the person who had been previously in
office, and had created the original vacancy.<p>

It is, therefore, decidedly the opinion of the
court, that when a commission has been signed
by the President the appointment is made; and
that the commission is complete when the seal
of the United States hs been affixed to it by
the Secretary of State.<p>

Where an officer is removable at the will of
the executive, the circumstance which completes his appointment is of no
concern; because the act is at any time revocable, and the
commission may be arrested, if still in the office.
But when the officer is not removable at the
will of the executive, the appointment is not
revocable, and cannot be annulled. It has conferred legal rights which cannot
be resumed.<p>

The discretion of the executive is to be exercised until the appointment has
been made.
But having once made the appointment, his
power over the office is terminated in all cases
where by law the officer is not removable by
him. The right to the office is then in the person appointed, and he has the
absolute, unconditiona] power of accepting or rejecting it.<p>

Mr. Marbury, then, since his commission was
signed by the President, and sealed by the Secretary of State, was appointed;
and as the law
creating the office, gave the officer a right to hold for five years,
independent of the executive, the appointment was not revocable, but
vested in the officer legal rights, which are protected by the laws of his
country.<p>

To withhold his commission, therefore, is an
act deemed by the court not warranted by law,
but violative of a vested legal right.<p>

This brings us to the second inquiry; which<p>

2d. If he has a right, and that right has been
violated, do the laws of this country afford him
a remedy?<p>

The very essenee of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every
individual
to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he
receives an injury. One of the first duties of
government is to afford that protection. ln
Great Britain the king himself is sued in the
respectful form of a petition, and he never fails
to comply with the judgment of his court.<p>

In the 3d vol. of his Commentaries, p. 23,
Blackstone states two cases in which a remedy
is afforded by mere operation of law.<p>

"In all other cases," he says, "it is a general
and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal
remedy by suit,
or action at law, whenever that right is invaded."<p>

And afterwards, p. 109, of the same vol. he
says, "I am next to consider such injuries as
are cognizable by the courts of the common law.
And herein I shall for the present only remark,
that all possible injuries whatsoever, that did
not fall within the exclusive cognizance of
either the ecclesiastical, military, or maritime
tribunals, are, for that very reanon, within the
cognizance of the common law courts of justice; for it is a settled and
invariable principle
in the laws of England, that every right, when
withheld, must have a remedy, and every injury its proper redress."<p>

The government of the United States has
been emphatically termed a government of laws,
and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if
the laws furnish
no remedy for the violation of a vested legal
right.<p>

If this obloquy is to be cast on the jurisprudence of our country, it must
arise from the peculiar eharacter of the case.<p>

It behooves us, then, to inquire whether there
be in its composition any ingredient which shall
exempt it from legal investigations, or exclude
the injured party from legal redress. In pursuing this inquiry the first
question which presents itself is, whether this can be arranged
with that class of cases which come
under the description of <i>damnum absque injuria;</i>
a loss without an injury.<p>

This descriptien of cases never has been considered, and it is believed never
can be considered, as comprehending offices of trust, of honor,
or of profit. The office of justice of peace in the
District of Columbia is such an office; it is
therefore worthy of the attention and guardianship of the laws. It has
received that attention and guardianship. It has been created by special act of
congress, and has been secured, so
far as the laws can give security, to the person
appointed to fill it, for five years. It is not,
then, on account of the worthlessness of the
thing pursued, that the injured party can be alleged to be without remedy.<p>

Is it in the nature of the transaction? Is the
act of delivering or withholding a commission
to be considered as a mere political act, belonging to the executive department
alone, for the
performanee of which entire confidence is
placed by our constitution in the supreme executive; and for any misconduct
respecting which, the injured individual has no remedy?<p>

That there may be such cases is not to be
questioned; but that every act of duty, to be
performed in any of the great departments of
government, constitutes such a case, is not to be
admitted.<p>

By the act concerning invalids, passed in
June, 1704, vol. 3, p. 112, the Secretary of War
is ordered to place on the pension list all persons whose names are contained
in a report previously made by him to congress. If he should
refuse to do so, would the wounded veteran be
without remedy? Is it to be contended that
where the law in precise term, directs the performance of an act, in which an
individual is interested, the law is incapable of securing obedience to its
mandate? Is it on account of the
character of the person against whom the complaint is made? Is it to be
contended that the heads of departments are not amenable to the
laws of their country?<p>

Whatever the practice on particular occasions may be, the theory of this
principle will
certainly never be maintained. No act
of the legislature confers so extraordinary a
privilege, nor can it derive countenance from
the doctrines of the common law. After stating that personal injury from the
king to a subject is presumed to be impossible, Blackstone,
vol. 3, p. 265, says, "but injuries to the rights
of property can scarcely be committed by the
crown without the intervention of its officers;
for whom the law, in matters of right, entertains no respect or delicacy; but
furnishes various methods of detecting the errors and misconduct of those
agents, by whom the king has been deceived and induced to do a temporary
injustice."<p>

By the act passed in 1796, authorizing the
sale of the lands above the mouth of
Kentucky river, (vol. 3, p. 299,) the purchaser, on paying
his purchase money, becomes completely entitled
to the property purchased, and on producing
to the Secretary of State the receipt of the
treasurer upon a certificate required by the
law, the President of the United States is authorized to grant him a patent. It
is further
enacted that all patents shall be countersigned
by the Secretary of State, and recorded in his
office. If the Secretary of State should choose
to withhold this patent; or, the patent being
lost, should refuse a copy of it; can it be imagined that the law furnishes to
the injured person no remedy?<p>

It is not believed that any person whatever
would attempt to maintain such a proposition.
It follows then, that the question, whether
the legality of an act of the head of a department be examinable in a court
of justice or not,
must always depend on the nature of that act.<p>

If some acts be examimable, and others not,
there must be some rule of law to guide the
court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<p>

In some instances there may be difficulty in
applying the rule to particular enses; but there
cannot, it is believed, be much difficulty in laying down the rule.<p>

By the constitution of the United States, the
President is invested with certain important politcal powers in the
exercise of which
he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in
his political character
and to his own conscience. To aid him in the
performance of these duties, he is authorized to
appoint certain officers, who act by his authority, and in conformity with
his orders.<p>

In such cases, their acts are his acts; and
whatever opinion may be entertained of the
manner in which executive discretion may be
used, still there exists, and can exist, no power
to control that discretion. The subjects are political. They respect the
nation, not individual
rights, and being intrusted to the executive, the
decision of the executive is conclusive. The application of this remark will be
perceived by
adverting to the act of congress for establishing
the department of foreign affairs. This officer,
as his duties were prescribed by that act, is to
conform precisely to the will of the President.
He is the mere organ by whom that will is communicated. The acts of such an
officer, as an officer, can never be examinable by the courts.<p>

But when the legislature proceeds to impose
on that officer other duties; when he is directed
peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the
rights of individuals are dependent on the performance of those acts; he is so
far the officer
of the law; is amenable to the laws for his conduct; and cannot at his
discretion sport away the vested rights of others.<p>

The conclusion from this reasoning is, that
where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the
executive,
merely to execute the will of the President, or
rather to act in cases in which the executive
possesses a constitutional or legal discretion,
nothing can be more perfectly clear than that
their acts are only politically examinable. But
where a specific duty is assigned by laws and
individual rights depend upon the performance
of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself
injured, has a
right to resort to the laws of his country for a
remedy.<p>

If this be the rule, let us inquire how it applies to the case under the
consideration of the
court.<p>

The power of nominating to the senate, and the power of appointing the person
nominated, are political powers, to be exercised
by the President according to his own discretion.
When he has made an appointment, he has exercised his whole power, and his
discretion has
been completely applied to the case. If, by law,
the officer be removable at the will of the President, then a new appointment
may be immediately made, and the rights of the officer are
terminated. But as a fact which has existed
cannot be made never to have existed, the appointment
cannot be annillilated; and consequently, if the officer is by law not
removable at the will of the President, the rights he has aquired are
protected by the law, and are not resumable
by the President. They can not be
extinguished by executive authority, and he has
the privilege of asserting them in like manner
as if they had been derived from any other
source.<p>

The question whether a right has vested or
not, is, on its nature, judicial, and must be tried
by the judicia authority. If, for example, Mr.
Marbury had taken the oaths of a magistrate,
and proceeded to act as one; in consequence of
which a suit had been instituted against him, in
which his defence had depended on his being a
magistrate, the validity of his appointment
must have been determined by judicial authority.<p>

So, if he conceives that, by virtue of his appointment, he has a legal right
either to the
commission which has been made out for him,
or to a copy of that commission, it is equally a
question examinable in a court, and the decision
of the court upon it must depend on the opinion entertained of his
appoiniment.<p>

That question has been discussed, and the
opinion is, that the latest point of time which
can be taken as that at which the appointment
wns complete and evidenced, was when, after
the signature of the President, the seal of the
United States was affixed to the commission.<p>

It is, then, the opinion of the Court,<p>

1st. That by signing the commission of Mr.
Marbury, the President of the United States appointed him a justice of peace
for the county of Washington, in the District of
Columbia; and that the seal of the United
States, affixed thereto by the Secretary of State,
is conclusive testimony of the verity of the signature, and of the completion
of the appointment, and that the anpointment conferred on
him a legal right to the office for the space of
five years.<p>

2d. That, having this legal title to the office,
he has a consequent right to the commission; a
refusal to deliver which is a plain violation of
that right, for which the laws of his country
afford him a remedy.<p>

It remains to be inquired whether,<p>

3d He is entitled to the remedy for which he
applies. This depends on,<p>

1st. The nature of the writ applied for; and,<p>

2d. The power of this court.<p>

1st. The nature of the writ.<p>

Blackstone, in the 3d volume of his Commentaries, page 110, defines a
mandamus to be
"a command issuing in the king's name from
the court of king's bench, and directed to any
person, corporation, or inferior court of judicature within the king's
dominions, requiring
them to do some particular thing therein specified, which appertains to their
office and duty,
and which the court of king's bench has previously determined, or at least
supposes, to be
consonant to right and justice."<p>

Lord Mansfield, in 3 Burrow, 1266, in the
case of <i>The King v. Baker et al.,</i> states, with
much precision and explicitness, the cases in
which this writ may be used.<p>

"Whenever," says that very able judge "there
is a right to execute an office, perform a service,
or exerecise a franchise, (more especiallv if it be
in a matter of public concern, or attended with
profit,) and a person is kept out of possession,
or dispossessed or such right, and has
no other specific legal remedy, this court ought
to assist by mandamus, upon reasons of justice,
as the writ expresses, and upon reasons of public policy, to preserve peace,
order and good government." In the same case he says, "this writ
ought to be used upon all occasions where the
law has established no specific remedy, and
where in justice and good government there
ought to be one."<p>

In addition to the authorities now particularly cited, many others were relied
on at the
bar, which show how far the practice has conformed to the general doctrines
that have been just quoted.<p>

This writ, if awarded, would be directed to
an officer of government, and its mandate to
him would be to use the worda of Blackstone,
"to do a particular thing therein specified,
which appertains to his office and duty, and
which the court has previously determined, or
at least supposes, to be consonant to right and
justice." Or, in the words of Lord Mansfield,
the applicant, in this case, has a right to execute an office of public
concern, and is kept out of possession of that right.<p>

These circumstances certainly concur in this case.<p>

Still, to render the mandamus a proper remedy, the other to whom it is to be
directed, must be one to whom, on legal principles, such
writ may be directed, and the person applying
for it must be without any other specific and
legal remedy.<p>

1st. With respect to the officer to whom it
would be directed. The intimate political relation subsisting between the
President of the
United States and the heads of departments,
necessarily renders any legal investigation of
the acts of one of those high officers peculiarly
irksome, as well as delicate; and excites some
hesitation with respect to the propriety of entering into full investigation.
Impressions are
often received without much reflection or examination, and it is not wonderful
that in such a
case as this the assertion, by an individual, of
his legal claims in a court of justice, to which
claims it is the duty of that court to attend,
should at first view be considered by
some, as an attempt to intrude into the cabinet
and to intermeddle with the prerogatives of the
executive.<p>

It is scarcely necessary for the court to disclaim all pretensions to such
jurisdiction. An
extravagance, so absurd and execssive, could
not have been entertained for a moment. The
province of the court is, solely, to decide on
the rights of individuals, not to inquire how
the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a
discretion. Questions
in their nature political, or which are, by the
constitution and laws, submitted to the executive, can never be made in this
court.<p>

But. if this be not such a question; if, so far
from being an intrusion into the secrets of the
cabinet, it respects a paper which, according to
law, is upon record, and to a copy of which
the law gives a right, on the payment of ten
cents; if it be no intermeddling with a subject
over which the executive can be considered as
having exercised any control; what is there in
the exalted station of the officer, which shall bar
a citizen from asserting, in a court of justice,
his legal rights, or shall forbid a court to listen
to the claim, or to issue a mandamus directing
the performance of a duty, not depending on
executive discretion, but on particular acts of
congress, and the general principles of law?<p>

If one of the heads of departments commits
any illegal act, under colour of his office, by
which an individual sustains an injury, it cannot be pretended that his office
alone exempts him from being sued in the ordinary mode of
proceeding, and being compelled to obey the
judgment of the law. How, then, can his office exempt him from this particular
mode of
deciding on the legality of his conduct if the
case be such a case as would, were any other
individual the party complained of, authorize
the process?<p>

It is not by the office of the person to whom
the writ is directed, but the nature of the thing
to be done, that the propriety or impropriety of
issuing a mandamus is to be determined.
Where the head of a department acts in a case,
in which executive discretion is to be exercised;
in which he is the mere organ of executive will,
it is again repeated, that any application to a court to control, in any
respect, his
conduct would be rejected without hesitation.<p>

But where he is directed by law to do a certain act affecting the absolute
rights of individuals, in the performance of which he is not
placed under the particular direction of the
President, and the performance of which the
President cannot lawfully forbid, and therefore
is never presumed to have forbidden; as for example, to record a commission or
a patent for
land, which has received all the legal solemnities, or to give a copy of such
record; in such
cases, it is not perceived on what ground the
courts of the country are farther excused from
the duty of giving judgment that right be done
to an injured individual, then if the same
services were to be performed by a person not
the head of a department.<p>

This opinion seems not now, for the first
time, to be taken up in this country.<p>

It must be well recollected that in 1792, an
act passed, directing the Secretary of War to
place on the pension list such disabled officers
and soldiers as should be reported to him, by
the district courts, which act, so far as the duty
was imposed on the courts, was deemed unconstitutional;
but some of the judges
thinking
that the law might be executed by them in the
character of commissioners, proceeded to act,
and to report in that character.<p>

This law being deemed unconstitutional at
the circuits, was repealed, and a different system was established; but the
question whether
those persons who have been reported by the
judges, as commissioners, were entitled, in consequence of that report, to be
placed on the pension list wvas a legal question, properly determinable in
the courts. although the act of
placing suceh persons on the list was to be performed by the head of a
department.<p>

That this question might be properly settled,
congress passed an act in February, 1793, making it the duty of the Secretary
of War, in conjunction with the attorney general, to take
such measures as might be necessary to obtain
an adjudication of the Supreme Court of the
United States on the validity of any
such rights, claimed under the act aforesaid.<p>

After the passage of this act, a mandamus
was moved for, to be directed to the Secretary
of War, commanding him to place on the pension list, a person stating himself
to be on the report of the judges.<p>

There is, therefore, much reason to believe,
that this mode of trying the legal right of the
complainant was deemed by the head of a department, and by the highest law
officer of the
United States, the most proper which could be
selected for the purpose.<p>

When the subject was brought before the
court, the decision was, not that a mandamus
would not lie to the head of a department directing hirn to perform an act,
enjoined by law,
in the performance of which an individual had
a vested interest; but that a mandamus ought
not to issue in that case; the decision necessarily to be made of the report of
the commissioners did not confer on the applicant a legal
right.<p>

The judgment, in that case, is understood to
have decided the merits of all claims of that
description; and the persons, on the report ot
the commissioners, found it necessary to pursue the mode prescribed by the law
subsequent
to that which had been deemed unconstitutional,
in order to place themselves on the pension list.<p>

The doctrine, therefore, now advanced, is by
no means a novel one.<p>

It is true that the mandamus, now moved for,
is not for the performance of an act expressly
enjoined by statute.<p>

It is to deliver a commission; on which subject the acts of congress are
silent. This difference is not considered as affecting the case.
It has already been stated that the applicant
has, to that commission, a vested legal right, of
which the executive cannot deprive him. He
has been appointed to an office, from which he
is not removable at the will of the executive;
and being so appointed, he has a right
to the commission which the secretary has received from the President for his
use. The act
of congress does not indeed order the Secretary
of State to send it to him, but it is placed in his
hands for the person entitled to it; and cannot
be more lawfully withheld by him than by any
other person.<p>

It was at first doubted whether the action of
<i>detinue</i> was not a specific legal remedy for the
commission which has been withheld from Mr.
Marbury; in which case a mandamus would be
improper. But this doubt has yielded to the
consideration that the judgment in <i>detinue</i> is
for the thing itself, or its value. The value of
a public office not to be sold is incapable of being ascertained. and the
applicant has a right
to the office itself, or to nothing. He will obtain the office by obtaining the
commission, or
a copy of it from the record.<p>

This, then, is a plain case for a mandamus
either to deliver the commission, or a copy of it
from the record; and it only remains to be inquired,<p>

Whether it can issue from this court.<p>

The act to establish the judicial courts of the
United States authorizes the Supreme Court to
issue writs of mandamus in cases warranted by
the principles and usages of law, to any courts
appointed, or persons holding office, under the
authority of the United States.<p>

The Secretary of State, being a person holding
an office under the authority of the United
States, is precisely within the letter of the description, and if this court is
not authorized to
issue a writ of mandamus to such an officer, it
must be because the law is unconstitutional, and
therefore absolutely incapable of conferring the
authority, and assigning the duties which its
words purport to confer and assign.<p>

The constitution vests the whole judicial
power of the United States in one Supreme
Court, and such inferior courts as congress
shall, from time to time, ordain and establish.
This power is expressly extended to all cases
arising under the laws of the United States;
and, consequently, in some form, may be exercised over the present case;
because the right claimed is given by a law of the United
States.<p>

In the distribution of this power it is declared that "the Supreme Court shall
have
original jurisdiction in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public
ministers and consuls,
and those in which a state shall be a party. In
all other cases, the Supreme Court shall have
appellate jurisdiction.<p>

It has been insisted, at the bar, that if the
original grant of jurisdiction, to the Supreme
and inferior courts, is general, and the clause,
assigning original jurisdiction to the Supreme
Court, contains no negative or restrictive words,
the power remains to the legislature, to assign
original jurisdiction to that court in other cases
than those specified in the article which has
been recited; provided those cases belong to the
judicial power of the United States.<p>

If it had been intended to leave it in the diseretion of the legislature to
apportion the judicial power between the supreme and inferior
courts according to the will of that body, it would certainly have been
useless to have proceeded further than to have defined the judicial
power, and the tribunals in which it should be
vested. The subsequent part of the section is
mere surplusage, is entirely without meaning,
if such is to be the construction. If congress
remains at liberty to give this court appellate
jurisdiction, where,the constitution has declared
their jurisdiction shall be original, and original
jurisdiction where the constitution has declared
it shall be appellale; the distribution of jurisdiction, made in the
constitution, is form without substance.<p>

Affirmative words are often, in their operation, negative of other objects
than those affirmed; and in this case, a negative or exclusive
sense must be given to them, or they have no
operation at all.<p>

It cannot be presumed that any clause in the
constitution is intended to be without effect;
and, therefore, such a construction is inadmissible unless the words require
it.<p>

If the solicitude of the convention,
respecting our peace with foreign powers, induced a provision that the
Supreme Court
should take original jurisdiction in cases which
might be supposed to affect them; yet the clause
would have proceeded no further than to provide for such cases, if no further
restriction on
the powers of congress had been intended.
That they should have appellate jurisdiction in
all other cases, with such exceptions as congress
might make, is no restriction; unless the words
be deemed exclusive of original jurisdiction.<p>

When an instrument organizing fundamentally a judicial system, divides it into
one supreme and so many inferior courts as the legislature
may ordain and establish; then enumerates its
powers, and proceeds so far to distribute them,
as to define the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court by declaring the cases in which it shall
take original jurisdiction, and that in others it
shall take appellate jurisdiction; the plain import of the words seems to be,
that in one class of cases its jurisdiction is original, and not appellate; in
the other it is appellate, and not
original. If any other construction would render the clause inoperative, that
is an additional
reason for rejecting such other construction
and for adhering to their obvious meaning.<p>

To enable this court, then, to issue a mandamus, it must be shown to be an
exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable
them to exercise appellate jurisdiction.<p>

It has been stated at the bar that the appellate jurisdiction may be exercised
in a variety of forms, and that if it be the
will of the legislature that a mandamus should be used for that
purpose, that will must be obeyed. This is
true, yet the jurisdiction must be appellate, not
original.<p>

It is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and
corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not
create that cause. Although, therefore, a mandamus may be directed to courts,
yet to issue
such a writ to an officer for the delivery of a
paper is in effect the same as to sustain an
original motion for that paper, and, therefore,
seems not to belong to appellate but to
original jurisdiction. Neither is it necessary in
such a case as this to enable the court to exercise its appellate
jurisdiction.<p>

The authority, therefore, given to the Supreme Court, by the act establishing
the judicial courts of the United States, to issue writs
of mandamus to public officers, appears not to be
warranted by the constitution and it becomes
necessary to inquire whether a jurisdiction so
conferred can be exercised.<p>

The question, whether an act, repugnant to
the constitutionc can become the law of the land
is a question deeply interesting to the United
States; but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. It
seems only necessary to recognize certain principles, supposed
to have been long and well established, to decide it.<p>

That the people have an originnl right to establish for their future
government, such principles, as, in their opinion, shall most conduce
to their own happiness is the basis on which the
whole American fabric has been erected. The
exercise of this original right is a very great exertion; nor can it, nor
ought it, to be frequently
repeated. The principles, therefore, so established, are deemed fundanmental.
And as the
authority from which they proceed is supreme,
and can seldom act, they are designed to be
permanent.<p>

This original and supreme will organizes the
government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It
may either
stop here, or establish certain limits not to be
transcended by those departments.<p>

The government of the United States is of
the latter description. The powers of the legislature are defined and limited,
and that those
limits may not he mistaken, or forgotten, the
constitution is written. To what purpose are
powers limited, and to what purpose is that
limitation committed to writing, if these limits
may, at any time, be passed by those intended
to be restrained? The distinction between a
government with limited and unlimited powers
is abolished, if those limits do not confine the
persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts
prohibited and acts allowed, are of
equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain
to be contested, that the constitution controls
any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the
legislature may alter the constitution by an
ordinary act.<p>

Between these alternatives there is no middle
ground. The constitution is either a superior
paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary
means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other
acts, is alterable
when the legislature shall please to alter it.<p>

If the former part of the alternative be true
then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if the latter
part be true, then
written constitutions are absurd attempts, on
the part of the people, to limit a power in its
own nature illimitable.<p>

Certainly all those who have framed written
constitutions contemplate them as forming the
fundamental and paramount law of the nation,
and, consequently, the theory of every such
government must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the
constitution, is void.<p>

This theory is esssentially attached to a written constitution, and, is
consequently, to be
considered, by this court, as one of the fundamental principles of our
society. It is not
therefore to be lost sight of in the further consideration of this subject.<p>

If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the
constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding
its invallidity, bind the courts, and oblige them
to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it
be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative
as if it were a law? This would be to overthrow
in fact what was established in theory; and
would seem, at first view, an absurdity
too gross to be insisted on. It shall,
however, receive a more attentive consideration.<p>

It is emphatically the province and duty ot
the judicial department to say what the law is.
Those who apply the rule to particular cases,
must of necessity expound and interpret that
rule. If two laws conflict with each other the
courts must decide on the operation of each.<p>

So if a law be in opposition to the
constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case,
so that the
court must either decide that case conformably
to thle law, disregarding the constitution; or
conformably to the constitution, disregarding
the law; the court muat determnine which of
these conflicting rules governs the case. This is
of the very essence of judicial duty.<p>

If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution and the constitution is
superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution,
and not such ordinary act must govern the
case to which they both apply.<p>

Those, then, who controvert the principle
that the constitution is to be considered, in
court, as a paramount law are reduced to the
necessity of maintaining that courts must close
their eyes on the constitution, and see only the
law.<p>

This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions.
It would deelare that an act which according to the principles and theory of
our government is entirely
void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory.
It would declare that if the legislature shall do
what is expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition,
is in reality
effectual. It would be given to the legislature
a practical and real omnipotence, with the same
breath which professes to restrict their powers
within narrow limits. It is prescribing limits
and declaring that those limits may be passed
at pleasure.<p>

That it thus reduces to nothing what we have
deemed the greatest improvement on political
institutions, a written constitution, would of
itself be sufficient, in America, where written
constitutions have been viewed with so much
reverence, for rejecting the construction. But
the peculiar expressions of the constitution of
the United States furnish additional arguments
in favour of its rejection.<p>

The judicial power of the United States is
extended to all cases arising under the constitution.<p>

Could It be the intention of those
who gave this power to say that in using it the
constitution should not be looked into? That a
case arising under the constitution should be
decided without examinlng the instrument under which it arises?<p>

This is too extravagant to be maintaind.<p>

In some cases, then, the constitution must be
looked into by the judges. And it they can
open it at all, what part of it are they forbidden
to read or to obey?<p>

There are many other parts of the constitution which serve to illustrate this
subject.<p>

It is declared that "no tax or duty shall be
laid on articles exported from any state." Suppose a duty on the export of
cotton, of tobaco
or of flour; and a suit instituted to recover it.
Ought judgment to be rendered in such a case?
ought the judges to close their eyes on the constitution, and only see the
law?<p>

The constitution declares "that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law
shall be passed."<p>

If, however, such a bill should he passed and
a person should be prosecuted under it; must
the court condemn to death those victims whom
the constitution endeavors to preserve?<p>

"No person," says the constitution, "shall
be convicted of treason unless on the testimony
of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on
confession in open court."<p>

Here the language of the constitution is addressed especially to the courts.
It prescribes
directly for them, a rule of evidence not to be
departed from. If the legislature should change
that rule, and declare one wittness, or a confession out of court, sufficient
for conviction, must
the constitutioual principle yield to the legislative act?<p>

From these, and
many other selections which
might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the constitution
contemplated that
instrument as a rule for the government of
courts, as well as of the legislature.
Why otherwise does it direct the judges to
take an oath to support it? This oath certainly
applies in an especial manner, to their conduct
in their official character. How immoral to
impose it on them, if they were to be used as
the instruments, and the knowing instruments,
for violating what they swear to support!<p>

The oath of office, too, imposed by the legislature, is completely
demonstrative of the legislative opinion on this subject. It is in these
words: "I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to
persons, and
do equal right to the poor and to the rich; and
that I will faithfully and impartially discharge
all the duties incumbent on me as, according to the best of my abilities and
understanding agreeably to the constitution and laws
of the United States."<p>

Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the constitution of
the United
States if that constitution forms no rule for his
government? if it is closed upon him, and cannot be inspected by him?<p>

If such be the real state of things, this is
worse than solemn mockery. To prescribe, or
to take this oath, becomes equally a crime.<p>

It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what shall
be the supreme law of the land, the constitution itself is
first mentioned; and not the laws of the United
States generally, but those only thich shall be
made in pursuance of the constitution, have
that rank.<p>

Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States
confirms and
strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written
constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void; and that
courts, as well as other departments, are bound
by that instrument.<p>

The rule must be discharged.<p>

There are numerous government restrictions on political speech, defined and
enforced by the Federal Election Commission. The restrictions are particularly
sharp on corporations -- including non-profit corporations -- and labor
unions. Some of these restrictions were recently challenged in court by a
non-profit corporation, Massachusetts Citizens for Life,
that claimed they violated their Constitutional right to free speech. As a
result, the regulations were loosened somewhat.<p>

The remainder of this article is a memo written by the Federal Election
Commission describing the new, less-restrictive regulations. We present these
for the guidance of any organizations who wish to engage in political speech or
political activity, and want to know what the law is.<p>

<h3>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</h3>
<h4>WASHINGTON, D.C. 20463</h4>

<h2><i>MCFL Rules on Corporate/Labor Activity<sup>1</sup></i></h2>

On March 13, 1996, new and revised FEC regulations
on corporate and labor communications and the use of
corporate/labor facilities and resources went into effect.<sup>2</sup>
These rules, which represented the second part of the
Commission's MCFL rulemaking, reflect recent judicial
and Commission interpretations of 2 U.S.C. &#167;441b. This
section of the law prohibits corporate/labor organizations
from using treasury funds to make contributions or expenditures in connection
with federal elections.
The new rules modify FEC regulations in five significant ways:

<ul>
<li>They provide a new standard for determining which
communications must be limited to the restricted class;
<li>They set guidelines for communications made by
corporate/labor organizations;
<li>They clarify that coordination between a corporation
(or labor organization) and a candidate generally results
in an illegal contribution to the candidate;
<li>They provide guidelines on the permissible uses of
corporate and labor facilities and resources; and
<li>They clarify that corporate and labor facilitation of
contributions to candidates and committees is prohibited.
</ul>

<h2>New Standard for Identifying Communications
Appropriate for Restricted Class</h2>

The new rules substitute a new standard for the
partisan/nonpartisan standard previously used for deciding
which communications had to be limited to the restricted
class (i.e., members, stockholders, executives, administrative personnel and
the families of each group) and
which could be distributed to a broader audience (i.e., all
employees or the general public). The new standard is
based on "express advocacy" (i.e., a communication that
expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly
identified candidate for federal office or the candidates of
a clearly identified political party). See also the August
1995 <i>Record</i>, page 1. Under this new standard, corporate
and labor communications that contain express advocacy
may be sent only to the restricted class.<p>

<h2>Corporate/Labor Communications</h2>

The new rules also provide guidance on the following:

<ul>
<li> Candidate appearances and speeches at corporate/labor
events;
<li> Endorsements of candidates;
<li> Candidate appearances and speeches on college campuses;
<li> Candidate debates;
<li> Written political communications, including voter
guides, voting records and press releases;
<li> Voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives; and
<li> Voting information. (See the accompanying chart.)
</ul>

<h2>Coordination with Candidate</h2>

A new provision in the revised rules addresses the
topic of coordination between a candidate and the
corporate or labor sponsor of an election-related communication. When
communicating with its restricted class, a
corporation or labor organization may coordinate with
candidates concerning their campaign plans, projects and
needs. That coordination, however, may compromise the
independence of future communications to the general
public (by the organization or its separate segregated
fund).<p>

When communicating beyond the restricted class,
coordination with the candidate (other than the kinds of
coordination specified in the regulations -- see chart) may
result in a prohibited in-kind contribution to the candidate. Additionally, it
may compromise the independence
of future communications to the general public (by the
organization or its separate segregated fund).<p>

<h2>Permissible Use of Corporate and Labor Facilities</h2>

The new regulations reaffirm that, if a candidate or
committee uses the facilities of a corporation or labor
organization, the organization must be reimbursed within a
commercially reasonable time for the usual and normal
rental charge. Reimbursement is not required for the use of
meeting rooms if the organization normally makes such
rooms available to civic or community groups without
charge and if it makes the room available on the same
terms to any other candidate (running for the same office)
who requests to use it.<p>

<h2>Facilitation of Contributions</h2>

Additionally, the rules clarify that corporations and
labor organizations are prohibited from facilitating
contributions to candidates or political committees (other
than the organization's separate segregated fund). Facilitation means using
corporate or labor facilities or resources to raise funds in connection with
any federal
election. The new regulations provide several examples.
They also explain that, in a few specific cases, a
fundraising activity sponsored by a corporation or labor
organization is not facilitation if someone, such as a
candidate, individual or political committee, pays the
organization in advance for the use of the facilities or
resources. This principle applies to three situations:

<ul>
<li> Directing staff to work on the fundraiser;
<li> Using the corporate or labor organization's mail list;
and
<li> Using the organization's food services.
</ul><p>

Note: This article represents the author's personal views, and not necessarily
the policies of Right to Life.
</font>
</table></center><p>

Should pro-lifers support proposed laws that would protect some babies from
abortion, but not others?<p>

Many pro-lifers answer, No.
If it would allow any abortions at all, they explain, than for pro-lifers to
support it would make us accomplices in those abortions. By protecting some but
not others, we would be saying that some lives are move valuable than others,
and thus we are falling into the pro-abortionist mindset of setting relative,
arbitrary values on human life. We must never, ever compromise.<p>

I respectfully disagree.<p>

A couple of years ago I saw a TV news interview with Barney
Frank. Mr Frank is an openly homosexual member of Congress who generally holds
far-left views. I doubt I agree with him on much of anything. But he made one
statement in that interview that I believe was absolutely correct.<p>

At the time, Congress and the administration were debating homosexuals in the
military. The reporter asked Mr Frank what he thought about a certain
compromise proposal. He said he supported it.
The reporter asked how he could support it when it didn't give him what he
wanted, complete and open acceptance of homosexuals in the
military. Mr Frank replied that it was better than the present policy, and
anything that was a step in the right direction he would support, and then
work from there.<p>

Of course, Mr Frank's idea of "better policy" is not necessarily mine, but I
believe he made a point which is just as valid for pro-lifers as it is for gay
rights activists. Namely: take anything you can get that's an improvement, and
then come back next year and use that as the starting point.<p>

I agree wholeheartedly that one should
never compromise on moral principles. But there is a vast difference between
compromising on principles, and compromising on a specific piece of
legislation.<p>

Suppose you are standing outside a burning building. Ten people are trapped
inside. I'm sure we would all agree that the morally correct thing to do is to
try to save them all. But suppose
you could reach and save only the nine who happen to be on the first two
floors. The tenth is on the top
floor, far beyond your ability to help him. Would you say that because you
cannot save all ten, that the morally correct thing to do is to
stand and do nothing while the nine you could have saved burn to death?<p>

Note that an important point in
my "fire analogy" is that you are saving everyone you can.
Compare this to a slightly different story: You are outside this same
burning building with ten people trapped inside. You could save all of them.
But one of them is an old enemy who spread vicious rumors about you a few years
ago that ruined your reputation, cost you your job, etc. So you decide you're
just going to let him burn to death while you save the others.<p>

Clearly, there is a vast difference between these two stories. In the first
case, you are saving everyone you can. You let one person die, not because you
consider his life less valuable, but because there was nothing you could do
about it. In the second case, you are deliberately letting someone die out of
malice. Arguably, this is morally equivalent to murder.<p>

As I write this, the President has just vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth
abortions, and Congress is working on a possible override. I came across an
article from a pro-life leader
who criticized the whole partial-birth effort on the grounds that it
would prevent very few abortions, while allowing the vast majority of abortions
to continue.<p>

Sure, even if passed this bill will only prevent perhaps a few hundred
abortions per year, a tiny fraction of 1%. If abortionists simply switch to
other methods, it might only prevent a few dozen. But ... suppose it only
prevented one abortion.
To that one child, it's all or nothing. Wouldn't that one life be worth
saving?<p>

And if this bill would make so little difference, why are all the pro-abortion
organizations fighting so hard against
it? There's no mystery, they openly state their reason: They fear that
it would set a precedent. If this year we outlaw partial-birth abortions, maybe
next year we'll outlaw abortions for sex selection, and the year after that
all late-term abortions. Who knows where it could lead?<p>

That scenario is far from fanciful. How did we get where we are now, anyway?
The abortionists didn't just come along one day and demand that abortion be
legalized throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy, everywhere in the
United States, with no questions asked, for any reason or no reason, and
supported with tax dollars. No, they started out with a small step: convincing
the Colorado legislature to legalize abortion in cases of rape. That passed in
1967.
Then they went to other states, pushing slightly broader bills: rape and
incest, deformed children, abortions very early in pregnancy. Finally, when it
was
clear that they had gotten as far was they were going to get with the state
legislatures, they went to the Supreme Court in 1973.
<i>Roe v Wade</i> was a dramatic step, but even there, it is carefully
worded. It appears to preserve
restrictions on late-term abortions and to allow regulation of abortion. 
They didn't throw these things out until later.
They kept some room so that they could back down if public opinion was too
outraged. (But Aermica was pre-occupied with the Watergate scandal, and <i>Roe
v Wade</i> just slipped though.)<p>

The abortionists took over ten years, at least 34 bills in various state
legislatures, and a dozen court decisions
to move us from an almost-absolute ban on abortion to its total
legalization. And that doesn't count the time they spent on public relations
preparing the country for their first legislative proposals. They have now had
20 years to establish and strengthen their position.
It is unrealistic to think we can undo all this overnight.<p>

If we manage to pass some restriction on abortion, no pro-lifer is saying that
we should pat ourselves on the back and go home. Rather, we save as many lives
as we can this year. Then next year we come back and try to save a few more.<p>

In practice, in politics, when you demand all or nothing, you usually get
nothing. We must compromise our way to total victory.<p>

<html><title>The Paradox of Democracy</title>

<h1><img src="vote.gif">The Paradox of Democracy</h1>
<hr>
Return to <a href="politics.htm">Politics</a> |
<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><br>
<hr>

The central tenet of democracy is the idea of the <i>vote</i>. And there
is an interesting paradox to voting.<p>

You often hear people say that they don't bother to vote because,
after all, my one vote doesn't matter.<p>

There is a sense in which this is true. There has never been a
candidate for President who has won or lost by a single popular vote.
While I do not have records of all the elections for governor or
senator or other high offices, I am sure that elections for these offices
won or lost by a single vote are extremely rare.<p>

But here's the paradox: If one person says to himself, "My vote doesn't
matter, if I don't bother to vote, it won't make any difference", he's
probably right. But if a million people say that, combined, they're
totally wrong.<p>

Sure, few candidates win or lose by one vote. But a million votes
required a million individual people to cast them. So even if a
candidate wins by a landslide, your one vote was part of that
landslide, and you <i>did</i> make a difference.<p>

That said, there are some votes that are very, very close.<p>

This is especially true in local elections, where there are fewer
voters. A few years ago I was watching elections return on television,
and quite late in the evening, when something like 95% of the votes
were in, there was a bond issue in a town in our area that was passing by
2 to 1. I don't mean, twice as many people voting for it as against it.
I mean, 2 people had voted for it, and 1 person had voted against it.<p>

So okay, that was a small town.<p>

Let's take a bigger race, the state legislature.<p>

In 1994 in Ohio, there was a race between incumbent Katherine Walsh and
challenger William Taylor.<p>

This race was particularly interesting to people concerned about the
abortion issue, because Ms Walsh was one of the two or three
leading pro-abortion advocates in the state legislature, while
Mr Taylor was pro-life. (Of course, even if you are not particularly
interested in abortion, the point of this little story is still
applicable -- it could happen in any race, no matter what the
issues are.)<p>

When the polls closed on election day, Ms Walsh had beaten Mr Taylor
by just twenty-six votes, out of almost 37,000 votes cast. There was much
hand-wringing among pro-lifers. If just <i>twenty-seven</i> more
pro-lifers had
bothered to go to the polls, they could have turned the election.
Indeed, if just fourteen people who voted for Walsh had voted for Taylor
instead, he would have won. Considering how many voters go the polls
with no clear idea of who the candidates are and what they stand for, one
person handing out a hundred flyers on a street corner might very well
have changed fourteen votes.<p>

But the initial count did not include absentee ballots. When these were
added in, Mr Taylor had won. By <i>nine</i> votes.
Now the pro-aborts are surely doing the hand-wringing. If just
<i>five</i> people
had changed their votes, Ms Walsh would have won. There was a point when
I was a boy when he had five registered voters in our family (two
parents, two kids in
college, and one finishing high school) -- one family could have turned
that election! And
surely one person making phone calls, handing out flyers, or just giving
some money so that one more ad could be placed on the radio or in the
newspaper, could have made the difference.<p>

And by the way, Mr Taylor's presence in the Ohio House meant that,
by at least one analyst's count, there were then 51 pro-lifers in the
99-seat legislature -- just one more than needed to make a majority.
There were a number of squeeker votes that term. Mr Taylor might well
have made the difference between certain bills passing or failing.
Which means that just five people in his district could have changed
the outcome of legislation for the entire state.<p>

<h1>Life-Issue Votes in the Senate</h1>

<hr>

This page shows how members of the U.S. Senate voted on
life-issue bills. Senators are grouped by state.<p>

Each vote is identified by an abbreviation at the top of
the column. The abbreviations are repeated at the beginning of each state.
These are linked to a brief description of the bill at the top of the page.
Each senator's vote is identifed as "L" for a pro-life vote, "C" for a
"pro-choice" vote, and "-" for absent, not voting, or voting "present".<p>

<font size=-1>
Disclaimers:<p>

One should be cautious about drawing conclusions from a single vote.
A senator may agree with the general idea of a bill but vote against it
because of objections to details;
in a few cases the exact effect of a bill is debatable; etc. Rather, we suggest
you look at an overall voting pattern.<p>

This information is presented for educational purposes only. We are not
advocating the election or defeat of any candidate.<p>

<b>HF:</b> Henry Foster: Clinton's nominee for Surgeon General not only
supported abortion but had personally performed abortions (though he gave
varying numbers of how many at different times). The Senate voted 57 to 43 to
end a filibuster against Mr Foster's nomination, but this was insufficient as a
3/5 majority is required, so he was effectively rejected.<p>

<b>FI:</b> Federal Insurance: In 1993, at President Clinton's orders, the
health insurance of federal government employees began covering abortions. A
measure to prohibit federally-subsidized insurance programs from covering
abortion except in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest, passed the
Senate 50 to 44.<p>

<b>PB:</b>
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed 54 to
44. Would ban abortions in which the unborn baby is partially delivered before
being killed. This bill was inspired by a procedure called
<a href="../aborters/dx.htm">"D&amp;X"</a>, "intact D&amp;E", and other
names.<p>

<h1>Life-Issue Votes in Congress</h1>

<hr>

This page shows how members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted on
life-issue bills. Representatives are grouped by state.<p>

Each vote is identified by an abbreviation at the top of
the column. The abbreviations are repeated at the beginning of each state.
These are linked to a brief description of the bill at the top of the page.
Each representative's vote is identifed as "L" for a pro-life vote, "C" for a
"pro-choice" vote, and "-" for absent, not voting, or voting "present". (By
tradition, the Speaker usually does not vote.)<p>

<font size=-1>
Disclaimers:<p>

One should be cautious about drawing conclusions from a single vote.
A representative may agree with the general idea of a bill but vote against it
because of objections to details;
in a few cases the exact effect of a bill is debatable; etc. Rather, we suggest
you look at an overall voting pattern.<p>

This information is presented for educational purposes only. We are not
advocating the election or defeat of any candidate.<p>

<b>TF:</b>
Tax-Payer Funded Abortions in Foreign Countries: A bill to deny federal tax
dollars to any organization that performs abortions, directly or indirectly, in
foreign countries (except when the life of the mother is at stake or in cases
of rape or incest). Passed 240 to 181.<p>

<b>TX:</b>
Title X: Current Title X regulations require participating clinics to "counsel"
pregnant women and girls about abortion as a "pregnancy management option".
Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, receives about $33
million per year through Title X. A proposal to completely eliminate Title X
and transfer its funds to health programs for poor people was defeated by 221
to 207.<p>

<b>AT:</b>
Abortion Training: An amendment to the Title X appropriations bill to remove a
provision that had been inserted in committee to say the government would not
discriminate against medical training programs that did not include abortion
training. This was in response to a decision by the Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education that they would no longer recognize medical training
programs unless they included abortion training. The federal government has
long relied on ACGME accreditation as a condition for receiving various
government assistance. Pro-life provision survived by a vote of 235 to 189 on
August 3.<p>

<b>MC:</b>
Military Clinics: An amendment to the defense appropriations bill to prohibit
abortions at military clinics except when necessary to save the life of the
mother. Passed 226 to 191 on Septermber 7.<p>

<b>PB:</b>
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833), November 1, passed 288 to
139. Would ban abortions in which the unborn baby is partially delivered before
being killed. This bill was inspired by a procedure called
<a href="../aborters/dx.htm">"D&amp;X"</a>, "intact D&amp;E", and other
names.<p>

The following candidates received contributions from the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League Political Action Committee between
January and August, 1996. (While I would have liked to give data through
October, unfortunately this was the latest I could get my hands on.)<p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

This includes candidates who received cash and/or in-kind
contributions. ("In-kind" contributions are donations of supplies,
merchandise, etc.) Most were cash.<p>

The candidate names are taken from the name of the campaign committee,
which does not always include the person's full name. In one case in Oregon, a
committee was listed in FEC reports as being a candidate's campaign
committee, but no name was given at all.<p>

The candidate's party was not always listed. This does not mean the
candidate is an independant, just that the data is incomplete.<p>

This list includes contributions to candidates in the primaries. Some
of these candidates may have been defeated in primaries and so will not
be on the November ballot.<p>

<hr>

The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is probably the
leading pro-abortion political organization in the country. (Not
counting the Supreme Court, which is nominally non-political.)
Earlier this year, NARRAL issued a press
release on Bob Dole. The first sentence read:

<blockquote>
Senator Bob Dole has cast 113 votes on abortion and
reproductive rights in his Senate career.  Of that number, 107 were
anti-choice votes.
</blockquote>

They go on to state that some of Senator Dole's most outrageous acts
include:

<ul>
<li>"Dole opposed a motion to table an amendment that would have put
Congress on record as stating that 'human life begins at conception.'"


<li>"Dole voted to support Senator Hatch's
constitutional amendment that would have permitted Congress and the
states to outlaw abortions."

<li>"Dole co-sponsored a bill to ban certain late-term abortion procedures, 
[partial birth aborttion] which presents a direct constitutional challenge
to Roe v. Wade."

<li>"Dole voted against the nomination of
Joycelyn Elders to be Surgeon General." (Elders nonetheless passed, though
she was later forced to resign amidst a flurry of controversies,
such as her chiding pro-lifers for having a "love affair with the
fetus", revelations that she concealed the fact that
condoms distributed to school children under one of her programs
were defective because she didn't want to harm public confidence
in the program, and her public call for legalization of drug abuse.)

<li>"Dole opposed the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General
and voted to prevent a vote on his nomination." (Foster was proud of
his record of not only defending abortion but having personally performed
abortions.)

</ul>

Some pro-lifers were disturbed by the fact that Dole voted for an early
version of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which restricts
anti-abortion protests and demonstrations. NARRAL explained that
pro-choicers should not take any comfort in this vote, pointing out that
he voted <i>against</i> the final bill.<p>

Indeed, according to NARRAL, Dole practically invented abortion as
a political issue. They quote him as telling a Christian Coalition
audience in South Carolina,

<blockquote>
Now let me make one thing clear. I have a flawless record of protecting
the unborn, and  thats not going to change when I become President of
the United States. I voted for it every year.  In fact, the first time this issue was an
issue was in my race in Kansas back in 1974: Think back about it -- go
back and look at the record, and youll find that when abortion first
became a national issue was at my re-election in 1974.
</blockquote>

Speaking of his 1974 election, NARRAL held a press conference
specifically to expose Dole's conduct in that race.<p>

According to NARRAL, Dole used some dirty tricks in that campaign
to defeat opponent Dr William Roy. Dole told voters that Roy supported
abortion, and indeed that Roy had personally performed abortions. These
charges apparently contributed to Roy's defeat.<p>

At the press conference, a reporter asked Mr Roy if he had,
in fact, ever perform an abortion. Roy replied that he had performed
a number of abortions. NARRAL's press release praises Mr Roy
for "having performed abortions ... in his ob/gyn medical practice."<p>

So to clarify, Dole's dirty campaign trick that NARRAL was exposing
was that he told people accurate information about where he and his
opponent stood on an important political issue, which, apparently,
his opponent would rather have kept secret from the voters.<p>

If I may be permitted an editorial comment, may I say that I am just
shocked at the low level that politics has reached today. Can you
imagine -- a politician sinking so low as to actually tell voters the
<b>truth</b>! It's a good
thing we have organizations like NARRAL to expose such dangerous
practices.<p>

<hr>

<i>The following article appeared in </i>Life Issues Connector<i>,
September 1996.</i><p>

<table border>
<tr><th width=50%>Bob Dole
    <th width=50%>Bill Clinton
<tr>
<td valign=top>
Bob Dole's position may be best summed up by the
remarks that he made, supported by his voting record, at a Family
Forum event in Iowa:<p>

"When I am President, my first full day in office will be
declared American Family Day. As President, I will rescind
every one of those acts of federal coercion that Clinton enacted on
his first day in office.<p>

"In a Dole administration, abortion on demand will no longer
be the policy of the federal government. As long as we hold the
White House, federal agencies will be in the business of licensing
drugs that promote life, not death. And our federal tax dollars
will not be used to promote abortion overseas.<p>

"As your President, I will sign an executive order to prohibit
federal funding for destructive experimentation on living human
embryos.<p>

"We can talk all day about children's issues, as liberals often
do. But it will be just that -- hollow talk -- if we don't have
enough love in our hearts to care for the most innocent among us.
All our talk about a less violent, more caring society will come to
nothing unless we protect the sanctity of human life. Until the
day comes when we overturn
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/classics/410us113.ovr.html">Roe v. Wade,</a>
why can't we reguire
parental consent before a minor obtains an abortion? Why can't
we stop partiallirth abortions? Why can't we get the
government out of the business of promoting abortions? The
truth is, we can -- and with the right leadership in the White
House -- we will.<p>

"The Oval Office should be a place of moral leadership for
America. But, for the past three years, it has not been. The
policies of the federal government should be rooted in the values
embraced by the American people. But our current President has
advocated policies that undermine those values. The executive
orders he signed were among the first examples.<p>

"Abortion is not an issue of when life begins, it's a question of
when love begins. It's a question of what kind of people we are
and aspire to become. A spirit of hope is evident across America
-- in crisis pregnancy centers, in groups finding homes for
children, by churches and synagogues caring for unwed mothers,
and by teenagers promoting abstinence. This will be the spirit of
the Dole administration, for this is the spirit of America."<p>

An actual count of Mr. Dole's Senate votes on abortion has
been made by two contrasting organizations, which have given
almost identical results. The National Abortion Rights Action
League attributes 105 pro-life votes to Dole out of a total of 111.
The National Right to Life Committee gives him 106 out of 112.
These two compilations result in a 95.5% pro-life voting record
over the last two decades.<p>
Jack Kemp, as his running mate, has a 100% pro-life voting
record.<p>

<td valign=top>
Bill Clinton's position on abortion is clear based on
his actions as President:<p>

He repealed regulations which prohibited counseling and
referral for abortions in fedual family planning clinics.<p>

He repealed the Reagan/Bush directives that prohibited
abortions in military facilities overseas.<p>

He repealed Reagan/Bush's Mexico City policy which had
denied overseas family planning groups assistance if they
"perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family
planning."<p>

He directed the Dept. of Health &amp; Human Selvices and the
FDA to expedite licensing of the abortion pill RU 486.<p>

He supported the repeal of the Hyde amendment, but Congress
passed it over his objections; however, he did get a rape-incest
exception.<p>

He tried to again use your tax money to pay for abortions in the
District of Columbia. Congress refused.<p>

Under Reagan and Bush, your tax money had not been used to
pay for abortions for government employees. Clinton wanted
you to pay for them, but Congress refused.<p>

The Helms Amendment, since 1973, forbids the government to
actually pay for abortions overseas. Clinton would like to repeal
this amendment.<p>

Health Care -- Hillary Clinton's socialized medicine -- included
making abortion-on-demand a federally mandated, tax paid
"service" in every region of every state. It did not pass.<p>

Clinton supported FOCA, the Freedom of Choice Act, which
would have wiped out even minor state restrictions on aborlions.
FOCA did not pass.<p>

He has pushed for international legalization of abortion
through the United Nations. And with this, heavy lobbying and
specific pressure on underdeveloped countries at the Cairo,
Beijing and Turkey conferences.<p>

He supported funding for the United Nations' Fund for
Population Activity. This is the group that supports the coercive
abortion policy and program in China.<p>

He supporled experimentation on live, embryonic human
babies -- he appointed a National Institute of Health advisory
panel, every member of which supported destructive embryo
experimentation.<p>

He vetoed the bill to ban
<a href="../lex/lexus.htm#pb">partial-birth, late-term abortions.</a><p>

Vice President Al Gore shares Clinton's strong pro-abortion
position.<p>

<h1>Dole's Statement on the Pro-Life Platform</h1>

<hr>

<i>The following is the full text of Bob Dole's statement on the
<a href="platform.htm">Republican pro-life platform.</a></i><p>

Since 1980, the Republican Party platform has included a statement of pro-life
principle and supported a pro-life constitutional amendment. In the 1996
platform, I will not seek or accept a retreat from those commitments.<p>

Some Republicans have suggested that the platform be silent on this issue to
expand our appea among Americans with different views. I agree with the goal,
but not the method. In 1980, the Republican platform on which Ronald Reagan ran
for president stated strong pro-life beliefs and
also acknowledged that "we recognize differing views on this question among
Americans in general and in our own party ..."
I expect to run for president with the existing
pro-life language from our 1992 platform and
with the declaration of tolerance for divergent
points of view on issues such as abortion. There
are a number of issues, including term limits,
on which Republicans of goodwill disagree.<p>

Let me be very clear: No one will be turned away from our convention or my
campaign because they do not agree with me on these issues. But I have been
chosen the Republican nominee, and I intend to run on a platform
that reflects my views. Those views have been demonstrated in a
long, consistent public record. They are a matter of conscience, not
calculation.<p>

Just as important as the wording in our platform, however, is the spirit we
carry into this election. I will stand up for my
beliefs with confidence, but I will not silence those who disagree. This has
been the practice of the Democratic Party, which
excluded one of its most popular leaders --
Governor Bob Casey -- from its last convention. We Republicans must avoid the
bitterness and intolerance of the Democratic Party that leads them to silence
those who oppose their hard-line views. Our convention must reflect not only
our strong pro-life convictions, but a decent regard for the opinions of those
who disagree. This is not compromise, it is civility.<p>

This same extremism was apparent in President Clinton's recent veto of a bill
preventing partial-birth abortions. With that decision, defending a practice
most Americans find horrible beyond belief, the president surrendered any claim
to moderation on this issue. The president has yet to
demonstrate there are any abortions, under any circumstances, he would not
support.<p>

I believe it falls to Republicans in 1996
to speak for that great majority of Americans -- for people of good will in
both parties -- who both respect a stand on principle and are searching for
common moral ground. In the long term, I believe that only
in this tolerant spirit can Americans ever
come together to end the abortion
tragedy -- not with anger and hatred, but
with hope, compassion, and humanity.<p>

<hr>
<font size=-1>Note: Right to Life is dedicated to ending abortion through
peaceful, legal means.</font><p>
<hr>
Norma McCorvey became pregnant by her boyfriend in 1969. She said she
had been raped, thinking that this would make it possible for her to get a
legal abortion. But Texas law then permitted abortion only to save the life of
the mother. She and various pro-abortion organizations used her case to
challenge the Texas abortion law in court, finally reaching the Supreme Court
in 1973. The court documents all referred to her as "Jane Roe" to protect her
privacy (though many years later she came forward). Henry Wade was the district
attorney for Dallas County, Texas, who defended the law. Thus the case is known
as
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/classics/410us113.ovr.html">
"Roe versus Wade".</a>
In its decision, the Supreme Court declared that all
state laws restricting or limiting abortion were "unconstitutional", and so
legalized abortion on demand throughout the United States.<p>

Ancient history? Not exactly. On July 22, 1995, Jane Roe / Norma McCorvey
became a born-again Christian and a pro-lifer.<p>

In early 1995 Miss McCorvey was working as marketing director at a Dallas
abortion center, "A Choice for Women". On February 1,
<a href="http://web2.airmail.net/orn">Operation Rescue,</a>
a pro-life group that engages in peaceful (though sometimes
illegal) protests, opened
an office in the same building. At first McCorvey, along with other workers at
the abortion center, would not speak to
the Rescue people (except for obscenities).<p>

This was a no-smoking building, so when Miss McCorvey wanted to smoke, she had
to go outside. Flip Benham, a minister and the president of Operation Rescue,
would hang around and chat with the smokers. Flip and Norma discovered
they had much in common: they were the same age, they had both been part of the
hippie culture in their youth, etc.
They gradually became friends, and pretty soon Norma was spending a lot of time
chatting with the Rescue people. Rhonda, one of the workers at the office,
sometimes brought her children with her, and Norma soon made a regular habit of
coming by to hug the kids.<p>

One day she stopped by the Rescue office and
asked Rhonda's 7-year-old child if she'd like to go with her to make some
copies. While Rhonda was nervous about the idea of her 7-year-old going off
with this women, she did not object.
While they were out, the little girl asked Norma
if she'd go to church with them that Sunday. Amazingly, she agreed.<p>

She continued to attend the independent Bible church.
On July 22, she became a born-again Christian.<p>

The Rescue people tried to keep it quiet as long as possible to shield her from
the media. But when she was baptized on August 8 it became clear that word was
about to get out, so on August 10 they released the story.<p>

In early press conferences the media leaped on her, looking for flaws in her
story. She said she was pro-life. The reporters pressed her, asking about this
or that special or extreme case, and she backed down and made some pro-abortion
statements. This, of course, made the media gleeful, sometimes using these
quotes to report that she is "still pro-choice", sometimes combining quotes to
show that she is contradicting herself.<p>

The reality, of course, is that at the time of these interviews she had only
been a pro-lifer and a
Christian for three weeks. She has not necessarily worked out all the details
of her new position. (If you've never stood in front of a hostile crowd
throwing questions at you with no time to think about your answers,
believe me, it's not easy to be completely logical and consistent.)<p>

It is interesting to compare the image of pro-lifers
that one normally gets from the media, with the image one
gets from this incident. Many people become pro-life
because they have carefully examined the scientific and ethical issues involved
and come to the conclusion that the pro-life position is the only rational one.
But that isn't how Norma McCorvey got here.
Norma McCorvey became pro-life and a Christian because her pro-life
"enemies" showed her more friendship, love,
and genuine concern than her pro-abortion "friends".<p>

Pray for Norma McCorvey. She has a tough time ahead.<p>

<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><br>
<hr>

Dearest New Family,<p>

<img src="roeshirt.gif" align=right>
I pray this letter finds you and yours doing very well in Christ. We are all
doing well here at
<a href="http://web2.airmail.net/orn">Operation Rescue National.</a>
I find it very hard though, to
put up with the incredible oppression of Christians in today's society. They
are being sued for millions of
dollars for simply telling and living out the truth. They are beaten up in
the media and maligned by friend and foe alike. I am learning that it has
always been this way.<p>

I am totally amazed at how all the folks here carry on the ministry without
being dreadfully depressed. On several occasions I have gone out to sidewalk
counsel only to return mad at the "blind" women whose minds are already made up
to kill their children.
Yet the folks in this office always seem to have the joy of the Lord filling
their hearts. Jesus is awesome!<p>

The abortion mill next door is doing less and less business every month.
Unfortunately, the owner of the building wants to throw us out this month.
Please pray for us. So many mothers have chosen life for their children
because Chlistians have been close enough to
share the Gospel with them. So many of the workers, including myself have
been saved out of that awful place.<p>

I come to the Operation Rescue office every day with a prayer on my lips and
a song in my heart. He has made me brand new and I pray that the rest of my
life will be a "thank you" to him for all He has done. I love you all. Please
keep me in you prayers.<p>

Your New Sister in Christ,<p>

The picture above shows three women who used to work in an abortion facility,
along with Emily, daughter of one of the workers at the
<a href="http://web2.airmail.net/orn">Operation Rescue</a>
office next door. (The Barbie jeep she is driving was given to her by one of
these women.)<p>

Through the outreach of Emily, her mother, and other pro-lifers, five employees
of the abortion facility have now quit. (Indeed, the woman on the right in this
picture is
<a href="roe.htm">"Jane Roe"</a>, the person who initiated the
<i>Roe v Wade</i> court case that made abortion legal throughout the United
States.) The abortionist now requires all his employees to sign a statement
that reads, "I will not associate with anyone from Operation Rescue during
working hours. If seen associating with anyone from Operation Rescue after
hours it will be considered immoral."<p>

<i>We thought we'd share some very well put pro-life quotes. We couldn't agree
with these statements more.</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>"While the deep concern of a woman bearing
an unwanted child merits consideration and
sympathy, it is my personal feeling that the
legalization of abortion on demand is not in
accordance with the value which our civilization
places on human life. Wanted or unwanted, I
believe that human life, even at its earliest stages,
has certain rights which must be recognized -- the
right to be born, the right to love, the right to
grown old.<p>

"I share the confidence of those who feel that
America is working to care for its unwanted as
well as wanted children, protecting particularly
those who cannot protect themselves. I also share
the opinions of those who do not accept abortion
as a response to our society's problems -- an
inadequate welfare system, unsatisfactory job
training programs, and insufficient financial
support for all its citizens.<p>

"When history looks back to this era it should
recognize this generation as one which cared
about human beings enough to halt the practice of
war, to provide a decent living for every family
and to fulfill its responsibility to its children from
the very moment of conception."<p>

Since writing this letter, Kennedy has become a

votes for taxpayer funding of abortion, and has won
awards for his efforts from the abortion industry.<p>

<dt>"There are those who argue that the right to
privacy is of [a] higher order than the right to
life ... that was the premise of slavery. You could
not protest the existence or treatment of slaves on
the plantation because that was private and
therefore outside your right to be concerned.<p>

"What happens to the mind of a person, and
the moral fabric of a nation, that accepts the
aborting of the life of a baby without a pang of
conscience? What kind of a person and what
kind of a society will we have 20 years hence if
life can be taken so casually? It is that question,
the question of our attitude, our value system, and
our mind-set with regard to the nature and worth
of life itself that is the central question
confronting mankind. Failure to answer that
question affirmatively may leave us with a hell
right here on earth."<p>

1. The NEA Resolution I-13 on Family
Planning was adopted in 1985, amended in
1986 and reaffirmed every year since.<p>

<i>"The National Education Association
supports family planning, including the right
to reproductive freedom.<p>

The Association urges the government to
give high priority to making available all
methods of family planning to women and men
unable to take advantage of private facilities.<p>

The Association further urges the
implementation of community-operated,
school-based family planning clinics that will
provide intensive counseling by trained
personnel."<p></i>

2. The NEA delegates easily passed New
Business Item 1990-65.<p>

<i>"NEA will oppose any legislation which
will erode the status of <u>Roe v. Wade</u> and/or
which impedes access to and choice of
reproductive health care options, by providing
technical assistance to state affiliates."</i><p>

Rationale: <i>"NEA resolution supports
family planning including the right to
reproductive freedom. Erosion of
reproductive rights by states, currently
provided by <u>Roe v. Wade,</u> must be
challenged."</i><p>

<h2>TSC NATIONAL</h2>

There are many pro-life teachers across the
nation. As a result, Teachers Saving Children
-- National was established on October 1,
1994. The governing body consists of a
Board of Trustees made up of 7 voting
members and the Executive Director. A goal of the national organization is to
assist in the development of affiliate state chapters.<p>

<h2>TSC ACTIVITIES</h2>

Activities include alerting NEA members and the public to
the facts, press articles and editorials, letter
writing campaigns, working through proper
channels for change, and more.<p>

An informative bi-monthly newsletter is
sent to all members. TSC board members are
available for speaking engagements and
workshops. Prayer and financial support are
both welcomed and needed.<p>

<h2>MEMBERSHIP</h2>

TSC membership is open to all pro-life,
pro-family educators and concerned citizens.
Membership in a professional educators'
organization is not a requirement to join TSC.<p>

Annual dues are $25.00 (college
students/retired educators $10.00). To join
TSC, simply fill out the membership form and
send it in with your $25.00. The TSC
membership year runs from September 1 -
August 31.<p>

Contributions and Memberships are NOT
tax deductible.<p>

Web note: Neat as it would be to do this as an electronic form, unfortunately
Ohio Right to Life is not affiliated with Teachers Saving Children
(we just think they're a great bunch of people), so sending a membership
form to us, electronically or otherwise, wouldn't do anybody a lot of good. So
if you want to join them, you'll have to print the
<a href="tscform.htm">form</a>
out and do it by hand. Sorry.<p>

<hr>

"Teachers Saving Children has been called
'the conscience of the classroom.' Your
willingness to dedicate yourselves to the pro-life cause gives great hope for
the future of
American education. Parents can have
confidence when their children are taught by
such courageous and principled teachers."<p>

<h1>Ohio Education Association Pro-Abortion</h1>
<hr>
Return to <a href="people.htm">People and Organizations</a> |
<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><br>
<hr>

At the OEA annual meeting, delegates voted to retain the following
resolution: "The Association supports family planning, including the
right to reproductive freedom." In February a survey was conducted by
a group of concerned Ohio educators. Dave Kaiser,
a delegate from Fort Recovery, stated: "Despite the fact that the
OEA president wants to maintain the current OEA position and has
discouraged teachers from responding, hundreds of teachers did respond
to our survey, and an overwhelming 82% want the OEA
out of the abortion business."<p>

Mr. Kaiser commented that many teachers and school employees across
the state are very concerned.  They resent their dues being spent on
non-educational issues, especially ones that eliminate future
students.  He noted that the delegates attending the convention
did not represent the views of most teachers.  He asked, "Why
does the OE Aleadership refuse to survey its membership on this issue
while actively discouraging members from responding to our survey?"

<h1>Childrens' Defense Fund</h1>

<hr>
Return to <a href="people.htm">People and Organizations</a> |
<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a>
<hr>

The Childrens' Defense Fund (CDF) staged a massive "Stand for Children"
rally in Washington, DC, Saturday June 1, 1996 to pressure Congress to adopt
their policies.<p>

Among CDF policies which are presumably intended to defend children are
opposition to the proposed $500 per child tax credit and opposition to any
restrictions on abortion, including the ban on partial-birth abortions. The
Children's Defense Fund would not support efforts to make adoption easier, and
is leading the coalition against the proposed Parental Rights Act.<p>

Other organizations that joined CDF in the "Stand For Children" rally are
Planned Parenthood, the nation's leading provider of abortions; Zero Population
Growth, which is founded on the principle that there are already too many
people in the world so children are undesirable and dangerous; the
Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes legalization of drugs;
and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and Human (Gay) Rights
Campaign, whose idea of "defending children" is somewhat unusual.<p>

CDF conducted an excellent marketing drive to sell this rally to more
mainstream organizations, like Big Brothers and church groups, many of
whom probably have little idea of the policies being pursued by the
organizers.<p>

<h2>Tips for Wise Use</h2>

Properly used, E-mailed press releases or letters to the
editor can greatly increase your organization's effectiveness and voice in
religious and secular media.<p>

Proper etiquette indicates that editors be E-Mailed in advance with a
notice that you'd like to E-Mail a press release to them on occasion.<p>

When done in a professional manner, and not over-used, the practice of
E-Mailing press release can save both your organization and the editor of
the receiving publication a good deal of time in getting a PSA, press
release, or even a "Letter to the Editor" to press, as the information is
already on the editor's computer and ready to edit.<p>

Some important points to remember when using this list:

<ul>
<li>Do NOT send out a blanket news release to every media outlet on this list.
A bicycling magazine is unlikely to be
interested in your thoughts on abortion, no matter how cogent they are,
and all you're going to do is get some recipients very annoyed.

<li>Be sure to personalize the address on each e-mail, perhaps with some
some sort of  mail-merge program.
Generic E-mail messages will stand a good
chanceof being deleted by the editorial staff.

<li>If you want a publication to print your letter to the editor, news
release, etc, you'll need to include your postal address and phone
number for verification purposes.

Some concerns have been raised about our publishing people's addresses
without first getting their approval. Therefore, we are revising this
list to only
include those who have specifically asked or agreed to be on it. In the
near
future we hope to contact everyone who used to be on the list. If your
Right to Life organization would like to be on, please write to
<a href="mailto:life@ohiolife.org">us</a> and we'll add you.<p>

In the mean time, if you'd like to get in contact with pro-lifers in your area,
call National Right to Life at 202-626-8800 ext 129 for assistance.

<html><title>Abortion and Race: Mistaken Identity</title>
<h1>A Case of Mistaken Identity</h1>

At first, I was pro-choice too. However, a racial incident which occurred in
1971 made it clear to me that the practice of abortions on demand is a direct
threat to the future existence of Black America.<p>

In 1971, my husband and I were poor struggling college students. Therefore, I
was forced to rely on the Cincinnati Public Health Department for my pre-natal
care.<p>

One day, the white clinic social worker invited me into her office for what
amounted to a family-values / pro-life pep talk. She spoke about the need to
maintain our "respect for life" in the face of poverty and hardship.<p>

I took this to be a kind gesture of encouragement, until I returned to the
clinic for my next appointment. This same white social worker walked over to
the black expectant mother who was sitting next to me. Then she asked the young
woman in clear earshot of everyone, "Have you considered getting an
abortion?"<p>

For a moment I was totally puzzled. It was hard to believe that this was the
same person who spoke to me privately a month earlier.<p>

Then I looked at my clinic data card and noticed that <strong>someone had
mistakenly listed my race as white!</strong> (You could not necessarily
recognize the mistake just by looking at me. The other pregnant mother was more
visibly black, of course.)<p>

In the 1990's, government-sponsored health care is still dominated by affluent
white health care professionals who administer to the poor. The
African-American community does <strong>not</strong> control the public health
care system today, not even in communities that are predominantly black.<p>

Common sense should tell us that this condition of inequality is dangerous for
African-Americans when it comes to the debate over "reproductive rights", an
issue which will ultimately determine which people in society will live or die.
This debate will determine the limits on government officials
whose policy decisions are now a matter of life or death in reference to the
poor, the unborn, the elderly, and the terminally ill!<p>

Pro-choicers have convinced the public that legalized abortions are an act of
mercy toward low-income mothers. They argue that government-funded abortions
need to be more accessible to the poor.
However, this kind of argument defies all reason, if you really
think about it. The whole idea that poverty is an acceptable reason for the
murder of unborn babies has had a devastating impact on the African-American
community.<p>

Let's consider the fact that there are at least thirty million poor people in
the USA. About ten million of those poor people are black. This means that only
one out of nine white people are poor, while a whopping one out of three
African-Americans are now living in poverty.<p>

Therefore, if poverty can be used to justify the slaughter of unborn babies,
then African-Americans are the most likely people to become endangered by
legalized abortion on demand. African-Americans, who are
12% of the population, received at least 30% of the abortions in the 1980's.
The number of abortions may go even higher in the wake of government efforts to
halt the birth rate of welfare recipients. Current welfare reform proposals
will allow states to put a cap on births to mothers who receive public
assistance.<p>

Statistics like this do not indicate that abortion is really a help for the
poor. In reality, abortion is just another means for <strong>wiping out the
poor, especially if the poor person happens to be black!</strong><p>

<h1>Abortion: The Robbing of a Heritage</h1>

Abortion is racism in its ugliest form. Because of some very suave planning by
abortion supporters and providers, abortionists have eliminated more
African-American children than the KKK ever lynched. This is one truth that is
very disturbing. Think about it. From 1973 to 1992, abortionists have snuffed
out the lives of over <strong>nine million</strong> African-American children
before their first birthday. Over <strong>nine million</strong> beautiful black
children were prevented from ever having the opportunity to become artists,
musicians, doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, taxi drivers, ambulance drivers,
nurses, secretaries, senators, representatives, salesmen, sales clerks,
computer programmers, analysts, managers, waitresses, waiters, tellers,
leaders, followers, ordianry people, extraordinary people, parents,
grandparents, and ancestors. They were robbed of the most essential of all
rights -- the right to life. They were robbed of their opportunities, and those
of us who remain are robbed of their contributions to humanity.<p>

<strong>When
liberal racists defend abortion as a way to help blacks, I challenge them
to show me the bodies of the dead African-American children the abortionists
have helped.</strong><p>

When a plantation Negro says he supports abortion because he cares about the
sisters, mothers and daughters, he is a hypocrite of the lowest order. To deny
the next generation of brothers and sisters the right to live is the ultimate
self-destructing mechanism in the African-American community.<p>

The legacy and heritage we are leaving is the most important treasure we can
give our children. As African-Americans, it is our responsibility to leave a
legacy to the next generation, one upon which they may build a better life for
themselves. Many great men and women have left us a heritage, but much of our
heritage was robbed by slave owners. Two hundred years ago our African-American
heritage was robbed by a group of elitist individuals who intentionally kept us
ignorant concerning the devastating effects of slavery. Today, our heritage is
being robbed by elitist individuals who have intentionally kept us ignorant
concerning the devastating effect of abortion on our race. They are robbing us
to profit from the deaths of our sons and daughters.<p>

The time has come for people of all races, religions, creeds and nations to
stand up on behalf of the next generation of children. It is time to reclaim
what is left of a broken legacy of enduring love and strength through faith in
God.<p>

It is time to no longer use the excuse of poverty. Who knows whether or not
this is the child who will bring his family out of poverty?<p>

It is time to no longer use the excuse of having this child later. No man and
woman can ever coneive the same child twice.<p>

It is time to insist that no child ever face discrimination because of race or
place of residence. It is time that African-American men and women insist that
their children and their children's neighbors no longer be denied the
inalienable right to life and the opportunity to appreciate their heritage.<p>

There is an old African proverb which says, "No one knows whose womb holds the
chief." Have they killed the chief? I hope not, but I do know that many of the
chief's people have been destroyed in a war directed at them in their most
defenseless moments.<p>

Pro-abortion feminists lecture at universities about how violent men can be --
scratch that -- make that, how violent men <i>are</i> (as in innately). In the
opinion of some pro-choice feminists, "all men are rapists and therefore the
enemy". Yet some of these same women make demands to protect a man's (the
abortionist's) "right" to penetrate a woman's body in what amounts to
mechanical rape and kill her unborn child.<p>

How is it that the same women who speak endlessly about how women around the
world are valued less than men are shocked to find out that in places like
India, out of 8,000 fetuses aborted, 7,999 were female? (1) Why are they
surprised to find out that in countries like China, where there is a one-child
policy, baby girls are often drowned so that a couple can try for a boy? There
is no doubt that circumstances that make a woman even consider having an
abortion are traumatic, to say the least. <strong> But allowing a man to enter
her body and destroy her child is about as effective a solution to her problems
as it is when blacks retaliate against racism by burning down their own
neighborhoods.</strong><p>

<h1>Market Value</h1>

When pro-abortionists argue the need for continuing legal abortion, they often
cite the special needs of the poor. Poor women, it is said, have fewer options
when confronted with an unplanned pregnancy than those in the middle or upper
economic levels, and therefore it is unfair to deprive them of their only
alternative - abortion. The problem with this argument is that poor women could
have as many options as women with higher incomes. The reason that they do not
is that society in general and the supposedly caring advocates of abortion on
demand in particular are unwilling to extend the kind of services to poor women
(adoption counseling and temporary financial support, for instance) that other
women already have access to. The extension of these types of options are left
to the pro-life movement because pro-lifers tend to see all unborn lives as
inherently equal. Pro-abortionists, conversely, tend to measure human life in
terms of economic valuation.<p>

Although the pro-abortionists who advocate access to abortion for the poor will
not state the argument directly, what their doctrine essentially says is that a
poor life is economically not as valuable as a middle or upper class life. Poor
children, the reasoning goes, are much less likely to become doctors, lawyers,
or bankers, professions which contribute economically to society, than they are
to become violent criminals, drug addicts, or wards of the state, habits which
place an economic drain on society. In purely economic terms, then, a poor
child is simply worth less than other children. At a time when the U.S. faces a
staggering national debt and a faltering economy, some would argue that we can
hardly afford to "grow" a class of people who are likely to place further
demands upon our limited economic resources.<p>

Aside from the obvious moral repugnancy of this doctrine, there are practical
problems in attempting to measure human worth in economic terms. First,
economic measurements of human worth fail to address the intangible values of
human beings. In his insightful work "Masters of the Dream: The Strength and
Betrayal of Black America", Alan L. Keyes, PhD. contends that social scientists
who saw black Americans as failures during the sanctioned economic repression
of the post-Reconstruction era through the 1960s did so because they measured
blacks in only economic terms. What the social scientists were unable (or
unwilling) to measure were intangible values such as church-centered morality,
commitment to self-betterment, and determination to obtain education. All of
these were strengths of the black community and of individual families which
survived in spite of economic repression. The second practical flaw in
measuring human value economically is that, although the role of the social
sciences is to explain and predict, that is precisely what cannot be done in
this case. Human nature is far too complex to allow anyone to predict that a
child born in poverty will either remain in poverty, or will become an
economic drain on society even if the individual remains poor. It is quite
possible for a child born in harsh economic circumstances but infused with
those intangible values of which Keyes writes to rise above societal
expectations and achieve economic and professional success. This possibility
is part and parcel of the American dream -- to achieve greater heights than
one's parents, and to raise children who will achieve more than oneself.
Furthermore, it is a fallacy to believe that poor people are necessarily a
burden on our nation economically. Many poor people do not become criminals,
addicts, or permanent welfare recipients. They labor all their lives in an
economic status which society scorns, but pass from this earth with a dignity
that the social engineers will never quantify or comprehend. Economic
measurements, then, simply fail to account for human potential.<p>

<hr>

I remember it wel, it was a very cold Janunary 21st night, last year. We all
gathered in front of the Hamilton County Court House in unity to send our
fellow pro-life supporters
to Washington, D.C. to particpate the March for Life '95.<p>

It wasn't much different this year. We all gathered in front of that same court
house. Songs were sung, prayers were prayed. Some held candle while others held
signs: "choose life" and "love them both". We were there again to send
off those who once again
saw fit to go to our nation's capitol to display their sadness and
disagreement with the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision. Everything was pretty
much the same this year as it was the previaus year, which is unfortunate.<p>

I had hoped that the media would show just one African-American that attended
the send-off. It didn't have to be me or my son (although we stood in front
of a camera on purpose, just as we did last yesr). It could have been
any number of African-Americans that were there that night.<p>

Without fail, I went home and turned on the news. Low and behold, once again
it happened. The media had once again edited out shots of African-Americans
who had joined white pro-lifers in the same belief that the unborn should have
a right to life. (Not only black babies or white babies but all unborn
babies.)<p>

I wonder why the media is so afraid to show blacks and whites agree an an issue
that is meant to divide us. Maybe they are afraid that we might unite on
other issues. Or perhaps they are afraid that African-American viewers will
come to seethat abortion also effects us as a peaple. (After all, most abortion
mills are set up in predominately black neighborhoods.)<p>

Whatever the media's reason for not showing the Blacks For Life that cold
January night last year or this year, I'll never know for sure, but what I
do know is that we were there,
if not in large numbers then certainly in the spirit of love, peace, hope and
most of all life.<p>

<h1>Why Anti-Abortion Demostrators Turn Violent</h1>

<hr>

In the late 1960s, a political scientist named Ted Robert Gurr wrote a
book entitled <i>Why Men
Rebel</i> (Princeton University Press, 1970). In this work, Gurr argued
essentially that people who choose
violent rebellion are led to do so when they experience what he termed
"relative deprivation". This
phenomena occurs when people perceive that there is something in life
which they a) deserve to obtain, b)
have seen other segments of society obtain, and c) feel that they
would be able to obtain were it not for the
blockage by their government or society of their efforts to achieve
their goal. These people also feel that
there is no other means of effectively changing the conditions of
their situation other than violent rebellion.
Although some sociologists found fault with Gurr's work because of his
inability to document the point at
which the sociological phenomena of relative deprivation was
transferred into the choice to utilize a
political means of solution (i.e. political will), I believe that
Gurr's hypotheses were correct. People
become angry when they see that their ability to function as full
members of society is being held captive
by others. If they do not possess any other outlet for correcting this
situation, they resort to violence.<p>

Although the first social condition which we may think of as being a
prime target for change
through violence is lack of economic opportunity, I would posit that
another likely point of frustration for
individuals which may lead them to violent action is the lack of a
political voice. People who live in
poverty can blame their circumstances at least partially on ambiguous
economic factors that seem to be
beyond the control of any particular person or segment of society.
However, when a group of people has
organized as a political entity and attempted to impact society with
their message but are denied the ability
to do so by the opposing political powers, cultural establishment, or
media of the society in which they
live, they may experience relative deprivation and feel that the only
means by which they may hope to
obtain a political voice is through violence.<p>

It is a fact that the American cultural establishment, government, and
media have attempted to
deprive the pro-life movement of a voice. Hollywood actors and
producers have made a number of films
for television that are extremely sympathetic to the pro-abortion
cause. The Madison Avenue fashion
industry has also given of its resources to the pro-abortion cause,
such as a late 1980s ad for Esprit
clothing that suggested we "keep abortion legal unless George Bush is
available to babysit". The U.S.
government has also done its share to heap favor upon the
pro-abortionists by applying the same laws
which it used to stop violence by the Ku Klux Klan and to prosecute
Mafia bosses to pro-life
demonstrators, effectively lumping those who feel that abortion is
wrong into the same moral categories as
racists and criminals. Further, newspaper and television media have
given biased friendly coverage to the
pro-abortion establishment, while failing to investigate the
sometimes-deadly medical malpractice at clinics
or to mention any of the work done by pro-lifers to economically and
emotionally support women who
choose to keep their unplanned babies.<p>

Are those anti-abortion activists who turn to violence justified? No.
Although they have correctly
perceived the attempts by the establishment cultural, political, and
media entities to deny the pro-life
movement a political voice and they may be extremely frustrated by the
overwhelming bigotry on the part
of these groups, those who turn to violence are wrong. Violence is not
our only option. In spite of the
clear attempt to deny our political voice on the part of these
societal forces, the pro-life movement is
finding ways around that blockage. Pro-lifers continue to demonstrate
at clinics in spite of restrictions.
We have established what amounts to an alternative, "underground"
press system with newsletters and
<a href="../links.htm">computer web-sites</a>.
We host speakers anywhere we can -- in schools,
churches, and at civic meetings -- to
get our message across in spite of the media black-out on our positive
activities. Pro-life members of the
artistic community have lent their talents to us for use on billboards
and bumper stickers, and those with
financial resources, such as the Arthur DeMoss Foundation, are
presenting the pro-life message in paid
media advertisements. In spite of an orchestrated, well-funded, and
pervasive effort to deny us an
opportunity to articulate our beliefs, the establishment has failed.
We will continue to have a voice, and
we will do so without violence.<p>

<hr>

I wish I had a dollar for every time that I've
been asked that
question.<p>

That's not to imply that it's a dumb question.
I must have asked that same question a hundred
times myself.
Speaking for myself, "Where are all the
black folks?" is more a cry of pain rather
than a question.<p>

Allow me to explain. I know that there are
black pro-lifers out there other than myself.
Why don't we see them? I believe it's
because the "powers that be" are scared
stiff of what would happen if blacks and
whites were to unite around this, the most
basic of all issues that has ever confronted
mankind or womankind.<p>

Therefore, you hardly ever hear about
black pro-life politicians like J.C. Watts.
Mr Alan Keyes isn't allowed to participate
in the presidential debate, despite the fact
that he was a candidate. And when an
African-American who is pro-life becomes
popular, such as Supreme Court justice
Clarence Thomas, he is portrayed as a
womanizing "Uncle Tom."<p>

Tens of thousands of Americans boarded buses and went to Washington,
D.C., for the annual march, but the media just happened
"overlook", two years in a
row, the main speaker -- who is African-American.
Naturally this only goes to "reaffirm"
that there aren't any blacks in the pro-life movement.<p>

Using the "tree in a forest" analogy, if
there's an African-American who is fighting
to protect the life of the unborn and no one sees
her, does that mean that she does not exist?<p>

What we do see are people like Faye Wattleton, Joycelyn
Elders, Alice ("The Color Purple") Walker
and Jesse Jackson, all of whom support the
"right" to kill little black and white babies.
Given this scenario, I guess it's only natural
for pro-lifers to ask, "Where are all the black
folks?"<p>

It has always been Blacks for Life's
policy to be "informational, not confrontational."
We've always tried to address various
issues (especially as they pertain to Blacks
in the pro-life movement)
in a manner which will foster a calmer climate whereby
we can, hopefully, get more people to see
that we are not the "raving maniacs" that
the media often portray us as.<p>

Having said that, enough is enough! It
seems as though the whole world has lost its
mind. We've entered a world where "good"
and "bad" are a matter of personal choice and
"common sense" is as common as the North
American Yak.<p>

Take for examples the following cases:
<ol>
<li>A five year old kid gets tossed out of school for
kissing a girl on the
cheek.
<li>Another child gets in trouble for <i>not</i>
writing a school paper in which the teacher
tells the class to "make a deal with the devil".
(Please keep in mind that the children are
forbidden to pray or
write about God.)
<li>A grandmother was handcuffed and arrested
for putting money in a parking meter for a
total stranger.
<li>Two girls were suspended. One for taking midol
for cramps and the other for giving it to
her.
</ol>

Prayers are not only forbidden in public schools, but a
new ruling forbids college football players
from kneeling to give thanks to God after
having scored a touchdown.
Meanwhile, a professional baseball
player can spit on an umpire and is allowed
to continue to play in the playoffs (earning
extra money, plus a shot at a championship.)<p>

As you can see, the same type of "logic"
that so many people have use to "legitimize"
abortion has now spread to so many
facets of our everyday life.<p>

Jesse Jackson, a minister, who is supposed to know
scripture backwards and fowards; the man
who march with Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., and refused to exchange violence for
violence, now says he supports the right to take the life of
an unborn baby. And Faye Wattleton has been
quoted as saying that Margaret Sanger is the
lady that she would
like to emulate.
Read <i>Margaret Sanger: Father of
Modern Society</i> by Elasah Drogin to
find out how African-Americans
fit into Sanger's plans.<p>

Our laws and "logic" have been twisted
so much that it's legal to kill a child before
they are born or an "unuseful" elderly
person. My wife likes to say that there's no
longer any such thing as good or bad, there are
only good and bad lawyers.
She may be right, but I would like to
think that the day will come when we rise
above it all and regain -- as my parents used to
say -- the sense that the good Lord gave us.<p>

I don't know. Is it me, or has the whole
world lost its mind?<p>

The earth is frequently compared to an overcrowded
lifeboat. Just how crowded is it?<p>

Suppose the earth really was the size of a lifeboat.
How many people would be on it? Let's assume that each person on the
lifeboat has the same amount of space that the average person on earth has in
real life.<p>

We could quibble over how big a "lifeboat" is. Do we mean some little two-man
(oops, two-<strong>person</strong>) dingy,
or some much larger boat? Well, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have
a fairly large lifeboat. Let's assume our lifeboat is, say ...<p>

Imagine a family of four living on a one-acre lot. That sounds like a decent
amount of living space. I'm sure you wouldn't consider them to be living in
overcrowded conditions. But by global standards, they are. Their property is
twenty-eight times as crowded as the world average.<p>

The total land area of the earth, not including Antartica, comes to seven acres
per person.<p>

By the way, personally I have a family of seven living on a half-acre. That's
one-fourteenth of an acre per person, or ninety-eight times as crowded as the
world average.<p>

<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><p>
<hr>

Since we posted our original <a href="7acres.htm">Living Space</a> article, we
have received a number of objections to it. These objections can be summarized
as two main points:<p>

<ol>
<li>It is unrealistic to compare the available land per person to a typical
housing plot, as people use land for many things besides a simple house and
backyard. Some portion of the world's land is being used to grow food for any
given person, to mine the metals he uses, etc etc.
<li>Not all of the world's land is suitable for habitation. For example, we
should have excluded deserts, mountains, and other uninhabitable areas from our
calculation.
</ol>

In reply to the first argument: this is absolutely true. A complete analysis of
the maximum "carrying capacity" of the world would certainly have to take more
into account than simply whether or not people had enough space to have a
nice-sized yard.
(See, for example, our articles on
<a href="food.htm">The Food Crisis</a> and
<a href="oil.htm">The Energy Crisis</a>.) Nevertheless, population limitation
advocates frequently argue that the world is becoming too crowded by a
"standing room" test, and our point here was to rebut that argument. We freely
admit that those three short paragraphs did not rebut every conceivable
argument for population limitation that one could make.<p>

A little thought will show that the second argument contradicts the first.
That is, how can people criticize us for failing to account for
all uses of land, and in the next breath criticize us for failing to exclude
land from our counts not being used for one particular purpose? Deserts,
mountains, and so forth are not by any means "useless": The most obvious
example is the Arabian Desert, which supplies a sizable percentage of the
world's oil. And people <i>do</i> live in "uninhabitable" areas, like the
Eskimos and oil workers who live in Alaska.<p>

But let's accept this criticism for the sake of argument and revise our
calculation.<p>

World population is about 5 billion. Total land area of the earth, excluding
Antartica, is about 34 billion acres. That gives the
7 acres per person that we stated in the original article.<p>

If we eliminate land classified as "polar" other than Antartica, mostly some
islands and the northern fringes of Asia and North America, that would take out
1.3 billion acres. The world's deserts total about 4.7 billion acres. I wasn't
able to find any figures on the area taken up by all the world's mountains.
Clearly the most sprawling mountain range in the world is the Himalayas, which
occupy about 300 million acres. Suppose for the sake of argument that the
Rockies, Andies and miscellaneous other peaks total another 300 million.
(Probably a very generous estimate.)<p>

Add all that together and we come up with 6.6 billion acres.
Lets be even more generous and round up to 7 billion. Subtract that from our
original 34 billion leaves 27 billion, or still about 5 1/2 acres of reasonably
pleasant, habitable land per person, or 22 acres for a family of four.<p>

Okay, some land is used for purposes other than back yards. 4 billion
acres are used for farming. I am hard-pressed to come up with any other
major use of land. Roads and parking lots take up less than 1% of the
United States -- probably much less in the rest of the world. Stores and
offices? Surely less than the roads and parking lots that surround them. So
let's be wildly pessimistic and assume that all economic uses take up as
much land as farms, another 4 billion acres. Subtract 8 billion from the 27
billion of our previous paragraph leaves 19 billion acres, or still almost 4
acres per person, or 16 acres for a family of four. Even making all these
concessions, the world still looks pretty roomy.<p>

<html><title>Overpopulation: The Landfill Crisis</title>
<h1><img src="trash.gif">The Landfill Crisis</h1>

Return to <a href="overpop.htm">Overpopulation</a> |
<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><p>
<hr>

Are we running out of resources? You frequently hear statistics which, it
is claimed, prove that some resource is near exhaustion. When you hear such
claims, perhaps you should carefully examine the logic.<p>

For example, a few years ago the news media in Ohio reported that Ohio was
running out of landfill space. One radio report that I heard said that "all
available landifll space in the state" would be filled in five years.<p>

Think about that for a moment. What does that mean? It sounds like it means
that every square foot of the state not already taken up by houses or factories
or roads would be buried under trash within five years. That's pretty hard to
believe. I live in one of the more crowded parts of the state, and just driving
to work every day I pass many acres of open land. Granted some of this
land may not be suitable for landfills for a
variety of reasons --
dangerous chemicals would be likely to leak into ground water or some such.
But there are still millions of acres of open land in Ohio.<p>

The factual basis behind the story was that the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency had estimated that all of the space which had already been purchased,
prepared, and approved by regulatory agencies for use as a
landfill site would be filled in five years.
Now a little thought will show that this is no reason for alarm or even
surprise.
Suppose you are an employee of a waste disposal
company in charge of
managing landfills. How much land will you buy for this purpose? Presumably
you'll make some estimate of how much trash you will have to dispose of, and
then buy enough landfill space to meet your needs for some reasonable period of
time, maybe five or ten or twenty years. Under normal circumstances
it would be foolish to acquire more land than this, because you'd just be
tying up money that could be invested better elsewhere. (If nothing else, you'd
be better to put your money in the bank for twenty years and collect interest,
rather than buy land you don't need and pay upkeep and property taxes.)
If every trash company in the state buys enough for 10 years at a time, and
doesn't buy more until that
is almost filled, then on the average we'd have 5 years of available
capacity.<p>

That warning came out in 1988. It's been more than five years, and I don't see
garbage piling up in my back yard. So if
you're wondering what
happened, I'll tell you: The state legislature passed laws encouraging cities
to reduce the amount of trash they produced and loosened some
regulations to make it easier to open new
and larger landfills.
According to an article from the May 15, 1994 Columbus
Dispatch, "Ohio has enough landfill space to take 10 years worth of trash. And
space for another eight years worth of trash is already approved but not
opened. Add another 10 years worth of space under review." The article went on
to say that the companies that run these landfills are now furiously cutting
their prices to try to attract business from each other, and environmentalists
are concerned that these low prices may reduce the incentive to recycle.<p>

Population control activists routinely argue that the world cannot continue to
support an ever-increasing population. Resources are finite, and they are
starting to run out, or will run out soon.<p>

Perhaps the most important resource is food. The consequences of running out of
food are surely more dire than running out of almost any other resource. So
let's take a look at the present state and future prospects of the world's food
supply.<p>

Thomas Malthus wrote one of the first books advocating population control, in
1798. It bore the catchy title, <i>
An Essay on the Principle of Population as it Affects the
Future Improvement of Society</i>.
He analyzed the situation as follows: Population growth is dependent on the
current population -- the more people there are at any given time,
the more children will be born, and the population will grow faster and faster
every year.
This is called "exponential growth". But food
production is limited by available land, water for irrigation, and so on. These
things are finite. At best food production might increase by the same amount
every year. This is called "arithmetic growth". But eventually even that rate
of growth will be impossible to maintain, as available land, water, and so on
are used up, and increases in food production must start to taper off.
Thus, with the number of people growing faster
and faster, and food production growing slower and slower,
sooner or later it will simply be
impossible to feed all the people, and there will be mass starvation.<p>

In Malthus time the population of Britain was about 11 million, which he
considered the country was just barely able to feed. He wrote that the idea
that the nation could feed double this number, or 22 million, was "probably a
greater increase than could with reason be expected". To support double this
again, or 44 million, would be "impossible to suppose", and that this
impossibility "must be evident to those who have the slightest acquantance with
agricultural subjects".[1] Britain today has a population of 58 million[2],
who do not appear to be starving.
(Our data processing manager at Ohio Right to
Life is an immigrant from England. I suppose he fled to escape the famines.)<p>

What was wrong with Malthus analysis?
He was essentially correct about population growth: it does indeed tend
to increase exponentially. But he was
completely wrong about food production. The following chart shows what Malthus
expected to happen to food production,
and what has actually happened. I use wheat as the example because
it is a basic food eaten by people all over the world, and
statistics on world production are readily available.[3]<p>

<img src="wheat.gif"><br>

The line labelled "Malthus" shows food production as Malthus predicted it would
be: starting out as a straight-line increase and gradually tapering off.
The line labelled "Actual" shows food production as it actually was: increasing
at a faster and faster pace.<p>

Population control advocates today admit that Malthus was overly pessismistic,
but they still hold to his basic ideas. They continue to warn that the disaster
is almost upon us. Occassionally some will even say that it is already
beginning. For example, Paul Ehrlich, one of the leading population control
advocates, recently wrote that "40,000
children die daily from hunger-related diseases".[4] This comes to 14.6 million
per year. It's not clear where he gets this number from, as no one is keeping
such statistics on a global basis. Presumably most of these starvation deaths
must be occurring in the developing world -- few people in the US or Europe are
dying of starvation. But according to UNICEF, about 12.9 million children in
the developing world die each year, of all causes combined. Of these, UNICEF
claims that 8.1 million could be prevented with proper medical care, primarily
vaccines.<p>

But as the population grows there is less and less food to go around,
right? Well, let's see. The following chart shows world food production per
person since 1950, based on the United Nations computation of the total of all
types of food.[5]<p>

<img src="foodper.gif"><p>

Hmm. According to the United Nations figures, since
World War II, world food production per person has
increased by 30%. Note we are not saying that food production has increased by
30%, but food production <i>per person</i>. And even this incredible
increase is surely less than what could be done. For the overwhelming majority
of Americans and Europeans, the problem is not that they have too little to
eat, but that they eat too much. So there is no need for food production for
these people to increase. If we just look at the developing countries, where
some people may really need more food, production
has increased 38%.<p>

How is it possible to continue to increase production year after year like
this? For most of history,
and even today in many parts of the world, the major limit on food production
is the number of farmers available to work the land. As the population grows,
so does the number of farmers. In addition,
what's really enabled the increase of the
last few decades has been the so-called "Green Revolution": irrigation,
selective breeding of improved crops, and fertilizer. When I was originally
researching this topic
I happened to come across a list of the leading exporters of
various foodstuffs. One showed the top ten wheat exporters. I could have
guessed most of them: the US, France, Canada, Australia, etc. But #10 was quite
a surprise: Saudi Arabia. That's really a place you think of as lush farmland,
isn't it? They now export over $200 million worth of wheat each year.[6]<p>

Some argue that these advances have now reached their limits, that all
that was accomplished was postponing the disaster, and that we are now once
again pushing the limits. Well, it would surely be pessimistic to assume that
after decades of advances, agricultural technology is now going to
stop dead. But even if it did, we could just plant more crops. The UN came out
with a study back in 1970, which is a little out-of-date but there is no reason
to believe things have changed much since then, on how much land in the world
is suitable for agriculture. If you assume that we are not going to
cut down any forests or make other major changes to the landscape, there are
about 4.4 billion hectares. Of this, 1.4 billion, or less than a third, are
actually being used to grow crops.[7]

<h1>Overpopulation and Standard of Living</h1>

<hr>

Clearly, natural resources are finite.
While a very sparsely populated country might have so many natural resources to
spare that an increase in population would hardly be noticed, as population
grows each person will only be able to use a smaller and smaller share of the
resource "pie". Thus, larger populations inevitably lead to lower standard of
living.<p>

While researching the subject of overpopulation recently, I thought about
this argument. It is surely overly simplistic, for of course there are many
factors that go into standard of living other than population density. But
still, it stands to reason that at a certain level of crowding, this factor
would begin to outweigh all others. But, I wondered, just what is this level?
Countries on Earth have widely differing population densities, so we should be
able to get at least a rough idea of the point at which overcrowding begins to
really hurt standard of living.<p>

My research on this is easily verified. I simply looked at the population, land
area, and gross national product of various nations listed in my <i>1995
Information Please Almanac</i>.<p>

I started by looking for the four most densely populated countries in the
world, and the four least densely populated. These turned out to be:<p>

<table border>
<caption><b>Most and Least Densely Populated Countries</b></caption>
<tr><th>Country     <th>Density (people / squre mile)
  <th>Per Capita GNP (US Dollars)
<tr><td>Macao       <td align=right>66,666 <td align=right> 6,900
<tr><td>Monaco      <td align=right>42,477 <td align=right>16,000
<tr><td>Malta       <td align=right> 3,279 <td align=right> 7,600
<tr><td>Bahrain     <td align=right> 2,500 <td align=right> 7,800
<tr>
<tr><td>Botswana    <td align=right>     6 <td align=right> 2,450
<tr><td>Mauritania  <td align=right>     6 <td align=right>   555
<tr><td>Suriname    <td align=right>     6 <td align=right> 3,300
<tr><td>Mongolia    <td align=right>     4 <td align=right>   800
</table><p>


Hmm. Every single one of the four most densely populated countries has a higher
standard of living then every single one of the least densely populated.<p>

Well, okay, but the densely populated countries in this list are all very
small. Perhaps that makes them special cases. Maco, Malta, and Monaco all
consists essentially of one city with little surrounding land.<p>

So let's look at it another way. Let's look at the four richest countries, and
the four poorest countries. This gives us:<p>

<table border>
<caption><b>Richest and Poorest Countries</b></caption>
<tr><th>Country     <th>Density (people / squre mile)
  <th>Per Capita GNP (US Dollars)
<tr><td>Japan         <td align=right> 857 <td align=right>34,000
<tr><td>Norway        <td align=right>  34 <td align=right>23,500
<tr><td>Liechenstein  <td align=right> 492 <td align=right>22,300
<tr><td>Switzerland   <td align=right> 439 <td align=right>22,300
<tr>
<tr><td>Sudan         <td align=right>  29 <td align=right>   180
<tr><td>Cameroon      <td align=right>  71 <td align=right>   130
<tr><td>Ethiopia      <td align=right> 124 <td align=right>   130
<tr><td>Eritrea       <td align=right>  77 <td align=right>   115
</table><p>

(In case you're wondering what happened to the United States, we're number
5.)<p>

Again, surprise! Norway is a very sparsely populated country,
but the other 3 richest countries are all well above
the world average (94 people per square mile).
The richest nation, Japan, is one of the most crowded in the world.
Of the poorest countries, only Ethiopia is
above the world average.
Cameroon and Eritrea are well below average, and Sudan is extremely sparse.<p>

If we actually look at the facts, then, in practice
high population density is associated with wealth, and sparse
population with poverty!<p>

This is so contrary to what you normally hear that we must ask how it
could possibly be true. Is this just a statistical fluke, or is their a reason
for it?<p>

Let's go back to Economics 101. What is it that increases people's
standard of living? Why do people in the developed world live so much better
today than they did a hundred or a thousand years ago?<p>

There is little debate among economists on this question. There are two
simple answers: specialization and technological innovation.<p>

Specialization is the idea that if you concentrate on doing what you're
good at, let other people concentrate on what they're good at, and then share
the
results, everyone will be better off than if each had tried to do a little bit
of everything. For example, suppose that you're very good at repairing cars,
and your neighbor is very good at gardening. Meanwhile, your neighbor can't
figure out how to open the hood, and you can't grow dandelions. If you and your
neighbor could work out an agreement where you'd repair his car in exchange for
him taking care of your garden, you would both come out ahead. Try to get more
people and more skills involved and making all these trades quickly gets
out of hand, so today we usually use money at each step rather than trying to
arrange individual deals, but money is just a handy portable measure of skill
and labor.<p>

The more people there are, the more it is possible to specialize. This can
lead to drudgery, of course, like the classic picture of the factory worker who
spends his whole life screwing in the third bolt on the left hand door. But if
done right it means people have more and more opportunity to spend their time
doing things they enjoy and are good at, and they can leave other tasks to
people who like that.<p>

The other contributor to wealth is technological advance. Technology is
applied knowledge. A better tool, a better way of doing things. Now remember
those "word problems" you had in math class? Let's try one.
An inventor spends 2000 hours designing a new tool. This tool is then used
by 10,000 people. Each of those people saves 3 hours per year (to get the same
amount of work done) because of the new tool. Question: How long would it have
taken the inventor to design the tool, if 20,000 people will use it?<p>

Obviously, the amount of time the inventor must spend has nothing to do
with how many people will use his new idea.<p>

Problem 2: Suppose that in a society of 1,000,000 people, there are 10
inventors. How many inventors would we expect to find in a society of 2,000,000
people?<p>

The answer is surely 20. The more people there are, the more scientists
and inventors we can expect. Of course there's more to it than that -- there
are issues like education and communication and culture.
But all else being equal, more people means more scientists and inventors,
yet each scientific discovery or invention does each person at least as much
good no matter how many times we multiply the population. So a high population
is likely to lead to a higher level of technology, which means more wealth for
everyone.<p>

So it should not really be surprising at all that more densely
populated countries also tend to be wealthy countries. Is there some point at
which crowding and resource consumption would overwhelm these good effects of
more people? Probably. But the evidence shows that with present technology,
that point is above the population density of the most crowded countries
presently on earth. And by
the time our population has grown that much, surely technology will also have
advanced.<p>

I recently came across a warning from the Interior Department
that the United States will run out of oil in 13 years.
Oil is one of the favorite "case studies" of population control activists who
seek to prove that we are running out of resources. It is probably where we
would be most likely to find a problem, as unlike most resources,
oil is consumed quickly and can't be recycled
-- once you burn it, it's gone.<p>

Nevertheless, I wouldn't be too concerned about this particular warning.
It was issued in 1939.<p>

The government has not had a very good track record predicting when we'll
run out of oil. They've been predicting that we just had a few years supply
left since at least 1866.<p>

In 1885 the US Geological Survey concluded that it was
unlikely that any oil would ever be found in California. California has since
produced about 20 billion barrels.<p>

In 1891 the US Geological Survey concluded that it was unlikely that any oil
would ever be found in Kansas or Texas. (American oil companies have foolishly
ignored their own government and spent millions of dollars drilling for oil in
Texas.)<p>

Today the United States has proven reserves
of about 25 billion barrels, and we are consuming about 3 billion barrels per
year. So our proven reserves will last only eight more years! Pretty scary,
eh?<p>

At least until you know the definition of "proven reserves".
It is the amount of oil which has actually been located, and which can be
extracted from the ground economically. This is a very useful definition for
an oil company -- it tells them how much oil they know they have available to
sell. Of course there is oil which has not yet been discovered, but no one
knows how much or whether your company will be the ones to find it or when.
Also note the key word "economically". Much oil has been discovered which is in
very small pockets, or very deep underground, or under the oceans, or in remote
places. Such oil is sometimes not practical to extract from the ground because
it would cost more to get it out than one could get by selling it. What can be
extracted economically depends on technology and market conditions.
If you are
an oil company and you find oil which would cost $25 a barrel to pump out, and
current prices are $20 a barrel, that oil is effectively useless to you. But as
technology improves, the cost of extracting this oil will go down. Indeed, in
close cases a simple change in price could add much oil to our stock of proven
reserves.<p>

So in fact, while our present proven reserves are 25 billion barrels,
the Department of Energy recently issued a report estimating that there were at
least 99 billion barrels of oil in the US which could be extracted with
existing technology for $20 a barrel or less. Given their past record this is
probably a very pessimistic estimate, but let's run with it for a moment. They
go on to give their estimates of total reserves given reasonable technological
advances, and if prices were to increase:<p>

<table border><caption>
<h2 align=center>US Oil Reserves</h2>
<p align=center>Estimates from US Department of Energy
</caption>
<tr><th>             <th>present technology  <th>new technologies
<tr><th>$20 / barrel <td align=right>99      <td align=right>142
<tr><th>$27 / barrel <td align=right>130     <td align=right>204
</table>

The bottom line: The US as at least 204 billion barrels of oil. That's
enough oil to last us 75 years!<p>

Still, though, we are using up our available oil. Over time, proven reserves 
have been falling, as oil is used up. Obviously so, right?<p>

No, sorry, that's wrong. The following graph shows the total world proven oil
reserves from 1981 to 1993.<p>

<img src="oilresrv.gif"><br>
<font size=-1>Source: <i>Oil Industry Outlook 1994</i>, Robert Beck (editor,
<i>Oil &amp; Gas Journal</i>), Tulsa OK, 1994</font><p>

Over the long haul, proven reserves are <i>increasing</i>, not decreasing.
New discoveries and technological advance continue to make new oil available
faster than it is burned up.<p>

In researching this article, I was interested to note that people in the oil
industry aren't worried about running out of oil to sell. They are worried
about the price of oil falling as production increases faster than demand.<p>

The media routinely report (at length) on acts of violence by pro-life
extremists. Ok, but why don't they give the same kind of coverage to violence
by pro-abortion extremists? You weren't aware there were violent pro-abortion
extemists? Of course not -- the media don't report on them.<p>

To take an example quite close to home for us here at Ohio Right to Life ...<p>

On the morning of April 27, 1994, Ohio Right to Life's chief lobbyist, Jan
Folger, got into car, started the engine, and turned in her seat to look behind
her as she backed out the driveway. When she turned to look forward again, she
saw a line of flame in her driveway. She jumped out of the car just as it burst
into flames.<p>

Jan escaped unharmed, though the car was completely gutted. Police
investigators ruled out accident or mechanical problems and classified the case
as "arson". The perpetrator was never caught.<p>

<hr>

Sex education has become a standard part of the curriculum of schools
throughout America. The goal is to teach
teenagers to practice "safe sex" -- that is, to use condoms or other birth
control devices -- and so reduces the chance that they will become pregnant or
become infected with a venereal disease.<p>

Occassionally supporters of sex education will argue that such programs reduce
teen sexual activity. But more often they
strongly oppose the idea of suggesting that teens should abstain
from sex outside marriage, as this would violate the "separation of church and
state". Besides, they explain, teens are going to have sex regardless of what
their parents or teachers tell them, so the only practical thing to do is to
try to reduce the damage when they <i>do</i> have sex.<p>

Does sex education result in more or less teen sexual
activity? Even if it does not
reduce the total activity, does it at least result in teens practicing more
"safe sex"?<p>

Planned Parenthood conducted a landmark study of this subject back in 1986.
Planned Parenthood is, of course, one of the leading advocates of more and
earlier and more explicit sex education, and so if their study
is at all biased, it would surely be on the side of the benefits of sex
education.<p>

In reporting the results of their study, they pointed out that teens who had
gone through what Planned Parenthood considered a "comprehensive" sex education
program were significantly more likely to use birth control.
Thus, they trumpeted, comprehensive sex education is a resounding success.<p>

By the way: They
defined "comprehensive" sex education as a program that included at least
four of six categories: biology of reproduction, coping with sexual
development, different types of birth control, preventing sexual abuse,
abortion, and where to get contraceptives. As three of the six are abortion and
birth control (note its mentioned twice), for a program to be labeled
"comprehensive" it had to discuss birth control and/or abortion.<p>

Assuming that the numbers they report in the "back of the book" are accurate,
it is true that sex education <i>does</i> result in
greater use of birth control. But a close examination of the numbers reveals
that this does not mean what Planned Parenthood would like you to think it
means.<p>

Planned Parenthood reported the results of their study as follows:<p>

<table border>
<caption><b>Chart 1</b></caption>
<tr>
<th> <th>Had sex <th>No sex
<th width=5%>
<th>Sex WITH<br>birth control <th>Sex WITHOUT<br>birth control

This is an odd way to present the statistics, as it does not allow us to
readily compare the sexual behavior of students who did and did not go
through "comprehensive sex education". However, there is sufficient information
here to
allow us to compute the percentages in a different way. (For the mathematically
inclined or those who question the accuracy of the following chart, I explain
how I came up with this chart at the end of this article.)<p>

<table border>
<caption><b>Chart 2</b></caption>
<tr>
<th>
<th>Comprehensive<br>sex ed <th>Non-comprehensive<br>sex ed <th>No sex ed

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>No sex <td>54% <td>70% <td>68%

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Had sex <td>46% <td>30% <td>32%

<tr><td><td><td><td>

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Sex WITHOUT birth control <td>19% <td>17% <td>17%

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Sex WITH birth control <td>24% <td>13% <td>12%

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Sex, birth control unknown <td>3% <td>0% <td>3%
</table><p>

Note that the bottom section shows the percentage of the TOTAL teens who had
sex and used birth control, not just the percentage of those who had sex.<p>

Studying the data in this form reveals a couple of interesting facts:<p>
<ul>
<li>Teens who went through what Planned Parenthood considered "comprehensive
sex education" -- i.e. a "good" program" -- were over 50% more likely to be
sexually active. (From 30% to 46%.)
<li>These teens were almost twice as
likely to engage in "safe sex" (from 13% to 24%). This agrees with Planned
Parenthood's boasts.
<li>But ... they were still slightly MORE likely to engage in "unsafe sex" (17%
versus 19%).
</ul>
In other words: Yes, Planned Parenthood - style sex education teaches teens to
practice "safe sex". But what they give up is not "unsafe sex", it's sexual
abstinence. And so we end up with the worst of both worlds: more immorality AND
more teen pregnancy and venereal disease.<p>

Of course, Planned Parenthood gets government grants to hand out contraceptives
to teenagers. And, as the above study indicates, sex education is bringing them
a lot of business.<p>

<hr>
<font size=-1>
Chart 2 was derived from Chart 1 as follows:<p>

Note that they provided the actual number for each column of percentages. We
can thus compute the number of teens represented by each percentage by
multiplying the percentage by the number at the top of the column. This gives
the following chart:<p>

<table border><caption><b>Chart 1.5</b></caption>
<tr>
<th><th>Had sex <th>No sex
<td width=5%>
<th>Sex WITH<br>birth control <th>Sex WITHOUT<br>birth control

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Total number of teens
<td>350 <td>600 <td> <td>160 <td> 168

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Comprehensive sex ed
<td>161 <td>186 <td> <td>85 <td>67

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>Non-comprehensive sex ed
<td>67 <td>156 <td> <td> 29 <td> 37

<tr align=right>
<td align=left>No sex ed
<td>119 <td>252 <td> <td>45 <td>62
</table><p>

Note that totals do not always add due to rounding, and that 22 teens who had
sex did not answer questions about birth control use.<p>

We then compute percentages based on totals across instead of down to arrive at
Chart 2.<p>

The federal government spends millions of dollars on family planning programs
which are intended to reduce teen sexual activity and pregnancy. How effective
are these programs?<p>

A cynic might point out that while spending on Title X (the umbrella that
includes most of these programs) has now grown to
almost $200 million per year, teen pregnancy continues to rise. Have they
accomplished anything at all?<p>

We might get a glimpse of their effectiveness by looking at what happened in
the early 1980's. There was a dispute between the administration and Congress
over how Title X money should be spent, and they ended up actually reducing
appropriations (rare for a government program). As federal family planning
activities had to be cut back, what happened to teen pregnancy rates? (Note:
the following chart lists out-of-wedlock births and abortions rather than total
pregnancies, because that's the data actually available.)<p>

Or let's look at it graphically:<p>

<img src="titlex.gif"><p>

Hmm, that's funny. When federal spending on family planning went up,
teen pregnancy went up. When federal spending on family planning went down,
teen pregnancy went down. In fact, the two trend lines practically parallel
each other.<p>

Maybe the cynic would be right after all.<p>

<i>Since when does anyone's right to live
depend upon
someone else wanting them?</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>Shouldn't every child be wanted?

<dd>At first glance, yes! "Every Child a Wanted Child" is the famous
Planned Parenthood slogan, and who can argue? That isn't the
disagreement. It is how to achieve such a goal.<p>

We agree that every child should be wanted. A world with only
wanted children would be an idyllic place in which to live. No
one could quarrel with that as an idealistic goal. Wouldn't it
also be a wonderful world if there were no unwanted wives by
husbands, no aging parents unwanted by their children, no
unwanted Jews, blacks, Catholics, Chicanos, or ever again a
person who, at one time or place, finds himself or herself
unwanted or persecuted. Let's all try to achieve this, but also
remember that people have clay feet and, sadly, the unwanted will
probably always be with us.<p>

A second thought: Women resent that the value of a woman is
sometimes determined by whether a man wants her. Yet radical
feminists insist that the value of an unborn boy or girl is to be
determined by whether a woman wants him or her.<p>

To use being wanted by someone as a measure of whether a human
life is allowed to live is a frightening concept. Its converse
logically awaits us -- that the unwanted can be eliminated. Don't
forget, Hitler's Germany was ideal for wanted Aryans.<p>

Since when does anyone's right to live depend upon someone else
wanting them?<p>

"Every Child a Wanted Child" should be completed with "and if not
wanted, kill!" for that is exactly what that Planned Parenthood
slogan means. To thus complete the sentence removes the mask from
this misleading slogan and reveals it for the monstrous evil that
it is.

<dt>That certainly makes it sound different!

<dd>Yes, and it is of crucial importance that every time we hear that
phrase, we should add Planned Parenthood's solution . . . "and if
not wanted, kill!"<p>

Do parents kill teenagers when they are not wanted, or Uncle Joe
after his stroke, or Mom, now that she is such a burden? You say
no?<p>

Do we give the mother the legal right to kill the two-year-old
daughter who is a burden to her? No! Then why and how can we give
her the legal right to kill the two-month-old daughter living
inside her who is a burden to her?<p>

The U.S. Supreme Court and the Parliaments in many other nations
have, for the first time in modern history, granted to one
citizen (the mother) the absolute legal right to kill another, if
that first person does not want them!<p>

Think of the logic of the inevitable extension of such a freedom
to kill. We could solve poverty by killing unwanted poor people,
or religious or political groups, or those too old, too
burdensome, and on and on . . .

<dt>OK, the ethic is horrible, but unwanted pregnancies do result in
unwanted children, don't they?

<dd>No, not in any greater percentage than wanted pregnancies.
Think of your own pregnancies. Was each planned, or was this or
that one a surprise? Were you really happy each time, in the
first month or two? Be honest. In the first few weeks or months,
were all of your pregnancies really "wanted?"<p>

But now look at your children. Are you glad you have them? Would
you give any back -- have any of them killed?<p>

You've changed your mind, haven't you? For almost all of you, a
pregnancy that was truly unwanted has resulted in a dearly loved
and wanted son or daughter.<p>

If we permit abortion for an unwanted pregnancy, we will be
destroying vast numbers of children who, by the time of their
birth and through their childhood, would have been very dearly
wanted and deeply loved children indeed. If the judgment of being
wanted at an early stage of pregnancy were a final judgment, and
abortions were permitted freely, a high percentage of everyone
reading this book would never have been born.

<dt>Are there any scientific studies?

<dd>Dr. Ferriera found no relationship between unplanned pregnancies
and newborn deviant behavior. In fact, there were more deviant
babies of mothers who had planned their pregnancy than those who
had not.<br>
<font size=-2>A. J. Ferriera, "The Pregnant Woman's Emotional
Attitude and Its Reflection in the Newborn,"
<i>Amer. Jour. Orthopsychiatry,</i> vol. 30, 1960, p. 553</font><p>

"There is a contention that unwanted conceptions tend to have
undesirable effects . . . the direct evidence for such a
relationship is almost completely lacking, except for a few
fragments of retrospective evidence. It was the hope of this
article to find more convincing systematic research evidence
and to give some idea of the amount of relationship between
unwanted conception and undesired effect on children. This
hope has been disappointed."<br>
<font size=-2>E. Pohlman, "Unwanted Conception,
Research on Undesirable Consequences,"
<i>Eugenics Quarterly,</i> vol. 14, 1967, p. 143</font><p>

"It is clear that mothers who initially believed their
pregnancy to be 'the worst thing that ever happened to them'
came to feel about the same degree of affection for their
children as the mothers who were initially 'ecstatic' about
the pregnancy.<p>

"Most women who were most regretful of the pregnancy now claim
they would have the child again if given the opportunity
[whereas] one of every six mothers who were initially pleased
with pregnancy would choose not to have the child again.<p>

"[They conclude] . . . initial feelings about pregnancy are
predictive of how a mother will eventually feel about her
child to only a very limited degree."
<font size=-2>P.
Cameron et al., "How Much do Mothers Love Their Children," Rocky
Mt. Psychological Assn., May 12, 1972</font><p>

Others have conclusively demonstrated a spontaneous change from
prepartum rejection to postpartum acceptance of their children by
a group of mothers.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Zemlich & R. Watson, "Attitudes
of Acceptance and Rejection During
and After Pregnancy," <i>Amer. Jour.
Orthopsychiatry,</i> vol. 23, 1953, p. 570</font>

<dt>What of other countries?

<dd>
<ul type=disc>
<li> Japan has had abortion-on-demand for over 35 years. It is used
there as a method of birth control, but "cases of infanticide
have been increasing so much that social workers have made
appeals to Japanese mothers in newspapers and on television not
to kill their babies."<br>
<font size=-2><i>The Sunday Times,</i> June 23, 1974</font>

<li> When Rumania reversed its law on abortion in 1966, doctors
stated that not only had they not overcome the problem of
unwanted children -- but that one of the factors which had
caused some of them to urge for changes in the law was that
there had been such an increase in the number of psychiatric
cases among lonely only- children and children of neurotic
mothers.

<li> In England the Working Party of the Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that the vast majority
of unplanned pregnancies become wanted children.

<li> Aberdeen, Scotland is a unique city because, through an unusual
law, it has had open abortion for 20 years in a nation that has
had legal abortion only one-third as long. If the availability
of abortion did reduce unwanted children, it should have the
best record in Britain. In fact, it has the worst record, with
10.2 per 1,000 abandoned, abused, and uncared for children
being supported by public agencies -- compared with the
national average of 6.6.<br>
<font size=-2>Annual Report, Chief Medical Health
Officer, Aberdeen, Scotland, 1972</font>
</ul>

<dt>Don't some studies prove the opposite?

<dd>No! In the entire world literature on this subject, there are
only two studies that attempt to show that there is a negative
effect on the children who had been "unwanted pregnancies." Both
have been conclusively shown to be invalid.<p>

The first study, from Sweden, concluded that such a child "runs
a risk of having to surmount greater mental and social handicaps
than its peers . . ."<br>
<font size=-2>Forssman & Thuwe, "One Hundred
and Twenty Children Born after
Application for Therapeutic
Abortion Refused," <i>Acta Psychiatrica
Scandinavica,</i> vol. 42, 1966, pp. 71-88</font><p>

Professor Paul Cameron has clearly shown that an evaluation of
the mothers in this study showed sufficient differences with the
control group so that the authors' conclusions were a mis-
analysis," invalid, and could have been predicted from these
differences alone, whether the pregnancy was wanted or not. There
were, incidentally, little differences anyway between the
children in the study and the control.<br>
<font size=-2>P. Cameron, "The Swedish `Children
Born to Women Denied Abortion' Study:
A Radical Criticism," <i>Psychological
Reports,</i> vol. 39, 1976, pp. 391-394</font><p>

The second study concluded that "Compulsory childbearing has
varied and sometimes unfavorable consequences for the subsequent
life of the child."<br>
<font size=-2>Dytrych et al., "Children Born
to Women Denied Abortion," <i>Family
Planning Perspectives,</i>
vol. 7, no. 4, July-Aug. 1975</font><p>

Professor Samuel Nigro, child psychiatrist at Case Western
Reserve University, has published a scathing commentary on this
study. He points to the fact that the data found and published in
the article "renders the conclusions untenable." He details the
"striking differences in the families of the two groups of
children," (the study group having more unstable mothers and
fathers than the control group), as the obvious cause for the
differences in the children.<p>

"The conclusions appear to be contrived by an abuse of
scientific method deplorable to the point of discrediting the
researchers, of discrediting the Institute which sponsored the
research, and of questioning the use of public funds for a
publication which takes such license with scientific data."<br>
<font size=-2>S. Nigro, University Hospitals
of Cleveland, Open Letter to
<i>Family Planning Perspectives,</i>
March 10, 1976</font><p>

In 1989, Henry David reported on the follow up to the above
studies and detailed certain less than catastrophic psychosocial
problems of children born after unwanted pregnancies.<br>
<font size=-2>Report to American Psychological Assn.
Meeting, "Born Unwanted -- Developmental
Effects of Denied Abortion,"
H. David, et al., Springer Co. 1988</font><p>

In another critique, Dr. Nigro has written a devastating critique
of David's study. He cites "flawed, tendentious, sorry science.
It is advocacy." Unwanted pregnancy is held up as a reason to
kill before birth. Dr. Nigro then details the "preselection
bias," among other problems in the study. Finally he notes that
even if one accepts everything Dr. David claims, that by any
measurement, the psychosocial maladjustment of these children is
minor (e.g., none have raped, robbed or assaulted anyone). Dr.
Nigro asks, "Is the record of these children so socially
destructive as to justify their deaths to prevent their
existence?"<br>
<font size=-2>Review, S. Nigro, M.D.,
Case Western Reserve,
U. of Cleveland, Sept. 1988</font>

<dt>But don't many unwanted pregnancies become battered children?
<dd>
<ul type=disc>
<li> Not so. The landmark study on this was done at the University
of Southern California. Professor Edward Lenoski studied 674
consecutive battered children who were brought to the in- and
out-patient departments of that medical center. He was the
first to go to the parents and study to what extent they wanted
and planned the pregnancy. To his surprise, he found that 91%
were planned and wanted, compared to 63% for the control groups
nationally. Further, the mothers had began wearing, on the
average, pregnancy clothes at 114 days compared to 171 days in
the control, and the fathers named the boys after themselves
24% of the time compared to 4% for the control groups.<br>
<font size=-2>E. Lenoski, <i>Heartbeat,</i> vol. 3, no. 4, Dec. 1980</font>

<li> Both parents (or parent figures) lived in 80% of the homes.
Two-thirds of the mothers were "housewives" and presumably were
at home. Almost all mothers were in the 20-30 age group, and
fathers were in the 20-35 age bracket. No special social,
racial, or economic class predominated.<br>
<font size=-2>Francis, "Child Abuse, A Nationwide
Study," <i>Amer. Humane Assn. & Child
Welfare League,</i> 1963</font>

<li> The parents commonly ". . . grew up in a hostile environment,
and were themselves abused. When the children fail to satisfy
their [unrealistic, neurotic expectations of perfection]
emotional needs, the parents react with the same violence they
experienced as children."<br>
<font size=-2>J. Walsh, IL Dept. of Child and Family
Services Newsweek, July 24, 1972</font>
</ul>

Not much has changed since these earlier investigations. There is
much that we still do not know about the sick psychology that
leads to child abuse. One thing does stand out, however:
Prenatally, these were not unwanted pregnancies, they were
super-wanted pregnancies.

<dt>I've been told that aborting unwanted babies would leave more
wanted ones and, therefore, there would be less child abuse.

<dd>Exactly the opposite has happened. In New York City during the
'60s, the number of abused children had averaged about 5,000
cases a year. Abortion was legalized in 1970. By 1975, over
25,000 cases were reported.<p>

Ontario's statistics show the same:<p>

Ohio reported 27,248 cases in 1981 and 65,965 in 1985, a 142%
increase according to a survey by the U.S. House of
Representatives Select Committee on Children, Families and Youth
for the largest state increase. The same survey reported over a
55% increase nationwide from 1981 to 1985.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Assoc. Press,</i> March 3, 1987.</font><p>

Dr. Phillip Ney, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of
Christ Church, New Zealand, while still at the University of
British Columbia, published a widely read study of this. His
analysis clearly pointed to the fact that abortion (and its
acceptance of the violence of killing the unborn) lowered a
parent's psychic resistance to violence and abuse of the born.<br>
<font size=-2>P. Ney, "Relationship Between Abortion
& Child Abuse," <i>Canada Jour. Psychiatry,</i>
vol. 24, 1979, pp. 610-620</font>

<dt>What if a mother really doesn't want the baby?

<dd>There are millions of outstretched arms aching to adopt and love
a baby. Her answer is to place the baby in a secure, loving,
adoptive home.

<dt>What of fetal abuse?

<dd>Under the present legal situation, nothing can be done while the
baby is still in the womb. A recent study has explored the
possibility of a born child suing his mother for abuse from her
chronic alcoholism while pregnant with him.<br>
<font size=-2>Machenzie et al., "A Case of
Fetal Abuse," <i>Amer. Jour.
Orthopsychiatry,</i> vol. 52,
no. 4, Oct. 1982, pp. 699-703</font>

<dt>Well, if she is refused abortion in one place, or if welfare won't
pay for it, then she will get it anyway, won't she, either legally
or illegally?

<dd>The studies show otherwise. Of a total of 6,298 women in six
different studies, only 13.2% went elsewhere for an abortion. The
studies showed no disadvantage or problems with the balance of
the pregnancy and delivery and "good acceptance of the baby and
minimal to moderate psychosocial disadvantages for the child."<br>
<font size=-2>C. Del Camps, <i>Canadian Med. Assn.
Jour.,</i> vol. 130, Feb. 15, 1984</font>

<dt>What does the Bible say?

<dd>It is doubtful whether the Lord would smile upon such fatal
selectivity as abortion for unwanted pregnancy or even upon those
who would think that sperm from Nobel Prize winners would be the
"best." God did not judge from "his appearance or his lofty
stature." No, "The Lord has not chosen any one of these," said
He, as Jesse lined up his handsome sons. Samuel asked if any were
missing. "Yes, the youngest," David, who was tending the sheep.
"Send for him," Samuel said, and when he came the Lord said,
"there -- annoint him, for this is he."<br>
<font size=-2>Samuel, 16/1, 6-7, 10-13 (31)</font><p>

Clearly, God judges not from intelligence or beauty or ability,
but rather from what each person is in their mind and heart and
what each has done with the gifts that he or she has been given.<p>

The Rev. Charles Carroll, Protestant chaplain of the University
of California at Berkeley, student of International Law at Yale,
Harvard, and the University of Berlin during the Hitler period,
and officer of the United States military government in Germany
at the trial of the Nazi doctors at Nuremberg, has stated:
"As I would reject the law of paterfamilias of ancient Rome, so
I would also reject the law of materfamilias in present-day
America. As I would not sympathize with the grant by the state
of the power of life and death of his offspring to the Roman
father, so I cannot sympathize with the grant by any state of
the power of life and death over her offspring to the American
mother. Surely, I would hope our legislators would be as
humane as the Emperor Hadrian, who abolished that article of
the Roman Law."<p>

A nation and its people will ultimately be judged not by the fact
that there are unwanted ones among them, but by what is done for
them.

<dt>What is the Survivor Syndrome?

<dd>Children usually know that mother is pregnant. They also know
when she gets unpregnant. This may cause Survivor's Syndrome,
similar to that of Jews who survived the holocaust. It is an
irrational but real guilt at "why was I saved and why were they
killed." Dr. Ney (above) has written about this.<p>

Dr. Edward Sheridan of Georgetown University has observed also a
fear and mistrust of the mother. Originally, a small child,
sensing a sibling's arrival, doesn't welcome it. "When the baby
suddenly disappears, the frightened child may get a warped sense
of his own power to 'will people away.' Or, if he knows that his
mother was an active agent in doing away with the sibling, he
begins to fear her."<br>

<h1>The Medical Establishment on Safe Sex</h1>

by Jay Johansen<p>

<hr>

I had a fascinating conversation with a nurse recently. She said that she
was working in her hospital and picked up a bag of medical waste. She
felt a sharp pain in her finger, and looked down to see that there was
a needle sticking out the side of the bag.<p>

This was cause for serious concern. No one could be sure where that needle
had been or what might be on it. The hospital quickly took a blood sample
from the nurse and rushed it down to the lab.<p>

The results indicated that she may have been infected with hepatitis.<p>

The lab technician assured her that there was no cause for panic: this
particular
test often gave false "positives". (I suppose a test that gives false
positives which can be checked out with futher tests, is better than
a test which gives false negatives leading someone to not seek treatment
that could have saved their lives.) They then sent a blood sample out
to an outside, presumably better equipped, lab for further tests.<p>

In the meantime, the lab tech gave her a list of precautions to take
to avoid infecting anyone else if she did have the disease. One of these
was: "no sex".<p>

Lest you worry, when the results came back, it was a false positive.
The nurse was not infected with hepatitis.<p>

But then she became puzzled. She called the lab tech back and asked,
"Why did you tell me 'no sex'? Why didn't you just tell me to be sure
I used a condom?"<p>

"Because that's hospital policy", she replied. "They're afraid that if
they had told you it was safe as long as you used a condom, and then
you had infected someone else, you could sue the hospital."<p>

Interesting, isn't it? The medical establishment routinely tells the
public that if they practice "safe sex", that is, use a condom, then
there's nothing to worry about -- as long as all that's at stake is your
life. But when their money is at stake, well, then they insist on a higher
level of safety. You wouldn't expect them to risk their hard-earned
money on something as fragile and unreliable as a little piece of
rubber, would you?<p>

<h1>Abortion: Questions &amp; Answers<br>PREFACE</h1>

<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><br>
<hr>

Fourteen years ago, at the insistence of many people, particularly
our college daughters, we wrote <i>Handbook On Abortion.</i> In question
and answer format, it attempted to present all of the arguments for
abortion and to answer them in a rational, medical, and scientific
way. The first edition, in June 1971, numbered 141 pages and
contained 42 scientific references arranged for the reader's
convenience immediately following the answer to a question.<p>

Its 1975 revision increased its size to 208 pages with 180
references, and the 1979 revision totalled 210 pages with 210 newer
references. In 24 printings, <i>Handbook On Abortion</i> sold over one
million copies and was translated into ten languages.<p>

But time moves on. Society's present questions remain, in many ways,
unchanged; but we must constantly rethink our answers. In addition,
a flood of new scientific information, particularly the explosion
of detailed information about the other patient (the tiny one)
through recent technology and modern research, reshapes our answers.
Historical, legislative, and legal developments must also be
incorporated into our thinking. A few earlier "facts" have been
disproved. Many new facts have been confirmed by scientific studies.<p>

Should we revise again on the framework and skeleton of the current
edition? Our decision was not to. We thought we needed a totally new
book. And so we started with blank paper and wrote afresh. Where are
we today? What questions are asked of us now? What information do
people need?<p>

It was an exciting adventure. Each topic, in turn, had us probing
our own memories, our experiences, and digging deeply into over 40
fully packed file drawers to document our answers.<p>

We have a new title, new sections and chapters probing entirely new
areas, and new questions and answers. Except for a few classic
papers, we have used new and updated scientific articles to support
our answers. We tried to keep the book brief and concise. But it
also had to be what was needed. And to fill those needs, it ended
up larger and, we're convinced, far richer and more useful.<p>

And for this book, we owe thanks to our son Joe for suggestions and
proofreading.<p>

Whether this will again become the "bible" of the Right to Life
movement, as our <i>Handbook On Abortion</i> was so often called, remains
to be seen. We live in a different time than 14 years ago. We need
new tools. We offer this new book to you as our best effort to fill
the continuing need of all pro-life activists and all men and women
who have questions and need answers.<p>

Events move fast. In only three years we've found it necessary to
revise, to update or to add almost 100 new questions.<p>

<h2>Abortion: Where It Is Today</h2>

<h3>In the UNITED STATES</h3>

Throughout the U.S.'s 200-year history, the developing baby in the
womb had been protected by law. Then, in 1967, the first state
legalized abortion for a few "hard cases."<p>

In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that as long as the baby
lived in the womb, he or she would henceforth be the property of
the mother. Further, it became legal in all 50 states to destroy
that property, for any and every reason, during the entire nine
months of pregnancy, as long as a licensed physician did the
abortion.<p>

Now, almost every third baby conceived in America is killed by
abortion, a total of over 1-1/2 million babies a year.<p>

For over a decade, the birth rate has been well under replacement
level. Except that older people are living much longer and
immigration is high, our population would be declining.<p>

<h3>CANADA</h3>

The reversal of its previous protection of unborn human life came
in Canada in 1969. Buried in a lengthy revision of the penal code
was, to many people's surprise, the legalization of abortion.<p>

It provided for "therapeutic abortion committees" in hospitals,
which would have to pass on requests for abortion. In some areas
these committees have conscientiously screened applications and
limited approvals. In many other areas, particularly major
metropolitan centers, approval is essentially automatic and
abortions can be done on-demand. Today, every sixth baby conceived
in Canada is killed in abortion and Canada's indigenous birth rate
is also below replacement level.<p>

In a shocking 5 to 2 decision in Jan. 1988, the Supreme Court
struck this law down and laid Canada open to abortion-on-demand. As
this goes to press this nation's Parliament has passed a law
allowing abortion until birth.

<h3>EUROPE</h3>

The laws vary. Germany still technically protects the unborn child,
but abortionists go unpunished. In Holland, abortion is legal.
England no longer protects the unborn, while Ireland passed the
world's first constitutional amendment protecting the unborn from
the time of conception. Italy legalized abortion in a referendum.
The Swiss cantons (counties) vary. Spain's Socialist party has
legalized abortion. Portugal legalized abortion for a few "hard
cases." France's Parliament has legalized early abortion, as has
Scandinavia's. Most Eastern-block countries are now reconsidering
their previous abortion-on-demand policies, principally because of
dropping birth rates and damage to women.

<h3>AFRICA and LATIN AMERICA</h3>

There is a lot of propaganda, and illegal abortions are being done,
especially in Latin America, but no legalization, except a few
nations, e.g., Zambia and Ghana.

<h3>NEAR EAST</h3>

There is <i>no</i> abortion in Moslem nations. In Israel the Moslem birth
rate is far above that of the Jews, who permit abortion.

<h3>ASIA</h3>

Abortions are widely practiced and legal, but customs, religion,
and the need for large families widely alters the situation,
depending on the area. China, particularly, is an open scandal,
doing compulsory abortions into the third trimester after the first
child. As many as ten million abortions were done in 1983, up to
90% of them coerced (M. Weisskopf articles, Jan. 6-8, 1985). Japan
continues its 35-year pattern of abortion-on-demand, killing almost
every other baby conceived in that nation. The Philippine
Constitution protects from conception. In reaction to its rapidly
dropping birth rate, Singapore has cut way back on abortions.

<h3>DOWN UNDER</h3>

In Australia abortion is legal by Parliamentary action, with few
restrictions in practice. Birth rates are below replacement level.<p>

New Zealand's law is much tighter, with its Society to Protect the
Unborn Child laboring mightily to hold it there.

<h3><i>The Bottom Line</i></h3>

Although many in other nations are unhappy about it, the fact is
that what the United States does about abortion will deeply
influence or even directly point the way for most other nations in
the free world. Will America maintain its present course? The
following pages will tell you why that course will almost certainly
change.

CHAPTER 2: When Does Human Life Begin?</h1>

<i>If there is one function absolutely central to the duty of a
nation-state, it is to protect the most precious possession of
its citizens -- their very lives. In order to make laws to
protect their lives, it is necessary to determine when their
lives begin. The question must be answered.</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>Where does one begin?
<dd>The question can be answered spiritually, philosophically, or
biologically. Much of today's confusion arises from mixing these
disciplines. Each is valid, but only one can be used to make law.

<dt>How is "Human Life" defined spiritually?
<dd>A religious faith belief or spiritual definition usually sees the
creation of the soul as the beginning of human life. The problem
here is that believers differ in when they think the soul is
created. There are, of course, other sincere people who do not
believe there is a soul.<p>

What is important is that in our secular nation, no one's
religious faith belief can be imposed on others through force of
law. Therefore, we cannot use a religious definition of when
human life begins as the basis for making laws.

<dt>How is "Human Life" defined philosophically?
<dd>In a myriad of ways. For example, there is not human life until
birth or until there is: a certain level of consciousness; a
certain degree of being wanted; a certain exchange of love; a
certain humanization or culturalization; a certain degree of
self-sufficiency or viability; a certain degree of physical
development; a certain degree of physical or mental perfection,
etc. Many sincere people define "human life" by these and other
criteria, all of which have certain things in common:

<ul type=disc>
<li>While admittedly arrived at through a certain reasoning
process, all of the above remain theories.

<li>None can be proven factually by science.

<li>All individuals have a right to hold their own philosophic
beliefs.

<li>People of good will can and do differ completely on the
correctness of the philosophic beliefs mentioned.
</ul>

Because these are non-provable theories and beliefs, they should
be treated the same way as religious beliefs. Just as our nation
should not impose religious faith beliefs on others through force
of law, so it should likewise not force philosophic beliefs and
theories on others through force of law.

<dt>What of a biologic definition?
<dd>This is the area where there is no disagreement -- the area where
natural science has provided proven facts. The biologic details
of human growth and development, from the single cell stage until
death, are beyond dispute.
</dl>

Any discussion of human life must first look to embryology,
fetology, and medical science. What are the known facts? Only
then can we honestly answer the central question of human life's
beginning.

Part III on Fetal Development is the most important part of this
book, for it explores in detail these biologic facts.

<h1>Abortion: Questions &amp; Answers<br>
CHAPTER 3: The Second Question</h1>

<hr>

There are only two questions that are basic to the entire abortion
controversy. The first is, "Is this human life?" As we have seen in
chapter 2 (and will further examine in Part III), the answer
clearly is Yes. That answer is a medical and scientific one, for we
cannot impose a religious or philosophic belief in our nations
through force of law.<p>

The second question is: "Should we grant equal protection by law to
all living humans in our nation?" or, "Should we allow 
discrimination against entire classes of living humans?"<p>

Has such discrimination ever been legal before? Yes, sadly so.<p>

<h3>DISCRIMINATION BY RACE</h3>

The Nazi Holocaust was a terrifying example of legal racial
discrimination. It began with the elimination of almost 300,000
Aryan German citizens who were "defective" and ended with the
elimination of 6 million members of a race that was also judged to
be "defective." (Add perhaps another 6 million Gypsies, war
prisoners, and other nationalities, e.g., Poles.)<p>

First, Jews were labeled subhuman through the use of names such as
"vermin, garbage, subhuman, trash," etc. Then, legal personhood and
equal protection by law were removed in 1936 by the Supreme Court
of Germany. Finally, the killing began. Detailed documentation is
available in <i>The German Euthanasia Program</i> (Wertham, Hayes
Publishing Co., Cincinnati [$2.50]) and <i>The Abortion Holocaust</i>
(Brennan, Landmark Press [$7.00]).<p>

<h3>DISCRIMINATION BY SKIN COLOR</h3>

In the U.S., from Colonial times, there was legal discrimination on
the basis of skin color.<p>

This ugly chapter in our history came to its legal climax with the
Dred Scott Decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857, three years
before Lincoln's election and the U.S. Civil War. In essence, it
confirmed that black people had no legal rights and were the
property of their owners. The analogy to abortion is direct.
Complete details are available on this analogy in <i>Abortion and
Slavery -- History Repeats</i> (Willke, Hayes Publishing Co.,
Cincinnati, 1984 [$3.50]).<p>

<h3>DISCRIMINATION BY AGE</h3>

If you are conceived in France, your life is legally protected
after ten weeks of life. In Denmark, it is 12 weeks. In the State
of Washington, just prior to the Roe vs. Wade Decision, life was
protected at 16 weeks; Sweden was 20. In New York, it had been 24
weeks; England was 28; and presently in the U.S., life is legally
protected only after birth. Nobel prize winner, Dr. James Watson,
has suggested "three days after birth."<p>

At first glance, one is likely to comment that all of the above
disagree. But look closer at the ethic, the logic, and the
criteria. They all agree. They agree that you can discriminate
against an entire class of living humans on the basis of age. They
just don't agree on which age.<p>

But note well that in the U.S. today there are 3.5 taxpayers for
every retired person who draws Social Security or other tax-funded
pensions. By the year 2040, there will only be 1.5 taxpayers to
support each retired person (assuming no rise in the current birth
rate). Our nation (among others) is all but bankrupt now, partly
due to such entitlement programs.<p>

This will be a completely impossible economic situation. The answer
could be rather simple and direct. Copy the ethic, the logic, and
the criteria of today's fatal discrimination on the basis of age
-- only start at the other end of the spectrum.<p>

Perhaps a court could rule that everyone over 80 years of age was
no longer a legal person. Or maybe it would have to be lowered to
75 -- or even to . . . ?<p>

<h3>DISCRIMINATION BY HANDICAP</h3>

Handicap is one of the two most accepted reasons for abortion. But
remember, before birth and after birth, it is the same patient and
the same handicap. Is it any wonder that we are increasingly seeing
the same "solution" after birth (killing by infanticide -- see
chapter 24) as before birth (killing by abortion)?<p>

Since when have we given doctors the right to kill the patient to
"cure" the disease?<p>

<h3>DISCRIMINATION BY PLACE-OF-RESIDENCE</h3>

This is abortion in the U.S. It is discrimination on the basis of
place-of-residence. If the child in the womb can escape from his
first place-of-residence (the womb) the day before his scheduled
execution, his life is protected by full force of law. As long as
he remains in the womb, however, he can be killed at his mother's
request.<p>

<i>In the ancient world, abortion was not common, but infanticide 
was widely practiced.</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>Why was this so?
<dd>Because abortion was so often fatal to the mother. The only
methods known then were two: One method was to give certain
poisons to the mother and hope the unborn child would die; often
the mother also died. The other method was to physically abuse
the mother's abdomen to induce abortion, which sometimes fatally
injured her.

<dt>And so?
<dd>Almost universally, the child was delivered and then killed if
unwanted. Abortion was rare; infanticide was common.

<dt>What were the laws?
<dd>The early Christian church was very positive (see chapter 22).
While its Fathers argued about whether the body was formed or
unformed, the existence of the soul, etc., they completely
condemned abortion and infanticide. Penalty for the sin of
abortion ranged up to and beyond seven years of public penance.
<font size=-2>J. Connery, <i>Abortion, the Development of the
Roman Catholic Perspective</i> Chicago: Loyola
University Press, 1977, pp. 65-87</font><p>

These penances were more stringent for abortion after quickening
(then defined as after being formed), for most thought life
didn't begin until after quickening.

<dt>What is quickening?
<dd>Originally, it meant "when formed," for this was when the soul
was presumably created. Later, it came to mean when the mother
"felt life" (its present meaning).<p>

As ecclesiastical law gave way to civil law, English common law,
as well as those in other nations, also condemned all abortion,
but only as a misdemeanor before quickening, a felony after. This
was because scientists "knew" that the baby was not yet alive
before that time. After quickening, or when the mother "felt
life," it was "known" that life was present and severe
punishments were inflicted for late abortions. When "life came to
the child," the child "came alive"; when the mother "felt life"
or "felt the baby kick," then that life was given the fullest
protection of the law.

<dt>When did they think that human life began?
<dd>In primitive times, there were many theories of how human life
began and grew. Most scientists "knew" that the man planted the
total new being in the nutrient womb of his wife's body. From
this came the agrarian terms of "planting the seed," "fertile,"
"barren,"  etc.<p>

When microscopes were developed, sperm were discovered (by Hamm
in 1677). They were seen to be tadpole-like objects and not at
all "little men." Even so, the books of those years show drawings
of a little man curled up in the sperm's head, for they "knew" he
was there. This was called a "Homunculus."<p>

As the power of microscopes increased, it slowly became evident
that there must be another explanation of life's beginnings.
Perhaps the woman contributed something to this new being?

<dt>But few abortionists were punished. Why not?
<dd>In order to prove the crime of abortion, one must (a) prove that
the woman was pregnant and (b) prove that this action killed the
baby.<p>

Until recent times, the only absolute proof of pregnancy was to
feel fetal movement and/or to hear the fetal heart, which was at
four to five months. After abortion, the only proof of pregnancy
was to produce the baby's body -- the corpus delicti. These were
seldom available as evidence. Because of the inability to prove
that an early pregnancy in fact existed, the crime usually
couldn't be proven.
<font size=-2>J. Dellapenna, The History of Abortion,
Technology, Morality, and Law,
<i>University of Pittsburgh Law Review,</i> 1979</font>

<dt>But abortions were common in the 19th century!
<dd>"Sometime after 1750, a new technique for inducing abortion was
introduced. [It was a] major technological innovation," which
involved inserting objects through the cervix into the uterus to
initiate the abortion. It, too, had major risks to the mother,
but was so much safer than the older, more lethal methods that it
replaced them, and infanticide became rare.
<font size=-2>ibid.</font>

<dt>Abortions did increase in the 19th century then?
<dd>Yes, many fold. In fact, they became very common.
<font size=-2>J. Mohr, <i>Abortion in America,</i>
Oxford University Press, 1978</font><p>

Then in 1827, Karl Ernst von Boar, in a scientific journal,
postulated that both man and woman contribute to a process called
conception. His was the first accurate description of the process
of conception. This was observed in a rabbit in 1843 by Martin
Berry, but not actually seen in a human until many years later.<p>

By the 1850s the scientific and medical world came to fully
accept the fact that the man and woman each contributed half to
the creation of the new human being. This event was called
conception or fertilization, and this stimulated the
anti-abortion action of the doctors.<p>

<dt>There was an anti-abortion movement then?
<dd>While abortions induced through the vagina became common, medical
communities throughout the world, were, at the same time,
becoming aware of the newly discovered scientific fact that human
life began at fertilization. In response to this the British
Parliament passed the "Offences Against the Person Act" in 1869,
dropping the felony punishment back to conception. It was during
the same years that members of the American Medical Association
went to the state legislatures to testify and inform them of this
scientific fact.<p>

"In 1859 the AMA protested that the quickening distinction
allowed the fetus rights 'for civil purposes [but as] to its
life as yet denies all protection.' They protested against
this 'unwarrantable destruction of human life,' calling upon
state legislatures to revise their abortion laws and
requesting the state medical societies 'in pressing the
subject.'"
<font size=-2>Roe vs. Wade,
U.S. Supreme Court, VI, 6, p. 26, 1973</font><p>

By 1871 the AMA report had summed up abortion: <i>"we had to deal
with human life."</i> As different state and national lawmakers were
taught the newly discovered scientific fact that human life
didn't begin at quickening but rather at conception, the laws
were changed. One by one, each ruled that human life should be
equally and fully protected by law, not from the time of
quickening, but from its actual beginning at conception.

<dt>When were the new laws passed in the U.S.?
<dd>Originally, the U.S. colonies, and then the states operated under
English Common Law. Connecticut passed the first separate state
law in 1821. By 1860, 85% of the population lived in states which
had clearly prohibited abortion with new laws.
<font size=-2>J. Dellapenna, The History of Abortion,
Technology, Morality, and Law,
"University of Pittsburgh Law Review," 1979</font><p>

<font size=-2>Quay, "Justifiable Abortion-Medical and
Legal Foundations,
49 Georgetown Univ. Law Review, 1960-1961</font><p>

Besides clearly forbidding abortion, these laws and those passed
after the Civil War moved the felony punishment from quickening
back to conception. This was done primarily to protect new human
life.

<dt>Pro-abortion people claim that there were other more important 
reasons.
<dd>Cyril Means, a law professor and legal counsel for the National
Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws in the U.S., wrote
two works which suggested that the laws were passed to protect
the health of the mother. (All other surgery was dangerous, too,
but no other surgery was forbidden.)
<font size=-2>C. Means, "The Law of New York and
Abortion and Status of Foetus,"
14 NYLF, 1968, p. 411</font><p>

<font size=-2>C. Means, "The Phoenix of American
Freedom," 17 NYLF, 1971, p. 335</font><p>

Justice Blackman, in writing the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court
decision, cited Means four times in an echo of his thinking. This
version of the history of abortion evoked scathing criticism.
<font size=-2>R. Byrn, "An American Tragedy,"
41 Fordham Law Review,
p. 807, pp. 814-839, 1973</font><p>

To counter this, the Ford and Rockefeller foundations funded a
major study by James Mohr, whose book, "Abortion in America"
(Oxford Univ. Press, 1978), was a more sophisticated version of
the same thesis. Mohr's historical study reported events only
from 1800, ignored the past, and added other reasons. These
included concern over the declining WASP (White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant) birth rate, and the concern of the doctor-members of
the AMA over competition from other medical practitioners.

<dt>Weren't these valid reasons?
<dd>Professor Joseph Dellapenna and others have almost totally
discredited these attempts to rewrite history. The main reason
was clearly that lawmakers wanted to protect human life from its
biologic beginning.
<font size=-2>J. Dellapenna, "Abortion and the Law,
Blackman's Distortion of the Historical Record,"
p. 137 in Abortion and the Constitution,
Horan et al., Georgetown U. Press, 1987.<p>

J. Dellapenna, The History of Abortion,
Technology, Morality, and Law,
"University of Pittsburgh Law Review,"
pp. 359-428, 1979</font>

<dt>Were women punished?
<dd>The definitive study on this gives the lie to Planned
Parenthood's ads which claimed: "If you had a miscarriage you
could be prosecuted for murder."
<font size=-2>Washington Post April 27, 1981</font><p>

Studying two hundred years of legal history, the American Center
for Bioethics concluded:
"No evidence was found to support the proposition that women
were prosecuted for undergoing or soliciting abortions. The
charge that spontaneous miscarriages could result in criminal
prosecution is similarly insupportable. There are no documented
instances of prosecution of such women for murder or for any
other species of homicide; nor is there evidence that states
that had provisions enabling them to prosecute women for
procuring abortions ever applied those laws. The vast majority
of the courts were reluctant to implicate women, even in a
secondary fashion, through complicity and conspiracy charges.
Even in those rare instances where an abortionist persuaded the
court to recognize the woman as his accomplice, charges were
not filed against her. In short, women were not prosecuted for
abortions. Abortionists were. The charges of Planned Parenthood
and other "pro-choice" proponents are without factual basis.
Given the American legal system's reliance on precedent, it is
unlikely that enforcement of future criminal sanctions on
abortion would deviate substantially from past enforcement
patterns."
<font size=-2>Women and Abortion, Prospects of Criminal Charges
Monograph, American Center for Bioethics,
422 C St., NE, Washington, DC 20002, Spring 1983</font>

<dt>Under a law or a Constitutional Amendment that forbids an abortion,
will women be punished?
<dd>We don't know of a single pro-life or pro-abortion leader, or
church leader, or congressman, or member of Parliament in any
nation, who would want this. The mother is the second victim; she
needs help and love -- not punishment. No, women would not be
punished. Would the abortionist? Yes, he or she is the killer who
took money and did the abortion.<p>

The abortionist deserves punishment and would, in all
probability, be punished, as in years past.

<i>This brief chapter speaks of U.S. history. Its analogy is a
powerful teaching tool worldwide.</i><p>

On March 6, 1857 the U.S. Supreme Court finally decided a very
vexing question which had troubled the citizens of the United
States for many years. In the landmark Dred Scott Decision the
court ruled once and for all that black people were not legal
"persons" according to the U.S. Constitution. A slave was the
property of the owner and could be bought and sold, used, or even
killed by the owner at the owner's discretion. The ruling was
final. It was by the highest court in the land.<p>

Those who opposed slavery protested, but were met with the retort:
"So you oppose slavery? It is against your moral, religious, and
ethical convictions? Well, you don't have to own a slave, but don't
impose your morality on the slave owner. He has the right to choose
to own a slave. The Supreme Court has spoken. Slavery is legal."<p>

But not for long. It took a bloody civil war to stop slavery. It
took the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution to
legally grant freedom, civil rights, and voting rights. From a
socioeconomic view, we are still striving for full equality.<p>

Then on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court finally decided a
very vexing question which had troubled the citizens of the United
States for many years. In a landmark Decision, the court ruled once
and for all that unborn humans were not legal "persons" according
to the U.S. Constitution. An unborn baby was the property of the
owner (mother) and she could have the baby killed at her request
because of her health (social distress). This could be done at any
time until birth. The ruling was final. It was by the highest court
in the land.<p>

Those who opposed abortion protested, but were met with a retort
that seemed an echo of slavery days. "So you oppose abortion? It is
against your moral, religious, and ethical convictions? Well, you
don't have to have an abortion, but don't impose your morality on
the mother (the owner). She has the right to choose to have an
abortion. The Supreme Court has spoken. Abortion is legal."<p>

But not for long? That was almost two decades ago. The goal of a
Constitutional Amendment or reversal by the Court is still ahead.
But the pro-life movement continues to grow. It is now the largest
grass-roots movement in the history of the U.S.A.<p>

Then, the discrimination was on the basis of skin color. Now, it is
on the basis of age and place of residence (living in the womb).<p>

<i>During the mid 1800s, all states tightened their laws, making
abortion -- from the time of fertilization on -- a serious crime.</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>When did the laws change again?
<dd>
<ul type=disc>
<li>For over 100 years, and until 1967, all states fully protected
all human life from conception except when the mother's life
was threatened. Then the first permissive law was passed in
Colorado.

<li>In June 1970, when New York passed the first abortion-on-demand
law (24 week limit), it became the 16th state to allow
abortion. Most of the others had allowed abortion only for very
restrictive reasons.

<li>After that, in the next 2 years, only <i>one</i> more state legalized
abortion (Florida because of a court order), while 33 states
debated the issue in their legislatures. All 33 states voted
against permitting abortion for any reason except to save the
mother's life.

<li>In April 1972, New York repealed its law, but Governor Nelson
Rockefeller vetoed the repeal, and the law remained in force.
</ul>

<dt>What of the state courts?
<dd>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, pro-abortionists challenged
the constitutionality of laws forbidding abortion in most states.
In about one-third of the decisions, such laws were declared
unconstitutional and varying degrees of abortions were permitted.
(Most of these were states that had already legalized abortion in
their legislatures.) Two-thirds of the state courts, however,
declared existing laws to be constitutional.

<dt>Then there were referenda?
<dd>Yes. After the pro-abortionists were stopped in the legislatures
and in the courts, they tried referenda in two states (abortion-
on-demand until 20 weeks) in the November 1972 election.

<ul type=disc>
<li>North Dakota, only 12% Catholic, voted 78% against abortion.

<li>Michigan, an industrial state (pre-polled at 60% pro-abortion),
voted 63% against abortion.
</ul>

<dt>The tide had turned?
<dd>Yes. It seemed obvious that most people did not want abortion.
But, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled.<br>
<font size=-2>Roe vs. Wade, U.S. Supreme Court, 410 U.S. 113, 1973<br>
Doe vs. Bolton, U.S. Supreme Court, 410 U.S. 179, 1973</font>

<dt>What was the ruling?
<dd>It struck down all laws against abortion which had in any way
protected unborn babies. The ruling legalized abortion in all 50
states for the full nine months of pregnancy for social and
economic reasons.

<ul type=disc>
<li>It created a new basic constitutional right for women in the
right to privacy, which the Supreme Court had created only a
few years earlier. This right to privacy was "broad enough to
encompass a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy."

<li>It stated that the law protects only legal "persons" and that
"legal personhood does not exist prenatally."
</ul>

The ruling authorized:

<ul type=disc>
<li>No legal restrictions at all on abortion in the first three
months.

<li>No restrictions from then until viability, except those needed
to make the procedure safer for the mother.

<li>Abortion was allowed until birth if <i>one</i> licensed physician
judged it necessary for the mother's "health."
</ul>

<dt>How did the U.S. Supreme Court define "health?"
<dd>The Court said that abortion could be performed: ". . . in the
light of all factors -- physical, emotional, psychological,
familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the well being of
the patient. All these factors may relate to health."<br>
<font size=-2>Doe vs. Bolton, U.S. Supreme Court,
No. 70-40, IV, p. 11, Jan.  1973</font><p>

"Maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a
distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent.
Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is
also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted
child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family
already unable, psychologically or otherwise, to care for it. In
other cases the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of
unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors that the
woman and the responsible physician will consider in
consultation."<br>
<font size=-2>Roe vs. Wade, U.S. Supreme Court,
No. 70-18, p. 38, Jan. 1973</font>

<dt>But these reasons are social reasons, not health reasons.
<dd>That is the situation! The U.S. Supreme Court has specifically
defined the word "health" to include a broad group of social and
economic problems, as judged by the mother herself. It has
further specifically forbidden any state to forbid abortion at
any time prior to birth for these reasons, if the mother can find
a doctor to do the abortion.<p>

This is also true in every nation in the world. If abortion is
allowed for "health," that state or nation has abortion on
demand; e.g., in England in 1986, 132,000 of 135,000 legal
abortions were due to mental health.<br>
<font size=-2><i>The Times</i>, 26 March '88</font>

<dt>Then the United States has abortion-on-demand until birth?
<dd>Correct. This is the legal situation.

<dt>Give me some authoritative reference on that!
<dd>"Our nationwide policy of abortion-on-demand through all nine
months of pregnancy was neither voted on by our people nor
enacted by our legislators."<br>
<font size=-2>R. Reagan, <i>Abortion & the Conscience of the Nation</i>,
Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1984, p. 15</font><p>

Also, the official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,
issued after extensive hearings on the Human Life Federalism
Amendment (proposed by Senators Hatch and Eagleton), concluded:<p>

"Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant
legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United
States for a woman to obtain an abortion for any reason during
any stage of her pregnancy."<br>
<font size=-2>Report, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, on Senate Joint Resolution 3,
98th Congress, 98-149, June 7, 1983, p. 6</font>

<dt>How did the court justify its action?
<dd>It seems obvious that the court approached the issue with a clear
conviction that "a woman must have this right" and tried to
justify this right. They admitted their decision was not in the
Constitution, but claimed that it was implied.<p>

Justice Douglas, in Griswold v. Conn. had found (created) a new
right of privacy. He found it in the emanations (vapors) from the
penumbra (a shadow) of the 14th Amendment. Justice Blackman
planted the abortion right firmly upon this foundation.

<dt>Specifically?
<dd>The most devastating was their judgment that, even though they
didn't know when "life"9 begins, they would rule out all
protection for this growing living human being on the basis of
age and place-of-residence (the womb).<p>

They justified this civil rights violation because the fetus had
not yet reached <i>"the capability of meaningful life"</i>; that he or
she was not a <i>"person in the whole sense"</i> [authors' italics].<br>
<font size=-2>Roe vs. Wade, U.S. Supreme Court
IX, p. 47, X, p. 48</font><p>

Most of the "foot-in-the-door" early euthanasia bills (living
will, death with dignity) introduced so far, justify post-born
extermination when the patient is no longer capable of
"meaningful" life.<p>

The Court found the right to abort in the right to privacy. What
about the right of a woman to the privacy of her own body?<p>

If you, as a citizen, stand outside a door and listen to a mother
battering her child, even to the point of killing him, what would
you do? Would you respect the privacy of her home? You would not!
You would open or break down the door and rescue the child. By
virtue of her assault upon and abuse of another human person, she
has surrendered her constitutional right to privacy in this case.
The same analogy applies to abortion: The right of the child to
live is greater than and supersedes any right that a woman may
have to the privacy of her own body.

<dt>But a woman does have a right to her own body. Isn't the child, at
least in the early stages of pregnancy, part of her body?
<dd>A woman's appendix, obviously a part of her body, can be removed
for sufficient reason. The cells of the appendix, however, carry
the identical genetic code that is present in every other cell in
the mother's body. They are, for this reason, undeniably part of
her body.<p>

The single-celled fertilized ovum, or later developing embryonic
human being within her uterus, cannot, by any stretch of the
imagination, be considered part of her body. This new living
being has a genetic code that is totally different from the cells
of the mother's body. He or she is, in truth, a completely
separate growing human being and can never be considered part of
the mother's body.

<dt>Does she have a right to her own body? Yes. But this is not part
of her own body. It is another person's body.
<dd>Has the Supreme Court decided other related cases after this?<p>

Yes. The main ones were:<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Spousal and parental consent was ruled unconstitutional.
Prohibition of salt poisoning abortion on medical grounds was
ruled unconstitutional.<br>
<font size=-2>Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth,
428 U.S. 52, 1976</font>

<li>Viability is what the doctor says it is.<br>
<font size=-2>Colautti vs. Franklin,
429 U.S. 379, 1979</font>

<li>The State is not required to fund "medically necessary"
abortions for the poor.<br>
<font size=-2>Harris vs. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 1980</font>

<li>Informed consent is not required. A waiting period is
unconstitutional. Mandatory hospitalization for second
trimester abortions is unconstitutional. "Humane"" disposal of
fetal remains is unconstitutional.<br>
<font size=-2>City of Akron vs. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health,
103 S. Ct. 2481, 1983</font>

<li>Informed consent is unconstitutional.<br>
<font size=-2>Thornberg v. Am. Col., OB & GYN,
106 S.Ct. 2169, 1986</font>
</ul>

This was the situation until the Webster Decision July 1989.

<dt>Weren't there any absolute legal requirements?
<dd>There were three. The woman must request it, a licensed doctor
must agree to do it, and the pre-born baby must still live in the
womb.

<dt>Can the U.S. Congress do anything at all?
<dd>Yes! Increasingly, the U.S. Congress has been passing pro-life
bills:

<ul type=disc>
<li>to cut off federal funding for Medicaid abortions (Hyde
Amendment);

<li>to stop federal funding of abortions in Federal Employees'
Health Insurance;

<li>to stop pro-abortion legal action by government lawyers;

<li>to limit fetal experimentation;

<li>to stop overseas aid for abortion;

<li>to stop funding of abortions in military hospitals;

<li>to aid pregnant women;

<li>to take abortion out of family planning aid.
</ul>

<dt>Can the Decision be reversed by an amendment to the U.S.
Constitution?
<dd>Yes, but the Supreme Court could also reverse the Decision.

<dt>How can such an amendment be passed?
<dd>There are two methods. For the last 16 amendments added to the
Constitution, the proposed amendment first had to pass both
Houses of the U.S. Congress by a two-thirds vote. In the other
method, used for the first ten amendments (the Bill of Rights),
a Constitutional Convention first approved the proposed
amendments. In both cases, the proposed amendment(s) had to be
ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures.

<dt>Have pro-lifers tried either method?
<dd>Yes. They are working on both. The most recent vote in the
Congress was in June 1983, when the Hatch-Eagleton Amendment was
debated and voted on by the U.S. Senate.<p>

Also, 20 states have voted to call a Constitutional Convention.
The required number is 34.

<dt>What amendments have been proposed?
<dd>The original wording formulated in 1974 by the National Right to
Life (NRLC) committee was:<p>

<blockquote>
<h3>THE NRLC HUMAN LIFE AMENDMENT</h3>

Section 1: With respect to the right to life, the word "person"
as used in this article and in the Fifth and Fourteenth
Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
applies to all human beings irrespective of age, health,
function, or condition of dependency, including their unborn
offspring at every stage of their biologic development.<p>

Section 2: No unborn person shall be deprived of life by any
person; provided, however, that nothing in this article shall
prohibit a law permitting only those medical procedures
required to prevent the death of the mother.<p>

Section 3: The Congress and the several States shall have power
to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<p>
</blockquote>

Later, another version was introduced which came to be called:<p>

<blockquote>
<h3>THE PARAMOUNT AMENDMENT</h3>

The Paramount right to life is vested in each human being from
the moment of fertilization without regard to age, health, or
condition of dependency.<p>
</blockquote>

Then, in 1981, these two versions were merged into a new NRLC
Amendment often called:<p>

<blockquote>
<h3>THE NRLC UNITY HUMAN LIFE AMENDMENT</h3>

Section 1: The right to life is a paramount and most
fundamental  right of a person.<p>

Section 2: With respect to the right to life guaranteed to
persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth Articles of Amendment to
the Constitution, the word "person" applies to all human
beings, irrespective of age, health, function, or condition of
dependency, including their unborn offspring at every state of
their biological development including fertilization.<p>

Section 3: No unborn person shall be deprived of life by any
person; provided, however, that nothing in this article shall
prohibit a law allowing justification to be shown for only
those medical procedures required to prevent the death of
either the pregnant woman or her unborn offspring as long as
such law requires every reasonable effort be made to preserve
the life of each.<p>

Section 4: Congress and the several States shall have power to
enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<p>
</blockquote>

<dt>Which of these three versions has the most support?
<dd>A measure of legislative support in the 98th Congress showed 26
senators cosponsoring the original NRLC, three senators
cosponsoring the original Paramount, and seven senators
cosponsoring the Unity Amendment.<p>

<dt>Would all three reverse the Supreme Court Decision?
<dd>Yes, but they would go further. Prior to the 1973 Supreme Court
Decision, the U.S. had a de facto states' rights situation under
which each state could decide if it wanted to forbid or to permit
abortion and to what degree.<p>

These amendments would reverse the 1973 Supreme Court Decision,
but would also go further and mandate federal protection for the
unborn in all 50 states.<p>

Many legal experts had thought that such protection was already
present in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution; but, as we
know, in the late 1960s, 17 states passed laws to allow abortion
for various reasons. Pro-life leaders do not want this to happen
again. Accordingly, these amendments would revoke the
pre-existing states' rights situation and mandate universal civil
rights for all living humans -- born or unborn.

<dt>But this is almost two decades later and none of these amendments
have been passed!
<dd>True. But support for such an amendment has steadily increased.
In 1974 there were only 28 pro-life Senate votes. By the early
1980s there were about 40.

<dt>But an amendment needs 67 votes!
<dd>That's the problem. Almost every third baby conceived in America
(and every sixth baby in Canada) is killed by abortion. Even if
the growth of pro-life strength continues, it could be another
decade before such an amendment would be passed out of Congress.
That was why two major steps-on-the-way, the Helms Human Life
Bill (HLB) and the Hatch-Eagleton Constitutional Amendment were
proposed.

<dt>What was the Helms Human Life Bill?
<dd>The HLB was introduced in January 1981. It was a statute, not a
Constitutional Amendment, and needed only a majority vote to pass
(unless filibustered).<p>

It would have declared that unborn humans were legal persons. If
the high court judged this to be Constitutional, the Supreme
Court would in effect, have reversed its judgment of 1973. The
HLB certainly would have applied to state abortions, but there
was a question as to whether it would have stopped private
abortions. The Court would have decided that question.<p>

The National Right to Life Board endorsed it by a narrow margin
eight months after it was introduced and by a two-thirds margin
eight months after that. By the time it reached the Senate floor,
there was full pro-life support for it. Stating that he had "only
35 or 40 votes" for its personhood feature, Senator Helms removed
that section on the eve of the vote. It was still filibustered.
Sixty votes for cloture were needed to stop a filibuster. The
deciding vote on invoking cloture, in September 1982, only
received 50 votes. It was then tabled on a 48-47 vote.

<dt>What was the Hatch-Eagleton Amendment?
<dd>This was to be the first of two Constitutional amendments. Facing
the reality of the inability at this time to pass a full federal
amendment, this was proposed as a major first step. It stated: "A
right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution."<p>

It would have reversed the Supreme Court Decision and returned
the nation to the condition prior to the 1973 Supreme Court
Decision, when each state had the power to forbid abortion.<p>

It was introduced in September 1981. As a Constitutional
amendment, it could not have been struck down by the Court, but
needed 67 votes. It would have required ratification by
three-fourths of the states.<p>

The chief objection was that a second amendment would never be
passed. Proponents answered this by noting that they feared that
a one-step amendment could not be passed in this century. They
felt that this would probably stop over half of the killing in
short order. Further, they argued, a reversal of the court
decision would re-establish a climate of protection and respect
for life and make a second step possible.

<dt>But wasn't the "Hatch" a compromise?
<dd>It was clear enough that all pro-life leaders wanted all babies
protected. There was no compromise on the basic ethic or ultimate 
goal. This was rather a change in legislative strategy.
Supporters of the Amendment pointed to the following reasoning:
If, today, we have 100% abortion, and we have the power to stop
60% of them (but not the full 100%) and do so, are we
"permitting" the 40% that remain? Hardly! We've taken one step,
saved many lives, and begun the reversal process. We'll stop more
abortions as soon as we have the strength to do so.

<dt>But it was defeated also?
<dd>The National Right to Life Board endorsed it by a narrow margin
three months after its introduction and by a two-thirds vote four
months later. After full debate, the Senate vote, in June 1983,
was 49 votes for and 50 votes against, with one pro-life senator
abstaining. It failed the two-thirds majority needed.

<dt>Were these two defeats crushing blows?
<dd>Not at all!
No pro-life leader realistically expected either the bill or the
Constitutional Amendment to pass. Nevertheless, there were major
social, legislative, and political reasons to bring both before
the Senate for record votes. This was the first time that a major
effort had brought a measure, the Hatch-Eagleton Amendment -- one
which would have reversed the Supreme Court Decision -- through
a Senate subcommittee, then through the full Judiciary Committee,
and on to a floor debate and vote by the full Senate. Just ten
years after that fateful Supreme Court Decision, the Senate split
right down the middle, by far the strongest showing yet on such
a major measure. Then, several months later, proving that the
Right to Life movement had not lost its strength, the U.S.
Congress reaffirmed the abortion funding restrictions of the Hyde
Amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services Annual
Appropriation Bill, and then, for the first time, cut off the use
of tax money to help pay for abortions done under the Federal
Employees' Health Insurance program.

<dt>Has the Supreme Court ever reversed one of its major decisions?
<dd>Yes! In the over 200-year history of the U.S.A., the Court has
completely reversed its own major decisions over one hundred
times.<p>

There is an increasing possibility that the Supreme Court may
reverse the Decision itself, as new justices have been seated on
the Court.

<dt>What if the Roe and Doe Decisions were reversed by the court?
<dd>The legal situation would revert to the status-quo-ante 1973. It
would again be possible to grant rights to the unborn child. A
mother's new constitutional right to abort would be gone.<p>

The federalization of the right to regulate abortion would be
gone and each state would regain the right to legislate on
abortion through their elected state senators and
representatives.

<dt>What of the Webster Decision in 1989?
<dd>This promised to reverse the trend that had moved more and more
toward total permissiveness. It foreshadowed returning to the
people of each state a freedom that they had had during the first
200 years of U.S. history.<p>

That was the freedom of the people of each state to decide,
through their elected state legislators, to what extent they
wanted abortion permitted or forbidden in each of their states.

<dt>And what of the Ohio and Minnesota decisions on parental
notification in June 1990?
<dd>The 1989 and 1990 decisions have discarded the trimester scheme
and reaffirmed that the unborn child has rights that exist
throughout pregnancy.<p>

The earlier Court considered abortion to be a woman's fundamental
right and had applied a "compelling interest" standard of review.
The present Court rather appears now to be willing to uphold
almost any state regulation of abortion under a "rational basis"
test. This new measuring rod is completely incompatible with the
fundamental right of Roe vs. Wade and if continued means that the
1973 decision is all but overruled (as of 1990) sub silentio' or
in practice.

<dt>When does implantation occur?
<dd>The tiny human implants himself or herself in the nutrient lining
of the womb at one week of life.

<dt>And then?
<dd>At ten days, this tiny living human male or female sends a
chemical hormonal message out into the mother's body, which stops
her menstrual periods. Later, it is this tiny passenger who
causes her breasts to enlarge in preparation for nursing, softens
her pelvic bones to prepare for labor, and, without question,
sets his or her birthday. The onset of labor is a unilateral
fetal decision (see chapter 7).

<dt>When does the heart begin to beat?
<dd>At 18 days [when the mother is only four days late for her first
menstrual period], and by 21 days it is pumping, through a closed
circulatory system, blood whose type is different from that of
the mother.<br>
<font size=-2>J. M. Tanner, G. R. Taylor, and the Editors
of Time-Life Books, <i>Growth,</i> New York:
Life Science Library, 1965, p. 64</font>

<dt>When is the brain functioning?
<dd>Brain waves have been recorded at 40 days on the
Electroencephalogram (EEG).<br>
<font size=-2>H. Hamlin, "Life or Death by EEG,"
<i>JAMA,</i> Oct. 12, 1964, p. 120</font><p>

Brain function, as measured on the Electroencephalogram, "appears
to be reliably present in the fetus at about eight weeks
gestation," or six weeks after conception.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Goldenring, "Development of the Fetal Brain,"
<i>New England Jour. of Med.,</i> Aug. 26, 1982, p. 564</font><p>

Only several generations ago, doctors used the ending of
respiration to measure the end of human life. This is no longer
true, for the use of artificial ventilators is common.<p>

Only one generation ago, doctors were using the ending of the
heartbeat to measure the end of human life. This is no longer
true, for now the heart can be stopped and restarted for
different operations. It also may stop during a heart attack and
sometimes can be restarted.<p>

Today, the definitive and final measure of the end of human life
is brain death. This happens when there is irreversible cessation
of total brain function. The final scientific measurement of this
is the permanent ending of brain waves.<p>

Since all authorities accept that the end of an individual's
life is measured by the ending of his brain function (as
measured by brain waves on the EEG), would it not be logical
for them to at least agree that individual's life began with
the onset of that same human brain function as measured by
brain waves recorded on that same instrument?

<dt>When does the developing baby first move?
<dd>"In the sixth to seventh weeks. . . . If the area of the lips is
gently stroked, the child responds by bending the upper body to
one side and making a quick backward motion with his arms. This
is called a 'total pattern response' because it involves most of
the body, rather than a local part."<br>
<font size=-2>L. B. Arey, <i>Developmental Anatomy</i>, (6th ed.),
Philadelphia: W. B. Sanders Co., 1954</font><p>

At eight weeks, "if we tickle the baby's nose, he will flex his
head backwards away from the stimulus."<br>
<font size=-2>A. Hellgers, M.D., "Fetal Development, 31,"
<i>Theological Studies,</i> vol. 3, no. 7, 1970, p. 26</font>

<dt>But pregnant women don't "feel life" until four or five months!
<dd>The inside of the uterus has no feeling. The baby has to be
almost a foot long (30 cm.) and weigh about one pound (454 gm.)
before he or she is large enough to brace a shoulder against one
wall and kick hard enough against the opposite wall to dent it
outward. Then the mother feels it because the outside of the
uterus is covered by a sensitive peritoneal surface.

<dt>How many weeks are there in a pregnancy and how do you measure
them?
<dd>There are 40 weeks. We measure a pregnancy from the time the ovum
begins to grow, that is, at the start of a woman's menstrual
period. After about two weeks of growth, the egg is released from
the ovary. Fertilization can then occur. This is about two weeks
before her next period is due. Four of the 40 weeks have already
elapsed at the time she misses her first period.<p>

Gestational age dates from the first day of the mother's last
menstrual period. Actual age of the baby dates from
conception.

<dt>When do teeth form?
<dd>All 20 milk-teeth buds are present at six and a half weeks.<br>
<font size=-2>"Life Before Birth," <i>Life Magazine,</i>
Apr. 30, 1965, p. 10</font>

<dt>But, early on, this is just a simple fish-like creature.
<dd>Not so.<p>

"The body of the unborn baby is more complex than ours. The
preborn baby has several extra parts to his body which he needs
only so long as he lives inside his mother. He has his own space
capsule, the amniotic sac. He has his own lifeline, the umbilical
cord, and he has his own root system, the placenta. These all
belong to the baby himself, not to his mother. They are all
developed from his original cell."<br>
<font size=-2>Day & Liley, <i>The Secret World of a Baby,</i>
Random House, 1968, p. 13</font>

<dt>What is the development at seven to eight weeks?
<dd>The baby's stomach secretes gastric juice by eight weeks. Now we
can listen to the tiny one's heartbeat on an ultrasonic
stethoscope. These are now common in doctors' offices and on
hospital wards. They are <i>never</i> used in abortion facilities,
however, as this information is universally withheld from mothers
prior to abortion. Abortionists know that if they tell women
there already is a heartbeat -- and certainly if they would let
her listen to the heartbeat -- some mothers would change their
minds. The actual sounds of an six-week-old baby's heartbeat
are available on tape from Cincinnati Right to Life,
1802 W. Galbraith Rd., Cincinnati, OH 45239 ($3.00).

<dt>When are all his body systems present?
<dd>By eight weeks (two months).<br>
<font size=-2>Hooker & Davenport, <i>The Prenatal Origin of Behavior,</i>
University of Kansas Press, 1952</font>

<dt>When can the baby start thumb sucking?
<dd>This is often seen on <i>Realtime</i> ultrasound movies of babies as
early as eight weeks. The most dramatic accounting of movement
very early has been recorded as follows:

<blockquote>
"Eleven years ago, while giving an anesthetic for a ruptured
tubal pregnancy (at two months), I was handed what I
believed to be the smallest human being ever seen. The
embryo sac was intact and transparent. Within the sac was a
tiny (one-third inch) human male swimming extremely
vigorously in the amniotic fluid, while attached to the wall
by the umbilical cord. This tiny human was perfectly
developed with long, tapering fingers, feet and toes. It was
almost transparent as regards the skin, and the delicate
arteries and veins were prominent to the ends of the
fingers.<p>

"The baby was extremely alive and swam about the sac
approximately one time per second with a natural swimmers
stroke. This tiny human did not look at all like the photos
and drawings of 'embryos' which I have seen, nor did it look
like the few embryos I have been able to observe since then,
obviously because this one was alive.<p>

"When the sac was opened, the tiny human immediately lost its
life and took on the appearance of what is accepted as the
appearance of an embryo at this stage (blunt extremities,
etc.)."<br>

Leonard Hospital, Troy, New York, U.S. Supreme Court.,

</blockquote>

At nine to ten weeks, he squints, swallows, moves his tongue, and
if you stroke his palm, will make a tight fist.<p>

By nine weeks he will "bend his fingers round an object in the
palm of his hand."<br>
<font size=-2>Valman & Pearson, "What the Fetus Feels,"
<i>British Med. Jour.,</i> Jan. 26, 1980</font>

<dt>When does he start to breathe?
<dd>"By 11 to 12 weeks (3 months), he is breathing fluid steadily and
continues so until birth. At birth, he will breathe air. He does
not drown by breathing fluid within his mother, because he
obtains his oxygen from his umbilical cord. This breathing
develops the organs of respiration."<br>
<font size=-2>"Life Before Birth,"
<i>Life Magazine,</i> Apr. 30, 1965, p. 13</font><p>

"Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy decreases the
frequency of fetal breathing by 20%. The 'well documented' higher
incidence of prematurity, stillbirth, and slower development of
reading skill may be related to this decrease."<br>
<font size=-2>F. Manning, "Meeting of Royal College
of Physicians & Surgeons,"
<i>Family Practice News,</i> March 15, 1976</font><p>

"The measurement of fetal breathing movements may soon provide an
indication of fetal well being that is at least as useful as the
evaluation of the fetal heart rate."<p>

"In the 11th week of gestation fetal breathing is irregular and
episodic. As gestation continues, the breathing movements become
more vigorous and rapid."<br>
<font size=-2>C. Dawes, "Fetal Breathing: Indication of Well
Being," <i>Family Practice News,</i> Mar. 16, 1976, p. 6</font><p>

Episodic spontaneous breathing movement have been observed in the
healthy human fetus as early as ten weeks gestational age.<br>
<font size=-2>Conners et al., "Control of Fetal
Breathing in the Human Fetus,"
<i>Am J. OB-GYN,</i> April '89, p. 932</font>

<dt>When can he swallow?
<dd>At 11 weeks.<br>
<font size=-2>Valman & Pearson, <i>British Med. Jour.,</i>
"What the Fetus Feels," 26 Jan. 1980, p. 233</font>

<dt>What of detailed development, like fingernails and eyelashes?
<dd>Fingernails are present by 11 to 12 weeks; eyelashes by 16 weeks.
Fingerprints are completely established during the fourth month
of gestation.<br>
<font size=-2>Hamilton et al., <i>Human Embryology,</i>
Fourth Ed., 1972, p. 567</font>

<dt>At what point are all his body systems working?
<dd>By 11 weeks.<br>
<font size=-2>"Life Before Birth,"
<i>Life Magazine,</i> Apr. 30, 1965, p. 13</font>

<dt>How does the size of the baby increase in weight?
<dd>At 12 weeks (three months) she weighs about 30 gm (1.0 ounce); at
16 weeks about 170 gm (6 ounces); and at 20 weeks (four months),
approximately 454 gm (one pound).

<dt>When is taste present?
<dd>"Taste buds are working between 13 and 15 weeks gestation" (11 to
13 weeks after conception).<br>
<font size=-2>Mistretta & Bradley, <i>Taste in Utero</i>, 1977, p. 62</font>

<dt>How about hearing?
<dd>"Auditory sense is present in the infant 24 weeks before birth
[14 weeks after conception]. This involves brain functioning and
memory patterns."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Clemens, "5th International Congress Psychosomatic,"
<i>OB & GYN,</i> Rome: Medical Tribune, Mar. 22, 1978, p. 7</font><p>

Although the watery environment in which he lives presents small
opportunity for crying, which does require air, the unborn knows
how to cry, and given a chance to do so, he will. A doctor<p>

<blockquote>
". . . injected an air bubble into the baby's amniotic sac
and then took x-rays. It so happened that the air bubble
covered the baby's face. The whole procedure had no doubt
given the little fellow quite a bit of jostling about, and
the moment that he had air to inhale and exhale they heard
the clear sound of a protesting wail emitting from the
uterus. Late that same night, the mother awakened her doctor
with a telephone call, to report that when she lay down to
sleep the air bubble got over the baby's head again, and he
was crying so loudly he was keeping both her and her husband
awake. The doctor advised her to prop herself upright with
pillows so that the air could not reach the baby's head,
which was by now in the lower part of the
uterus."<br>
<font size=-2>Day & Liley, <i>Modern Motherhood,</i>
Random House, 1969, pp. 50-51</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>Did Dr. Liley, the "Father of Fetology," think the tiny being was
human?
<dd>Dr. Liley, who did the first fetal blood transfusion in the womb,
said that seven days after fertilization,<p>

<blockquote>
". . . the young individual, in command of his environment
and destiny with a tenacious purpose, implants in the spongy
lining and with a display of physiological power, suppresses
his mother's menstrual period. This is his home for the next
270 days and to make it habitable, the embryo develops a
placenta and a protective capsule of fluid for himself. He
also solves, single-handed, the homograft problem, that
dazzling feat by which foetus and mother, although
immunological foreigners who could not exchange skin grafts
nor safely receive blood from each other, nevertheless
tolerate each other in parabiosis for nine months.<p>

"We  know that he moves with a delightful easy grace in his
buoyant world, that foetal comfort determines foetal
position. He is responsive to pain and touch and cold and
sound and light. He drinks his amniotic fluid, more if it is
artificially sweetened, less it if is given an unpleasant
taste. He gets hiccups and sucks his thumb. He wakes and
sleeps. He gets bored with repetitive signals but can be
taught to be alerted by a first signal for a second
different one. And, finally, he determines his birthday, for
unquestionably, the onset of labour is a unilateral decision
of the foetus.<p>

"This, then, is the foetus we know and, indeed, we each once
were. This is the foetus we look after in modern obstetrics,
the same baby we are caring for before and after birth, who
before birth can be ill and need diagnosis and treatment
just like any other patient."<br>

Studies, Whitcombe & Tombs, Ltd., 1971</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>What measure would you use to define Human Life?
<dd>We would ask:

<dl>
<dt>Is this being alive?
<dd>Yes. He has the characteristics of life. That is, he can
reproduce his own cells and develop them into a specific
pattern of maturity and function.

<dt>Is this being human?
<dd>Yes. This is a unique being, distinguishable totally from any
other living organism, completely human in all of his or her
characteristics, including the human 46 chromosomal pattern,
and can develop only into a fully mature human.

<dt>Is this being complete?
<dd>Yes. Nothing new will be added from the time of union of
sperm and egg until the death of the old man or woman except
growth and development of what is already there at the
beginning. All he needs is time to develop and mature.
</dl>

<dt>Does the unborn baby dream?
<dd>Using ultrasound techniques, it was first shown that REM (rapid
eye movements) which are characteristic of active dream states
have been demonstrated at 23 weeks.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Birnhaltz, "The Development of Human
Fetal Eye Movement Patterns,"
<i>Science,</i> 1981, vol. 213, pp. 679-681</font><p>

REM have since been recorded 17 weeks after conception.<br>
<font size=-2>S. Levi, Brugman University of Brussels,
<i>American Medical Association News,</i> February 1, 1983</font><p>

Since REM are characteristic of dream states after birth,
researchers are asking if the unborn child also dreams?

<dt>Does he/she think?
<dd>In adults, when we contemplate a physical move or action from a
resting state, our heart rate accelerates several seconds before
the motion. Similarly, the fetal baby's heart rate speeds up six
to ten seconds prior to fetal movement. Is this conscious thought
and planning?<br>
<font size=-2>N. Lauerson & H. Hochberg,
"Does the Fetus Think?"
<i>JAMA,</i> vol. 247, no. 23, July 18, 1982</font><p>

"We now know that the unborn child is an aware, reacting
human being who from the sixth month on (and perhaps
earlier) leads an active emotional life.<p>

"The fetus can, on a primitive level, even learn in
utero.<p>

"Whether he ultimately sees himself and, hence, acts as a sad
or happy, aggressive or meek, secure or anxiety-ridden
person depends, in part, on the messages he gets about
himself in the womb."<br>
<font size=-2>T. Verney & J. Kelly,
<i>The Secret Life of the Unborn Child,</i>
Delta Books, 1981, p. 12</font><p>

"At eight weeks of life a tapping stimulus on the amniotic sac
results in arm movements . . . the primitive brain receives the
stimulus, selects a response and transmits the response as a
signal to the arm."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Rosen, <i>Learning Before Birth,</i>
Harpers Magazine, April 1978</font>

<dt>You mean that the unborn baby's emotions can be affected?
<dd>This is probably true.

<blockquote>
"We know already that even embryonic nervous tissue is 'open'
to maternal communication via brain chemicals called
'neurotransmitters.' This is a finding with enormous
implications. It means that the mother's emotional state can
affect the unborn almost from conception onward. Even before
the baby can hear in the womb, or think consciously, it is
capable of sensing discord between its parents. If the
mother is in constant turmoil, its own environment will be
tainted by the biochemistry of fear and hostility, grief,
and anger."<br>
<font size=-2>Shettles & Varick, <i>Rites of Life,</i>
Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1983, pp. 87-89</font>

At four and one-half months, a very bright light on a woman's
abdomen will cause the baby to slowly move its hand to a position
shielding the eyes.<p>

Loud music will cause the baby to cover its ears.<p>

<dt>What is birth?
<dd>Birth is the emergence of the infant from the mother's womb, the
severing of the umbilical cord, and the beginning of the child's
existence physically detached from the mother's body. The only
change that occurs at birth is a change in the external life
support system of the child. The child is no different before
birth than after, except that he has changed his method of
feeding and obtaining oxygen. Before birth, nutrition and oxygen
were obtained from the mother through the baby's umbilical cord.
After birth, oxygen is obtained from his own lungs and nutrition
through his own stomach, if he is mature enough to be nourished
that way. If he is quite premature, nourishment would continue
through our present reasonably sophisticated external life
support systems in the form of intravenous feeding, which is
similar to the umbilical cord feeding from the mother.

<dl>
<dt>What is viability?
<dd>It is that stage of fetal development when the baby is
"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb [that is, can
survive], albeit with artificial help."<br>
<font size=-2>Roe vs. Wade, U.S. Supreme Court, 1973, p. 45</font>

<dt>The U.S. Supreme Court and some other nations have used viability
as a measure of humanness. Do you agree with this measure?
<dd>No. This position is completely untenable.<p>

Why was viability at 30 weeks? Why is it now at 20 weeks? Why
will it be ten weeks someday? The babies haven't changed. What
has changed has been the development of better life support
systems around the baby. The doctors and nurses of today have
more knowledge, and their equipment is far more advanced.<p>

<i>Viability is a measure of the sophistication of the life
support systems around the baby; it does not measure the
humanness or aliveness of the baby himself or herself.</i>

<dt>But some laws hold abortion legal until the baby is "viable." What
does this mean?
<dd>Most people define viable as "capable of independent existence."
We believe this should be stricken from the law books. By this
definition, even a seven-pound baby after birth is not viable.
Leave this healthy full-term child alone and she will die in a
few days from neglect. She is not capable of independent
existence, but depends totally on the life support given her by
her mother.

<dt>So when is a child capable of independent existence?
<dd>Certainly not before she's old enough to go to school. And we can
make a pretty good case for her not being capable of it much
before she's a teenager.

<dt>Viability should not determine legal rights?
<dd>The frightening aspect of using viability as a dimension of
someone's right to life is quickly apparent when we consider
that, by this standard, a newborn baby or a child of any age with
a handicap is also not "viable." By the above criterion, the
senile old person rendered incompetent by a stroke, the
completely psychotic individual, or even the quadriplegic war
veteran is not "viable," since they are not capable of
independent existence. Some of these persons also do not have
mental "viability." To make a judgment of an unborn child's right
to live or not in our society by his mental or physical
competence, rather than merely by the fact that he is human and
alive, brings only too close the state's determination of a
person's right to continued life as measured by one's mental or
physical competence -- or whatever the current price tag is.

<dt>How do you measure age of survival?
<dd>The age of a premature baby at birth is measured by age from
first day of last menstrual period (LMP). Weight is also a
measure when the dates are uncertain, a 20- to 22-week-old baby
has an average weight of 500-600 gm (1 lb., 2 oz. to 1 lb., 5
oz.) with "normals" varying from 400 to 700 gm (14 oz. to 1 lb.,
9 oz.). There are also other maturation factors that are used.<p>

With the widespread establishment of premature intensive care
units, the age of survival has dropped dramatically. For example,
in 1950, it was rare for a baby to survive if born at 30 weeks (A
full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks). Today, survivability has
occurred in infants born as early as 20 weeks premature.
Tomorrow, babies born even more prematurely will survive.

<dt>What is the "survival rate?"
<dd>Survival rate is a measure of the percentage of chance for
survival at a particular age. The younger the baby, the lower the
rate. At the University of Pennsylvania, the survival rate in the
years 1944-77 was 40% for babies with birth weights between 750
to 1,000 gm (1 lb., 10 oz. to 2 lbs., 2 oz.), with only 6% having
major neurologic abnormalities.<br>
<font size=-2>Kuma et al., <i>Pediatrics 66,</i> vol. 3, Sept. 1980</font><p>

At Vanderbilt, University of Tennessee, for the years 1978-81,
39% of 500 to 750 gm infants survived and 69% of those weighing
751 to 1,000 gm survived.<br>
<font size=-2>Barnett et al., "Effect of Type
of Delivery on Neonatal Outcome,"
<i>JAMA,</i> vol. 250, no. 5, Aug. 5, 1983</font><p>

At the Bristol Maternity Hospital, England, in 1980, 29% of
liveborn babies of 22-27 weeks gestation survived. In 1982, it
was 43%. In 1984, it rose to 72%.<br>
<font size=-2>P.M. Dunn, PreTerm Labour and its
Consequences, <i>Royal Col. OB-GYN,</i> Feb. 1985</font><p>

At the Good Samaritan Hospital Regional Prenatal Center in
Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A., the survival rate was:<p>

<pre>
500-750 gm
(1 lb, 1-5 oz.-1 lb., 10 oz.)...........................30%
750-1000 gm
(1 lb., 10 oz.-2 lb., 3 oz.)............................75%
1000-1250 gm
(2 lb., 3 oz.-2 lb., 12 oz.)............................88%
1250-1500 gm
(2 lb., 12 oz.-3 lb., 5 oz.)...........................100%
</pre>
<font size=-2>K. Weddig. Personal communication
with author. Dec. 1984</font>

<dt>Only six percent abnormal?
<dd>Extremely low birth-weight infants have "a remarkably favorable
outcome," reported Dr. F. Bennett of the University of Washington
in Seattle. Of sixteen infants weighing 800 gm (1 lb., 12 oz.) or
less at birth, only one turned out to have a handicap "that would
interfere with his vocational choice and independence."<br>
<font size=-2>F. Bennett, <i>Family Practice News,</i> June 1, 1982</font><p>

"It is reassuring that the proportion of children with congenital
abnormalities, or developmental delays of all types of severity
combined, decreased and that the gains in reducing mortality have
apparently not been at the expense of enlarging the pool of
children with such impairments."<br>
<font size=-2><i>Jour. of Pediatrics,</i> vol. 72, 1983, pp. 408-415</font><p>

"Preterm infants of less than 1,000 gm (2 lbs., 2 oz.) do not
appear to have significantly higher incidence of severe
developmental abnormalities in the first 18 months of life than
do 1,000 to 1,750 gm babies."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Hoffman-Williamson, Amer.
Academy for Cerebral Palsy and
Developmental Med., Chicago, 1983</font>

<dt>But is the cost worth it?
<dd>The cost is high. Back in 1979, Dr. T. McCarthy in Denver
reported that the mean cost for 500 to 999 gm infants was
$25,000. The cost for infants born weighing between 2,000 to
2,499 gm was only $5,000.<br>
<font size=-2>J. T. McCarthy, et al., "Who Pays the
Bill for Neonatal Intensive Care?" <i>Jour.
of Pediatrics,</i> vol. 95, 1979, p. 755</font><p>

A Chicago study of infants born before 34 weeks showed that they
averaged costs amounting to $10,000, if born in a perinatal
center, but $18,000, if transferred in from an outlying
hospital.<br>
<font size=-2>C. L. Anderson, "An Analysis of Maternal
Transport within a Suburban Metropolitan
Region," <i>Amer. Jour. of OB/GYN,</i> 1981</font><p>

But what does a coronary bypass cost? How much for a kidney
transplant or joint replacements, or extensive cancer treatment?
Compare the total cost of these and divide the number of years of
life expectancy. Then take the cost of saving the preemie, divide
by a normal life expectancy of around 75 years and, even on a
strict cost-benefit analysis, we get a real bargain. If the
expense today would be $75,000 for such an infant, that would
"cost out" at just $1,000 per year.

<dt>What about very early survivors?
<dd>Since single cases are not usually reported in professional
journals, we turn to the daily press for data on these little
ones. There were a few very young survivors as early as ten years
ago. These included:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Alicia Ponce - 24 weeks - 644 gm - April '74 - (Associated
Press)
<li>Tascha Hudson - 23 weeks - 580 gm - March '74 - (Brooke Army
Hosp.)
<li>Tracy LaBranch - 22 weeks, 1 day - 538 gm - March '72 - (Battle
Creek Enquirer)
<li>Suzanne South - 21 weeks, 2 days - 644 gm - July '71 -(Bethesda
Hosp., Cincinnati)
<li>Kelly Thorman - 21 weeks - 596 gm - March '71 - (St. Vincent
Hosp., Toledo)
<li>Marcus Richardson - 19 weeks, 6 days - 780 gm - Jan. '72 -
(University Hosp., Cincinnati)
</ul>

More recently there have been increasing numbers reported:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Simmonne Jayette - 23 weeks - 595 gm - April '78 - (Montreal
Jewish General Hospital)
<li>Melissa Cameron - 20 weeks - 450 gm - Dec. '83 - (Sault Ste.
Marie Hosp., Cincinnati Enquirer)
<li>Ernestine Hudgins - 22 weeks - 484 gm - Feb. '83 - (San Diego,
Washington Post)
<li>Mimi Faulkner - 23 weeks - 484 gm - Nov. '78 - (San Diego,
Boston Herald)
<li>Melissa Murray - 22 weeks - 510 gm - June '83 - (Victoria,
Texas - Houston Post)
<li>Kenya King - 21 weeks - 510 gm - June '85 - (Med. World News,
Nov. 11, 1985, p. 119)
</ul>

An inquiry in your authors' city revealed two preemies in one
hospital, both born at 24 weeks, weighing 580 gm and 608 gm at
birth. Both progressed normally and survived without apparent
abnormalities.<br>

Personal communications with authors.
Apr. 1984 and Dec. 1984</font>

<dt>The age and weight don't always track together?
<dd>There is a variance, just as with children and adults, but a much
narrower one. Dr. L. Lubchenco, University of Colorado, has been
the recognized authority in preparing most of the charts used.
Babies can be small for stated age or "runts," if malnourished.
They can also be large for stated age, as was baby Marcus
Richardson in the list above, but still fall within the 90
percentile range on the charts.

<dt>How tiny can one presently survive?
<dd>Here is a list of some infants born who weighed under 454 gm (one
pound):
<ul type=disc>
<li>Jamie Baire - 24 weeks - 446 gm - Oct. '83 - (Garfield
Hospital, Monterey, CA)
<li>Chaya Snyder - 26 weeks - 420 gm - Oct. '79 - (Albert Einstein
Hospital, NYC)
<li>Melissa Cameron - 20 weeks - 450 gm - Dec. '83 -  (Sault Ste.
Marie Hospital, Cincinnati Enquirer)
<li>Russell Williams - 26 weeks - 450 gm - Nov. '79 - (Memorial
Hospital, Long Beach, CA)
<li>Darlene Monroe - 27 weeks - 360 gm May 27, 1986 - (Medical
Post, Canada)
<li>Brandon William Spense - 22 weeks - 340 gm - July 13, 1986 -
(Cincinnati Enquirer)
</ul>

<dt>Will the survival age ever drop under 20 weeks?
<dd>It's only a question of time and technology. Some day there will
be artificial placentas and then who knows how early a preemie
will be able to survive?<p>

For instance, it may be possible to save babies much younger by
using oxygen saturated liquid instead of air.<br>

<i>"When the lives of the unborn are snuffed out, they often
feel pain, pain that is long and agonizing."</i><br>
<font size=-2>President Ronald Reagan
to National Religious Broadcasters,
<i>New York Times,</i> Jan. 31, 1984</font>

<dl>
<dt>That statement by President Reagan was denied by some!
<dd>Yes, but, then it was confirmed as accurate by a well-documented
statement from an auspicious group of professors, including pain
specialists and two past presidents of the American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology. The text of their letter follows:<p>

<blockquote>
February 13, 1984<p>

President Ronald Reagan<br>
The White House<br>
Washington, DC<p>

Mr. President:<p>

As physicians, we, the undersigned, are pleased to associate
ourselves with you in drawing the attention of people across
the nation to the humanity and sensitivity of the human
unborn.<p>

That the unborn, the prematurely born, and the newborn of the
human species is a highly complex, sentient, functioning,
individual organism is established scientific fact. That the
human unborn and newly born do respond to stimuli is also
established beyond any reasonable doubt.<p>

The ability to feel pain and respond to it is clearly not a
phenomenon that develops de novo at birth. Indeed, much of
enlightened modern obstetrical practice and procedure seeks to
minimize sensory deprivation of, and sensory insult to, the
fetus during, at, and after birth. Over the last 18 years, real
time ultrasonography, fetoscopy, study of the fetal EKG
(electrocardiogram) and fetal EEG (electroencephalogram) have
demonstrated the remarkable responsiveness of the human fetus
to pain, touch, and sound. That the fetus responds to changes
in light intensity within the womb, to heat, to cold, and to
taste (by altering the chemical nature of the fluid swallowed
by the fetus) has been exquisitely documented in the pioneering
work of the late Sir William Liley -- the father of fetology.<p>

Observations of the fetal electrocardiogram and the increase in
fetal movements in saline abortions indicate that the fetus
experiences discomfort as it dies. Indeed, one doctor who, the
<i>New York Times</i> wrote, "conscientiously performs" saline
abortions stated, "When you inject the saline, you often see an
increase in fetal movements, it's horrible."<p>

We state categorically that no finding of modern fetology
invalidates the remarkable conclusion drawn after a lifetime of
research by the late Professor Arnold Gesell of Yale
University. In <i>The Embryology of Behavior: The Beginnings of
the Human Mind</i> (1945, Harper Bros.), Dr. Gesell wrote, "and so
by the close of the first trimester the fetus is a sentient,
moving being. We need not speculate as to the nature of his
psychic attributes, but we may assert that the organization of
his psychosomatic self is well under way."<p>

Mr. President, in drawing attention to the capability of the
human fetus to feel pain, you stand on firmly established
ground.<p>

Respectfully,<p>

<dt>But the unborn baby can't tell us that he or she feels pain.
<dd>Pain can be detected when nociceptors (pain receptors) discharge
electrical impulses to the spinal cord and brain. These fire
impulses outward, telling the muscles and body to react. These
can be measured.<br>
<font size=-2>Mountcastle, <i>Medical Physiology,</i>
St. Louis: C. V. Mosby, pp. 391-427</font><p>

The first detectable brain activity in response to noxious (pain)
stimuli occurs in the thalamus between the ninth and tenth weeks.<br>
<font size=-2>Reinis & Goldman, <i>The Development of the
Brain,</i> Thomas Publishers, 1980, pp. 223-235</font><p>

"The sensory nerve of the face, the Trigeminal nerve, is already
present in all of its three branches in a four week old human
embryo . . . At seven weeks they twitch or turn their head away
from a stimulus in the same defensive maneuver seen at all stages
of life."<br>

<dt>But isn't pain mostly psychological?
<dd>There is also organic, or physiological pain which elicits a
neurological response to pain.<br>
<font size=-2>P. Lubeskind, "Psychology & Physiology
of Pain," <i>Amer. Review Psychology,</i>
vol. 28, 1977, p. 42</font>

<dt>Some is reflex pain?
<dd>Yes. When you stick a baby with a diaper pin, she will object.
Her initial reflex recoil is exactly what happens in the womb
after eight weeks when the same child is painfully stimulated.<p>

Changes in heart rate and fetal movement also suggest that
intrauterine manipulations are painful to the fetus.<br>
<font size=-2>Volman & Pearson, "What the Fetus Feels,"
<i>British Med. Jour.,</i> Jan. 26, 1980, pp. 233-234.</font>

<dt>How have lawmakers reacted to this knowledge?
<dd>There have been bills introduced to require abortionists to
anesthetize the unborn baby before killing him or her.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Siljander, <i>Congressional
Record,</i> E609, Feb. 23, 1984</font><p>

One early dramatic account was by Dr. R. Selzer of Yale
University. A needle had been inserted through the mother's
abdominal wall and into the four-month-old baby's bag of waters
when, suddenly, he related,<p>

<blockquote>
". . . the hub of the needle in the woman's belly has jerked.
First to one side. Then to the other side. Once more it
wiggles, is <i>tugged,</i> like a fishing line nibbled by a
sunfish. It is the fetus that worries thus."<br>
<font size=-2>
R. Selzer, "What I Saw in
Abortion," <i>Esquire,</i> pp. 66-67</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>Give some more specific quotes.
<dd>". . . as soon as pain mechanism is present in the fetus --
possibly as early as day 45 -- the methods used will cause pain.
The pain is more substantial and lasts longer the later the
abortion is. It is most severe and lasts longest when the method
is salt poisoning. . . . They are undergoing their death agony."<br>
<font size=-2>Noonan, "The Experience of Pain,"
<i>In New Perspectives on Human Abortion,</i>
Aletheia Books, 1981, p. 213</font>

<dt>What of the "Nathanson" movie?
<dd>A <i>Realtime</i> ultrasound video tape and movie of a 12-week suction
abortion is commercially available as, <i>The Silent Scream,</i>
narrated by Dr. B. Nathanson, a former abortionist. It
dramatically, but factually, shows the pre-born baby dodging the
suction instrument time after time, while its heartbeat doubles
in rate. When finally caught, its body being dismembered, the
baby's mouth clearly opens wide -- hence, the title (available
from American Portrait Films, P.O. Box 19266, Cleveland, OH
44119, 216-531-8600). Proabortionists have attempted to discredit
this film. A well documented paper refuting their charges is
available from National Right to Life, 419 7th St. NW,
Washington, DC 20004, $2.00 p.p.<p>

A short, 10-minute video showing the testimony of the doctor who
did the abortion in <i>Silent Scream</i> definitely debunks any
criticism of <i>Silent Scream</i>'s accuracy. <i>The Answer,</i> Bernadel,
Inc., P.O. Box 1897, Old Chelsea Station, New York, NY, 10011.

<dt>Pain? What of just comfort?
<dd>"One of the most uncomfortable ledges that the unborn can
encounter is his mother's backbone. If he happens to be lying so
that his own backbone is across hers  [when the mother lies on
her back], the unborn will wiggle around until he can get away
from this highly disagreeable position."<br>
<font size=-2>
M. Liley & B. Day, <i>Modern Motherhood,</i>
Random House, 1969, p. 42</font>

<dt>Give me more testimony verifying fetal pain.
<dd>"By 13 weeks, organic response to noxious stimuli occurs at all
levels of the nervous system, from the pain receptors to the
thalamus. Thus, at that point, the fetal organic response to pain
is more than a reflexive response. It is an integrated
physiological attempt to avert the noxious stimuli."<br>
<font size=-2>Wm. Matviuw, M.D., Diplomate,
Amer. College of OB & GYN</font><p>

"When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb,
they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the
same fashion as a child would. But they soon learned that he
would."<br>

"Lip tactile response may be evoked by the end of the 7th week.
At 11 weeks, the face and all parts of the upper and lower
extremities are sensitive to touch. By 13.5 to 14 weeks, the
entire body surface, except for the back and the top of the head,
are sensitive to pain."<br>
<font size=-2>
S. Reinis & J. Goldman,
<i>The Development of the Brain</i></font><p>

"The fetus needs to be heavily sedated. The changes in heart rate
and increase in movement suggest that these stimuli are painful
for the fetus. Certainly it cannot be comfortable for the fetus
to have a scalp electrode implanted on his skin, to have blood
taken from the scalp or to suffer the skull compression that may
occur even with spontaneous delivery. It is hardly surprising
that infants delivered by difficult forceps extraction act as if
they have a severe headache."<br>
<font size=-2>Valman & Pearson, "What the Fetus Feels,"
<i>British Med. Jour.,</i> Jan. 26, 1980</font><p>

"As early as eight to ten weeks gestation, and definitely by
thirteen and a half weeks, the human fetus experiences organic
pain." (See letter to President Reagan above.)<br>
<font size=-2>V. Collins, M.D., Diplomate and
Fellow, Amer. Board of Anesthesiologists</font><p>

"Dilatation and evacuation, for example, where fetal tissue is
progressively punctured, ripped, and crushed, and which is done
after 13 weeks when the fetus certainly responds to noxious
stimuli, would cause organic pain in the fetus. Saline
amnioinfusion, where a highly concentrated salt solution burns
away the outer skin of the fetus, also qualifies as a noxious
stimulus."<br>

<dl>
<dt>What is In Vitro fertilization?
<dd>It involves giving a woman drugs to induce ovulation and then
harvesting (collecting) those mature eggs through a laparoscope.
The man masturbates to collect the semen. Then, the semen and ova
are mixed in a dish, where fertilization may occur. Then the
tiny, new embryonic human(s) are put into the cavity of the
woman's uterus with the hope that they will plant and grow.

<dt>What does Right to Life think of this?
<dd>Since some RTL groups limit their official organizational policy
to protecting human life already conceived, they have no official
position on the "preliminaries." All, however, totally object to
the destruction of any of these tiny human lives once they exist.
All, therefore, condemn the "pick-of-the-litter" practice. This
is when certain "concepti" (embryos) are discarded (killed) while
others are planted.<p>

The pregnancy rate was double in those who got "high calibre
embryos."<br>
<font size=-2>Dickey, "Grading Helps Embryo Quality,"
<i>OB-GYN News,</i> Dec. 1, 1986, p. 39</font>

<dt>What is the success?
<dd>Reports vary from 6% to 22%, but this is with two to four embryos
planted, and one making it.<br>
<font size=-2>
Dodson, "Low I.V.F. Rate,"
<i>OB-GYN News,</i> Oct. 15, 1986, p. 18</font>

<dt>But these are not really humans yet, are they?
<dd>Wrong! The success of in vitro fertilization techniques has only
added further proof that each human being is alive, sexed,
intact, complete, human, and growing from the single cell stage.
This tiny being is a complete human body.<p>

To illustrate, let's assume that a new, tiny embryonic male
human, from a black mother and father was planted in the womb of
a white woman. The baby she would deliver, months later, would be
the black son of those black parents. The white woman would have
provided only nutrition and a home for the tiny unborn baby to
grow and develop.<p>

Human life, total and complete, begins at conception.

<dt>What of frozen embryos?
<dd>Preliminary thinking poses all kinds of moral objections. Since
present technology involves the death of 50% of frozen embryos in
the thawing process, it must be condemned.<br>
<font size=-2>
J. Kennan, <i>USA Today,</i>
October 25, 1984, p. 7A</font><p>

Some more recent reports have had losses of only 30-40%.<p>

"The pregnancy rate per patient who had embryos frozen was 8%."<br>
<font size=-2>
Trounson, "Preservation of Human Eggs
and Embryos," <i>Fertility and Sterility,</i>
vol. 46, no. 1, July 1986</font>

<dt>What of embryo transplant?
<dd>This technique almost inevitably results in the direct killing of
some of the live human embryonic male and female humans who are
transplanted. One report had only two of twelve (or 16%) survive.<br>
<font size=-2>
Bustillo et al., "Ovum Transfer
in Infertile Women," <i>JAMA,</i>
vol. 251, no. 9, Mar. 2, 1984</font><p>

Another had 14% success.<br>
<font size=-2>
Marshall & Merz, "Stock Breeding Technique
Applied to Human Fertility, <i>JAMA,</i>
vol. 250, no. 10, Sept. 9, 1983, p. 1257</font>

<dt>Are there similar methods of fertilization acceptable to all
churches?
<dd>Yes. Apparently, neither the Roman Catholic nor other churches
object to Low Tubal Ovum Transport (LTOT) or Gamet
Intra-Fallopian Transfer (GIFT). GIFT brings together the egg and
the husband's sperm collected from her vagina after the sex act.
LTOT enables sperm to bypass a blocked tube.

<dt>What of resultant abnormal humans?
<dd>If any of these techniques result in the conception and growth of
babies with handicaps, their lives must be respected and
protected just as yours and ours. The use of midtrimester
amniocentesis or of chorionic villi sampling to detect those who
are not perfect (in order to kill them) would be condemned.

<dt>What is chorionic villi sampling?
<dd>This sampling, or biopsy, is an exam which involves passing a
small instrument through the cervix, in early pregnancy, to cut
away a very small piece of the edge of the tissue surrounding the
baby. Since this tissue is a part of the baby's body, it has the
same genetic makeup as the rest of the baby. The same information
previously obtained only by amniocentesis will probably be
obtained in the future by this newer technique.

<dt>Is it safe?
<dd>It has its hazards. Early reports indicate that from 3.5% to 12%
of the babies so tested are lost in a miscarriage as a result of
the sampling.

One report gave only a 5% loss "in experienced hands," but noted
that "the question of potential Rh Isoimmunization, subtle birth
defects, prematurity, placental separation, and intrauterine
growth retardation will be answered as more infants are
delivered."<br>
<font size=-2>
M. Golbus, "Initial Chorionic
Biopsy Problems Being Resolved,"
<i>OB-GYN News,</i> Nov. 15, 1984, p. 4</font><p>

Another reported a 3% fetal loss on one sampling, 7.8% on a
second try, and 14.3% after the third.<br>
<font size=-2>
Wade & Young, "Analysis of Fetal Loss After
Transcervical Choronic Villus Sampling,"
<i>Amer. J. OB-GYN,</i> 1989, 161:513-9</font><p>

Further, there is a reported 3% false positive in one study,
i.e., 3% of the babies, killed because they tested abnormal,
turned out to be normal.<br>
<font size=-2>
<i>Br. Med. J.,</i> L.C. van Prooijen-Knegt, 1987<br>
<i>N.Y. Times,</i> G. Kolata, Oct. 9, 1987</font>

<dt>Why is it done?
<dd>To seek out and identify babies with handicaps -- so they can be
killed. There is no genetic abnormality or disease known to
medical science that can be treated in the first six months of
pregnancy.

<dt>Is living embryo experimentation presently taking place?
<dd>Yes, although few centers will admit it. In Britain the
government established an official commission to look into this.
Their recommendation was that experimentation on living human
embryos was all right, but that they must be killed and not
allowed to grow beyond 14 days.

The resultant public reaction and also the reaction in the
British Parliament has made the acceptance of this recommendation
highly unlikely.<br>
<font size=-2>
"Warnock" Commission of Inquiry into
Human Fertilization and Embryology,
<i>New York Times,</i> Oct. 16, 1984</font><p>

<dt>Give an example of such embryo experimentation.
<dd>England's Dr. Robert Edwards, at an international meeting of
medical scientists in Norfolk in 1983, spoke of experimenting on
some "concepti" and then discarding them. Right to Life has
condemned this.<br>
<font size=-2>
<i>Human Reproduction and Extracorporeal
Fertilization with Embryo Transfer,</i>
Norfolk, VA, Sept. 12, 1983</font><p>

At the Norfolk meeting, Dr. Edwards suggested one experiment
which would use micro-surgery to cut, exactly in half, a two,
four, or eight cell living human embryo. If both halves continued
to live and grow, there would be identical twins. Dr. Edwards
would plant one back into the mother's womb. The other would be
artificially grown larger, and then he or she would be killed and
a chromosome exam done. If this baby proved to be abnormal, the
twin would also be killed (by very early abortion).

<dt>How many abortions are there?

<dd>In 1985, 1,588,600 abortions were done in the U.S., with 10%
being late abortions (after 12 weeks) (Alan Guttmacher
Institute's figure). When the unreported abortions are added
(income tax evasion, cover-up for privacy, etc.), a figure of
1,800,000 is probably more realistic. Live births have hovered
around the 3,600,000 figure for several years. Therefore: <i>Almost
every third baby conceived in America is killed by abortion.</i> In
the U.S., about 40% of the total are repeat abortions.<p>

In Canada, in 1984, there were 62,291 abortions, which is 17.5%
of their birth rate (11.7% were late abortions).

<dt>This is the same in all areas?

<dd>No. There are more abortions in some regions and always more in
cities than in small towns or rural areas. Some cities have more
abortions than births. For example, in 1978, the cities of
Atlanta, Atlantic City, Charlotte, Columbia (SC), Gainesville,
Harrisburg, Iowa City, Madison (WI), Miami, Raleigh, Reno,
Richmond (VA), San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto and Washington, DC
had more abortions than live births.

<dt>How far along in pregnancy were they?

<dd>There were 1,588,600 abortions done in 1985.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Family Planning Perspective,</i> March 1987</font><p>

One percent was done after 21 weeks.<br>
<font size=-2>Center for Disease Control, MWWR, Feb. 1987</font><p>

That means 15,886 done after 21 weeks, annually.

<dt>Even third trimester?

<dd>Yes, e.g., Dr. Wm. Swartz reported on inserting laminaria in 700
women for <u>third</u> trimester abortions.<br>
<font size=-2>Swartz, <i>OB/GYN News,</i> vol. 21,
no. 11, p. 23, Jan '87</font>

<dt>Are any infants born alive after abortion?

<dd>Yes! In Atlanta, GA, there were ten babies born alive in 1980; in
Madison, WI, four in 1982; in New York City, 27 in 1970; in
upstate New York, 38 in 1970-72; in Wilmington, DE, 2 in 1979;
the list is even longer.<p>

"About once a day, somewhere in the U.S., something goes wrong
and an abortion results in a live baby." Forty-five of the 607
midtrimester abortions done at Mount Sinai Hospital in Hartford,
CT, between 1974 and 1976 resulted in live births.<br>
<font size=-2>"Avoiding Tough Abortion Complication, A Live Birth,"
<i>Medical World News,</i> Nov. 14, 1977, p. 83</font><p>

Not many are officially reported. Dr. Willard Cates, the
aggressively pro-abortion former chief of abortion surveillance
for the Center for Disease Control, said that reporting abortion
live births "is like turning yourself in to the IRS for an income
tax audit. What is there to gain?"<br>
<font size=-2>L. Jeffries & R. Edmonds, "The Dreaded Complication,"
<i>Philadelphia Inquirer,</i> Aug. 2, 1981</font>

<dt>Do these babies survive?

<dd>Almost all die, usually because the abortionist neglects them or
actively kills them. Some have survived to be adopted and are
normal. In one case, an unborn baby had her left arm amputated at
the shoulder by the abortionist and also had deep scalp
lacerations. Healing occurred and the baby was later delivered
alive. A medical journal later carried her photo, which was taken
by Dr. R. Thomsen of Walla Walla, WA.

<dt>Are twins ever aborted?

<dd>Yes! In early pregnancy, abortion usually kills them both. But,
in England, after a ten-week abortion and sterilization, a woman
"stayed pregnant" and later delivered alive the dead baby's twin.
<br>
<font size=-2><i>The Sun,</i> London, July 11, 1974</font><p>

In later pregnancy the survival of a twin can be unintended, as
at New York Cornell Medical Center, when the abortionist, Dr. F.
Fuchs, in an attempted abortion, injected salt into only one of
a set of twin's amniotic sacks without knowing there were twins.
That baby was killed and was aborted. Its twin was later
delivered alive, but was too tiny to survive.
<br>
<font size=-2><i>New York Daily News,</i> Sept. 11, 1970</font><p>

Finally, the ultimate in technologically sophisticated killing
occurred when one of a set of twins was selectively killed. Tests
had shown one to have Down's Syndrome, the other to be normal. At
20 weeks, a needle was passed into the body and heart of the tiny
handicapped boy and the blood sucked out, killing him instantly.
Later, the mother delivered the normal baby, and the tiny,
shrunken dead body of his little brother.<br>
<font size=-2>Kerenyi & Chitkara, "Selective Birth
in Twin Pregnancy with Discordancy
for Down's Syndrome," <i>New England Jour.
of Medicine,</i> vol. 304, no. 25, 1981, p. 1525</font><p>

And two of quintuplets were killed, allowing triplets to be born.<br>
<font size=-2>Brandes et al., "Reduction of Embryos
in Multiple Pregnancy," <i>Fertility and
Sterility,</i> vol. 48, no. 3, Aug. 1987, p. 236</font>

<dt>What about repeat abortions?

<dd>The longer a nation has legal abortion, the higher the percent of
repeaters. In 1970, only 0.6% of New York City abortions were
repeats. By 1974, it was 21%; and by 1975, it was 38%. By 1987,
in the U.S., it was 43%.<br>
<font size=-2>Powell-Griner, "Induced Terminations of Pregnancy,"
<i>Monthly Vital Statistics Report,</i> Nat'l. Center for
Health Statistics, vol 35, no. 3, July 14, 1986.</font>

<dt>What about Informed Consent?

<dd>This is one of the most tragic abuses associated with the
abortion industry. In any other type of surgery, the doctor is
required to explain in detail what the procedure is, its possible
complications, etc. Only then does the patient give "informed"
consent.<p>

Abortion is unique in that, while it is surgery that is
potentially dangerous to the mother, it also destroys the living
being within her. To be fully informed, she should be given full
factual information on the surgery, its possible complications
(immediate and long-term), and, also, full details about "what
she carries."<p>

What is done? Very little factual information is given at all,
and what is given is often false. The complications are ignored,
glossed over, or given on a paper in fine print. Her passenger is
referred to as "pregnancy tissue," "not alive yet," "not a baby
yet," "just a bunch of cells," "only a glob." These descriptions
are given at a stage of development when the baby already sucks
her thumb and feels pain, and when we can listen to her tiny
heartbeat on an office ultrasonic stethoscope.<p>

Such deception of the mother and planned railroading of her into
an abortion is never more evident than when the so-called
"counselor" asks her, "Do you want your menstrual period
re-established? If so, just sign up for this procedure." Abortion
is not mentioned, nor anything about the baby.<p>

There is no better example of the exploitation of women than this
continuing, commercialized, and almost universal deception.

<dt>And it is legal till birth?

<dd>"Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant
legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United
States for a woman to obtain an abortion for any reason during
any stage of her pregnancy."<br>
<font size=-2>Report of the Senate Judiciary
Committee on the Human Life Federalism
Amendment, June 8, 1982, p. 3</font>

<dt>How else are abortions different?

<dd>Abortions are unique among all types of surgery. The chart below
reflects the situation in free standing abortion clinics in the
U.S. which do 90% of the abortions there. To a greater or less
extent, in every nation, abortion procedures are commonly exempt
from the sanitary and professional rules required of other
surgery.<p>

<dl>
<dt>Is abortion done for sex selection?

<dd>Yes. And the girls are almost always the ones killed.<p>

"Of a series of 100 pregnant women recently tested and told the
sex of their unborn children, a female fetus was detected in 46.
Twenty-nine of these mothers elected to abort. Of 53 found to be
carrying males, only one woman chose to terminate her pregnancy."
<br>
<font size=-2><i>Med. World News,</i> Dec. 1, 1945, p. 45</font><p>

In a recent series of 8,000 amniocenteses done in Bombay, India,
7,999 unborn girl babies and one boy baby were killed.

<dt>How about race?

<dd>Based on a percentage of total population, since legalization
there have been two minority race babies killed by abortion for
every one white baby per unit of population. This stands in stark
contrast to the fact that all polls have consistently shown a
higher percentage of minority race people opposing abortion than
white people.<p>

Why? Michael Novak, in an article in the <i>Washington Star,</i>
pointed to the loss of 1.3% of the total population of black
people annually in the U.S. through abortion and expressed his
surprise "that black leaders so easily go along with the abortion
rate among black women."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Novak, "How Placidly They Accept Aborting So
Many Black Babies," <i>Washington Star,</i> Nov. 14, 1976</font><p>

Abortion statistics from the state of Michigan also confirm this.
In 1982, 67% of Medicaid abortions were performed on black women,
while only 35% of blacks of all ages were receiving Medicaid.

<dt>But black leaders often support legal abortion.

<dd>"Black leaders react in traditional, knee-jerk liberal fashion to
issues across the board, even though, in general, black Americans
are decidedly conservative on a number of issues. The Black
Caucus, for example, advocates a 'right' to abort, whereas 62% of
blacks oppose abortion (National Opinion Research Center, 1984)."<br>
<font size=-2>J. Perkins, "Are Black Leaders Listening to Black
America?" <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> Oct. 16, 1984, p. 28</font>

<dt>What percentage of those who get abortions are teenagers?

<dd>About one-third. Another one-third are in the 20-24 age group,
while slightly more than the remaining one-third are age 25 and
older.<p>

Three-fourths of the women getting abortions are unmarried.

<dt>Planned Parenthood claims that one million teenagers get pregnant
each year. Is this true?

<dd>This is a classic half-truth. The inference is that all of them
are unmarried and young. In fact, 280,000 teenagers who get
pregnant are married, and an additional 100,000 marry when the
pregnancy is confirmed, so only 620,000 are unmarried. That is
less than two-thirds the number Planned Parenthood claims.<p>

As for the actual ages of these one million teenage pregnancies
claimed by Planned Parenthood, fewer than 250,000 were under 18
years old and unmarried. There were 9,632 births in the
14-year-old and under group.<br>
<font size=-2><i>New York Times,</i> (AP Washington), Nov. 7, 1984</font><p>

No one should be proud of these figures, but they are sharply
less than those claimed by Planned Parenthood. Further, there has
been no increase in the percentage of teenagers becoming pregnant
in recent years. The National Center for Health Statistics
reports that the births among under 20-year-old women in 1981
were 537,024, which amounted to 18% fewer births than in 1970,
when far fewer teenagers gave birth to 656,460 babies.

<dt>But think of the additional welfare costs for all these babies born
to teenagers.

<dd>Planned Parenthood's own figures are that there will be welfare
costs of $13,900 for each first birth to a teenager (married and
unmarried), and $8,400 cost for each first birth to her if she is
20 years or older. Compare this with the average of nearly
$50,000 each will ultimately pay in taxes as an adult.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Burt, "Public Cost of Teen Childbearing," <i>Family
Planning Perspectives,</i> vol. 18, no. 5, Sept. 1986</font><p>

In the decade of the 1970s, while pregnancies did increase,
abortions more than doubled, so that the number of babies being
born to teenagers dropped 23%.

<i>There is serious question whether mental health, viewed as a
psychiatric illness, can ever be a reason to induce abortion.</i><p>

The term "mental health," as commonly used, is synonymous with the
United Nations' definition of "health," which means social,
emotional, and economic well-being, as judged by the person
him/herself. This is a broad, sweeping definition which soars far
beyond and cannot be equated with "mental health," as medically
defined.<p>

As early as 1971, Dr. Louis Hellman, deputy assistant secretary of
the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), who was
strongly pro-abortion, said (at Columbia Women's Hospital,
Washington, DC), that the requirement of a psychiatrist's
permission for abortion was a "gross sham."<br>
<font size=-2><i>Washington Post,</i> Nov. 25, 1971</font><p>

This reference was made in spite of (or because of), the fact that,
of a total 14,717 hospital abortions performed in California (Nov.
'67-Sept. '69), 90% were for mental health purposes.<br>
<font size=-2>California Dept. of Public
Health, Third Annual Report to
California Legislature, 1970</font><p>

In New York, where the law did not require such a subterfuge, only
2% of the abortions reported for 1970 were performed for "mental
health" reasons. Every state or nation that has legalized abortion
for "health" has abortion-on-demand.<p>

<dl>
<dt>There used to be only physical health reasons?

<dd>Yes. But prior to legalization, these reasons had all but
vanished. Already in 1951, Dr. R. J. Heffernan, of Tufts
University, said:<p>

"Anyone who performs a therapeutic abortion (for physical
disease) is either ignorant of modern methods of treating the
complications of pregnancy, or is unwilling to take time to
use them."<br>
<font size=-2>Congress of American College of Surgeons, 1951</font>

<dt>Aren't there any valid psychiatric reasons for abortion?

<dd>Dr. R. Sloan, who was pro-abortion, said:<p>

"There are no unequivocal psychiatric indications for
abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>R. Sloan, <i>New England Jour. Med.,</i> May 29, 1969</font><p>

Later, Frank Ayd, M.D., medical editor and nationally known
psychiatrist, said:<p>

"True psychiatric reasons for abortion have become practically
non-existent. Modern psychiatric therapy has made it possible
to carry a mentally ill woman to term."<br>
<font size=-2>F. Ayd, <i>Medical Moral Newsletter</i></font>

<dt>Are you saying that "mental illness" is usually just an excuse to
have an abortion?

<dd>We are saying exactly that.

<dt>What of the woman in poor mental health? If the abortion won't help
her, will it harm her?

<dd>This has been a rather well-kept secret. In an otherwise strongly
pro-abortion paper, it was stated that "women with a history of
psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some
psychiatric disturbance" after an abortion as others who had no
such history.<br>
<font size=-2>E. Greenglass, "Abortion & Psychiatric
Disturbance," <i>Canadian Psych. Assn. Jour.,</i>
vol. 21, no. 7, Nov. 1976, pp. 453-459</font><p>

Dr. Charles Ford and his associates at UCLA reported the same
finding.<p>

"The more serious the psychiatric diagnosis, the less
beneficial was the abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>C. Ford et al., "Abortion, Is It a Therapeutic
Procedure in Psychiatry?" <i>JAMA,</i> vol. 218,
no. 8, Nov. 22, 1971, pp. 1173-1178</font><p>

"The more severely ill the psychiatric patient, the worse is
her post-abortion psychiatric state."<br>
<font size=-2>E. Sandberg, "Psychology of Abortion."
In <i>Comprehensive Handbook of Psychiatry,</i>
3rd ed. Kaplan & Friedman Publishers, 1980</font><p>

All of these support the original official statement of the World
Health Organization in 1970:<p>

"Serious mental disorders arise more often in women with
previous mental problems. Thus, the very women for whom legal
abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are
the ones who have the highest risk of post-abortion
psychiatric disorders."

<dt>What of bad effects if a woman is in good mental health?

<dd>"The trauma of abortion may have significant emotional sequelae
[aftermath]. . . . Few medical subjects are as fraught with
strong sociological, political, cultural, and moral
implications as abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>C. Hall & S. Zisook, "Psychological
Distress Following Therapeutic
Abortion," <i>The Female Patient,</i>
vol. 8, Mar. 1983, pp. 34/47-34/48</font><p>

"When patients present with emotional problems, and there is a
history of abortion, then the emotional sequelae of the
abortion should be considered the major offending life event
until proven otherwise. Patients usually never make this
association because the offending conflicts are predominantly
lodged in the unconscious mind."<br>
<font size=-2>R. Maddock & R. Sexton, "The Rising
Cost of Abortion," <i>Medical Hypno-
analysis,</i> Spring 1980, pp. 62-67</font>

<dt>But most polls show few emotional problems -- only a sense of
relief!

<dd>Yes, but "What women really feel at the deepest level about
abortion is very different from what they say in reply to
questionnaires." A Canadian study polled a group of women who had
previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having
problems from an abortion. One half of this group was randomly
chosen for in-depth psychotherapy.<p>

"What emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast [to the
questionnaires], even when the woman had rationally considered
abortion to be inevitable, the only course of action." It was
demonstrated that the conscious, rationalized decision for an
abortion can coexist with profound rejection of it at the
deepest level. Despite surface appearances, abortion leaves
behind deeper feelings "invariably of intense pain, involving
bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus."

Elective Abortion," <i>British College of

<i>Family Practice News,</i> June 1980, p. 80</font>

<dt>Does it ever lead to suicide?

<dd>Suicide is rare among pregnant women, but much more common after
induced abortion. It is never reported under maternal mortality
from abortion, of course, even though it is causative.

<dt>Rare while pregnant? I thought it was common in women who were
refused abortion.

<dd>This is an oft-repeated fallacy. Suicide among pregnant women is
extremely rare. Several well-controlled studies have shown this
conclusively. The State of Ohio had only two maternal suicide
deaths between the years 1955-1963.<br>
<font size=-2>"Maternal Deaths Involving Suicide,"
<i>Ohio State Med. Jour.,</i> Dec. 1966, p. 1294</font><p>

Between 1938 and 1958, over 13,500 Swedish women were refused
abortions. Only three committed suicide.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Ottosson, "Legal Abortion in Sweden,"
<i>Jour. Biosocial Sciences,</i> vol. 3, 1971, p. 173</font><p>

In Brisbane, Australia, no pregnant woman has ever committed
suicide.<br>
<font size=-2>F. Whitlock & J. Edwards, "Pregnancy & Attempted
Suicide," <i>Comp. Psychiatry,</i> vol. 9, no. 1, 1968</font><p>

In Birmingham, England, in seven years, 119 women under 50
committed suicide. None were pregnant.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Sim, "Abortion & the Psychiatrist,"
<i>British Med. Jour.,</i> vol. 2, 1963, p. 145</font><p>

In a detailed report of the Minnesota experience from 1950-65
entitled, <i>Criminal Abortion Deaths, Illegitimate Pregnancy
Deaths, and Suicides in Pregnancy,</i> the following facts are
reported:<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li> There were only 14 maternal suicides in the state of Minnesota
in 15 years, or one for every 93,000 live births. Four were
first pregnancies. None were illegitimately pregnant.

<li> Ten of these women committed suicide after delivery, only four
while pregnant, leading to the author's comment, "The fetus in
utero must be a protective mechanism. Perhaps women are
reluctant to take another life with them when they do this."

<li> Twelve of the 14 suicides were psychotic depressions. Two were
schizophrenics. Only four had seen a psychiatrist.

<li> Male suicide during these years averaged 16 per 100,000
population. Non-pregnant female suicides averaged 3.5 per
100,000, and pregnant female suicides 0.6 per 100,000.

<li> The authors concluded that therapeutic abortion for psychiatric
reasons "seems a most nebulous, non-objective, non-scientific
approach to medicine. It would seem that psychiatrists would
accomplish more by using the available modalities of their
specialty in the treatment or rehabilitation of the patient
instead of recommending the destruction of another one."<br>
<font size=-2>Minnesota Maternal Mortality Committee,
Dept. of OB & GYN, Univ. of Minn.,
<i>Amer. Jour. of OB/GYN,</i> vol. 6, no. 1, 1967</font>
</ul>

<dt>What of post-abortion suicide?

<dd>In one report, two teenaged mothers, following induced abortion,
attempted suicide on the very dates their babies would have been
born.<br>
<font size=-2>C. Tishler, "Adolescent Suicide
Attempt: Anniversary Reaction,"
<i>Pediatrics,</i> vol. 68, 1981, pp. 670-671</font><p>

Post-abortion suicide is slowly growing into a rather frightening
phenomenon. Suiciders Anonymous is a national fellowship
patterned after Alcoholics Anonymous. It tries to help those who
have attempted suicide. Suiciders Anonymous, in a 35-month period
in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, reported counseling 5,620 members.
These people were described as, "those suffering in-depth, deep
depression, anxiety, stress, and fears they cannot overcome,
those who have attempted suicide, often several times, and
failed, and those who are considering taking that final desperate
step." Of these 5,620 people:<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li> 4,000 were women

<li> 1,800 had abortions, of whom

<li> 1,400 were between 15-24 years old.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Uchtman, Ohio Director of
Suiciders Anonymous Report to the
Cincinnati City Council, Sept. 1, 1981</font>
</ul>
<dt>What are the psychodynamics of post-abortion suicide?

<dd>In her report, M. Uchtman (Suiciders Anonymous), said it in a way
which makes it clearly understandable:<p>

"After years of listening to their [would-be suicides']
stories, we know there are thousands more out there being
brave. By holding a tight reign on their emotions, they tuck
all that unexpressed emotion and unshared experience deep down
inside themselves, where it keeps growing, like a pressured
tumor of pain.<p>

"Of all the emotions they experience during the abortion
crisis, none brings more pain and distress than the one they
now know and identify five to ten times more than any other
feelings. These women always tell us the same thing. 'Oh, my
God, I am evil. I have to be evil to have done this thing. I
feel so alone, so forsaken.'<p>

"Panic and distress grips them after an abortion, because the
feelings are allowed to remain shadowy, ominous, ghost-like.
They are shapes dancing around the edges of their
consciousness. They commonly postpone the moment of truth as
long as possible. But when the subconscious throws it forward,
they go through mental hell! Even at age 87, the critical
moment comes when the chilling reality overwhelms them and
cold reality numbs their spirit and casts them into those dark
'pits' of despair and pain!<p>

"They fantasize that the 'cancer' will disappear. But it
cannot! So feelings cannot be denied and repressed without
doing violence to every other area of their living. And of all
those they touch! It is vital that parents are prepared!<p>

"Here are the two questions they always ask us:

<ul type=disc>
<li> 'Will this pain never die?'
<li> 'How many years does it take to get over this pain?'
</ul>

"Margaret Wold writes: 'This pain remains as a counterpoint to
the rest of their lives, even though time mutes its sharpness.
Women who have had abortions and made the decision on their
own are too often faced with intentionally hurting others.
Each woman actually does unintentionally hurt others
immediately after abortion. Why? Because they are seeking
forgiveness. Under any circumstances! Sad, isn't it?'<p>

"Many women purposely keep the pain alive by never forgiving
the spouse or mate after the decision. He rejects her, leaving
her to live in the pits alone, in the depths and in deep
depression!<p>

"They become more and more depersonalized, superficial, and
artificial. Suicide is now more desirable for them than a
lifetime of false pretense and hopelessness."<br>
<font size=-2>ibid.</font>

<dt>Does Suiciders Anonymous support Parental Notification Laws?

<dd>Yes. "It is an act of cruelty to remove parental duties and
rights during the abortion crisis."<br>
<font size=-2>ibid.</font>

<dt>But few teenagers want to tell their parents!

<dd>We believe the following article, written by one of your authors
after the U.S. Supreme Court Decision, provides an alternative
path for many of those young women Meta Uchtman described above.

<blockquote>
<h3>Your Daughter -- Pregnant?</h3>

And under 18 years? What does she think of you, her parents?
Should she tell you? Sadly, few girls want to. They think
you'll explode, condemn, reject, feel ashamed. She doesn't want
to hurt you. But she is alone, frightened, defiant, worried.
Yes, but still a young girl who desperately needs your love and
help.<p>

The Supreme Court ruling assures her that she can have her baby
killed, can internalize all of the psychic trauma, the
loneliness, the bitterness, and never know that . . .<p>

If she had told you -- Yes, you might have "exploded"
initially. But then, with rare exceptions, you would have
shared your tears and given her the help, support, and love she
so desperately needed. To her surprise, you would not condemn,
but offer all the love, help, and understanding you could in
this time of trial.<p>

In my 25 years of counseling, I have found that when a girl
does come to her parents, and receives the help they can offer,
it becomes the occasion of a real growth in maturity, self-
confidence, and ability to love by the girl. She faces her
responsibility and stands tall. The family bond is strengthened
by the sharing of the burden.<p>

But no, now the tragic Supreme Court Decision can guarantee
that she'll never know that you really love her and would have
helped her. Thanks to them, she can have her baby killed in
secret and become disillusioned, embittered, hardened.<p>

May God have mercy on those judges for what they have done.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Willke, <i>Cincinnati RTL
Newsletter,</i> July 1976, p. 3</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>What if a woman has a psychosis, is pregnant, and needs shock
treatment? Shouldn't she be aborted?

<dd>Pregnancy does not rule out the use of almost any known
psychiatric therapy, including electric shock.

<dt>But don't some women have psychotic breakdowns after delivering a
baby?

<dd>Yes. Postpartum psychosis is relatively common following
childbirth. It, however, is almost entirely unpredictable. It
does not bear any particular relationship to whether or not a
woman had mental trouble during her pregnancy. It frequently
occurs in a woman who was entirely mentally stable during her
pregnancy. Furthermore, these "after the baby blues" are rarely
permanent and seldom have relapses. Also, drug treatment usually
clears the problem promptly and usually without relapse.

<dt>Are there post-abortion psychoses?

<dd>Yes. And compared to post-delivery disturbances, they are much
more serious, last longer, and are more likely to recur. They are
more often the "hard" cases. This had been the experience before
abortion legalization.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Sim, "Abortion and the Psychiatrist,"
<i>British Med. Jour.,</i> vol.2, 1963, pp. 145-148</font><p>

After legalization, a repeat investigation in a larger series of
the same problem gave the same result. Of 199 postpartum
depressive psychoses, "with two exceptions the prognosis was
good." Of 34 post-abortive psychoses, "16 had an adverse
prognosis."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Sim, <i>Instability Associated with
Pregnancy,</i> Univ. of Birmingham Press</font><p>

"The patients clearly functioned well before the abortion and
later experienced psychoses precipitated by guilt over the
abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>J. Spaulding & J. Cavernar, "Psychosis
Following Therapeutic Abortion,"
<i>Amer. Jour. Psychiatry,</i> vol.
135, no. 3, March 1978, p. 364</font>

<dt>Does having a baby help the mental problems?

<dd>It is certainly better than not having children, but just having
children later, in and of itself, doesn't heal the wound in her
mind and heart.<p>

It is interesting that early in the next pregnancy, "Eight of 21
women who had obtained a past abortion were found to be
clinically depressed and anxious. In contrast, only 8 of 98 who
had not had abortions were depressed."<p>

The women with prior abortions expressed fear for their baby's
health because "punishment was due."<br>
<font size=-2>R. Kumar & K. Robson, <i>Psychol.
Med.,</i> vol. 8, 1978, pp. 711-715</font>

<dt>How about an example from a non-Christian culture?

<dd>In Japan, where abortion has been legal and accepted for 35
years, a rapidly growing custom is to conduct Mizuyo Kuyo
services in honor of the god Jizo. This god has been made the
patron saint of infants who died of starvation, abortion, or
infanticide. Small baby statues, in his honor, are bought and
dressed. Then, in a Buddhist Temple, rites of sorrow and
reconciliation are carried out.<p>

Also, Mother Theresa's visits there and her pleas to protect the
unborn have been met with an extraordinary response.

<dt>These guilt feelings don't come from religious beliefs then?

<dd>Certainly there are guilt feelings related to religious beliefs,
but most guilt feelings after abortion have little to do with
religious belief. Abortion violates something very basic in a
woman's nature. She normally is the giver of life. Most women who
are pregnant are quite aware of the fact that they have a baby
growing within them. Your author will never forget a 44-year-old
lady who had been childless during her marriage. A Christian
woman with a Jewish husband, they had been unable to adopt a
child because of their mixed religion. She longed for a child but
was sterile, as several tests had shown her tubes to be blocked.
Theirs was an excellent marriage, and both had given of
themselves to many community and charitable efforts. On this day,
after a routine exam, I told her that, because of a continuing
fibroid enlargement, her uterus would have to be removed.<p>

She gasped as if hit by a pole, and collapsed in a hysterical
heap, completely out of control in her grief and crying.<p>

After considerable time, sedatives, and support, I was able to
again talk with her and the story tumbled out. She related how
she had become pregnant while in college and had an abortion "by
an excellent surgeon." Throughout her subsequent marriage, she
had hoped against hope that, somehow, she would still conceive.
Now I had just told her that her womb must be removed and her
last, faint hope for a baby was forever gone.<p>

Through tear-reddened eyes and with a pathos that still brings a
lump into my throat, she quietly said, "I killed the only baby I
ever bore."

<dt>What is post abortion syndrome (PAS)?

<dd>This is the medical name given to the emotional and psychological
distress experienced by many aborted women. It had been suspected
for a long time, but most studies found few problems. Now
research is showing that it is similar to the Post Traumatic
Stress Syndrome experienced by Vietnam Veterans which ultimately
effected 15% of these military veterans.<br>
<font size=-2>T. Keane, Vietnam Vets Trauma
disorder level at 15%, <i>Am. Med.
News,</i> L. Abraham, Dec 2, 1988, p. 2</font><p>

The cardinal feature of post abortion syndrome is denial and
suppression. This psychological protective mechanism usually
works well for some years. Sooner or later (after 5, 10, or more
years), many women can no longer handle it, and they become
increasingly emotionally disabled.<p>

Denial and repression are central, as is the use of avoidance
behavior. Guilt is a near constant, often with shame, lowered
self-esteem and then depression. Insomnia, sorrow and
hopelessness, anniversary reactions, dreams, nightmares, and
reliving are all part of it. She considers suicide (see above)
and often becomes sexually dysfunctional, perhaps unable to
maintain a stable relationship, often gets into chemical
dependency, etc.<p>

It may be that in years to come, the loss from abortion will be
seen as psychodynamically similar to the loss of any loved one.
Research to date points toward the need to (a) admit that she was
a party to the killing of her own child, (b) grieve over the
loss, (c) seek and accept God's forgiveness, and (d) forgive
herself.<p>

In the studies to date, 80% of the PAS patients had been
unchurched and most knew little of fetal development at the time
of the abortion. It is perhaps significant that healing was
possible partly through some form of spiritual experience of
forgiveness.

<dt>Why haven't studies shown this sooner?

<dd>Perhaps enough time had to pass first, before these surfaced in
large enough numbers to attract researchers' attention.<p>

Almost certainly, the vast majority of studies which claim that
abortion has few psychological sequelae to date are inadequate
and have reached invalid conclusions. The landmark paper by James
Rogers, who carefully examined over 400 published studies, points
to the almost universal use of "poor methodology and research
design" and "grossly substandard power characteristics." He
concludes that "the question of psychological sequelae of
abortion is not closed."
<br>
<font size=-2>J. Rogers et al., "Validity of Existing
Controlled Studies Examining the
Psychological Sequelae of Abortion,"
<i>Perspectives on Science and Christian
Faith,</i> vol. 39, no. 1, Mar. 1987, p. 20-29.</font>

<dt>But U.S. Surgeon General Koop said that PAS was not proven.

<dd>True, but at the same time he stated that there was no proof that
abortion was safe either. He wanted long-term, prospective,
well-controlled, double-blind studies, and none have been done.
He said that all current studies were flawed.<p>

Probably the best description of PAS was the analysis by Rue,
Franz, et al., which agreed with the need for better studies and
laid out details of diagnosis of PAS and its treatment.<p>

This "white paper" was incorporated as part of the record of
hearings on March 16, 1989 by the Human Resources and
Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee of the U.S. House of
Representatives. The title of the "white paper" was "the
Psychological Aftermath of Abortion" and is available from the
Subcommittee or from the National Right to Life Committee.<p>

The bruised, upset, crying woman, just victimized by a rapist, goes
to the emergency room of the nearby hospital. She is cared for and
treated and does not become pregnant.<p>

Another woman, ashamed or too frightened, goes home and cries in
her pillow. She does seek treatment. On rare occasions she does
become pregnant. Much more frequently, she gets V.D.<p>

The V.D. can be treated, but the pregnancy? Should this innocent
woman be forced to carry the rapist's child? What if it were your
daughter? Shouldn't we allow abortion at least for this reason?<p>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Is pregnancy from rape common?

<dd>No. It is very rare.

<dt>Why?

<dd>There are a number of reasons:<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li> The woman may be on the pill.

<li> It may be during the non-fertile days of her cycle.

<li> She or he may be sterile, naturally or through disease or
surgery.

<li> She may be too young or too old to conceive.

<li> There can be disruption of the ovulation cycle due to the
extreme emotional trauma.<br>
<font size=-2>A. Helligers, U.S.C.C. Ab.
Conference, Washington, DC, Oct. 1967</font>

<li> One study shows there is 58% "sexual dysfunction" (no
penetration or retarded or premature ejaculation).<br>
<font size=-2><i>Sexual Medicine Today,</i> Jan. 1978, p. 16</font>

<li> Another study shows that there is often no sperm deposited in
the vagina.<br>
<font size=-2>Groth & Burgess, <i>New England Jour.
Med.,</i> vol. 297, 1977, pp. 764-766</font>
</ul>

<dt>Can you prove that pregnancy is rare?

<dd>A study of 1,000 rape victims, who were treated medically right
after the rape, reported no pregnancies.<br>
<font size=-2>L. Kuchera, "Postcoital
Contraception with Diethylstilbestrol,"
<i>JAMA,</i> October 25, 1971</font><p>

In another study, medical treatment on more than 1,000 women, was
"100% effective," according to Dr. B. Craver at the Wilson
Foundation.<br>
<font size=-2>B. Craver, "Morning After Pill
Prevents Pregnancy in Victims of
Rape," <i>Family Practice News,</i> Mar. 1972</font>

<dt>What if the rape victim is not treated?

<dd>If it is limited to true assault rape, the pregnancy rate will
still be extremely small. If all "reported" rapes, including
statutory rape (under 18-years-old, but sometimes with consent
given), when drunk (with questionable consent), etc., it is
higher.<p>

There are two such large, across-the-board studies of all
reported rapes (with no reported attempt to validate them), in
Washington, DC for the years 1965-69 and 1969-70. These reported
on rape victims seen by private doctors, clinics, and hospitals,
with no details as to treatment, if any. Of the 2,190 women in
the first study and the 1,223 women in the second, a total of 23
and of 21 pregnancies occurred, or rates of 6 and 17 per 1,000.
If these had been limited to true assaults and the women had been
given hormone treatment, the pregnancy rate would have been much
lower, perhaps zero.<br>

Dr. Alfred Kinsey reported that of 2,094 single females who had
voluntary intercourse 460,000 times, the pregnancy rate was 1 per
1,000 exposures. Many of these women had used contraception, many
had not, but it is also true that some assaulted women have
I.U.D.s or/and are on the pill.<br>

<dt>And in other countries?

<dd>In Czechoslovakia, out of 86,000 consecutive induced abortions,
only 22 were done for rape.<p>

In England, in 1938, Dr. Aleck Bourne had a 14-year-old girl
brought to him who had been raped. She became pregnant. He did
the abortion, and then gave himself up to the police. He was
tried and finally acquitted on the grounds that he had performed
the operation in order to save the girl's sanity. It was on the
findings of this trial that British law was based until all
abortion was legalized in that country in 1967. For many years it
was very conservatively interpreted to provide protection for
doctors to use their medical judgment in the "hard cases."
Ultimately, however, it opened the door to abortion-on-demand.<p>

It is significant to point out that the same Aleck Bourne,
"appalled" by the way in which the results of his case ultimately
opened to door to abortion-on-demand and all of its abuses,
became a founding member of the Society for the Protection of
Unborn Children in 1967.

<dt>How many assault rape pregnancies are there?

<dd>In 1987, in the U.S., there were 90,000 rapes reported. There are
about 100,000,000 females old enough to be at risk. This means
that approximately one women in 1,000 is raped each year.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Statistical Abstract of the U.S.,</i>
1989, Bureau of the Census, Table
No. 283, Forcible Rape, p. 169</font><p>

If we use that figure of one rape per 1,000 women per year and
calculate on the basis of one pregnancy for every 500 rapes, we
find 200 pregnancies. If we use the more reasonable one pregnancy
per 1,000, we find only 100 pregnancies per year in the entire
United States, or only one pregnancy per year in a state of two
million people.<p>

If we assume that only half of all assault rapes are reported and
that there are 200,000 rapes per year, and then calculate a
pregnancy rate of one per 500 and one per 1,000, we get 400 and
200 pregnancies per year.<p>

If we use the figure of one rape per 1,500 women per year, we
have 60,000 victims and 120 or 60 pregnancies. This would agree
with one reliable report listing a total figure of 63,020 rapes
per year.<br>
<font size=-2>F.B.I., <i>U.S. Dept. of Justice Uniform
Crime Reports,</i> 1977, pp. 15-18</font><p>

Again, using the one rape per 1,000 per year, and the totally
unrealistic pregnancy rate of one pregnancy per 100 assaults,
there would still be only 1,000 pregnancies per year in the
entire U.S. resulting from rape.<p>

Since only half of those who become pregnant will want abortions,
the final figure could be somewhere between 30 and 500 rape
pregnancy abortions per year, with a more likely figure between
50 and 100.<p>

In Canada the number of reported forcible rapes were 2,987 in
1977, 2,987 in 1981, and 3,600 in 1984.<br>
<font size=-2>Statistics Canada</font>

<dt>That isn't many!

<dd>No! Using a figure of 1,600,000 abortions per year in the U.S.,
that means there will be about 25,000 elective abortions done in
the U.S. for other reasons for every one abortion performed
because of rape.

<dt>What of legal proof for rape?

<dd>If the woman goes directly to the hospital, her word is accepted.
But, sadly, through fright or ignorance, she may not report it
and quietly nurse her fears. She misses her period and hopes
against hope that it isn't what she thinks it is. Another month,
another month, and finally, in tears, she reports to her mother,
her physician, or some other counselor or confidante. To prove
rape then is impossible. The only proof of rape then is to have
a reliable witness corroborate the story, and such a witness
almost never exists.

<dt>What of a law that would allow abortion only for assault rape or
incest?

<dd>Such a law would affect only a few women. If she does go
immediately to the hospital and is treated, the rape victim
almost certainly will not get pregnant. If she doesn't go and
does become pregnant, she cannot prove it was due to rape.<p>

Responsible lawmakers have always agreed that "hard cases make
bad laws." This means that laws must speak to the general norm.
Judges have always allowed certain exceptions to laws or to
punishment out of mercy for a "hard" or tragic case. The Bourne
Case was a good example, until some judges and countries (like
Jamaica) stretched its meaning to allow abortion-on-demand.<p>

The plea to legalize abortion here and abroad leaned heavily on
the tragedy of hard cases such as rape. Once abortion became
legal, it was quickly apparent that 99% of abortions were done
for social and economic reasons and less than 1% were performed
for rape and incest, for physical health problems, and for severe
fetal handicap.

<dt>But, even if rare, some girls are forcibly raped and some do get
pregnant. Should they be forced to carry an unwanted child?

<dd>Unquestionably, many would return the violence of killing an
innocent baby for the violence of rape. But, before making this
decision, remember that most of the trauma has already occurred.
She has been raped. That trauma will live with her all her life.
Furthermore, this girl did not report for help, but kept this to
herself. For several weeks or months, she has thought of little
else. Now, she has finally asked for help, has shared her upset,
and should be in a supportive situation.<p>

The utilitarian question from the mother's standpoint is whether
or not it would now be better to kill the developing baby within
her. But will abortion now be best for her, or will it bring her
more harm yet? What has happened and its damage has already
occurred. She's old enough to know and have an opinion as to
whether she carries a "baby" or a "blob of protoplasm."<p>

Will she be able to live comfortably with the memory that she
"killed her developing baby"? Or would she ultimately be more
mature and more at peace with herself if she could remember that,
even though she became pregnant unwillingly, she nevertheless
solved her problem by being unselfish, by giving of herself and
of her love to an innocent baby, who had not asked to be created,
to deliver, perhaps to place for adoption, if she decides that is
what is best for her baby.<p>

Compare this memory with the woman who can only look back and
say, "I killed my baby."

<dt>But carry the rapist's child?

<dd>True, it is half his. But remember, half of the baby is also
hers, and there are other outstretched arms that will adopt and
love that baby.

<dt>I don't see how she could!

<dd>"Interestingly, the pregnant rape victim's chief complaint is
not that she is unwillingly pregnant, as bad as the experience
is. The critical moment is fleeting in this area. It
frequently pulls families together like never before. When
women are impregnated through rape, their condition is treated
in accordance, as are their families.<p>

"We found this experience is forgotten, replaced by remembering
the abortion, because it is what they did."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Uchtman, Director, Suiciders
Anonymous, Report to Cincinnati
City Council, Sept. 1, 1981</font><p>

"In the majority of these cases, the pregnant victim's problems
stem more from the trauma of rape than from the pregnancy
itself."<br>
<font size=-2>Mahkorn & Dolan, "Sexual Assault &
Pregnancy." In <i>New Perspectives on
Human Abortion,</i> University Publishers
of Amer., 1981, pp. 182-199</font><p>

As to what factors make it most difficult to continue her
pregnancy, the opinions, attitudes, and beliefs of others were
most frequently cited; in other words, how her loved ones treated
her.<br>
<font size=-2>Mahkorn, "Pregnancy & Sexual Assault."
In <i>Psychological Aspects of Abortion,</i>
University Publishers of Amer., 1979, pp. 53-72</font>

<dt>But wouldn't it be safer physically to abort a young girl than to
let her deliver?

<dd>Quite the contrary! Teenage abortions have more complications
than those done on older women. Teenage deliveries are as safe
as, and perhaps safer, than deliveries done on older women. For
detailed studies, see chapters 15 & 17.

<dt>The "treatment" for rape, isn't it abortive?

<dd>This is best illustrated by giving two theoretical case
histories. Woman "A" is raped at midnight on Saturday and is
treated in a hospital emergency room with a female hormone
medication at 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning. In this case, the woman's
body was scheduled to ovulate two days later, on Monday. If that
were to have occurred, and if the assailant's sperm were still
alive in her body, she might have been fertilized two days after
the assault and might have become pregnant at that time. There is
a substantial body of medical opinion that believes that the dose
of medication given would prevent that ovulation, and she would
therefore not get pregnant. This mechanism of action would be one
of temporary sterilization, or, in more commonly used (however
technically inaccurate) terms, the action would be contraceptive.<p>

Woman "B" presents a different case. She had ovulated at 9:00
p.m. on Saturday, was raped at midnight, and also received
treatment at 3:00 a.m. To her own observation, this lady also
does not "get pregnant." In fact, something entirely different
happened inside her body. Let us assume that she was one of those
very rare cases where fertilization did occur, and had, in fact,
occurred prior to the giving of the medication. The life of a
tiny new little boy or girl had begun. The cells of this tiny
body begin to divide and divide again, but at one week of life,
when implantation within the nutrient lining of the mother's womb
should occur, this tiny new human being could not implant and
died. The mechanism of action of the drug, in this case, had been
to "harden" the lining of the womb in order to prevent
implantation. This effect was one of a micro-abortion, at one
week of life.

<dt>Would a Human Life Amendment in America, or a law forbidding
abortion in another nation, prevent such treatment?

<dd>Most legal opinion is quite positive about the fact that since
these drugs have a multiplicity of other beneficial and
therapeutic effects, they would never be removed from the market.
Since they would in some (most?) cases, have a legally
permissible effect (temporary sterilization), even with a strong
Human Life Amendment in place, the use of such drugs after rape
could not be forbidden. Therefore, the choice now available to a
woman after an assault rape, to use or not use such treatment,
would still be available after such a law.

<dt>But in a rape pregnancy, everyone loses!

<dd>In her beautiful autobiography, His Eye Is on the Sparrow, Ethel
Waters reveals that she was conceived following the rape of her
13-year-old mother, at a time when rape treatment was
unavailable. Her mother's love and Ethel Water's value to society
were not diminished by the circumstances surrounding her
conception.<p>

In our own experience, once, after answering questions on rape on
a radio show, one of your authors was called to the phone after
the program. A woman's voice said,<p>

"You were talking about me. You see, I am the product of rape.
An intruder forced his way into my parents' house, tied up my
father and, with him watching, raped my mother. I was
conceived that night. Everyone advised an abortion. The local
doctors and hospital were willing. My father, however, said,
'Even though not mine, that is a child and I will not allow it
to be killed!' I don't know how many times that, as I lay
secure in the loving arms of my husband, I have thanked God
for my wonderful Christian father."

<dt>What of incest?

<dd>Incest is intercourse by a father with his daughter, uncle with
niece, etc. It usually involves a sick man, often a sick mother
who frequently knows it's happening even if not consciously
admitting it, and an exploited child. Fortunately, pregnancy is
not very common. When incest does occur, however, it is seldom
reported and, when reported, is hard to prove.

<dt>Pregnancy is not common?

<dd>Correct. "Considering the prevalence of teenage pregnancies in
general, incest treatment programs marvel at the low incidence of
pregnancy from incest." Several reports agree at 1% or less.<br>
<font size=-2>G. Maloof, "The Consequences
of Incest," <i>The Psychological
Aspects of Abortion,</i> University
Publications of Amer., 1979, p. 74</font><p>

When pregnancy does occur, it is often an attempt to end the
relationship. In a twisted sort of way, however, the father is a
love object. In one study, only 3 of 13 child-mothers had any
negative feelings toward him.<br>
<font size=-2>H. Maisch, <i>Incest,</i> New York:
Stein & Day Publishers, 1972</font>

<dt>How does the incest victim feel about being pregnant?

<dd>For her, it is a way to stop the incest; a way to unite mother
and daughter; a way to get out of the house. Most incestuous
pregnancies, if not pressured, will not get abortions.<p>

"As socially inappropriate as incest and incestuous pregnancies
are, their harmful effects depend largely upon reaction of
others."<br>
<font size=-2>ibid, Maloof, p. 100</font>

<dt>The answer?

<dd>Even strongly pro-abortion people, if they approach an incest
case professionally, must be absolutely convinced before advising
abortion, for it not only is an assault on the young mother, who
may well be pregnant with a "love object," but it may completely
fail to solve the original problem.<p>

It is also unusual for wisdom to dictate anything but adoptive
placement of the baby.<p>

<dt>Dying? When there is overpopulation?

<dd>There isn't overpopulation at all. The problem is too low a birth
rate and an aging population.<p>

</dl>

</pre>

<dl>
<dt>In which countries?

<dd>Almost all of Western Europe, Canada, and the United States,
Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

<dt>But the population of the U.S. is still growing.

<dd>That is correct. The total number of people living in the U.S.
(and Canada) is still increasing. The 1990 figure is about 250
million. The rate of growth is slowing markedly, however, as is
evident from the above graph.<p>

But this continued growth is not due to an adequate birth rate,
for the birth rate is much too low. It is due to two other
reasons:
<ul type=disc>
<li> Immigration; this accounts for almost half of the growth.<br>
<font size=-2>Assoc. Press, "Population Rises"
<i>Wash. Times,</i> Aug. 20, 1986</font>

<li> The longer life span of the elderly. Many, who in years past
would have already died, are still alive. The average life
expectancy has been dramatically lengthened. It is now 74.9
years.
</ul>

<h2 align=center>POPULATION BY AGE -- 1980</h2>

<pre>

25-44 Years   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   (62.1)

Over 65       XXXXXXXXXXXX                      (24.5)
</pre>


<dt>So there is an unusually low death rate?

<dd>Yes. The current death rate in the U.S. is about nine deaths per
thousand per year. This cannot continue this low, however. To
understand this, let's look at the above chart.<p>

Note that there were about four times as many people in the two
younger 20-year age groups as there were in the older one.
<ul type=disc>
<li> Not many people die in the 25-45 age group.

<li> Some people die in the 45-65 age group.

<li> Everyone dies in the 65-and-older group.
</ul>
Today, there are 9/1,000/year persons dying (almost all in the
65-and-older group). Tomorrow, there will be twice as many people
in the "dying" age group. Therefore, there will be twice as many
people dying.
<ul type=disc>
<li> Today, we are burying 9/1,000/ year.

<li> Tomorrow, we will be burying 15-20/1,000/year.
</ul>
<dt>What about the birth rate?

<dd>Ah, there's the rub! The only factor that ultimately determines
population growth or decline is the birth rate. In order for a
population to just replace itself -- to have ZPG (zero population
growth) -- the average woman, in her reproductive years, must
have 2.1 children. If the average is higher, the nation grows. If
the average is lower, the nation ages and slowly dies.<p>

The U.S. has been at, or below, 1.8 since 1972. Only three of the
50 states have rates over 2.3: Wyoming, 2.4; Idaho, 2.5; and
Utah, 3.2; whereas Rhode Island, North Carolina, and Massachusett
have the lowest birth rate at 1.5, as does the Canadian Province
of Quebec.<br>
<font size=-2>"Drop in Fertility Rate," Oct. 10, 1984,
p. 5A also <i>Time,</i> Oct. 5, 1987, p. 38</font><p>

The U.S. had been below 1.8 since 1972. Suddenly in 1988 and 1989
there was a jump to 1.9 and 2.0 apparently due to childless
career women wanting to beat their biologic clocks. Is this a
temporary jump?<p>

<p align=center>
<b>POPULATION REPLACEMENT<br>
Total Fertility Rate Needed 2.1 Babies/Woman<br>
Actual Has Been 1.8 Babies/Woman<br>
We Are An Aging, Dying Nation</b><p>

<dt>What will this lead to?

<dd>Today, more persons are born than are dying in the U.S.<p>

Tomorrow, the U.S. will be burying more people than are born.<p>

The clear and inevitable result will be a nation with more and
more elderly and fewer and fewer young people. Then, given time
alone, the population will crest and begin to drop. For example,
comparing 1980 with 1970, there were 6,500,000 fewer school-age
children and 9,000 public elementary schools had to close.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Newsweek,</i> Mar. 30, 1981</font><p>

One projection is that deaths will exceed births by 2014.<br>
<font size=-2><i>TIME,</i> Feb. 23, 1987, p. 29</font>

<dt>What can prevent this?

<dd>It could be prevented by continuing heavy immigration. Both the
U.S. and Canada are host to large numbers of immigrants. At the
current birth and immigration rates, the indigenous Anglo race
(white, European ancestry) in the U.S. will be a minority by the
middle of the next century. If immigration is heavy enough and
the new immigrants have enough babies, the population could even
grow, but the ethnic composition will be far different from
today.<p>

The second possibility would require a dramatic increase in the
birth rate in the near future within our present population.
There is no sign of this happening. Furthermore, the increase
would have to happen soon if it is to replenish the indigenous
population. If too many years pass before another "baby boom,"
even if all women had twice as many babies as they are having
today, they would not be able to "catch up," for there would be
too few women of childbearing age.

<dt>What is the current situation in other Western and Developed
Nations?

<dd>Other Western nations are slightly above or below this. West
Germany and Italy at 1.35 each are the most rapidly dying nations
in the world. In Canada the rate is 1.8. In all of Western
Europe, only one country is well above replacement level --
Ireland, while Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore are
at about 1.8.<p>

"The European Parliament is seriously disturbed by statistics
showing a rapid decline in the birth rate in the European
Economic Community, which fell from 2.79 in 1964 to 1.68 in
1982."<br>
<font size=-2><i>European Parliament News,</i>
no. 53, April/May 1984</font><p>

In 1900 the West had 30% of the world's population, in 1950 it
was 22%. Today it is 15%. By 2030 it will be 9% and by 2100 about
4-5%.<br>
<font size=-2>B. Wattenberg, <i>The Birth
Dearth,</i> Pharos Books 1987</font><p>

As mentioned, Germany is dying faster than any other nation, with
only 1.2 children per family. With 57 million people, it has
about 500,000 abortions per year. If the birth trend continues,
Germany's "population is expected to fall to 38 million in 50
years."<br>
<font size=-2>W. Drozdiak, "West German Birthrate
Dropping," <i>Washington Post,</i> Jan. 10, 1984</font>

<dt>And the Third World?

<dd>Most of it still has a growing population, but the rate of growth
has progressively declined from 6.1 babies/woman in 1970 to 4.1
in 1985, and it is still dropping steadily.<br>
<font size=-2><i>U.S. News &amp; World Report,</i>
June 22, 1987, p. 57</font><p>

The U.S. policy paper presented to the 1984 United Nations
Population Conference in Mexico City was very clear. It noted
that economic growth and a rising standard of living is
associated with a falling birth rate. It also stated that the
U.S. AID program will not fund family planning programs if they
include abortion.<p>

The UN Population Conference adopted a recommendation, without
dissent, that abortion "in no way should be promoted" as a family
planning method.<p>

Even John D. Rockefeller, Jr., the most zealous population
control advocate of all, finally admitted, after the 1974 UN
Population Conference in Bucharest, that the outside imposition
of any type of family planning (abortion, sterilization,
contraception) on an underdeveloped nation or subgroup within a
nation has never been effective. People just won't cooperate. The
only measures that have worked have been to raise that group's
standard of living, to reduce infant and childhood mortality, and
to raise expectation of (and provide opportunity for) education.
If these changes are accomplished, people will then voluntarily
limit the number of their children for two reasons: (a) they want
more for each child, and (b) they can reasonably expect their
children to survive to adulthood and be alive to care for them in
their old age.<p>

Each country is its own case. Just because there is over-
population in one country doesn't mean that a more developed one
should commit national suicide.

<dt>What's Russia's birth rate?

<dd>Russia is a special case. Along with all of the Eastern European
Iron-Curtain countries, White Russia (the western part) has a
birth rate below replacement level. Eastern Russia and its large
Moslem areas have high birth rates. The West speaks Russian and
is better educated. East and Southeast Russians do not speak
Russian and are less well-educated. White Russians will soon
comprise less than 50% of the population, and Russia has no
immigration to speak of. It seems many people want out, but few
want in.

<dt>But doesn't the U.S. use up a high percentage of the world's
natural resources?

<dd>It is a fact that there are more such resources available today
than there were a decade or two ago. In America one farmer feeds
99 other people. In some countries, one farmer cannot even feed
his own family. What is our solution? Should we encourage
American farmers and industrial workers to kill their own preborn
children or should we stay strong, have children, and help to
teach those other farmers and workers to be more productive?

<dt>Isn't the U.S. having a mini baby boom now?

<dd>In 1957, the average woman, during her reproductive years, had
3.7 children. There were 4,300,000 children born that year. (Keep
in mind that replacement level is 2.1 children per woman.)
Through the 1970s this rate dropped to only 1.8 children born per
woman. But, with many more women of childbearing age (as a result
of previous higher replacement rates), the total births were
about 3,500,000 babies per year. The baby boom women born in the
1950s-60s are now in their prime childbearing years. If they had
maintained the fertility rate of their mothers, the U.S. would be
having over 7,000,000 births per year. Just to maintain a ZPG
replacement rate, the U.S. would need 4,200,000 births per year.
In reality, births are still under 4,000,000 from the low of
3,200,000 in 1975.

<dt>What are the effects of an aging population?

<dd>The effects are far reaching. Fewer children become fewer
adolescents and fewer young people, and fewer taxpaying workers.
By 2025 the world (not just the U.S.) will have twice as many
grandparents as babies.<br>
<font size=-2>U.N. Conference, <i>Vienna
Washington Times,</i> July 24, 1982</font><p>

To understand this better, one must look ahead 30 years, using
today's number of born people and adding new births at the
present rate. This yields a dramatically different age than that
from the 1980 chart earlier in this chapter. Where, in 1980,
there were over four people in the wage earning age, in 2020
there will be only a little over two for each person over 65
years.<p>

Many in the working age are not wage earners (e.g., housewives).
Therefore, let us translate the above into U.S. wage earners
paying taxes and retired people drawing benefits from those
taxes.<p>

The Western world, in the past half-century, has supported its
senior and disabled citizens with tax funds on a scale previously
unknown. But, unless there are enough taxpaying younger workers,
there will be no way that such retirement and medical benefits
can continue.<p>

<tr align=right><td>2040 <td>1                <td>1.5
</table>

<dt>Only one and one-half taxpayers to support every retired person?
That's an impossible situation! What will happen?

<dd>Euthanasia!<p>

Yes, that will be the answer. Today's "Every Child a Wanted
Child" will become tomorrow's "Every Grandparent a Wanted
Grandparent."<p>

The above figures are from the U.S.A. If we were to examine other
developed nations we would find that, with some variations, all
reveal a similar pattern.<p>

In almost every undeveloped nation a similar aging process is
occurring, the difference being that all have started from a much
higher birth rate and even though a drop is occurring, their
total fertility rate is still well above replacement level.

<dt>How does abortion affect this?

<i>The coat hanger and the back alley abortions were moving
arguments which originally convinced many to work for legalized
abortion.</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>If abortion was again forbidden, wouldn't we have a return to these
back alley abortions, resulting in thousands of women dying?

<dd>Before we answer that, we must first ask, "How many women used to
die from illegal abortions?"

<dt>Why?

<dd>Because anyone who gives you a figure on the total number of
illegal abortions is guessing. There are no records. By
definition, illegal abortions are not recorded. The only way to
estimate the number of illegal abortions is to first determine
how many women died from abortions. Their deaths were reported.
Then we must guess what percent of such abortions ended in a
maternal death and work backwards to the total number of
abortions there were.

<dt>How many women did die?

<dd>Mortality figures from the U.S. Bureau of Vital Statistics were
gathered and presented during the U.S. Senate debate on the
Hatch-Eagleton Amendment in June 1983 (see chapter 6). The chart
used in that debate included all reported deaths from illegal and
legal abortions.
</dl>

<table border>
<caption><h2 align=center>MOTHERS DIE FROM ABORTION</h2></caption>

<tr><td>1960 - All States Illegal<td>289 per year
<tr><td>1966 - All States Illegal<td>120 per year
<tr><td>1972 - 16 States Legal<td>39 per year
<tr><td>1980 - All States Legal<td>10-20 per year
</table><p>

<dl>
<dd>One must go back to the pre-Penicillin era to find a year during
which more than 1,000 women died from abortions in the U.S. There
was a precipitous drop in deaths in the late 1940s which was
clearly due to improved medical care.<p>

In 1966, the year before the first state legalized abortion, only
120 women died from abortions. In 1972, the year before the
Supreme Court legalized abortion in all states, only 39 women
died.<br>
<font size=-2>U.S. Dept. HHS, Center for Disease
Control, <i>Abortion Surveillance,</i> Nov. 1980</font>

<dt>Once abortion was legal, then fewer women died?

<dd>The legality of abortion had no effect on reported deaths. The
slowly decreasing line on the chart didn't even waver. It
continued on its previous downward course. The figure for 1977
was 21 deaths (17 legal, 4 illegal); for 1981, it was 9 deaths (8
legal, 1 illegal).

<dt>But I've heard time and again that between 5,000 and 10,000 women
died annually from illegal abortions.

<dd>Yes, those were the figures publicized. The only comment about
them is the statement from Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a co-founder of
the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL)
-- a man who once ran the largest abortion facility in the
Western world and is now pro-life. He stated:<p>

"How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was
illegal? In NARAL, we generally emphasized the frame of the
individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of
the latter it was always '5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.' I
confess that I knew the figures were totally false, [italics
added] and I suppose the others did too if they stopped to
think of it. But in the 'morality' of our revolution, it was
a useful [Nathanson's italics] figure, widely accepted, so why
go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics? The
overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and
anything within reason that had to be done was permissible."<br>
<font size=-2>B. Nathanson, <i>Aborting America,</i>
Doubleday, 1979, p. 193</font>

<dt>So there obviously weren't nearly as many illegal abortions as many
claim?

<dd>That's right. The often-quoted figure of one million a year in
the U.S. is obviously ridiculous.

<dt>Then, actually how many illegal abortions were there?

<dd>One study quoted in the U.S. Senate debate was authored by Dr. T.
Hilgers from Creighton University, who estimated the figure
probably was at or somewhere near 100,000 abortions annually in
the U.S. prior to legalization.

<dt>Are there any other studies?

<dd>There have not been many in recent years. Most were done
comparing the time before and right after legalization in other
countries. In the earlier editions of <i>Handbook on Abortion,</i> we
listed studies done in England (<i>Brit. Med. Jour.,</i> May 1970, 1972,
and <i>Lancet,</i> Mar. 1968); Japan (<i>Asahi Jour.,</i> Oct. 16, 1966);
Hungary (<i>Internat'l Jour. of OB/GYN,</i> May 1971); and the U.S.
(<i>Amer. Jour. of Public Health,</i> No. 1967). All these studies
showed that illegal abortions had not decreased significantly
after legalization.<br>
<font size=-2>B. Willke &amp; J. Willke, "Reduce
Illegal Abortions." <i>Handbook
on Abortion,</i> Hayes Publishing,
Cinn., 1979, p. 10</font>

<dt>So what are we to think?

<dd>It is clear that there always were and always will be some
illegal abortions, but either the actual numbers were only a
small fraction of what the pro-abortionists have claimed, or the
illegal abortionists of years past were remarkably skillful.<p>

In fact, it is clear that legal abortions have skyrocketed and
today are 10 to 20 times more numerous than illegal ones were.

<dt>But, if we do forbid abortions again, won't some women die?

<dd>Today, legal abortion deaths of mothers have replaced the illegal
ones. If abortion were forbidden, we would see a 90% reduction in
abortions performed and probably a similar reduction in abortion
deaths.<p>

Further, we'll never return to the back alley abortions.

<dt>Never return to the back alley? Who says?

<dd>Dr. Nathanson, the man who helped start it all and then became
convinced that he "had in fact presided over 60,000 deaths."<br>
<font size=-2>B. Nathanson, "Deeper Into Abortion,"
<i>New England Jour. Med.,</i>
Nov. 28, 1974, pp. 1189-1190</font><p>

Dr. Nathanson further stated,<p>

"One can expect that if abortion is ever driven underground
again, even non-physicians will be able to perform this
procedure with remarkable safety. No woman need die if she
chooses to abort during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy."<br>
<font size=-2>B. Nathanson, <i>Aborting America,</i>
Doubleday, 1979, p. 193</font><p>

Prior to legalization, Dr. Kinsey's study showed "of the illegal
operative abortions, less than 1% were self-induced. Almost all
of the remaining were performed by a physician." Dr. Mary
Calderone, former president of Planned Parenthood, stated in 1960
that "90% of all illegal abortions are presently done by
physicians."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Calderone, "Illegal Abortion as a
Public Health Problem," <i>Amer. Jour.
of Health,</i> vol. 50, July 1960, p. 949</font><p>

Dr. Garrett Hardin, in Abortion and Human Dignity, 1967, p. 72
quotes "Dr. Guttmacher estimates 80% by doctors."

<dt>Then there is a difference between illegal abortions and back alley
abortions?

<dd>Yes! Doctors who did illegal abortions would let a woman in the
back door, take her money, and do the abortion. Today, the same
abortionist lets her in the front door, takes her money, and does
the abortion in the same way. Abortions from untrained "butchers"
are increasingly rare and would be in the future.

<dt>No coat hanger abortions?

<dd>Your authors have lectured worldwide and in all 50 of the United
States on this subject for two decades. During this entire time
we have never heard or read about a single documented case of an
abortion induced by a coat hanger. We must conclude that the
entire concept of coat hanger abortions is a total fabrication by
pro-abortion people.<p>

It simply never happened.

<dt>I've heard of large numbers of women dying from illegal abortions
in other countries.

<dd>In Portugal the claimed figure was 2,000 deaths. The actual
number of deaths in the nation of females between the ages of
15-46 was 2,106 in the same year from all natural causes,
accidents and illness. There were only 97 listed in the
"complications of pregnancy" of which 12 were due to abortion,
including spontaneous and induced, legal and illegal.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Portuguese Anuario Estatistico,</i>
Tables 11, 16, 111</font><p>

In Italy, the claimed figure before their abortion referendum was
20,000. In the age group 15-45, there were actually only 11,500
female deaths from all causes.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Primum Non Nocere,</i> vol. IV, no. 1, 1983</font><p>

In Germany the claim was that 15,000 women died annually. In
fact, only 13,000 women of reproductive age die annually in West
Germany, and less than 100 die of complications of abortion,
legal and illegal.<br>
<font size=-2>Kurchoff, <i>Deutches Arzteblatt,</i>
vol. 69, no. 27, Oct. 26, 1972</font>

<dt>Isn't it cheaper to abort poor women than raise their children on
welfare?

<dd>Dr. Louis Hellman, from the U.S. Department of HEW, said: "An
abortion costs only about $350 at most, while prenatal care
through the first year of a baby's life costs $2,200. It is
estimated to cost $35,000 to raise a child to 18 years." In
response, the strongly pro-abortion <i>Washington Post</i> said, "This
is a terrible argument. Its implications are monstrous."<br>
<font size=-2><i>Washington Post,</i> June 2, 1977</font><p>

But think of the additional welfare costs for all these babies
born to teenagers.<p>

Planned Parenthood's own figures are that there will be welfare
costs of $13,900 for each first birth to a teenager (married and
unmarried), and $8,400 for each first birth to her if she is 20
years or older. Compare this with the average of nearly $50,000
each will ultimately pay in taxes as an adult.
<br>
<font size=-2>M. Burt, "Public Cost of Teen
Childbearing," <i>Family Planning
Perspective,</i> vol. 18, no. 5, Sept. 1986</font><p>

The average time a family stays on welfare in the U.S. is 27
months, not 18 years. When we peel away the outer layer of the
rhetoric, what we expose is a callous cost-benefit analysis of
solving poverty by killing the unborn children of the poor.<p>

This continues to happen. In 1982, Michigan for instance, only
14.7% of pregnancies of non-welfare mothers were aborted. This
clearly suggests coercion when we realize that the minority
classes who make up a large share of the welfare people are more
against abortion than are the white middle and upper classes.<br>
<font size=-2>ibid.</font>

<dt>What if public funding of abortions is cut off?

<dd>There has been an excellent example. In 1977, the federal
government of the U.S. paid for 295,000 welfare abortions. In
1978, it only paid for 2,000 abortions because the Hyde Amendment
had cut off the funding.<p>

The U.S. government's chief pro-abortion biostatistician, Dr.
Willard Cates, predicted "a total of 77 excess deaths to women"
who would turn to illegal abortions, plus five additional deaths
due to delay of abortions into the later weeks of pregnancy.<br>
<font size=-2>Petitti &amp; Cates, "Restricting Medicaid
Funds: Projection of Excess Mortality,"
<i>Amer. Jour. Public Health,</i> vol. 67,
no. 9, Sept. 1977, pp. 860-862</font><p>

In fact, his projection proved to be completely unfounded. A
later article by the same department, which later surveyed 13
states and the District of Columbia, revealed, "No increase in
abortion related complications was observed. . . . No abortion
deaths related to either legal or illegal abortions were
detected, [and there was] no difference between institutions in
funded and non-funded states."<br>
<font size=-2><i>Morbitity and Mortality Weekly
Report,</i> CDC, U.S. Dept. HEW,
vol. 28, no. 4, Feb. 2, 1979</font><p>

A later attempt to link three deaths as "abortion funding
related" was shown not to be related to the funding cut off at
all. Total maternal abortion deaths were actually lower than
before the cutoff in 1976.<p>

Further, when welfare funds for elective abortion are cut off,
there is a reduction in the total number of abortions, but also
of live births. Apparently, conceptions decreased when the
welfare state eliminated free abortions as a birth control
measure.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Kasun, "Cut Off Of Abortion Funds
Doesn't Deliver Welfare Babies,"
<i>Wall Street Journal,</i> Dec. 30, 1986</font>

<dt>Making abortion illegal will not stop abortions, so why not keep
them legal?

<dd>Did you know that more than one million cars were stolen in the
U.S. last year? Surely, this can't be stopped. Therefore, why not
make it legal to steal cars? How many banks were robbed? That is
a dangerous occupation. People get killed stealing cars and
robbing banks. We'll never be able to stop all car stealing and
bank robberies, true? Then, let's legalize car stealing and bank
robbing to save those lives.<p>

Since when is it possible to eliminate evil by legalizing it?

<dt>What do polls show on abortions paid for by tax money?

<dd>No poll with unbiased wording has ever shown a majority of
citizens favoring government funding of abortions. In 1984, the
strongly pro-abortion University of North Carolina polled its
state to find that only 32% favored tax funding. An important
finding was that 43% of the college-educated favored such
government "assistance," while only 17% of those with less than
a high-school education concurred. Also, 36% of men favored
assistance, but only 28% of women.<p>

So, those who would receive the "benefit" of tax-funded abortions
wanted them the least. One might conclude that the elitist social
planners see this as a way of reducing poverty -- killing the
unborn children of the poor.<p>

<i>"The old law permitted abortion to save one life when two
would otherwise die. The new law permits abortion to take
one life when two would otherwise live."</i><br>
<font size=-2>Herbert Ratner, M.D.</font><p>

Abortion was known and practiced in the world of Greece and Rome
into which Christianity came. Judaism, having developed a high
respect for the family, for women, and for individual life, had
condemned abortion but found certain exceptions to it. The
Christian message brought a further dignity to the concept of the
individual person and the value of life. The idea of an individual,
animate, immortal soul given by God to every human person, and
hopefully, returning to him for eternity, was a powerful concept
which transformed the Roman Empire within two centuries. The value
of the unborn person became associated closely with a similar value
granted to the born person, and as Christian beliefs crystallized
in writing and tradition, condemnation of abortion came to be "an
almost absolute value," as Professor John T. Noonan of the
University of California at Berkley says in his book.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Noonan, <i>The Morality of Abortion,</i>
Harvard University Press, 1970, ch.1</font>

<dl>
<dt>What, specifically, was the Christian teaching?

<dd>The Gospel taught that Jesus was conceived in Mary's womb by the
Holy Spirit. What grew in her womb from conception was not a blob
of protoplasm, but the person of the God-man Jesus. Also clearly
taught was that the infant John (the Baptist) "leaped" in the
womb of Elizabeth. These specific references to the living
personhood of the human embryo were reinforced by the teachings
of the Fathers of the Church. The Didache said, "You shall not
slay the child by abortion." Clement of Alexandria condemned
abortion, as did Athenagoras: "Those who use abortifacients are
homicides." Tertullian said, "The mold in the womb may not be
destroyed." The Council of Ancyra in 314 denounced women who
"slay what is generated." Another Council in 305 at Alvira
excommunicated women committing abortion after adultery and would
not even readmit them to the Church at the point of death. While
Saints Jerome and Augustine questioned when the rational soul was
given by God, this did not affect their complete moral
condemnation of abortion. In the late fourth century, St. Basil
wrote, "The hairsplitting difference between formed and unformed
makes no difference to us. Whoever deliberately commits abortion
is subject to the penalty for homicide."<p>

The early Christians saw their attitudes about women, children,
and the structure of the family as distinctive and revolutionary.
The second century Epistle to Dionysius proclaims that Christians
"marry like everyone else, and they beget children, but they do
not cast out their offspring."<p>

By the time the curtain of the barbarian invasions rang down on
the glory of Rome, the Christian teaching had codified itself
into an extremely firm and certain moral opinion. Abortion was
condemned. There was no question about Christian belief.

<dt>Does the New Testament oppose abortion? How and where?

<dd>The most cogent look at this is through the clinical history of
"Mary's Pregnancy" and the Gospel's story.<br>
<font size=-2>"Mary's Pregnancy," Hayes Pub. Co.,
pamphlet, 1989, $12.00/100</font>

<dt>What was Thomas Aquinas' opinion 700 years later?

<dd>Thomas totally condemned abortion for any and all reasons.<p>

Aquinas did question when the soul was created. He spoke of the
then-current scientific conviction that a male child was not
fully enough developed to be judged human (and therefore to have
a soul) until forty days, and that the female fetus could not be
judged fully human until eighty days. This obviously says
something about scientific knowledge of that age. Aquinas was
reflecting a theological and scientific judgment that mirrored
the most accurate scientific information of his time. When, to
the most exact instrument available, the unaided human eye, the
unborn child looked like a child and the individual's sex could
be determined, he or she was deemed dignified and developed
enough to be the possessor of an immortal soul, and so Aquinas
made his conclusions.<p>

Since that time we have progressed to electron microscopes,
ultrasonic stethoscopes, and Realtime ultrasonic movies, and
increasingly sophisticated knowledge of chromosomes and genes. We
now must make judgments in the light of our new and more accurate
biological knowledge. Aquinas' conclusions were the best that
could be expected in his day. While not applicable today, they
are of historical significance. Had men of his time had today's
knowledge of embryonic and fetal development, their conclusions
would have been different.

<dt>They didn't think that there was life until the soul was created?

<dd>Correct, but they still totally forbad abortion, and the penances
for the sin of abortion were severe. For the first eleven hundred
years, the laws punished fetal destruction, whatever the stage of
formation or animation.<br>
<font size=-2>D. Granfield, <i>The Abortion Decision,</i>
Garden City, NY, Doubleday, 1969, p. 72</font>

<dt>The Church's teaching changed then!

<dd>The moral prohibition against killing after conception did not
change. After the 12th century, there was some legal acceptance
that a soul may not be present until the fetus was "formed."
However, Canon law still condemned induced abortion. The change
was only that the killing of a formed fetus was classified as
homicide.<br>
<font size=-2>ibid., p. 72</font><p>

In the penitentias of Canones Hibernensus (A.D. 675), the penance
for the sin of abortion was seven years of exclusion from the
sacraments as well as public penance on bread and water for the
destruction of "the embryo of a child in the mother's womb."<br>
<font size=-2>J. Connery, "Abortion, the Development
of the Roman Catholic Perspective." <i>Private
Penance,</i> Loyola Univ. Press, 1977, p. 68</font><p>

The Council of Ancyra imposed 10 years of penance.<p>

Anglo-Saxon penitentials proscribed more severe penances after
the soul was infused (presumably at 40 days), a practice followed
on the continent.<p>

The Council of Elvera made the exclusion from the sacraments
permanent (for life).<br>
<font size=-2>ibid., pp. 65, 72</font>

<dt>When did changes in the earlier absolute Christian position begin
to occur?

<dd>In the centuries before and after the Protestant Reformation,
Christian thinkers came to debate and, in some cases, to justify
the use of therapeutic abortion for the purpose of saving the
life of the mother. Later, other reasons were added, such as the
removal of an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy or of a cancerous
pregnant womb. Both of these killed the growing unborn child if
still alive, but were not direct assaults upon the child's life
for the primary purpose of destroying it. Rather, they had
another, more primary effect, that of saving the mother's life.
No major religious bodies came to endorse abortion for less
serious reasons until the middle of this century.

<dt>I've heard that the Catholic Church only forbad abortion after
1869.

<dd>In 1869 Pope Pius IX removed the formed-unformed fetus
distinction from Canon law. Instead of a less stringent
punishment for early abortions and a more stringent punishment
for later abortions, he again made the punishment for all
abortions the same. This punishment was excommunication, a
penalty which has been continuously reaffirmed since then.<br>
<font size=-2>ibid., p. 212</font><p>

What needs repeating is that, while the Canon law punishment for
the sin of abortion varied, the Church's teaching was constant.
Abortion was always condemned.<p>

"Some have thought that the Catholic teaching on the morality
of abortion has altered with each change in Canon law. This is
altogether mistaken. The Canon law always has assumed that all
abortion is a serious sin. From this assumption, it has
proceeded variously in different periods to try to discourage
Catholics from committing this sin."<br>
<font size=-2>Grisez, <i>Abortion, the Myths, the
Realities, and the Arguments,</i> New York,
Corpus Books, 1970, pp. 180-181</font>

<dt>But this entire concept of soul is only a belief. It cannot be
proven!

<dd>That is correct. It is a faith belief. One person may believe the
soul is created at conception, another at three months, another
at birth, and yet another does not believe in the presence of a
soul at all. Each of us has the right to believe what we wish.<p>

If the pro-life forces triumph and abortion is again condemned,
it may well be that other family-preserving values will be
strengthened. But if we fail, few other family-life values or
interpersonal moral values can endure if the one person ordained
by nature and by God to protect this helpless innocent little one
is allowed to kill her own flesh and blood to "solve" her own
personal, social, or economic problem.

<dt>Some think that the nuclear war issue is a more important moral
concern than abortion.

<dd>Sincere pro-lifers have taken positions on both sides of the
nuclear issue, and we should respect both. As to importance and
gravity, there are differences of opinion.

<ul type=disc>
<li> The nuclear holocaust is still but a threat. Since the U.S.S.R.
matched the U.S.'s atom bomb 40 years ago, no one has died in
a nuclear war. The abortion holocaust is happening now. Over
1-1/2 million deaths occur annually in the U.S. alone.

<li> A war is an activity of the state, and any citizen of the
nation involved may or may not agree. They do share
responsibility but in a distanced, indirect, and corporate way.<p>

Abortion is an immediate, personal, one-on-one, voluntary
decision over which each participating person has direct
control.

<li> A war, if a just one, that is, a defensive one, defends from
another's attack. Abortion is direct aggression which kills an
innocent baby. In war we defend our lives. In abortion, we
aggressively kill others.
</ul>
<dt>How does religious belief influence the abortion issue then?

<dd>Belief in God, in our creation by Him, in His authorship of life,
of His Commandments and His justice, and in our brotherhood and
sisterhood with the unborn is a powerful motivation leading
believers to work for the protection of the unborn. The bottom
line is that our religious faith motivates us. It can never be
the sole legal justification for seeking laws to protect the
unborn, the handicapped, and the elderly.

<dt>What right has any religious body to impose its morality upon a
woman?

<dd>If this were a sectarian religious belief, there would be justice
to such a complaint. In fact, this is not a religious question
except in the broad sense of equal rights, dignity, and justice
for all.<p>

If any religious philosophy has been imposed upon a nation, it is
Secular Humanism. The U.S. Supreme Court has defined Humanism as
a religion. The officer corps of the pro-abortion movement is
almost entirely made up of secular humanists who have imposed
their beliefs upon our nation.<p>

I have the right to swing my fist, but that right stops at your
nose. A woman has certain (not total) rights to her own body, but
not over another living human's body just because he or she still
happens to live inside her.<p>

The Ten Commandments forbad murder and stealing. So do the laws
of every civilized nation. Do those laws impose religious
morality? Hardly!<p>

This is a civil rights issue. It is a question of whether an
entire class of living humans shall be deprived of their basic
right to life on the basis of age and place of residence.<p>

Perhaps the question should be turned around:<p>

<dt>Why do doctors do abortions?

<dd>Rarely, a doctor will do an abortion because he believes it is
necessary to save a mother's life.

<dt>But other than that?

<dd>If, tomorrow, a law were passed mandating that thenceforth all
abortions were to be done for free, at least 98% of the doctors
doing them would quit.<p>
</dl>

physicians joining brand new group just moving
into Dallas. Will open in July. Full and part
time openings for residents in surgery, ob-gyn,
and general medicine. Growth potential unlimited.
</table><p>

<dl>
<dt>Is doing abortion that lucrative?

<dd>Yes. See above. An abortionist, working only 20 or 30 hours a
week, with no overhead, can earn from 3 to 10 times as much as an
ethical surgeon. The above ad was run in the Dallas Morning News
on June 24, 1974. Guess why they were willing to pay four times
the starting salary for regular obstetric practice? With
inflation, abortionists in the U.S. can now make $400,000 per
year while working only a 30-hour week.

<dt>Don't some doctors do them for humanitarian reasons?

<dd>There are some. Most of these become disillusioned, however. Dr.
Bernard Nathanson is an example of one who quit. Another related
his experiences in the March 4, 1985 issue of Medical Economics.

<dt>Some do them for mental health?

<dd>There is no known psychiatric disease that is helped by an
abortion. Further, it is well known that mentally stable women
can tolerate the psychic stress of abortion better than unstable
ones (see chapter 17).

<dt>Don't doctors take the Hippocratic Oath?

<dd>All doctors used to. By doing so, they promised to only cure, not
to kill, by abortion or any other way. In recent years, however,
in many countries, the abortion part has been quietly dropped. It
had said:<p>

"I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest
such counsel, and in like manner, I will not give to a woman
a pessary to produce abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>The Oath of Hippocrates</font><p>

Today, the abortion portion has been removed and replaced by "I
will do nothing that is illegal." We might note that the new oath
would have fit well in Nazi Germany, where the doctors who helped
to kill Jews were doing nothing that was illegal.<p>

Hippocrates, the father of medical ethics, defined the
practitioner of medicine as only a healer and thus, began a new
era. Previously, the medicine man's role had combined both
healing and killing. Today, turning the clock back several
millennia, some doctors are again assuming that dual role.

<dt>Are there any other famous pledges?

<dd>Yes, as follows:<p>

"Thou has appointed me to watch over the life and death of thy
creatures."<br>
<font size=-2>Oath of Maimonides (12th Century A.D.)</font><p>

The American Convention on Human Rights in San Jose, November 22,
1969 stated:<p>

"Every person has the right to have his life respected, this
right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the
moment of conception. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of
his life."

<dt>Here is another oath familiar to many:

<dd>"I will not give my patients any poisonous drug, if they ask
first, nor will I advise them thus, nor aid in a miscarriage."<br>
<font size=-2>Oath of the Arabian Physician</font><p>

The most modern pledge is:<p>

"I solemnly pledge myself to consecrate my life to the service
of humanity. I will give to my teachers the respect and
gratitude which is their due; I will practice my profession
with conscience and dignity; the health of my patient will be
my first consideration; I will respect the secrets which are
confided in me; I will maintain by all means in my power the
honour and noble traditions of the medical profession; my
colleagues will be my brothers; I will not permit
considerations of religion, nationality, race, party politics,
or social standing to intervene between my duty and my
patient; I will maintain the utmost respect for human life,
from the time of conception; even under threat, I will not use
my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity. I make
these promises solemnly, freely, and upon my honour."<br>
<font size=-2>Declaration of Geneva, The World
Medical Association, Sept. 1948</font>

<dt>What is the policy of the American Medical Association?

<dd>The AMA policy maintains that if killing of the unborn is legal,
then it is also ethical.

<dt>Does making something legal, also make it right?

<dd>"In 1944, a physician in Germany could participate in genocide
with legal sanction. In America he would have been a murderer.
In 1977, in America, a physician could perform an abortion
with legal sanction. In Germany, he would have been a
murderer. We have come 360 degrees on the moral compass."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Baten &amp; W. Enos, "Questions of
Authenticity and Situational Ethics,"
<i>Cancer Bulletin,</i> vol. 29, no. 4, 1978</font>

<dt>Wow!

<dd>Yes, that is a total change from the policy that the AMA had
always held sacred. The contrast from 100 years ago also makes a
chilling comparison.

<dt>How did the AMA deal with physician abortionists back then?

<dd>In 1871 the AMA recommended dealing with medical abortionists in
the following manner:
"These men should be marked as Cain was marked; they should be
made the outcasts of society . . . respectable men should
cease to consult with them, should cease to speak to them,
should cease to notice them except with contempt . . .
Resolved, That we repudiate and denounce the conduct of
abortionists, and that we will hold no intercourse with them
professionally or otherwise, and that we will, whenever an
opportunity presents, guard and protect the public against the
machinations of these characters by pointing out the physical
and moral ruin which follows in their wake."<br>

<font size=-2>Exerpted from <i>The Abortion Holocaust,</i>
W. Brennan, Landmark Press, 1983.</font>

<dl>
<dt>How did the change come about?

<dd>"The beginnings were at first merely a subtle shift in emphasis
in the basic attitude of the physicians. It started with the
acceptance of the attitude, basic in the euthanasia movement,
that there is such a thing as a life not worthy to be lived.
This attitude in its early stages concerned itself merely with
the severely and chronically sick. Gradually, the sphere of
those to be included in this category was enlarged to
encompass the socially unproductive, the ideologically
unwanted, the racially unwanted, and finally all non-Germans.
But it is important to realize that the infinitely small
wedged-in lever from which this entire trend of mind received
its impetus was the attitude toward the nonrehabilitable
sick."<br>
<font size=-2>L. Alexander, "Medical Science Under
Dictatorship," <i>New England Jour. Med.,</i>
vol. 241, July 14, 1949, pp. 39-47</font>

<dt>That was in Germany. How about America?

<dd>The first public admission of this change of basic ethic was an
editorial:
"The reverence of each and every human life has been a keystone
of Western medicine, and is the ethic which has caused
physicians to try to preserve, protect, repair, prolong, and
enhance every human life.<p>

"Since the old ethic has not yet been fully displaced, it has
been necessary to separate the idea of abortion from the idea
of killing, which continues to be socially abhorrent. The
result has been a curious avoidance of the scientific fact,
which everyone really knows, that human life begins at
conception, and is continuous, whether intra- or
extra-uterine, until death. The very considerable semantic
gymnastics which are required to rationalize abortion as
anything but taking a human life would be ludicrous if they
were not often put forth under socially impeccable auspices.
It is suggested that this schizophrenic sort of subterfuge is
necessary because, while a new ethic is being accepted, the
old one has not yet been rejected."<br>
<font size=-2>Editorial, <i>Jour. CA State Med. Assoc.,</i> Sept. 1970</font>

<dt>Doctors really know that abortion kills a human life, don't they?

<dd>Perhaps not all of them. Doctors are narrowly specialized. Just
because M.D. or D.O. appears after their names, don't assume they
know everything about fetal development. Remember, most clergymen
aren't scripture scholars, and few attorneys know much about
copyright law. Also, few stop to think that 99% of abortions are
done on normal, healthy women to directly kill normal, healthy
babies for non-medical reasons.

<dt>Which doctors are most pro-abortion?

<dd>Psychiatrists.

<dt>And most pro-life?

<dd>Pediatricians, Family Practitioners, and Neo-natologists.

<dt>Are there any pro-life medical associations?

<dd>Yes. The largest and most effective one in America is the
American Academy of Medical Ethics. See chapter 36 for others.

<dt>What about nurses, they help with abortions don't they?

<dd>Most of them only help with abortions because there are no other
jobs available and they need the money. They usually get the
dirty end of it. Abortions are particularly upsetting to nurses.

<dt>Why is that?

<dd>"I saw a bassinet outside the nursery. There was a baby in this
bassinet -- a crying, perfectly formed baby -- but there was
a difference in this child. She had been scalded. She was the
child of a saline abortion.<p>

"This little girl looked as if she had been put in a pot of
boiling water. No doctor, no nurse, no parent to comfort this
hurt, burned child. She was left alone to die in pain. They
wouldn't let her inside the nursery -- they didn't even bother
to cover her.<p>

"I was ashamed of my profession that night! It's hard to
believe this can happen in our modern hospital, but it does.
It happens all the time. I thought a hospital was a place to
heal the sick -- not a place to kill.<p>

"I asked a nurse from another hospital what they do with their
babies who are aborted by saline. Unlike the hospital where I
work, where the baby was left alone struggling for breath,
their hospital puts the infant in a bucket and puts the lid
on. Suffocation! Death by suffocation!<p>

"Another nurse said she had to stop helping with abortions. The
little severed arms and legs from a suction abortion were just
too much for her to look at."<br>
<font size=-2>D. Conklin, "Nurse to Senate:
'Ashamed of Profession," '
<i>The Miami Voice,</i> May 25, 1979</font>

<dt>Can a nurse refuse to assist at an abortion?

<dd>It depends. In some hospitals, yes. In others they are
transferred and given such lousy hours and duty that they quit.
The free standing abortion chambers, of course, do nothing but
abortions, so the nurse who works there knows that this is the
work she will be doing when she is hired.

<dt>What about emotional stress for the nurses?

<dd>For salt-poisoning and Prostaglandin abortions, the abortionist
gets off easy; he injects the drug and leaves. Later, the mother
goes into labor and delivers (usually) a dead baby. The nurses
have to cope with the dead, dying, or live baby, as well as
attending to the mother, who often becomes hysterical when she
discovers that the "product of pregnancy" is in reality, a tiny
son or daughter.<p>

"Nurses were more disturbed by amniocentesis abortions (salt
poisoning and Prostaglandin) in which they played major roles
in supporting the patient as well in her abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>N. Kaltreider et al., "The Impact
of Midtrimester Abortion Techniques
on Patients and Staff," <i>Amer. Jour.
OB/GYN,</i> vol. 135, 1979, p. 235</font><p>

D&amp;E abortions are a newer development. The dilatation and
evacuation method spares the mother the emotional trauma of
directly facing the fact that she has killed a real baby, but
pro-abortion propagandist Dr. W. Cates admits:<p>

"Ossified (bony) parts such as the skull must often be crushed
and the bone fragments extracted carefully to avoid tearing
the cervix. Reconstruction of the fetal sections after removal
is necessary to ensure completeness of the abortion procedure.
Clearly, D&amp;E transfers much of the possible psychological
trauma of the abortion from the patient to the professional."<br>
<font size=-2>J. Roaks &amp; W. Cates, "Emotional Impact
of D&amp;E vs. Instillation," <i>Family Planning
Perspective,</i> Dec. 1977, pp. 276-77</font><p>

Colorado abortionist Warren Hern, who does these in large volume,
writes of:
". . . the emotional turmoil that the procedure inevitably
wreaks on physicians and staff. . . . There is no possibility
of denial of an act of destruction by the operator. . . . The
sensations of dismemberment flow through the forceps like an
electric current. . . . Some part of our cultural and perhaps
even biological heritage recoils at a destructive operation on
a form similar to our own. . . ."<br>

Planned Parenthood Physicians,"
<i>OB-GYN News,</i> 1978<p>

"Meeting of Nat'l Abortion Federation,
San Francisco," OB-GYN News, Dec. 1981</font>

<dt>What about malpractice insurance for abortionists?

<dd>The more dangerous the surgical procedure, the higher the cost of
medical malpractice insurance. The State of Florida has always
rated its doctors as Class I up to Class VI. On January 1, 1984,
a special ultra-risk Class VII rating was created for
abortionists. This acknowledged the fact that the risk was
greater than that for brain or heart surgery.<br>
<font size=-2>"Florida Insurance Reciprocal by PIMCO,"
<i>Amer. Assn. of Pro-Life OB &amp; GYN
Newsletter,</i> Jan. 1984, p. 10</font>

<dt>How many American doctors do abortions?

<dd>Out of over 300,000 physicians in the U.S., there are about 8,700
who are willing to provide abortions.<br>

Case Loads," <i>OB-GYN News,</i> Sept. 1, 1984</font>

<dt>What is fetal experimentation?

<dd>Experimentation can be carried out on the living human fetus
while he or she still lives in the womb. Experimentation can also
be carried out on the living human baby after delivery. If the
experiment (for example, trial of a new drug in treatment) is
done for the possible benefit of this specific living human, then
it is ethical if the parents approve. If, however, the experiment
is done with the intention of later killing this living human to
determine the effects from the experiment, then a serious crime
is committed against human rights.

<dt>But if the mother has the right to abort, why not the right to
consent to an experiment? The child can't live anyway.

<dd>The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973, and the parliaments in some other
nations, debated the conflict of rights between mother and baby.
By legalizing abortion, they granted the mother the superior
right. Through the surgery of abortion, she can become
unpregnant. Once the mother and child are separated, however, if
the child is born alive, there is no longer a conflict of legal
rights. Besides being alive and human, the child is now separated
from the mother and equally entitled to his or her human rights
and protection.<p>

"Merely because a developing baby is condemned to death does
not give anyone the license to do as one pleases with him or
her. To grant such a permission would be to admit in principle
that an adult condemned to death for a crime may also be
treated in whatever way one wishes. Most people would find
this totally unacceptable.<p>

"Non-therapeutic research with discernible risk cannot
ethically be imposed on condemned criminals in modern society
or on dying children. By the same reasoning, it should not be
imposed on aborted fetuses or fetuses marked for abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>D. McCarthy, A. Moraczewski, "An Ethical
Evaluation of Fetal Experimentation,"
Pope John, Med-Moral Research &amp; Educational
Center Publishers: St. Louis, 1976, p. 78</font><p>

To do so would be to repeat the Nazi era. Remember, Nazi doctors,
who did just that, were hanged for it.

<dt>But the aborted baby is not viable yet!

<dd>Viability measures the sophistication of the external
life-support systems around the baby. Viability is not a measure
of the aliveness or humanness of the baby. All "pre-viable"
babies are viable if left in their natural habitat, the womb (see
chapter 9).

<dt>Under what conditions can parents give consent for experimentation?

<dd>Parents who give consent for experimentation on their children
are assumed to have concern for their child's welfare, and the
hope has always been that such experimentation will benefit them.<p>

Parents who give consent to have their child in the womb killed,
obviously have no such loving interest. Legal tradition through
our country's history has always forbidden parents to injure or
allow others to injure their child. That is what child-abuse laws
are all about. If such experiment is not done to preserve the
life or health of the baby, the parents should have no right to
grant permission.

<dt>For purposes of experimentation, what is a "live birth?"

<dd>The World Health Organization defines a live birth as the
delivery of a neonatal baby with a heartbeat, a pulsating cord,
muscular movement, or a respiratory effort.<br>
<font size=-2>E. Diamond, "Redefining the Issues
in Fetal Experimentation," <i>JAMA,</i>
vol. 236, no. 3, July 19, 1976, p. 282</font>

<dt>Would you regard experiments on live human fetal tissue as ethical?

<dd>This is an entirely different question. Such experimentation can
be ethical. When we die, some of our tissues can be preserved and
classified as "live tissue." Experiments using live human tissue
are entirely different from experiments on live humans.

<dt>What about using the placenta?

<dd>After the child is born, he or she no longer needs their
placenta. For many years, hospitals have frozen and sold them to
drug companies to extract hormones and other substances. More
recently, placentas have also been sold to cosmetic manufacturing
companies. This may be distasteful or even revolting to many
people. There is, however, no major ethical problem in such use.

<dt>What is a "fetus ex utero?"

<dd>That is a live-born baby. Such terminology is mere semantic
gymnastics to hide the humanity of the newborn baby and to make
it more likely that the public will allow experimentation and
killing.<p>

It is also a contradiction in terms, as the technical biological
name of the being still in the uterus is "fetus," but the proper
biologic name, once outside the uterus, is baby or infant.

<dt>But don't we need some human experimentation? We can't learn
everything from other research.<p>

<dd>"With proper design and effort and money, animal experiments
can solve almost every fetal problem presently under
investigation. A man did not have to be shot into space naked
to learn the hazards of unsupported life in the stratosphere."<br>

<i>Washington Post,</i> April 21, 1973</font>

<dt>Has there been any fetal experimentation in North America?

<dd>Dr. A. Ammann, of the University of California, transplanted
human fetal thymus glands into two older children. Both donor
humans were killed.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Time Magazine,</i> Feb. 28, 1972, p. 54</font><p>

This happened in South Carolina as well.<br>
<font size=-2>"Thymus Implant," <i>Medical Tribune,</i> Nov. 3, 1971</font><p>

Kidneys from aborted babies were used to study kidney
maldevelopment at Dalhouse University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. The
donor humans were killed.<br>
<font size=-2><i>British Medical News,</i> April 2, 1973</font><p>

Dr. R. Goodlin at Stanford University, California, did
experiments including, "slicing open the rib cage of still-living
human fetuses [newborn babies] in order to observe the heart
action. . . . Some as old as twenty-four weeks . . . were used."<br>
<font size=-2>Sworn testimony of Mark Swedsen, June 1, 1972</font><p>

"It was repulsive to watch live fetuses [premature infants]
being packed in ice while still moving and trying to breathe,
then being rushed to a laboratory." Seeing this happening at
Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh, Mrs. W. Dick,
Anesthetist, requested to be excused from helping with
abortions. Her request "was denied . . . with threats of being
fired, harassment, intimidation, restrictions in assigned
duties, etc." She finally quit her job.<br>

<dt>How about the other countries?

<dd>The most grisly one reported to date was done at the University
of Helsinki, Finland, by Dr. Peter Adam, a professor at
Case-Western Reserve University in Cleveland.<p>

"To produce those data, the investigators severed the heads of
12 previable fetuses obtained by abdominal hysterotomy at 12
to 20 weeks' gestation. The heads were then perfused through
the internal carotid arteries with recirculating Krebs-Ringer
bicarbonate medium containing labeled substrates, and were
equilibrated continuously with a gaseous oxygen-carbon dioxide
mixture. Venous return was obtained from the incised sagittal
sinus, and carbon 14-labeled CO2, evolved from the labeled
substrates, was collected in hyamine hydroxide solution."<br>

A six-month-old aborted baby had his testicles transplanted into

sexually active. The surgery was successful, the donor baby was
killed.<br>

The live, beating hearts of preborn babies (up to 15 weeks) were
removed for experimentation at the University of Szeged, Hungary.<br>

Contraction Rates of In-Situ and Isolated
Fetal Hearts in Early Pregnancy," Amer.
Jour. OB/GYN, vol. 118, no. 1, Jan. 1, 1974</font>

<dt>Are there other studies?

<dd>With the publication of the above and the resultant public outcry
in the U.S. and other countries, most such experimentation has
slowed or gone unpublished. For a detailed listing of earlier
experimentation, see articles by J. Harrington (Parts I &amp; II), in
Marriage and Family News, Feb. 1972.

<dt>Is there still experimentation in the U.S.?

<dd>In April 1974, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 281 to 58
to prohibit research on a human fetus "which has been removed
from the womb and which has a beating heart." The U.S. Senate
voted likewise, adding only that the ban be reviewed later. A
special commission later recommended that the ban be lifted, but
maintained substantial restrictions.<p>

The U.S. Congress also denied the U.S. National Science
Foundation any funds "to be used to conduct or support research
in the U.S. or abroad on a human fetus which has been removed
from the womb and which has a beating heart, unless such research
is for the purpose of insuring the survival of that fetal baby."

<dt>What about more recent studies?

<dd>A series of three studies performed up to 1976 at the University
of Manitoba in Canada was published and met with intense public
outcry. The first involved the delivery of live, normal babies by
hysterotomy (mini-Cesarian section) and entailed 54 babies, some
as old as 16 weeks' gestational age and as long as 10 inches in
crown-rump length. After delivery, the abdomens were cut open and
their sex and adrenal glands were examined.<p>

The second study involved 79 babies, up to 26 weeks' gestation,
aborted alive by hysterotomy, who were killed by heart puncture.<p>

The third study involved 116 babies, up to 22 weeks, aborted
alive by hysterotomy, who were then killed by having their hearts
punctured, their skulls opened and their pituitary glands
removed.<br>

Development," Parts I, II, III. <i>Jour.

(II) vol. 38, no. 4, 1974, pp. 612-617,
(III) vol. 42, no. 1, 1976, pp. 9-19</font><p>

In Arizona in 1981, the E. R. Squibb Drug Company offered free
abortions to 14 pregnant women if they would take a certain drug
(Naldol) before their abortions and allow their baby's blood to
be tested after they were killed. The doctors were paid $10,000.<br>
<font size=-2>R. Collins, <i>Arizona Republic,</i> Mar. 26, 1981</font><p>

In Europe, a 1983 report to a Committee of the European
Parliament by A. Gherto details hysterotomy abortions at 12-21
weeks and subsequent experimentation on various organs. It
reports that some of the human remains are frozen and then sold
to cosmetic industries.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Cork Examiner,</i> Ireland, Aug. 25, 1983</font>

<dt>What do most doctors think of live fetal experimentation?

<dd>It cannot be stated strongly enough that the overwhelming
majority view this sort of activity as revolting, subhuman,
barbaric, and disgusting, and would categorically condemn it.
Nevertheless, when the door to abortion-on-demand is open, things
like this are bound to happen. Once reverence for life is lost at
any stage of human life, practices like this soon appear.

<dt>What about using newborn anencephalic babies as organ donors?

<dd>After he or she dies, the above rules apply. These are live
babies and they cannot be killed for their organs.
Loma Linda University experimented with such babies but quit when
it became evident that by the time of brain death, (including
brain stem death) the other organs were not usable.

<dt>What about experimenting on live human embryos?

<dd>Sadly, this may be about to begin. A report of a 16-member
government-appointed panel in England recommended that any kind
of experimentation on a living human embryo be permitted up to
the 14th day of life. They recommended that after 14 days it be
a criminal offense. Happily, the House of Lords did not accept
this recommendation, and the House of Commons rejected it on a
vote of 238 to 66 on Feb. 15, 1985.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Warnock et al., England, July 18, 1984</font>

<dt>What of fetal surgery?

<dd>New advances in intrauterine fetal surgery have only added more
proof that there are two patients to be concerned with. A recent,
dramatic example of treatment of the preborn patient occurred in
London's King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry:<p>

"A 28-year-old pregnant woman had a history of four previous
fetal deaths from severe Rh disease. In the current pregnancy
she was watched closely. At 18 weeks gestation, ultrasound
exam showed fetal scalp edema (swelling) and large pericardial
effusions (fluid in the sac around the heart) indicating
serious Rh trouble.<p>

"Fresh packed blood, group O-Rh negative, was transfused into
the baby through the umbilical cord artery at 18 and 19 weeks.
During the second transfusion the unborn baby's heart slowed
and then stopped. This was detected by ultrasound.<p>

"Under ultrasonic guidance, the mother was turned on her left
side and the fetal heart was massaged by the fingers of the
doctor. In three minutes, the heart began beating again.<p>

"The unborn baby was transfused again at 23 weeks, 26 weeks,
and 29 weeks. At 32 weeks gestation (seven months), a normal
infant was delivered."<br>
<font size=-2><i>British. Med. Jour.,</i> vol. 288, 1984, pp. 900-901</font>

<dt>What of fetal transplants?

<dd>Transplantation of fetal organs into the body of a born person
should observe the same ethical norms as for organs from born
persons. These include:
<ul type=disc>
<li> Proper permission, i.e., from parents who have loved and
offered proper care to keep the unborn baby alive and well. If
the parent is part of the killing team, she surrenders any
moral right to give such permission.

<li> The newly developed baby must be dead (there are definition of
death laws in most states) before any organs are removed.

<li> One cannot kill a baby (in or out of the uterus) to get an
organ.

<i>Abortion Leads to Infanticide
Like Night Follows Day</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>Why is this so?

<dd>One example is all that is needed. Let's assume that a mother has
the amniocentesis test to be sure that she is not carrying a
Down's Syndrome baby. If it is positive, she definitely intends
to have the unborn baby killed by abortion (a narrow majority of
Americans agree that for this "hard case" such killing should be
permitted). In this instance, the test is normal.<p>

But, when the baby is born, he turns out to have Down's Syndrome.
The test was mistaken. Now what? If she had identified the baby's
condition before birth, she would have "solved" the problem by
killing the tiny patient.<p>

Now the baby is breathing air. Now the diagnosis is definite. Now
there is also no danger to the mother as a result of the
"procedure."

<dt>Why not kill the baby now?
</dl>

<p align=center>
<b>Same Patient<br>
Same Problem<br>
Same Solution</b><p>

<dl>
<dt>That would be terrible.

<dd>But utterly logical! That is the frightening thing about aborting
a handicapped baby. The most direct statement on this was by
Nobel Laureate, James Watson, the man who cracked the genetic
code:
"Because of the present limits of such detection methods, most
birth defects are not discovered until birth.<p>

"If a child were not declared alive until three days after
birth, then all parents could be allowed the choice . . . the
doctor could allow the child to die if the parents so choose
and save a lot of misery and suffering."<br>
<font size=-2>"Children from the Laboratory," J. Watson,
<i>AMA Prism,</i> Ch. 3, p. 2, May 1973</font>
<ul type=disc>
<li> Some of his colleagues disagree. Three days is too short a
time. They would prefer thirty days after birth.

<li> The pro-abortionist, Joseph Fletcher, would use the I.Q.
measurement and allow those with an I.Q. under 20 or perhaps 40
to be declared non-human. (Who will bid 60?)

<li> There are some who think that just being black would be reason
enough, or perhaps Jews might be declared "non-persons" again.

<li> Miss Barbara Smoker, President of the National Secular Society
and Vice-Chairman of the British Humanist Association, wrote:
"The situation of a newborn baby is very different from that of
the same baby, even a few weeks later. . . . At birth the baby
is only a potential human being and at that point, it is surely
the humane and sensible thing that the life of any baby with
obvious severe defects, whether of body or brain, should be
quietly snuffed out by the doctor or midwife. This should not
be a decision referred to the family who are too emotionally
involved; though in borderline cases the doctor's knowledge of
the family situation would be one of the factors taken into
account."<br>
<font size=-2><i>The Times,</i> January 22, 1973</font>
</ul>
<dt>Is any of this happening -- really?

<dd>The most famous case was Baby Doe of Bloomington, Indiana, in
1982. He had Down's Syndrome at birth, but he also had a
connection between his food-pipe and windpipe (a trachea-
esophageal fistula). There were several surgeons within
50 miles who could have repaired it. Otherwise, the baby could
not be fed. Because of the Down's Syndrome, however, the parents
refused permission to operate or to administer IV feedings or any
other treatment. This decision was upheld by the Indiana Supreme
Court, and the baby starved to death.<p>

Baby Jane Doe of New York, was born in 1983. She had spina bifida
(a partially open spine) and a potential hydrocephalus (water
head). Good medical care would have mandated surgical closure of
the spinal defect and placement of a shunt to prevent the
hydrocephalus. The parents were apparently ready to give
permission to operate when they were told that the baby would
possibly or probably be mentally retarded. Because of this, they
refused permission for surgery. Without closure, such an infant
will ultimately die from recurrent meningitis infections which
enter through her open spine. Several such infections did occur.
However, this little girl's skin spontaneously grew over the
spinal defect about three months later, closing it. The parents
then consented to the placement of the shunt. But, prior to the
parents' consent, the federal government and a private attorney
had attempted to step in and have the surgery legally authorized
without parental consent. A federal judge, however, held that the
parents had the right, in effect, to decide to let the little
girl slowly die from these painful infections.

<dt>These were landmark cases?

<dd>Yes, and tragic ones. Both were similar. Except for the probable
mental deficiency, both would promptly have had corrective
surgery. In each case, however, because of this undetermined (and
undeterminable) mental deficiency, the parents refused, assuring
an immediate death in the first case, and (except for spontaneous
closure), painful, recurrent infections, and death in the second
instance.<p>

In both cases, the parents' rights to allow death (the right to
kill) were granted. The babies were refused ordinary treatment
because they had a handicap. Both were discriminated against
because of a handicap.

<dt>Who sided with the babies?

<dd>Many different associations for the handicapped such as the
Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC), Right to Life groups or
other concerned people, and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, which issued regulations to protect such babies.

<dt>Who sided with the parents?

<dd>The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical
Association, and other medical groups who felt that protection of
the babies would infringe upon the rights of the doctors to
determine treatment. The courts also sided with the parents and
struck down the first set of proposed regulations.

<dt>Have there been any positive developments?

<dd>Yes, one major one. A joint statement in December 1983, by the
American Academy of Pediatrics and eight disability rights groups
agreed that:
<ul type=disc>
<li> Discrimination against anyone with a disability, regardless of
its severity, is morally and legally indefensible.

<li> Disabled individuals have the same rights as any other
citizens, rights recognized at birth.

<li> A person's disability (mental or physical) must not be the
basis for withholding treatment.

<li> Anticipated limited potential or lack of community resources
are irrelevant and must not determine decisions concerning
medical care.

<li> The individual's medical condition should be the sole focus of
the decision.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Pediatrics,</i> vol. 73, no. 4, April 1984, p. 559</font>
</ul>
<dt>Any more bad ones?

<dd>Yes. In an earlier issue of Pediatrics, a certain Peter Singer
wrote that the sanctity-of-life view, the "religious mumbo-
jumbo," should be stripped away. "Species membership in
Homo-sapiens is not morally relevant." If we "compare a dog or a
pig to a severely defective infant," he said, "we often find the
non-human to have superior capacities." To Singer, quality of
life is the only guide.<br>
<font size=-2>P. Singer, "Sanctity of Life or
Quality of Life?" <i>Pediatrics,</i> vol.
73, no. 1, July 1983, pp. 128-129</font><p>

At the University of Oklahoma, a team of specialists evaluated 69
newborn babies with spina bifida. They admitted that the physical
defect could be corrected, but decided whether or not to do so on
an evaluation of the child's "quality of life," that is, his or
her estimated intelligence, and the support available at home and
from society. On this basis, they used "early, vigorous
treatment" on 36 of the 69 infants, and they all did well. The
remaining 24 babies got a failing grade and were given no
treatment, no surgery, no shunt, no antibiotics, not even any
sedation when they died (which they all did). This study was
published in a major medical journal. It was a callous,
cost-benefit analysis test used to determine who should live and
who should die.<br>
<font size=-2>R. Gross et al., "Early Management and
Decision Making in Myelomeningocele,"
<i>Pediatrics,</i> vol. 72, no. 4, Oct. 4, 1983</font><p>

A professor of Pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin, a
member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Ethics Committee,
sadly stated, "It is common in the U.S. to withhold routine
surgery and medical care from infants with Down's Syndrome for
the explicit purpose of hastening death."<br>
<font size=-2>N. Fost, <i>Archives of Internal Med.,</i> Dec. 1982</font>

<dt>How does one begin to answer this?

<dd>Professor Jerome Lejeune, discoverer of the chromosomal pattern
of Down's Syndrome once related to us a story he had heard from
a geneticist colleague.<p>

"Many years ago, my father was a Jewish physician in Braunau,
Austria. On one particular day, two babies had been delivered
by one of his colleagues. One was a fine, healthy boy with a
strong cry. His parents were extremely proud and happy. The
other was a little girl, but her parents were extremely sad,
for she was a Mongoloid baby. I followed them both for almost
fifty years. The girl grew up, living at home, and was finally
destined to be the one who nursed her mother through a very
long and lingering illness after a stroke. I do not remember
her name. I do, however, remember the boy's name. He died in
a bunker in Berlin. His name was Adolf Hitler."

<dt>What if the parents don't want the handicapped infant?

<dd>There are organizations like the Spina Bifida Association of
America, with over 100 couples on its waiting list, wanting to
adopt an infant with spina bifida. (Write J. Grafstron, 1955
Florida Ave., Xenia, OH 45385.) The Michael Fund, 400 Penn
Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15146 can give you a similar waiting list.

<dt>What do parents of retarded children think?

<dd>"There has not been a single organization of parents of
mentally retarded children that has ever endorsed abortion.
We, who are parents of these children and have borne the
burden, ask that before you, the legislators, propose to speak
for us, by possibly authorizing abortion for fetal
abnormality, please ask our opinion first."<br>
<font size=-2>Mrs. Rosalie Craig, Testimony
before Ohio Legislature, 1971</font><p>

It is of considerable interest that an unusual number of natural
and adoptive parents of handicapped children are to be found
among the pro-life activists in all countries.

<dt>But isn't it cruel to allow a handicapped child to be born -- to a
miserable life?

<dd>The assumption that handicapped people enjoy life less than
"normal" persons has been shown to be false. A well-documented
investigation has shown that there is no difference between
handicapped and normal persons in their degree of life
satisfaction, outlook of what lies immediately ahead, and
vulnerability to frustration.<p>

In a series of 150 unselected spina bifida patients questioned as
older children, all were asked whether their handicaps made life
not worth living and should they have been "allowed to die" after
birth. Their unanimous response was forceful. Of course they
wanted to live! In fact, they thought the question was
ridiculous.<br>
<font size=-2>W. Peacock, Pers. Comm. to D. Shewmon
in "Active Voluntary Euthanasia,"
<i>Issues in Law &amp; Medicine,</i> 1987.</font><p>

"Though it may be both common and fashionable to believe that
the malformed enjoys life less than normal, this appears to
lack both empirical and theoretical support."<br>

et al., Wayne State Univ., "Happiness and
Life Satisfaction of the Malformed," <i>Proceedings,
Amer. Psychologic Assn. Meeting,</i> 1971</font>

<dt>But wouldn't care of the handicapped be very costly?

<dd>What is your ethic? Do you treat, care for, and help a sick or
disabled person, or do you kill him? Do you measure the value of
a person's life in money? Or in utilitarian usefulness?

<dt>Is keeping these babies worth the cost?

<dd>The cost to society to care for all the physically and mentally
handicapped among is us would be but a tiny fraction of the cost
to society for the morally deformed among us.<p>

Dr. D. McLone &amp; Colleagues reported on a series of almost 1,000
unselected cases of spina bifida which they had aggressively
treated.
<ul type=disc>
<li> 75% had normal intelligence

<li> 80% were walking by school age

<li> 90% had bowel and bladder control by school age

<li> 99% of parents were satisfied with the treatment<br>

the Management of "Spina Bifida,"

<dt>What of Down's Syndrome?

<dd>"Upwards of 80% of Down's babies will occur to younger mothers"
under 35.<br>
<font size=-2>Adams et al., "Down's Syndrome,
Recent Trends," <i>JAMA,</i> vol. 246,
no. 7, Aug. 14, 1981, pp. 758-760</font><p>

The mother is not solely the cause. "In about 30% of the cases,
the father has been responsible for the extra 21st chromosome in
Down's Syndrome." The older the father, the higher the percent.<br>
<font size=-2>Roberts et al., "Midtrimester
Amniocentesis," <i>Jour. of Repro. Med.,</i>
vol. 28, no. 3, Mar. 1983, p. 168</font><p>

Even so:<p>

at a maternal age of 30, 99.9% of babies do not have it,<br>
at a maternal age of 36, 99.6% of babies do not have it,<br>
at a maternal age of 40, 99.1% of babies do not have it.<p>

There is, we hope, great news coming. A treatment for this
condition may be found in our lifetime. Several studies have now
shown that the use of multivitamins, including folic acid, taken
before conception and through the first three months of pregnancy
was associated with less than half the number of defects found in
the non-treated group.

<dt>Is it possible to "cleanse the gene pool?"

<dd>Any talk about breeding out genetic diseases is a lot of
nonsense. Seriously affected persons are unlikely to marry and
have children; the genes are passed along by carriers. For
instance, there are 40 carriers for every person with sickle cell
anemia. If every victim of this disease were eliminated, it would
require 750 years just to cut the incidence in half; to stamp it
out altogether would require 200,000 abortions for every 500,000
couples. Because each "normal" person is the carrier of three or
four bad genes, the only way to eliminate genetic diseases would
be to sterilize or abort everybody.<br>
<font size=-2>Dr. Hymie Gordon, Professor of Genetics, Mayo Clinic</font>

<dt>Will maternal X-rays harm the baby?

<dd>"Interruption of pregnancy is never justified because of the
radiation risk to the embryo/fetus from a diagnostic X-ray
exam, abdominal or peripheral."<br>
<font size=-2>Policy Statement, Amer. College of
Radiology, <i>AMA News,</i> Nov. 1976, p. 12</font>

<dt>How do parents emotionally handle the abortion of a handicapped
baby?

<dd>Very poorly. One study reported maternal depression of 92% and
paternal depression of 82%, plus a 30% incidence of marital
separation after the abortion.<br>
<font size=-2>Blumberg et al., "Psychiatric Sequelae of
Abortion for Genetic Indication," <i>Amer. Jour.
OB/GYN,</i> vol. 122, no. 7, Aug. 1975, pp. 799-780</font>

<dt>How are handicapped preborn babies diagnosed before birth?

<dd>The mainstay of the "search and destroy" mission is
amniocentesis. A new method is chorionic villi biopsy. Another is
maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein.

<dt>What is amniocentesis?

<dd>It involves taking a small amount of fluid from the baby's
amniotic sac through a needle inserted into the mother's abdomen
and uterine wall. The cells in the fluid are cultured and
examined a month later. Certain chemicals in the fluid can also
be measured.

<dt>Why is it done?

<dd>In the midtrimester, it is done to diagnose certain conditions.
In the third trimester, it is done to treat illnesses of both
baby and mother.

<dt>Is it safe?

<dd>Opinions differ. A very reputable, large English study found that
there were 14 fetal deaths in the amniocentesis groups compared
to 5 in the control group, severe maternal bleeding in 37
compared to 12, ruptured membranes in 0.5% compared to none,
subsequent spontaneous abortion in 2.7% compared to 1.4%, and Rh
antibodies developed in 9 compared to 2. Severe postpartum
respiratory distress occurred after birth in 30 compared to 9,
with 24 major orthopedic abnormalities compared to 1. The overall
increased risk to the baby was 300% and the cumulative overall
risk of all negative factors to both mother and child was 9.2%
compared to 3.3% in the control group. One must also add to this
the false positive and false negative test results which resulted
in additional "needless" abortion of normal babies.<br>
<font size=-2>Royal College of OB/GYN, "An Assessment
of Hazards of Amniocentesis," <i>British Jour.
OB/GYN,</i> vol. 85, Supplement N.2., 1978</font><p>

In a large follow-up study eight years later, "spontaneous
abortion rate was 1.7% in the group with amniocentesis, and 0.7%
in the control group."<br>
<font size=-2>"Randomized Trial of Amniocentesis
in 4606 Low Risk Women"
<i>Lancet,</i> 1287, June 7, 1986</font><p>

Thus, both of these well-controlled British studies confirm that
the amniocentesis test itself kills 1% of the babies tested.
Strangely, most American studies have found fewer problems, but
all studies have found some.<br>
<font size=-2>Roberts et al., "Midtrimester
Amniocentesis," <i>Jour. of Rep. Med.,</i>
vol. 28, no. 3, Mar. 1983, pp. 167-168</font>

<dt>Are there any fetal conditions that can be treated in the
midtrimester?

<dd>No. Both Methylmalonic Acidemia and Biotin deficiency can be
discovered in mid pregnancy. Neither, however, is treatable until
later in the third trimester. The testing is not necessary in the
midtrimester -- unless you want to kill the babies before they
get too old.

<dt>Then why do the amniocentesis test?

<dd>Solely to make a diagnosis. If a baby with a genetic handicap can
be identified, he can then be killed by abortion.

<dt>No other reason?

<dd>"If abortion is outlawed, amniocentesis programs in
midtrimester would close, since the main therapeutic
prerogative would have been eliminated."<br>
<font size=-2>Golbus, "The Current Scope of Antenatal
Diagnosis," <i>Hospital Practice,</i> April 1982</font>

<dt>What about third trimester amniocentesis?

<dd>This is quite different. These are much safer, and they are done
to help treat and save the lives of both baby and mother. Then it
is done for Rh disease, diabetes, fetal lung maturity, etc.

<dt>But what of a child with Tay-Sacs Disease? That child will surely
die a slow death of deterioration?

<dd>So the new "ethic" says that you should kill him early and
efficiently! Does age (younger) and place of residence (in the
womb) really change what you are doing (killing)? There are
dozens of incurable illnesses, some just last longer than others.

<dt>What defects come from Rubella?

<dd>Of the 16.9% of children who develop defects when their mothers
get Rubella while pregnant:
<ul type=disc>
<li> 50% had hearing loss, most correctable by hearing aids.

<li> 50% had heart defects, almost all surgically correctable.

<li> 30% had cataracts, often one-sided. Most had fair vision.

<li> Mental retardation was 1.5% compared to 1% in a non-affected
population.<br>
<font size=-2>Rendle-Short, <i>Lancet,</i> vol. 2, 1964, p. 373</font>
</ul>
<dt>What if a woman receives Rubella vaccine while pregnant?

<dd>There are no reported cases of significant damage to the babies
who were born after such vaccination. For example, "none of the
live-born infants had serologic or clinical evidence of
congenital rubella."<br>
<font size=-2>S. Wyall &amp; K. Herrmann, "Inadvertent Rubella
Vaccination of Pregnant Women," <i>Jour. Amer.
Med. Assn.,</i> vol. 225, 1973, p. 1472</font><p>

Rubella Vaccine probably poses no threat to fetuses whose mothers
are vaccinated around the time of conception. All newborns tested
in this study were negative.<br>
<font size=-2>S. Sheppard, "Rubella Vaccine,"
<i>Br. Med J.</i> 292:727, 1986.</font><p>

The U.S. Center for Disease Control, U.S. Public Health Services,
in a report covering 1971 through 1982, reported on 959 pregnant
women who were vaccinated while pregnant. They reported no
evidence of Rubella-induced defects. The very few abnormalities
found were "expected" in such a large number.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Morbidity &amp; Mortality Weekly Report,</i>
vol. 32, no. 33, Aug. 26, 1983 </font>

<dt>What is Alpha-Fetoprotein testing, and why is it done?

<dd>It tests the mother's blood and can reveal that she is probably
carrying a child with either an open spine (spina bifida) or
anancephaly.<p>

It must be done on blood drawn between her 16th and 18th week of
pregnancy. Of 1,000 women, 50 will have positive results. The
blood test must then be repeated. This time, only 30 will be
positive. An ultrasound test will then be done and will clear 15,
leaving 15 still positive. Then these mothers must have an
amniocentesis (1% of babies die from the test). After the
necessary four-week wait, the results will pinpoint 1 or 2 babies
who have the handicaps, who are 20-22 weeks old, and who weigh 1
to 1-1/2 pounds each.<p>

Even after all of this testing, some of the babies aborted will
be normal, and some of the "normals" will be born with the
handicap, for the test is not always correct. The test is
available, however, is being used, and is required by law in some
places. The main problem, even for those who favor abortion, is
the level of anxiety created as the elimination process
continues. Many, who are "cleared" still don't believe they are
"OK" and get abortions on the suspicion that the tests were
wrong.<p>

Another report found false positive and negative results varying
from 4% to 17.5%.<br>
<font size=-2>Bradley, et al., <i>N. Eng. J. Med.,</i> vol.
315, no. 3, p. 193, July 17, 1986.</font>

<dt>Can an unborn baby get AIDS?

<dd>Yes, but only a small percentage do. All test positive at birth
if the mother is AIDS positive, but this is a passive antibody
carryover from the mother. At one year, only 25-40% still test
positive. Assuming that these babies are infected, probably half
or fewer will get the active disease and die, most within two
years.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Mason, Asst. U.S. Surgeon
General, "Pers. Comm.," Center
for Disease Control, Mar. 24, 1987.</font>

<dt>Hasn't abortion reduced infant mortality?

<dd>Not so! How is it possible to save one baby's life by killing
another? Of course, if you kill one and one-half million babies
before they are born, there will be fewer left to be at risk of
dying. If we killed everyone over sixty years of age, there also
would be a sharp drop in cancer deaths.<p>

The real reason for the actual drop in infant mortality has been
the creation of neonatal intensive care units in most major
hospitals.<p>

<i>Euthanasia is
When the Doctor Kills the Patient</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>But there are different kinds of euthanasia such as active and
passive, direct and indirect, voluntary and involuntary.

<dd>Let's clear up this semantic confusion. All of these
qualifications are either the product of confused minds, or a
direct attempt to change the meaning of the word euthanasia so
that we can accept it: Euthanasia is when the doctor kills the
patient.

<dt>But I don't want the doctor keeping me alive artificially. Why not
a law to permit death with dignity?

<dd>No new laws are needed. No doctor in the U.S. has ever been
indicted for <i>allowing</i> a patient to die a natural death. When a
patient is surely dying, doctors may and must use their best
judgment when deciding whether to continue or discontinue certain
therapeutic efforts that have failed to cure the patient, and
that may only be serving to postpone dying. The doctor's only
obligation, then, is to keep the patient comfortable and allow a
peaceful death.<p>

Doctors have had the confidence of patients in the past because
their total effort has been to cure. If and when doctors begin to
practice exterminative medicine and begin to kill, then that
absolutely essential factor in the doctor/patient relationship --
complete confidence -- will be destroyed.<p>

In any case, those who have been in intensive care units, by
large majorities, would go back, even if such care gave them only
one more month of survival.<br>
<font size=-2>M. Danis et al., Patients &amp; Family's
Preferences for Medical Intensive Care,
<i>JAMA</i>, vol. 260, no. 6, Aug. 12, '88, p. 797</font>

<dt>What about "Living Wills"?

<dd>These are misnamed, for they have nothing to do with living and
everything to do with dying. Nor are they wills; they are,
rather, "death wishes" or "death directives." Right to Life
agrees that anyone who wants to can sign one, but totally opposes
making them binding by law.

<dt>Why oppose legally binding "death wishes"?

<dd><ul type=disc>
<li> The Euthanasia Society started the idea, and that should give
us pause.
<li> Informed consent just cannot be given in a generic fashion for
an unknown problem at a future time.

<li> Legislation is not necessary; we have enough government
intervention.

<li> The patient and family can always get another doctor if the
present one seems unsatisfactory.

<li> A conscious patient can always refuse treatment.

<li> Many patients change their minds. With a signed document that
is legally binding, it may be too late.

<li> What does "terminally ill," or "artificial means," or "heroic
measures," or "meaningful," or "reasonable expectation" mean?
These definitions change with time and are different in each
case.
</ul>
<dt>The Euthanasia Society started these wills?

<dd>Yes. The Euthanasia Society and its Foundation have since changed
their names to The Society for the Right to Die, which then
changed its name to The Society for Concern for Dying. They all
have been headquartered at 250 W. 57th St., New York, NY 10019.
On the Euthanasia Society's advisory council as a founding member
is Abigail Van Buren, the "Dear Abby" newspaper columnist, who
constantly pushes these misnamed "living wills."<p>

Before his death, Dr. Alan Guttmacher, head of Planned Parenthood
World Population was also a prominent member of the Board of the
Euthanasia Society of America.

<dt>Where does the ACLU stand?

<dd>In 1977, the American Civil Liberties Union's Board of Directors
stated:
"Consensual euthanasia involves an act or an omission by a
second person, at the request of an individual, for the
termination of the latter's life when he or she is either
terminally ill or totally and permanently disabled. The ACLU
recognizes this form of euthanasia as a legitimate extension
of the right of control over one's own body."<br>
<font size=-2><i>Euthanasia News,</i> vol. 3, no. 1, Feb. 1977</font>

<dt>What of suicide?

<dd>There is a Hemlock Society in America, and an Exit Society in
England to aid people in taking their own lives.

<dt>What of the courts?

<dd>The courts are moving the U.S. rapidly down the slippery slope to
legal euthanasia. A major step was taken when several courts
redefined "treatment" to include food and water. Then they
authorized the discontinuation of "treatment" for certain
patients. These patients were not in pain, were not dying, but
were (permanently?) comatose and being fed through nasogastric
tubes. When food and water were stopped, they died. The best
easy-to-read, moderately-detailed discussion of this is in three
short chapters in:<br>
<font size=-2><i>Window on the Future,</i> Ed. by
D. Andrusko, Nat'l Right to Life, 1987.</font>

<dt>Euthanasia is legal in Holland?

<dd>The Dutch legalized euthanasia through a decision in 1981 of the
Rotterdam Criminal Code.<p>

The doctors there began to remove food and water from such
patients. They soon learned that the patients died slow, painful
deaths that were psychologically stressful for the family and the
medical personnel, as well as being expensive. "Why torture them?
We are killing them. Why not do it quickly and painlessly," they
said. And so the Dutch doctors began to use lethal injections
(and the judges tolerated the practice).<p>

Reports vary because of wide variations in reporting and
non-reporting, but in 1986, out of a total of 120,000 deaths,
between 5,000 to 20,000 people were killed by doctors.

<dt>Are the Dutch people accepting it?

<dd>Some are, others are not. "Documented cases of involuntary active
euthanasia have been reported by C.I. Dessaur and C.J.C.
Rutenfrans, by myself, and others. K.F. Gunning published his
experience with the specialists who, when asked to admit an
elderly patient to the hospital, advised the general
practitioners to administer lethal injections instead. H.W.
Hilhorst, in his extensive study (sponsored by Utrecht University
and the Royal Dutch Academy of Science), found that involuntary
active euthanasia was being practiced in eight hospitals.<p>

"Anxiety is growing among threatened groups. Warnings have been
published that elderly patients, out of fear of euthanasia,
refuse hospitalization and even refuse to consult doctors. An
inquiry among hospital patients showed that many fear their own
families may ask for euthanasia without consulting them. The
Dutch Patients' Association placed a warning in the press that,
in many hospitals, patients are being killed without their will
or knowledge, or the knowledge of their families, and advised the
patients and their families to carefully inquire on every step in
the treatment, and when in doubt, to consult a reliable expert
outside the hospital."<br>

no. 4, Spring '89 pp. 455-487.</font>

<dt>Is there an alternative to euthanasia?

<dd>The real alternative to euthanasia is to provide loving,
competent care for the dying. A new concept for the dying arose
in England, where institutions called Hospices specialize in
compassionate, skilled care of the dying. This concept has spread
to Canada and the U.S., where it has been quickly accepted.<p>

"Once a patient feels welcome and not a burden to others, once
his pain is controlled and other symptoms have been at least
reduced to manageable proportions, then the cry for euthanasia
disappears. It is not that the question of euthanasia is right
or wrong, desirable or repugnant, practical or unworkable. It
is just that it is irrelevant. Proper care is the alternative
to it and can be made universally available as soon as there
is adequate instruction of medical students in a teaching
hospital. If we fail in this duty to care, let us not turn to
the politicians asking them to extricate us from this mess."<br>
<font size=-2>R. Lamerton, Care of the Dying
<i>Priorty Press Ltd.,</i> 1973, p. 99</font>

<dt>Why talk about euthanasia in an abortion book?

<dd>They both directly kill living humans. They both are done for the
same reasons (also see chapter 28).

<i>A Brief Look at the Analogy</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>How did euthanasia come about?

<dd>The <i>original</i> euthanasia program to "purify" the German race was
a creation of certain physicians, <i>not</i> Hitler. He simply allowed
the use of the tools others had prepared.<p>

The first gas chamber was designed by professors of psychiatry
from 12 major German universities. They selected the patients and
watched them die. Then they slowly reduced the "price tag" until
the mental hospitals were almost empty.<p>

They were joined by some pediatricians, who began by emptying the
institutions for handicapped children in 1939. By 1945, these
doctors had so lowered the price tag that they were killing bed
wetters, children with misshapen ears, and those with learning
disabilities.<br>
<font size=-2>Wertham, <i>The German Euthanasia Program,</i>
Hayes Publishing Co., Cinn, 1977, p. 47</font><p>

There were internists who helped empty the homes for the aged.
Then some doctors went out into the community. Many handicapped
and old people were taken from their homes and killed. By 1945,
these doctors had even eliminated many World War I amputee
veterans.<p>

Few people know that doctors participating in the "German
Euthanasia Program" did so voluntarily. Some left the program and
received no retaliation. Of course, Hitler approved and exerted
specific pressures, but it was doctors who started it.<p>

Hitler, taking his cue from these physicians, after the eugenic
killing of almost 300,000 Aryan Germans who were "defective,"
then used their gas chambers and proceeded to eliminate
"defective" races. He destroyed an entire race of Gypsies, six
million Jews, and perhaps almost as many captured Poles,
Russians, and central Europeans.<br>
<font size=-2>ibid.</font>

<dt>But I thought the program started with sterilization.

<dd>That's true. The first and fundamental law change was the Law for
the Prevention of Progeny with Hereditary Diseases, promulgated
by Hitler on July 25, 1933. It was aimed at Aryan Germans and its
purpose was to purify the race by eliminating those with supposed
heredity diseases. In six years, the law was responsible for the
involuntary sterilization of an estimated 375,000 Germans.
<br>
<font size=-2>W. Deuel, <i>People Under Hitler,</i>
New York, 1942, p. 221</font><p>

This law also legalized abortion for women who were to be
sterilized. Later, the "right" to legal abortion was extended to
Jews, Poles, Gypsies, and other racial minorities.<br>
<font size=-2>ibid., par. 14</font>

<dt>But I thought Hitler opposed abortion.

<dd>Wrong! Hitler only opposed abortion for "pure blood" Aryan women.
He allowed and even encouraged it for others.<p>

In an order to the SS, SD, and police on June 9, 1943,
Reichskommisar Kaltenbrunner directed: "In the case of eastern
female workers, pregnancy may be interrupted if desired." First,
a racial exam was to be done and then, "If a racially valuable
result is to be expected, the abortion is to be denied . . . if
not valuable, the abortion is to be granted."<p>

After the war, the War Crimes Tribunal indicted ten Nazi leaders
for "encouraging and compelling abortions," which it considered
a "crime against humanity."<br>
<font size=-2>"Trials of War Criminals," <i>Nuremberg
Military Tribunal,</i> Washington, DC:
USGPO, vol. IV, p. 610</font>

<dt>But no one in America would agree with any of that!

<dd>Margaret Sanger, the famous founder of Planned Parenthood, was
supportive. She wanted "more children from the fit, less from the
unfit."<br>
<font size=-2><i>Birth Control Review,</i> vol. 3,
no. 5, May 1919, p. 2</font><p>

This wasn't only related to contraceptive planning. As editor,
she printed grossly eugenic material, approving of Hitler's
sterilization program (see <i>Into the Darkness, Nazi Germany Today,</i>
by L. Stoddard , p. 196).<p>

She believed that "Negroes and Southern Europeans were mentally
inferior to native born Americans." She found these people,
Hebrews, and others "feebleminded," "human weeds," and called
them a "menace to the race." In 1933, her <i>Birth Control Review</i>
devoted an entire edition to eugenic sterilization.<p>

Sanger's famous "Plan for Peace" was almost the same as Hitler's,
even going beyond it to suggest, in essence, concentration camps.<p>

"When the world realized the logical consequences of Hitler's
hereditarian-eugenic, totalitarian type of government,
Margaret Sanger's birth-control movement had to take a quick
step away from its overt eugenic language."<br>
<font size=-2>E. Drogin, <i>Margaret Sanger, Father of
Modern Society,</i> CUL Publications, 1979, p. 28</font>

<dt>Do you see signs of this destructive thinking in America and other
nations today?

<dd>Yes, definitely. The last two chapters have spoken of infanticide
for handicapped newborns and of the clear preliminary steps
toward euthanasia of the elderly and handicapped. We are going
down the same road, developing and nurturing the same attitudes
in our thinking.<p>

"There is a prevalence of thinking in destructive rather than
ameliorative terms in dealing with social problems. The ease
with which destruction of life is advocated for those
considered either socially useless or socially disturbing,
instead of educational and ameliorative measures, may be the
first danger sign of loss of creative liberty in thinking
which is the hallmark of a democratic society.<p>

"The beginnings [in Germany] were merely a subtle shift in
emphasis in the basic attitudes of physicians. It started with
the acceptance of the attitude, basic in the euthanasia
movement, that there is such a thing as a life not worth
living. This attitude in its early stages concerned itself
merely with the severely and chronically sick. Gradually, the
sphere of those to be included in this category was enlarged
to include the socially unproductive, the ideologically
unwanted, the racially unwanted, and finally, all non-Germans.<p>

"From the attitude of easing patients with chronic diseases
away from the doors of the best types of treatment facilities
available, to the actual dispatching of such patients to
killing centers is a long, but nevertheless, logical step."<br>
<font size=-2>Leo Alexander, "Medical Science Under
Dictatorship," <i>New England Jour. Med.,</i> July 1949</font><p>

"In 1944, a physician in Germany could participate in genocide
with legal sanction. In America he would have been a murderer.
In 1977, In America, a physician can perform an abortion with
legal sanction. In Germany, he would be a murderer. We have
come 360 degrees on the moral compass."<br>
<font size=-2>M. Baten &amp; W. Enos, "Questions of
Authenticity and Situational Ethics,"
<i>Cancer Bulletin,</i> vol. 29, no. 4</font>

<dt>Where can I find more details?

<dd>Without question, the best source is Dr. William Brennan's book,
<i>The Abortion Holocaust,</i> (Landmark Press, 1983, $6.95). It
describes in minute detail the analogy between the Nazi holocaust
and the abortion holocaust. Complete with charts and fully
documented, it is a very valuable book.<p>

<dl>
<dt>What is Right to Life's position on birth control?

<dd>The RTL movement limits itself to the protection of life from
conception until natural death. It takes no position on the
"preliminaries." Therefore, it has no opinion on contraception or
sterilization.

<dt>What is the difference between contraception, sterilization, and
abortion?

<dd>Contraception and sterilization prevent human life from
beginning. Abortion directly kills a human life already begun.<p>

The legal freedom of individuals to use contraceptives has been
recognized by most governments during this century. The
recognition of such individual freedom of action does not, by
itself, make such actions morally right or wrong. Obviously,
there are sharply differing judgments taught by different
religions. For example, the Roman Catholic Church forbids the use
of artificial contraceptives on the grounds that human persons
are no more the arbiters of the process by which human life comes
to be than they are of human life already begun. Many other
Christian and non-Christian churches hold other opinions. If a
husband and wife do decide to use contraceptive methods to plan
their family, this decision immediately affects only themselves
and their own bodily functions.<p>

Sterilization is a permanent form of contraception. It can never
be equated with abortion. It is a permanent termination of one of
the body's natural functions. It prevents human life from
beginning. It does not kill a life already begun.<p>

Abortion, however, kills another human being. As such it can
never be a matter of a mother's privacy or legal freedom of
action (as ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court). Once pregnant, a
woman is going to have a baby. The only choice open to her then
is to allow the child to grow and be delivered or to have her
tiny son or daughter killed. It should be the social concern of
all citizens to give equal protection by law to all members of
society.

<dt>How does the "pill" work?

<dd>There are over 30 "contraceptive" pills on the market, each
differing a little from the others. They "prevent" pregnancy
through three separate functions.<p>

1. They thicken the mucous plug at the cervix. If this is the
primary effect, then it truly is contraceptive because it
prevents sperm from entering.<p>

2. They prevent release of the ovum. If this is the primary
effect, then the function is "temporary" sterilization.<p>

3. They render the lining of the womb hostile to the implantation
of the tiny new human at one week of life. This effect is
abortifacient.<p>

The earlier high-estrogen pills largely prevented ovulation. The
newer low-estrogen pills allow "breakthrough" ovulation in up to
20% or more of the months used. Such a released ovum is
fertilized perhaps 10% of the time. These tiny new lives which
result, at our present "guesstimations," in 1% to 2% of the pill
months, do not survive. The reason is that at one week of life
this tiny new boy or girl cannot implant in the womb lining (see
number 3 above) and dies. These are micro-abortions.<p>

The pill, then, can have a contraceptive or temporary
sterilization effect (by far the most common), or it can be an
abortifacient.<br>
<font size=-2>Willke, "The Physiologic Function
of Certain Birth Control Measures,"
<i>Nat'l RTL News,</i> Mar. 9, 1981</font>

<dt>In any one month for any one woman, which effect is primary?

<dd>For the woman, it is impossible to know.

<dt>How does the "morning-after pill" work?

<dd>Sometimes it acts in a sterilizing fashion. The massive dose
rapidly affects the ovary, almost certainly preventing any
ovulation that might have occurred one to three days after the
intercourse. If sperm were still present and active in the
woman's genital tract, she might otherwise have been fertilized
one to three days after the event. In this case, such treatment
(for example, as for an assault rape victim) actually prevents a
pregnancy (also see chapter 19).<p>

Like the pill above, this medication also has an antinidatory
effect on the endometrium (that is, a hardening of the lining of
the uterus), which prevents implantation of the tiny new human
being (blastocyst stage).<p>

If, for example, a rape victim had ovulated just before the
assault and fertilization had occurred, then the use of such
medication after the event would clearly be abortive.<p>

In actual practice, there is no way of knowing if she was
fertilized at all, and if so, which effect the medicine had.

<dt>What is an IUD?

<dd>The intrauterine device, commonly referred to as an IUD or a coil
(in Europe), is a small plastic or metal device that is inserted
into the cavity of the uterus through the vagina. The purpose of
this is to "prevent" pregnancy.

<dt>Is an IUD a contraceptive or an abortive agent?

<dd>Until recently, almost all scientific papers had agreed that its
effect was to prevent the implantation of the tiny new human
being into the nutrient lining of the uterus; an abortive action.<p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated in an official
report that its effectiveness is "in direct proportion to the
quantity and quality of the inflammatory response which it
engenders." The report summarizes the various types of IUDs and
the various theories of action, and states that there "is one
common thread . . ." They all "interfere in some manner with the
implantation of the fertilized ovum in the uterine cavity."<br>
<font size=-2>Second Report on IUDs, Dec. 1978,
U.S. Dept. of HEW, Food &amp; Drug
Administration Document 017-012-00276-5</font><p>

A detailed report in a Planned Parenthood publication in 1989,
however, claimed that a high percentage of its action was the
prevention of fertilization.<br>
<font size=-2>IUDs are Contraceptives, not
Abortifacients: A Comment on
Research and Belief, I. Sivin,
<i>Studies in Family Planning,</i>
vol. 20, no. 6, Dec. '89.</font>

<dt>Have the IUDs been withdrawn from the market?

<dd>Yes, in the U.S., the Dalcon Shield was withdrawn in 1974 because
of a flood of lawsuits alleging injury and death from its use.
Because of this, its manufacturer paid out $2.5 billion in
damages and went bankrupt.<p>

After this the Lippes Loop was withdrawn in 1985, as were the
Saf-T-Coil in 1982 and the Copper-7 in 1986.<p>

The Progestasert remained. A new one, the Copper-T-380A, was
marketed in very limited numbers in 1988.

<dt>What about natural family planning?

<dd>This is not to be confused with the old (and not always
effective) calendar rhythm. Utilizing an intimate knowledge of
the woman's bodily functions such as mucous production, body
temperature, and other signs and symptoms, this method helps a
couple know when her fertile and nonfertile times of the month
are. Without using any pills or other artificial means, couples
can plan their families by having intercourse when she is (or is
not) fertile. The abstinence time can be as brief as one week.

<dt>What is RU-486?

<dd>It is an abortion drug. It is taken after the mother misses her
period and the baby is at least two weeks old. It cuts off an
essential hormonal nutrient, progesterone, and the baby withers
on the vine, dies, and drops off. It has been tried as a
once-a-month menses inducer, but has caused such an upset to her
cycle and body rhythms, and has not prevented pregnancies, that
such use has been abandoned.<br>
<font size=-2>Santen &amp; Haspels, "Failure of RU-486 as
a Monthly Contraceptive," <i>Contraception,</i>
vol. 35, no. 5, May 1987, p. 433<p>

Ulmann &amp; Hodges, "RU-486 Abortifacient,
Not Home Contraceptive," Contraceptive
Technology Update, Dec. 1986, p. 146</font>

<dt>But family planning methods don't always work. What happens if a
woman becomes pregnant and didn't want to be?

<dd>Over a lifetime, statistically speaking, most family planning
methods do work. They also do fail in individual situations. Many
people who are reading these words have been surprised by an
unplanned pregnancy. Most of these originally unplanned
pregnancies, however, over a period of nine months, came to be
wanted and, after birth, became very cherished and loved children
indeed. Truly, family planning, while not always "working" in
each individual instance, will, if averaged out over a lifetime
of marriage, be very effective in almost all cases in producing
a family of approximately the size that a particular couple would
desire. In any case, one cannot solve such a "problem" by killing
a baby.

<dt>What about compulsory sterilization for those who have major,
dominant genetic defects which they would be passing on to their
children?

<dd>Conscientious people with a hereditary defect would be well-
advised to refrain from having their own children, but rather to
adopt children as their own if they desire a family. Compulsory
sterilization for such reasons has already been enacted into law
in some states and nations. Not many would agree with this type
of law and activity. Even this, however, is something essentially
less than the deliberate taking of a human life once conceived,
since this involves only that person's body and not the life of
another human being (as abortion does).

<dt>Would a Constitutional Amendment in the U.S. or a law in Canada or
other nation outlawing abortion also forbid the use of the
contraceptive pill, the morning-after pill, or the IUD?

<dd>No! Such a law or amendment would only forbid induced abortion.
It could not "reach" these drugs and devices. This is because of
the legal effect of dual action.<p>

If a drug or device has an illegal action, but also a legal
action, it cannot be outlawed or removed from the market. A good
example is a butcher knife. This has a legal function in your
kitchen. It can also be used as a murder weapon. Because it has
both a legal and illegal function, its use cannot be forbidden.<p>

The "pill," "morning-after pill," and IUD would still have a
legal action (contraception, temporary sterilization), even
though the other action (abortifacient), would now be illegal.
Because of the legal action, the anti-abortion law could not
forbid the use of these medications.<p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has instructed all
physicians who insert IUDs to warn women that its use may cause
pelvic inflammatory disease and to make their patients
"thoroughly aware of this increased risk and its possible
interference with future fertility."<br>
<font size=-2>U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration
Drug Bulletin, May-June 1978</font>

<dt>Is the IUD safe for women?

<dd>Not very. The IUD, along with prior induced abortion and venereal
disease, is also assumed to be one of the principal causes of the
140% increase in ectopic (tubal) pregnancies in the last decade
(CDC figures, Medical World News, May 14, 1984).<br>
<font size=-2>Hallatt, "Ectopic Pregnancy
Associated with the IUD," <i>Amer.
Jour. OB/GYN,</i> vol. 125, p. 754</font><p>

This is true of all IUDs, but appears perhaps ten times as likely
with the "Progestasert" brand.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Medical World News,</i> Feb. 6, 1978<p>

R. Peck, "F.D.A. Advisory
Committee on Fertility and
Maternal Health Drugs," Medical Tribune</font><p>

The IUD causes infection in the uterus and Fallopian tubes and
often seals them off. Dr. R. Burkeman of Johns Hopkins, for
example, reported that "nongonococcal salpingitis [pelvic
inflammatory disease] is nearly twice as common (47% vs. 25%) in
IUD users as in non-users."<br>
<font size=-2>R. Burkeman Jr., "IUD Promotes PID,"
vol. 243, no. 24, June 27, 1980</font><p>

Add to this a "1.5 fold increase in risk of spontaneous
miscarriage."<br>
<font size=-2>Levin, MA General Hospital, <i>Family
Practice News,</i> May 15-31, 1982</font><p>

The question of whether an anti-abortion law would forbid the use
of the IUD may well prove irrelevant, for all will probably be
removed from the market someday because of their damage to women.

<dt>Does it cause sterility?

<dd>Two studies designed specifically to study the link with
infertility "confirm what doctors have strongly suspected for
years -- that the IUD increases the risk of infertility," said
Dr. Bruce Stadel of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development.<br>
<font size=-2>NICHHD Notes, Nat'l Inst. Health,
US Dept. HHS, Apr. 10, 1985</font><p>

Designed by the NICHHD, the studies confirmed the higher
incidence of PID and resultant sterility, but also showed that
"even women who have no signs of pelvic infection with the IUD
still have a greater chance of becoming infertile than do those
who never used the device."<p>

Different types carried different risks. Most dangerous was the
Dalkon Shield (3-7 times) than the Lippes Loop and the Saf-T-Coil
(3 times) and then the copper wound types (2 times the risk)<br>
<font size=-2>"Tubal Infertility and the IUD,"
D. Cramer et al., <i>N. Eng. J. Med,</i>
vol. 312, no. 15, p. 941-947, Apr. 11, 1985<p>

"Primary Tubal Infertility in Relation
to the Use of an IUD J. Daling et al.,
N. Eng. J. of Med. vol. 312, no. 15,
p. 938, 940, Apr. 11, 1985</font>

<dt>What about school based clinics?

<dd>These are more accurately called "sex clinics." After exhaustive
investigation of these new clinics, the entire Right to Life
movement has a strong opinion. These are seedbeds for abortion.
By "cooperating" with the students in giving them contraceptives
behind their parents' backs (the "sneak rule"), these clinics
actually encourage more sexual activity.<p>

Some reports show a decreased birth rate ("fertility rate") but
when more closely examined, most have an increased pregnancy
rate, but such a sharp increase in abortions that fewer babies
are delivered.<p>

There is a flood of recent literature on this. The best, most
detailed and most documented source of information is Dr. R.
Glasow's School Based Clinics; the Abortion Connection, published
by National Right to Life, 419 7th St., N.W., Suite 500, Wash.
D.C. 20004, $5.00 p.p.<p>

There has been an incredible campaign for these in the media, by
pro-abortion groups, and by many well-meaning but misinformed
citizens. Dr. Glasow's book cuts through this. It is the
definitive work.<p>

<i>The words we use are of incalculable importance.</i><p>

Those who support abortion have quite successfully engaged in
semantic gymnastics. They have told us that we are for "compulsory
pregnancy" and that they are for a "woman's right to choose."
"Termination of pregnancy" is "as simple as pulling a tooth." All
it does is to gently remove the "products of pregnancy," "the
fetus," "the embryo," the "feto-placental unit," "pregnancy
tissue," and will "restore her periods." They accuse us of wanting
to "impose our morality" and say that she has a "right to her own
body," to "reproductive freedom." Most pro-abortionists insist that
they "are personally opposed, but . . ." They fear a return to
back-alley butchery. They consistently emphasize the problems of
"unwanted pregnancy" and "women's rights," while totally ignoring
her tiny passenger.<p>

But we call ourselves "Right to Life." Early on, we who would
protect all human life adopted a title that has been startlingly
effective. We became "right-to-life." This is the best title. Use
it always. We also have said we are "pro-life." This, too, is an
excellent title. But many people have used "pro-life" in other
ways, changing its original meaning in many minds in an attempt to
include those who labor against poverty, against war, against
capital punishment, and against nuclear arms. Pro-abortionists have
also, at times, claimed to be "pro-life." They have never and will
never, however, adopt the title "Right to Life."<p>

Let's be positive, if possible. We are for protection for the
unborn, the handicapped, and the aged. If possible, don't accept
the negative label "anti-abortion." There is nothing negative about
being for life. And their label? "Pro-abortion" is acceptable;
"anti-life" is best. Never use their "pro-choice." If you do, add
"to kill" at the end of the phrase.<p>

What grows within? An "unborn baby or child," or perhaps "preborn
baby" is better. "Developing baby" is also scientifically and
professionally accurate. Sometimes other humanizing terms fit, such
as "this little guy." Avoid referring to the unborn child as "it";
use "he" or "she." The terms "the fetus" and "the embryo," fall on
the listening ear as "non-human glob." Never use them. If you can't
avoid it, speak of "the living human fetus." Remember that the
stage of "fertilized egg" lasts less than 24 hours. What implants
one week later is not a fertilized egg, is not a "pre-embryo"
(there is no such thing), but rather is a living embryonic baby.<p>

Who does the procedure? Never call him/her a doctor. They don't
deserve the dignity that "Doctor" calls forth. Also, don't use
"surgeon." Call them "abortionists." Never deviate from that title.
The word "abortionist" is one of condemnation, of criminality, of
killing. That is the label they deserve.<p>

"Termination of pregnancy" is a pro-abortion propaganda phrase.
Avoid it like the plague. It masks what is actually happening. It
speaks only to the mother's condition, completely ignoring the baby
she carries. Furthermore, it is not specific for abortion. Didn't
each of you terminate your mother's pregnancy by your birth?<p>

Use the word "kill." Use it repeatedly, directly, and often. It is
a non-judgmental, accurate, biological description of what happens.
We use it when we step on a roach or when we spray crab grass. Use
it here also. What of "murder?" This is a much stronger word. One
cannot "murder" a dog or an insect, only a human being. To say
"murderer" clearly implies that the abortionist knows that this
living being is human and kills anyway. Therefore, use "murderer"
with caution. Sometimes it may be too inflammatory and even
counterproductive. "Kill," however, is always in order.<p>

Who carries the child in her womb? A "mother." Pro-abortionists
hate the word. "Pregnant woman" is accurate, but "mother" is much
better.<p>

"Womb" is usually a better word than "uterus," carrying a message
of love, warmth, and security. "Womb" ties closely with "mother"
and leads to "the womb has become a tomb."<p>

Right to control her own body? You might facetiously ask, "Since
when has it been out of control?" More to the point, however, it
that this is a biologic absurdity, for over half (52%) of the
babies born (or aborted) are male. Who ever heard of a woman's body
with male organs?<p>

"Right to her own body," if accepted as a feminist credo (women's
rights), would or should serve to protect the almost 800,000 tiny
American women whose mothers kill them annually.<p>

"Place of residence" is a catchy and accurate way of remembering
that killing in America is legal as long as the baby still lives in
his first "place of residence," the womb. We also speak of
discrimination on the basis of race, color, age, handicap, and
place of residence.<p>

The U.S. Supreme Court Decision of 1973 should always be described
as "the tragic . . . the savage . . ." and like terms.<p>

Clinic? "Abortion clinic" is strong pro-abortion propaganda
semantics. Sadly, this term is commonly used by many pro-lifers.
The term is a contradiction. A "clinic" is where you go to be
healed. There are even automobile transmission clinics. Use
"abortion mill"; "abortion facility" if you must be neutral. Best
of all, use "abortion chamber." Why "chamber?" That reminds us of
gas chambers -- extermination centers -- and properly so. Every
second human being who enters an abortion chamber, is exterminated
(the tiny human inside the womb of a mother). Glad you asked.<p>

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is accurately described
as the legal defense and attack arm of the anti-life movement.
Since it is so selective in whose right to live it defends, many
call it the "anti-Civil Liberties Union." Some call it the
"Anti-Christian Liberties Union."<p>

Planned Parenthood needs to be explained and named every time you
talk of abortion. Sometimes "Planned Barrenhood" may be in order.
Planned Parenthood can always be labeled "The Largest Baby-Killing
Conglomerate in America." Never fail to mention their almost 60
abortion chambers which produce an over 100,000 per year "body
count."<p>

"Rape pregnancy" is not specific enough. Always speak of "assault
rape pregnancy," which is very, very rare and is what we're talking
about.<p>

"Euthanasia" comes from two Greek words meaning "good death."
Euthanasia proponents use this word to make it sound good. A quick
retort is that it no longer means good death; it simply means
"good-bye."<p>

Similarly, "death with dignity" sounds good, but say it right. We
want people to live in dignity until natural death occurs.<p>

"Liberalize abortion?" Horrors! Never use this phrase. For many of
us, to be liberal is to be concerned about those who need help the
most. Instead, speak of "permissive" or "radical" abortion laws.
Similarly, never use "reform" of older protective laws to mean that
killing is now permitted.<p>

Pro-abortionists accuse us of wanting to "impose our morality" on
women. Turn that around, and say it correctly: "How much longer
will our nation continue to allow mothers and abortionists to
impose their morality on their helpless babies -- fatally?"<p>

"Every Child a Wanted Child" is their slogan. We must finish their
sentence: "and if not wanted, kill."<p>

Always say "salt poisoning abortion." Never refer to "saline
abortion" or "salting out." These are pro-abortion terms and do not
face what actually takes place. Always -- and without exception --
say "salt poisoning," as that is exactly what kills the baby.<p>

"Interruption of pregnancy" is an absurd and inaccurate use of
words. If I interrupt you, it means that I temporarily stop you,
after which you resume. Abortion is permanent. It kills.<p>

The abortionist's "curette" is not a "spoon-shaped instrument." It
is "a loop-shaped steel knife." The curette doesn't "scrape" the
placenta away; it "cuts and slices" it away.<p>

"Person" is defined in one dictionary in 12 different ways. If you
use it, define it first. If they use it, ask, "What do you mean by
'person?"' Pro-lifers do much better to speak of "human life."<p>

"Conception?" Some define it as implantation at one week of life.
Better to use "fertilization." (See chapter 7.)<p>

"Contraception" is not a Right to Life issue, but I.U.D.s are
referred to as contraceptives when in fact, they are
"abortifacients." Use the correct word.<p>

Perhaps "untimely" or "problem" pregnancy is better than "unwanted"
pregnancy.<p>

Are we "compulsory pregnancy" people? Then they are "compulsory
death" people.<p>

They want "reproductive freedom." She has it, and has used it. She
is now a mother. She has reproduced. The only question now is
whether to kill.<p>

Is abortion a "single issue" in considering a candidate? No. But we
do see it clearly as a "disqualifying issue" at the ballot box.<p>

"Therapeutic abortion" always used to mean an abortion needed to
save a mother's life. But its use in California's first abortion
law, by Canada's "therapeutic abortion committees," and by many
pro-abortionists in the U.S. has totally destroyed its original
meaning. Now "therapeutic" has come to mean "elective."<p>

For a few "one-liners" consider:

<ul>
<li> Abortion is the ultimate child abuse.
<li> Abortion equals violence; oppose both.

<li> Intrauterine-battered child.

<li> Meaningful life? Meaningful to whom?

<li> It's a slippery slope from abortion to infanticide to
euthanasia.

<li> Quality of life? Or equality of life?

<li> Back-alley abortions are now front-alley abortions.
</ul>

"Since men can't get pregnant, they have nothing to say about
abortion." If that were true, doctors couldn't treat a disease
unless they had it first. How could we train funeral directors when
they have never died? How can we oppose Hitler's genocide if we're
not Germans or Jews -- or slavery if we were not slaves or slave
holders? In any case, each child has a father. And 52% of all
unborn babies are boys.<p>

If one is "incurably ill," that applies to all diabetics, for they
are incurable. Let's speak of "terminally ill" instead.<p>

"Potential" life? No. Rather, this is human life with vast
potential.<p>

Did you "come from" a teenager, a small girl, an infant, a female
fetus, a female fertilized ovum? No, you once were a teenager, a
small girl, an infant, a fetus, a female fertilized ovum. You were
all there at each of those stages of your life. All you've done is
to grow up.<p>

"Overpopulation?" Remember, the U.S., Canada, and most of the
Western world have had birth rates well below replacement level for
over a decade.<p>

"Health" is not what we think it is. As defined by the U.S. Supreme
Court, and as interpreted in law throughout the world, it means
"social, economic, and physical well being" of the mother.<p>

If a person is "personally opposed, but . . ." they are in reality,
pro-abortion. We'd far rather have a political office holder admit
that even though personally in favor of abortion, he or she will
vote for the civil rights of the unborn.<p>

Abortion of "handicapped," preborn babies is "killing the patient
to cure the disease." Remember, before birth and after birth, it's
the same patient and the same handicap. This is prenatal
euthanasia.<p>

"Fetal Deformity?" "Fetal Defect?" Why use such "turn off"
adjectives when we use "handicapped" for the child already born.
The word "deformity" makes us turn away in revulsion. "Defective?"
Our culture throws defective things away. "Handicapped" as a word
calls forth a helping hand. To use "fetal deformity" or "fetal
defect" is to make the killing easier. To use "fetal handicap" is
to call forth a helping hand.<p>

Never forget that abortion for rape is "killing an innocent baby
for the crime of his father."<p>

School based "health" clinics? Never, they are school based "sex"
clinics.<p>

An example of the use of words to deceive is shown in the following
routine instruction sheets. Both are for the same exam done by the
same technician with the same equipment.<p>

<i>With a Few Notable Exceptions,
It Is Overwhelmingly Pro-abortion.</i>

<dl>
<dt>That is certainly the shared opinion of pro-life leaders throughout
the Western world. Anyone in the Right to Life movement for any
length of time can cite numerous examples of pro-abortion bias,
ranging from selective reporting of actual facts, to slanting the
news, to gross distortion.<p>

Can you give examples?

<dd>The U.S. Supreme Court Decision of 1973 legalized abortion until
birth (see chapter 6). Almost two decades later, it was still
common in the daily media, to hear or read that it was only legal
in the first three months of pregnancy, or only legal until
viability, giving the clear impression that it was illegal after
that time.<p>

We are called "anti-abortion" (a negative label), while they are
"pro-choice" (a positive label).<p>

Large pro-life rallies, marches, picketing, etc., are ignored or
grossly underestimated in size. A dozen "pro-choice" protestors,
however, will get equal or often much more time on TV or space in
print than even tens of thousands of pro-life people.<p>

Anti-abortion "fanatics" are contrasted with pro-abortion people
with "deep commitments."<p>

It is okay to identify those who oppose abortion as Catholics, as
Evangelicals, Fundamentalists, or right-wing extremists. But who
has ever heard of a pro-abortion person being identified as a
Jew, an atheist, or a homosexual or lesbian, if such they were.

<dt>This is universal?

<dd>Of course not. Apart from the religious media, there are a few
columnist, daily newspapers, and radio and TV personalities who
try to be fair or who are openly pro-life. The point is that they
are a very small percentage, and this is true in every country.

<dt>Are there any surveys?

<dd>There have been some done to measure the values and convictions
of journalists and other leading professionals. The Connecticut
Mutual Life Insurance Company did an extensive survey of the
general public in the U.S. and contrasted their values with
"leaders" including those in the news media.

<pre>
"WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING DO YOU BELIEVE ARE MORALLY WRONG?"

Adultery.................................................85%
Use of hard drugs........................................84%
Homosexuality............................................71%
Engaging in sex before the age of 16.....................71%
Lesbianism...............................................70%
Pornographic movies......................................68%
Abortion.................................................65%
Smoking marijuana........................................65%
Living with someone of the opposite sex before marriage..46%
Sex between two single people............................40%
</pre>

By far the most interesting fact revealed by the study was
comparing leaders in various groups with the general public.<p>

<pre>
"IS ABORTION MORALLY WRONG OR IS THIS NOT A MORAL ISSUE?"

                       Morally Wrong      Not a Moral Issue

General Public..............65%..................35%
Leaders-overall.............36%..................64%
Religion....................74%..................26%
Business....................42%..................58%
Military....................40%..................60%
News Media..................35%..................65%
Voluntary Association.......33%..................67%
Government..................29%..................71%
Education...................26%..................74%
Law and Justice.............25%..................75%
Science.....................25%..................75%
</pre><br>
<font size=-2>"The Impact of Belief,"
<i>Conn. Mutual Life Report
on American Values in the '80s</i></font><p>

Another and more detailed report was based on "hour long
interviews with 240 journalists and broadcasters at the most
influential media outlets including the <i>New York Times,
Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, Newsweek,
U.S. News and World Report, CBS, NBC, ABC, PBS,</i> etc." Among the
findings were that 90% said a woman had the right to choose
abortion.<p>

Forty-six percent felt adultery was wrong, with only 15% feeling
strongly about it, and 76% approved of living with someone of the
opposite sex.<p>

On religion, 50% denied any religious affiliation. Twenty-three
percent were raised Jewish, but only 14% were practicing Judaism
at the time. Only one in five identified themselves as
Protestant, one in eight as Catholic. Overall, however, only 8%
went to church or synagogue weekly with 86% attending seldom or
never.<p>

They were largely male, white, highly educated, with high
incomes. They voted heavily for McGovern and Carter over Nixon
and Ford. They were committed to the welfare state, to
redistribution of income, and were strong environmentalists and
desegregationists. Eight-five percent agreed that homosexuals
have the right to teach in public schools, etc.<br>
<font size=-2>S. Lichter &amp; S. Rothman, "The Media
Elite: White, Male, Secular and Liberal,"
<i>Public Opinion Magazine,</i> 1981</font><p>

In a study two years later of "Television's Elite," 104 network
vice presidents, writers, producers, and executives returned
similar results. "Ninety-seven percent of the 'elite' agreed that
a woman has the right to decide on abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>J. Carmody, "The TV Column,"
<i>Washington Post,</i> Feb. 9, 1983</font>

<dt>Does the average journalist share the "media elites" liberal bias?

<dd>Yes. In 1985, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> surveyed 3,000 of the general
public and 3,165 more ordinary newspaper reports and editors
nationwide. The same bias was evident in who favored:
<pre>
                          Public             Journalists

Prayer in schools...........74...................25
Death penalty for murders...75...................47
Allowing abortions..........51...................82
Gay rights in employment....56...................89
Stricter handgun control....50...................78
Disinvestment in S. Africa..31...................62
Reagan's job performance....57...................30
</pre><br>
<font size=-2>R. Irvine, "Charting Media Attitudes,"
Wash. Times, Sept. 9, 1985</font>

<dt>What of journalism students?

<dd>In a study of 28 candidates for master's degrees at Columbia
University School of Journalism, the leftward bias was much more
pronounced, showing overwhelming support of women's rights. To
sample one other question; in 1980, 4% voted for Reagan, 59% for
Carter, and 29% for Anderson.<br>
<font size=-2>"Accuracy in Media Review,"

<i>Washington Journalism Review</i></font>

<dt>But does this value system show through their reporting?

<dd>Not for some, but very obviously for others. With such strong
opinions, even the most dedicated professional will show his or
her bias only too often.

<dt>Is there a pro-life answer?

<dd>Yes! For now, take everything you read with a healthy skepticism.<p>

For the future, let's urge our pro-life sons and daughters to
seek careers in journalism.

<dt>What of Opinion Formers in the performing arts?

<dd>A study of the 104 top Hollywood creators of TV shows, each of
whom had been associated with two or more prime time series,
reported that 97% were pro-abortion. Also, two-thirds said that
TV should be a major force for social reform. As with the news
media elite, they were well paid (two-thirds over $200,000 per
year), white, urban, male, most lived in California and the
Northeast, and only 7% went to church once a month.<br>
<font size=-2>L. and R. Lichter, S. Rothman,
"Hollywood and America, the
Odd Couple," Public Opinion 5,
Dec.-Jan. 1983, pp. 54-58</font><p>

A study of 149 writers, producers, and directors of the 50 top
grossing movies (1965-83) showed 96% pro-abortion, with similar
characteristic make-ups as those mentioned above.<br>
<font size=-2>S. Rothman &amp; R. Lichter,
"What Are Moviemakers Made Of?"
Public Opinion 6,
Dec.-Jan. 1984, pp. 14-18%</font>

<dt>Should we give up on the media? Is it hopeless?

<dd>Quite the contrary. Our relationship with the media is getting
better.<p>

We must get acquainted with media people. They will see us as
single issue? True, but they must also see us as well-spoken and
professional, not irresponsible firebrands; concerned for the
mother as well as her preborn child; broad based, not a single
political party or religion or sex; and as a voting block to
respect.<p>

We must educate them. Many media people have gross misconceptions
of us and what we stand for. When they understand us and our
issue better, we will get more balanced reporting.<p>

Most media people are sincere, dedicated, and try to do a job.
You should praise their professional work, but constructively
criticize their unprofessional reporting. Above all, however,
respect them, and continue to work with them. When we do get to
know each other, and do continue to communicate, we will get more
balance and, sometimes, even favorable treatment.<p>

Reporters and commentators are interested in news, any kind of
news. When we make news, we rate time and space and will get it.<p>

A good example of real news that was picked up and aired broadly
was <i>The Silent Scream,</i> the ultrasound movie of a 12-week suction
abortion (see chapter 10). This movie, on the cutting edge of new
technology, was news and was given good coverage.

<i>The Abortion Connection</i><p>

Section I: Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.<p>

Section II: The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by
appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<p>

Section III: This amendment shall effect two years after the date
of ratification.<p>

<dl>
<dt>When was it originally passed?

<dd>On March 22, 1972, by both Houses of Congress. Within two months,
13 states had ratified, within nine months, 22 states; within 12
months, 30 states. Then the tide turned. In the next six years,
five more states ratified but five rescinded, leaving the total
at 30 of the 38 needed, (assuming that the recisions were valid).

<dt>It passed Congress without argument?

<dd>Quite the contrary. There was a long series of amendments
proposed. The defeat of each of them had immense long-term
significance. During the debate in the U.S. Senate prior to
passage, this series of amendments was offered to specify that it
would not or could not be interpreted by judges to do certain
things. They included:

<ul type=disc>
<li> Women could not be drafted. Amendment 1065: "This article shall
not impair, however, the validity of any laws of the United
States or any State which exempt women from compulsory military
service." It was voted down.

<li> Women could not be sent into combat. Amendment 1066: "This
article shall not impair the validity, however, of any laws of
the United States or any State which exempt women from service
in combat units of the Armed Forces." It was voted down.

<li> Women, wives, and mothers would not lose certain privileges
that they have always needed. Amendment 1067: "This article
shall not impair the validity, however, of any laws of the
United States or any State which extend protections or
exemptions to women." And Amendment 1068: "This article shall
not impair the validity, however, of any laws of the United
States or any State which extend protections or exemptions to
wives, mothers, or widows." Both were voted down.

<li> Women would not lose child support. Amendment 1069: "This
article shall not impair the validity, however, of any laws of
the United States or any State which imposed upon fathers
responsibility for the support of their children." It was voted
down.

<li> Schools, seminaries, sports, toilet facilities, etc., could
continue to be segregated and have separate private facilities.
Amendment 1070: "This article shall not impair the validity,
however, of any laws of the United States or any State which
secure privacy to men or women, boys or girls." It was voted
down.

<li> Homosexuality would not be forced upon the nation as co-equal
legally with the traditional heterosexual family, in education,
etc. Amendment 1071: "This article shall not impair the
validity, however, of any laws of the United States or any
State which make punishable as crimes sexual offenses." It was
voted down.
</ul>

Since the Senate rejected all of these limitations, it was
logical to assume that they meant the ERA to allow or even direct
that these things happen. This was the beginning of the campaign
against the ERA.

<dt>But none of these suggested amendments mentioned abortion.

<dd>True, although, if the sexes were to be completely equal, then
what rights one sex had, the other should also have.<p>

1. Men could have sex and walk away non-pregnant. So, also, if a
woman had sex (and got pregnant) she should have the right to
also walk away non-pregnant. If she were "forced" to stay
pregnant that would be sexual discrimination.<p>

2. If surgical operations peculiar to the male sex (for example,
prostate surgery), were paid for with tax money, so also
should operations that were peculiar to the female sex (like
abortions), be paid for.<p>

But such a connection was still conjecture in those first years
after Congressional passage.

<dt>Were there other forceful arguments?

<dd>There were others, but two were of great importance and worth
noting here.<p>

Present Social Security laws give a homemaker benefits because of
what her husband earns. Under the ERA, she may also have to pay
social security taxes based upon the value of her contributed
work at home in order to obtain these later retirement benefits.
If homemaker wives are ever required to pay $1,000 or $2,000 a
year in Social Security taxes, many or most will have to leave
their homes to work.<p>

Another telling argument against the ERA was by Senator Sam
Erwin:<p>

<blockquote>
"The ERA will transfer from the states to the federal
government vast governmental powers which have been reserved
to the states throughout our history. By so doing, the
amendment will substantially thwart the purpose of the
Constitution to create 'an indestructible union composed of
indestructible states' and reduce the states in large measure
to powerless zeros on the nation's map."<br>
<font size=-2>Senator Sam Erwin in a
speech to the Nor. Car.
General Assembly, Mar. 1, 1977</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>Were there any referenda?

<dd>In November 1975, both New York State and New Jersey had
statewide referenda. Both decisively defeated their proposed
state ERAs. Other referenda (Wisconsin in 1973, Florida and
Nevada in 1978, and Iowa, in 1980), also rejected the ERA. In
November 1984, Maine defeated a proposed ERA in a referendum, 65
to 35, and in November 1986, Vermont did also.

<dt>Some states rescinded after ratifying earlier?

<dd>Yes. They were Nebraska, Tennessee, Kentucky, Idaho, and South
Dakota. The legality of their rescinding was challenged. A
Federal Court ruled the rescissions to be legal. This decision
was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled it moot (no
decision necessary), without commenting upon its merits after the
time limit for ratification had expired.<p>

On March 22, 1979, the seven-year limit for ratification expired.
Congress then extended the time limit for 30 more months. The
constitutionality of extension by a majority vote was questioned,
since a two-thirds vote had been needed to send it to the states
originally for ratification. Even with the extension, the ERA
expired in 1982 without any more states ratifying.

<dt>But the ERA was reintroduced.

<dd>Yes. In January 1983 the same wording was reintroduced in both
the House and the Senate. Hearings were again held.<p>

The prime sponsor of the newly resurrected ERA, Senator Paul
Tsongas, testified before Senator Orrin Hatch. "Would the ERA
lock the right to abortion and/or abortion funding into the
Constitution?" Senator Tsongas' answer: "That issue will be
decided in the courts."<br>
<font size=-2>U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on
the Constitution, Senate
Judiciary Committee, May 26, 1983</font><p>

To other questions on women-in-combat, private schools, veterans'
preference, insurance, homosexuality, etc., Senator Hatch
received the same answer. This revealed, in a dramatic and
devastating fashion, that the ERA would mean anything the Supreme
Court interpreted it to mean, a fact hardly reassuring to anyone
who held traditional values.<br>
<font size=-2>ibid. </font>

<dt>In the meantime, some states incorporated the ERA wording in their
State Constitutions?

<dd>Yes, and with these came new developments.<p>

Hawaii: In January 1978 Hawaii RTL asked its state court to stop
funding elective abortions. Two abortionists and the American
Civil Liberties Union intervened. They argued that that state's
ERA mandated the use of tax money to pay for elective abortions.
The judge ordered that abortions be paid for, but stated that he
had not ruled on the basis of the ERA/abortion issue.<br>
<font size=-2>Hawaii RTL vs. Chang, 1978</font><p>

Massachusetts: The Massachusetts Civil Liberties Union asked the
highest state court to rule that, "By singling out for special
treatment and effectively excluding from coverage an operation
which is unique to women, while including without comparable
limitation a wide range of other operations, including those
which are unique to men, the anti-funding statutes discriminates
on the basis of sex, in violation to the Massachusetts ERA."<p>

The judges ruled that taxes must pay for elective abortions
without commenting on the validity of the above argument.<br>
<font size=-2>Moe vs. King, Sept. 8, 1980</font><p>

Wisconsin: This state's General Assembly passed the ERA in 1982
but with a preamble which stated "that such an amendment shall
not limit in any way the legislature's power to enact legislation
prohibiting, regulating, or allowing abortions."<p>

In order to amend that state's Constitution, the General Assembly
must first pass the proposal on two successive sessions prior to
a referendum vote. The pro-abortion groups woke up, lobbied
heavily, and killed the entire ERA in the second session because
they could not remove the abortion neutralizing clause, which
they called "objectionable anti-civil libertarian language."<p>

Pennsylvania: The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in March
1984 ruled that Pennsylvania's ERA required Medicaid funding of
abortion-on-demand. The state law had forbidden the use of taxes
for elective abortions. Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and the
Women's Law Project had argued that this was "sex discrimination"
and was a violation of the Pennsylvania ERA. The Court stated
that the ERA

<blockquote>
". . . is meritorious and sufficient in and of itself to
invalidate the statutes before us in that these statutes do
unlawfully discriminate against women with respect to a
physical condition unique to women."<br>
<font size=-2>Fischer vs. Dept. of Public Welfare,
Commonwealth of PA, March 9, 1984</font>
</blockquote><p>

The decision was reversed by that state's elected Supreme Court.<p>

Connecticut: Its Medicaid program had paid for abortions only for
the life of the mother, rape, and incest. In April 1987, the
Superior Court ruled this to be unconstitutional under that
state's ERA.<p>

"Since only women become pregnant, discrimination against
pregnancy by not funding abortion . . . is sex-oriented
discrimination."

<dt>What position has Right to Life taken?

<dd>Back in the early 1970s, when the first ERA was introduced, the
National Right to Life Board did not take a firm position. All
members were for equal rights for women, and the abortion
connection was not completely clear. As the years passed, and the
evidence proving the ERA/abortion connection accumulated, the
Board (which is made up of elected representatives from each of
the 50 state RTL organizations), took a position of opposition,
unless the ERA were amended to render it abortion neutral.<p>

In addition to the above evidence, the final proof came from the
realization of what "strict scrutiny" and "unique physical
characteristics" would do. The U.S. Supreme Court had clarified
this.

<dt>Strict Scrutiny?

<dd>This was crucially important. In 1977 and in 1980, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of the Hyde
Amendment to the Labor HHS appropriation bill. It stated that
laws forbidding the use of tax funds for abortion were
constitutional. The court clearly stated that this was so because
they were not based on a "suspect classification" and thus, did
not trigger "strict scrutiny" by the courts.<br>
<font size=-2>Maher vs. Roe, U.S. Supreme
Court, 432 US 464, 1977<p>

Harris vs. McRae, U.S.
Supreme Court, 1980 at 23</font><p>

The ERA advocates have emphasized that the ERA's principal legal
effect would be to make sex a "suspect classification under the
Constitution."

<blockquote>
"The most important 'suspect classification' at present is
race. If sex discrimination were treated like race
discrimination, government refusal to fund abortions would be
treated like a refusal to fund medical procedures that affect
members of minority races, for example, sickle cell disease
which affects only black people."<br>
<font size=-2>H. Hyde, The ERA/Abortion Connection,
testimony before Constitution
Subcommittee, U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee, May 26, 1983</font></blockquote><p>

In the House hearing, strongly pro-abortion Congressman Don
Edwards stated that the ERA would impose such "strict scrutiny"
on "pregnancy classification."<br>
<font size=-2>Hearings, Judiciary Committee U.S.
House of Representatives, Nov. 9, 1983</font><p>

So did the Congressional Research Service's legal memo, which, in
1983, suggested that the imposition of "strict scrutiny" on
pregnancy classifications by the ERA would invalidate all funding
restrictions for abortions.

<dt>Unique Physical Characteristics?

<dd>"The U.S. Supreme Court has already created a parallel legal
doctrine under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which
prohibits sex discrimination in employment. An employer
violates Title VII if he treats an employee 'in a manner which 
but for that person's sex, would be different.'"<p>

"Under the ERA, this doctrine would be applied with
constitutional force in every aspect of the law. It would
invalidate not only restrictions on funding of abortion, but
also any other law that 'discriminates' against such a
'sex-specific' procedure."<p>

"This could include, for example, the 'conscience' laws
currently in effect in 44 states, which prevent penalization
of medical personnel and institutions for refusing to
participate in abortions. The doctrine could also jeopardize
the tax-exempt status of, for example, religiously affiliated
educational institutions that try to impede abortion-related
activities on their campuses."<p>

"Title VII does not require employers to provide abortion
'benefits,' simply because Congress attached to Title VII an
<i>explicit exception</i> for abortion. The same solution should be
applied to the ERA."<br>
<font size=-2>D. Johnson, "Proof of Abortion-ERA
Link Massive, Compelling," <i>Nat'l
Cath. Reporter,</i> July 6, 1984</font><p>

If the ERA had been in the Constitution, it is clear that the
Hyde Restriction and all of its counterparts would have been
judged unconstitutional.

<dt>What then?

<dd>When the 1983 ERA was introduced, National RTL asked Congress to
attach the following abortion neutralizing clause:<p>

"Nothing in this Article (the ERA) shall be construed to grant or
secure any right relating to abortion or the funding thereof."<p>

If this had been attached, the ERA would have easily passed by
the required two-thirds vote in the U.S. House of
Representatives. The radical feminist groups, however, would have
none of it. They demanded and got a vote on the unamended
original wording -- and lost by six votes on November 15, 1983.
Without question, the ERA was defeated on the horns of the
abortion issue.<p>

Since the ACLU's victory in the 1987 Connecticut case, the final
nail has probably been driven into the ERA coffin. By this new,
obvious and undeniable link to abortion, "the ACLU has erected a
political obstacle that backers of the amendment will find
insurmountable."<br>

<dl>
<dt>What is Right to Life's most important boycott?

<dd>The one against the Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company of Kalamazoo,
Michigan. It is of great importance, possibly equaled only by the
boycott of the March of Dimes.

<dt>Why the Upjohn Company?

<dd>A decade ago Upjohn held the original basic patents on a newly
discovered class of human hormones, the prostaglandins. These
held great promise for human betterment. Back then, Upjohn knew
that among other functions, different forms of these hormones
might (a) cure asthma, (b) cure many forms of rheumatism and
arthritis, (c) cure peptic ulcers, (d) cause the uterus to
contract and cause abortions, and (e) correct a congenital heart
problem. Their research funds and facilities would not permit a
full-scale effort to perfect all these forms at once.
Accordingly, they chose, in a fateful decision, to concentrate on
the one form whose only function was to kill.<p>

Upjohn spent tens of millions of dollars for research, and
finally perfected an intra-amniotic injectable form, Prostin f2a
and brought it to the market in 1973. At that time, the U.S. Food
&amp; Drug Administration approved it for only one use, "the
induction of mid-trimester abortions." Since then, two other
forms have been introduced, Prostin E2, as a vaginal suppository
and Prostin 15M, for intra-muscular injection. Since their
introduction, the last two drugs have been recognized as useful
in the treatment of several other obstetrically related
conditions.<p>

Some of the drug literature for doctors, in detailing its
abortion usage, listed as the first possible complication as
"live birth."

<dt>How does it work?

<dd>Prostaglandin causes powerful and sustained contractions of the
uterus (labor), at any stage of pregnancy, resulting in vaginal
delivery of whatever size baby the mother carries. In early
pregnancy, the drug always kills the baby. In mid pregnancy, the
baby is sometimes born alive -- a "complication."

<dt>Is the drug safe?

<dd>Well, certainly not for the baby! It may be safer at times for
the mother than the alternative of salt poisoning, but it is
still dangerous (see chapter 14).

<dt>How does the boycott work?

<dd>Small wallet cards are used to alert people to ask their doctors
or pharmacists if what they are purchasing is an Upjohn product.
If it is, they ask for a different company's brand because they
don't want to support "a death peddler." These cards are probably
available from your local Right to Life chapter. If not, you can
write to Cincinnati Right to Life.<p>

In 1985, Upjohn announced that it was closing its prostaglandin
research unit. In 1986, it said it would not market its new
do-it-yourself suppository. In 1987, it withdrew Prostin F2a from
the market.

<dt>What about the March of Dimes (MOD)?

<dd>For over a decade, every RTL chapter in the U.S. has endorsed
this boycott, and still many who are not informed, do not
understand the boycott.<p>

The MOD does a lot of good with well over 90% of their dollars.
But it tolerates "a little eugenic Auschwitz" on the side. For
all of the good that the MOD has done for our society, this evil
may, in balance, ultimately do far more harm.

<dt>What has the MOD done?

<dd>It was they who first funded and set up, all across the country,
genetic testing centers. They popularized amniocentesis in the
midtrimester (see chapter 26). This has become a search and
destroy mission and has taught a nation that the "answer" to an
unborn baby who is handicapped is to kill him or her before
birth.

<dt>The March of Dimes pays for abortions?

<dd>No, they do not. They pay for and facilitate only the search and
identify portion, and they stand back and do not protest the
almost inevitable (97-98%) killing that then occurs. Right to
Life has repeatedly asked them to stop doing midtrimester
amniocentesis (not late ones, which benefit both baby and
mother). Such testing has only one purpose: to identify the
child's condition. There is no medical problem identifiable in
the midtrimester that is treatable in the midtrimester.

<dt>But the MOD speaks of two treatable conditions!

<dd>The ones that they speak of, both Methylmalonic Acidemia and
Biotin deficiency, can be discovered in mid pregnancy. Neither,
however, is treatable until later in the third trimester. The
testing is not necessary in the midtrimester -- unless you want
to kill the babies before they get too old.

<dt>The MOD argues that by identifying "normals," they often save
babies who would otherwise be aborted!

<dd>An analogy would have been a testing center outside Auschwitz
where suspected Jews would be taken. Some would be found to be
"normal" Aryans and their lives would be spared. Of course, the
Jews would be gassed. Would you contribute money to such a
testing center?

<dt>And so the boycott?

<dd>Yes. Right to Life suggests that all pro-life people withhold
contributions from the MOD until it ceases to be a part of this
eugenic death selection process.

<dt>You've also boycotted Avon Cosmetics?

<dd>Yes, and successfully. They had given funds to several radical,
pro-abortion feminist groups who were pushing abortion. They
quit, and RTL called off the boycott.

<dt>What about the Procter and Gamble and Kellogg boycotts?

<dd>Both corporations had given funds to Planned Parenthood. Both
quit. We thanked both of them and again buy their products.

<dt>How about the United Appeals?

<dd>A number of major metropolitan United Appeals have been boycotted
for including Planned Parenthood among their beneficiaries. These
boycotts have been successful in Toronto, Tulsa, Calgary, Berks
Co., PA, and other places where Planned Parenthood was
subsequently excluded. In some cities after a boycott, Planned
Parenthood voluntarily withdrew from that United Appeal, as
happened in Chicago, Seattle, Spokane, and other cities.<p>

There is still work to do here. One well-publicized target city
is Akron, OH. If major religious groups such as the Catholic
Diocese and others were to withdraw from the United Appeal,
almost certainly that United Appeal would stop funding Planned
Parenthood.<p>

How about the UA in your city? Best you find out.

<i>Since They Can't Close Them,
They Burn Them Down.</i><p>

To hear Planned Parenthood officials, abortion profiteer, William
Baird, or abortion chamber proprietors talk, the above is the
thinly veiled policy of Right to Lifers.<p>

<dl>
<dt>Well, isn't this correct?

<dd>Absolutely not. There has not been a single instance of arson or
violence against an abortion chamber that has been proven to be
planned or carried out by a Right to Life group.

<dt>Never? Not even one?

<dd>No, not one. This is remarkable when we know that there are
literally millions of outraged citizens who feel frustrated and
helpless before an all-powerful federal judiciary.

<dt>Our founding fathers, our frontiersmen took matters into their own
hands. Why don't you?

<dd>Because we are nonviolent, peaceful people. Has unjust and
oppressive violence ever really been stopped by more violence?
Will the misguided and often, hardened hearts of pro-abortion
people be changed or softened by retaliating against their
violence with our own violence?

<dt>Abortion is violence?

<dd>Precisely. The violence is occurring inside the doors of the
abortion chambers. Killing of innocent babies is the ultimate
violence, and it occurs 4,000 times every day in the United
States.

<dt>Who throws the fire bombs then?

<dd>We believe several have been set by the owners to get insurance
after picketers had ruined their businesses.<p>

One incident was caused by a man judged to be insane. Another was
by a husband who went berserk in the abortion chamber after his
wife had "killed my baby." Others were by a "religious" group
(Army of God).<p>

We could also imagine the parents of a minor daughter (who they
never even dreamed was pregnant) being called to the intensive
care unit of a hospital to find her in critical condition caused
by complications from an abortion -- an abortion that was legally
done without their knowledge or consent. Their beloved daughter,
now injured physically and emotionally for life! Can't you
imagine that father blindly seeking vengeance against those who
did it?<p>

Three fire bombings in Everett, Washington, led to the
incarceration of a man who was not a RTL member. Others in
Pensacola were charged to four young people who were motivated by
religious reasons.

<dt>What was the Army of God?

<dd>Three men arrested, convicted, and sent to jail have stated that
they made up the name and are its only members.

<dt>Right to Lifers will never use violence?

<dd>We hope not. To adopt pro-abortionists' twisted ethic would be to
endorse it.

<dt>What about those who picket these places?

<dd>They are heroes and heroines. They volunteer their time. They
walk in the rain and snow. They endure insults and sometimes
assault from the guards that the abortion proprietors hire, and
they take it -- all in hope of saving one tiny life, in the hope
of preventing the physical and psychic damage to one woman.

<dt>Do they save lives?

<dd>Yes, they do, and that is their reward. They sidewalk counsel and
picket peacefully. When a woman goes through their line to enter,
they will offer her literature and help. In a quiet voice, they
will say, "Please don't kill your baby. We'll help you in any way
you need. Won't you let us?"

<dt>But I've heard that the picketers threaten and sometimes physically
abuse the women.

<dd><i>Never!</i> In fact, it is the abortion chamber people who frequently
do such things. Pro-life picketers have been spit on, pushed,
cursed, threatened, ridiculed, hit, etc. All they do is turn the
other cheek.<p>

The only unwise thing that we've heard occasionally has been
shouting by picketers. This is unwise and probably hasn't saved
many babies.

<dt>But this picketing does upset some women who have their minds
firmly made up. Is that good?

<dd>If these women had truly been informed of the full facts of fetal
development, of the hazards of induced abortion, and of all the
alternatives, there would be no need for picketing. Furthermore,
a woman at peace with her choice for an abortion would not be
upset by pickets, pictures of babies, and attempted counseling.

<dt>Do you mean the picketers give information the women wouldn't get
otherwise?

<dd>Yes. A good example is the fact that a heartbeat can be heard
seven or eight weeks after conception on an office ultrasonic
stethoscope. Is this an important bit of information? Should a
pregnant mother know it?<p>

In a series of 327 women at the University of Szeged, Hungary,
mothers who wanted abortions were allowed to listen to the "fetal
heartbeat." After hearing it, 16% refused abortion.<br>
<font size=-2>F. Sontag, Third Internat'l Congress of
Psychosomatic Medicine, <i>OB &amp; GYN,</i> London, 1971</font><p>

Ask any abortionist, ask any Planned Parenthood official why they
<i>never</i> tell women there is a heartbeat, and why they would <i>never</i>
dare to let her listen.

<dt>How can the violence be stopped?

<dd>The fastest way would be to stop the far more ghastly fatal
violence inside their doors. If it were stopped, there would
certainly be no more violence outside. As long as the violence
against babies continues, while we are saddened to so state, we
doubt it is possible that all of the violence against bricks
(empty abortion chambers) will never stop.

<dt>What about Operation Rescue?

<dd>This is a new movement organized separately from the Right to
Life groups. It patterns itself after the civil rights movement
in America in the 1950s and '60s. It sponsors non-violent,
peaceful blockades and sit-ins in abortion kill centers. These
groups deliberately break the law by trespassing, get arrested
and then pledge the "defense of necessity"; i.e., they disobeyed
the minor law against trespassing in order to achieve a higher
good, that of saving lives.<p>

This movement has grown very large and has spread to many other
nations.</dl>

<dt>Local

<dd>The basic "cell" of the Right to Life movement is the Right to
Life chapter in your local area. This may be in a town, small
city, a county, or part of a large metropolitan area. It is
pluralistic, being made up of all types of people. It should not
be affiliated with a specific church or with a political party.
Its function is largely educational, but it must also be active
in lobbying. It should also give public witness in parades,
picketing, etc. During pre-election times, its members put on
another hat and become active in the local Right to Life
Political Action Committee. You probably can find your nearest
chapter under R in the phone book, since most cells are called
"Right to Life of . . ." If it is not listed there, write to
National RTL for details. If none exists in your community, help
start one. Your prime responsibility for personal involvement and
financial support lies here and with your local service group
which helps pregnant women.

<dt>State

<dd>In almost all states there is one central RTL organization (a
very few states have coexisting similar groups). Local chapters
usually elect regional delegates, who comprise the board of the
state RTL organization. Usually based in the state capital, its
prime function is lobbying the state legislature and helping to
start and support local chapters. It also educates, holds an
annual state convention, and sees to the necessary administrative
needs of a statewide group. Its board elects a delegate to
represent it on the board of National Right to Life.<p>

It should have a functional, internal, educational foundation and
a similar internal statewide Political Action Committee.

<dt>National Single Interest Groups

<dd>The central national organization, the National Right to Life
Committee, has a governing board of 54 members, one elected by
each state RTL organization and the District of Columbia, and
three at-large members elected by the general membership. It is
made up of the 50 state RTL Organizations, which are made up of
the over 2,500 functional local RTL chapters in the U.S. It has
a central (Washington, DC) office and three satellite offices.
Because of its structure, its policies closely reflect the
thinking and wishes of grass roots pro-lifers nationwide.<p>

It publishes the <i>National Right to Life News.</i> It maintains the
movement's largest lobbying staff in Washington. It has a
national Political Action Committee. Its internal Trust Fund and
its Horatio Storer Foundation are educational. Its convention is
the major national meeting of the year for the movement. It has
multiple other departments to service the movement. The address:
National Right to Life Committee, 419 7th St., NW, Suite 500,
Washington, DC, 20004 (Phone: 202-626-8800)

<dt>Are there other organizations which are also single issue?

<dd>There are other independent groups, not a part of the pyramidal
membership group above, which make substantial contributions to
the pro-life movement. Some of these publish; some are
educational foundations; some are church-related; some are
political action groups. One does legal research and legal
defense. Some are Washington-based and have large mailing lists;
others are headquartered in other cities. A few of these are
single issue; others pursue multi-issues. Some of them include:<p>

Horatio R. Storer Foundation: A subsidiary corporation of
National Right to Life, it is educational in thrust. It publishes
a national professional journal, <i>Issues In Law and Medicine,</i>
sponsors major seminars, publishes books, is in legal action,
etc.<p>

Collegians for Life and Teens for Life are very important youth
groups.<p>

March for Life: Its main activity is to put on the large, annual
January 22 March for Life in Washington. It also has a lobbyist
in Washington.<p>

Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life: Maintains a lobbyist in
Washington and publishes <i>Lifeletter</i> and the quarterly, <i>Human Life
Review.</i><p>

National Committee for a Human Life Amendment: Its primary
emphases are lobbying for a Human Life Amendment, lobbying
against funding for abortion and also, grass roots development.
Its Washington office coordinates its nationwide Congressional
District Action Committee (CDAC) groups. It works primarily in
the Catholic community.<p>

Action for Life: Based in Chicago, this group reports on and
stimulates picketing and other nonviolent direct action outside
abortion chambers.<p>

American Victims of Abortion: A national coordinating group that
brings together Open Arms, Rachel, Women Exploited by Abortion,
and other groups.<p>

Feminists for Life: A group of dedicated feminists who strongly
believe in equal rights for all women, born and unborn.

<dt>Professional Groups

<dd>The American Academy of Medical Ethics is the largest, but there
also are the National Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, Pediatricians for Life, Nurses for Life, and the
World Federation of Doctors Who Respect Life, as well as
Scientists for Life, Doctors for Life, Public Health Workers for
Life, Pharmacists for Life, Veterinarians for Life, and others.

<dt>National Political Action Committees

<dd>National Right to Life PAC: This is the largest PAC. It works
with candidates in every state, both Democrat and Republican. Its
less than 5% fund raising overhead is by far the lowest of any
RTL PAC. It works closely with the state RTL PACs.<p>

Committee for a Pro-Life Congress: This is unique in that, rather
than only giving money directly to campaigns and candidates, it
operates as a planning and strategy group. It operates nationally 
and has been very effective.<p>

National Pro-Life PAC: This is the oldest PAC. It tends toward
independent expenditures and operates nationally, but on a small
scale.<p>

Life Amendment PAC: In 1982, it concentrated heavily on only one
political race. Essentially non-functional since that time.

<dt>Legal Defense

<dd>National Right to Life's legal department has been a major part
of this effort. Other active groups are the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights, the Rutherford Institute, and
Americans United for Life.<p>

State Right to Life groups and Local Right to Life groups have
commonly carried the major part of the responsibility for state
and local legal actions.

<dt>Multi-Issue Pro-Life Groups

<dd>Women's Groups: Eagle Forum, Concerned Women of America, and many
others have the pro-life issue as a high priority.<p>

Pro-Family Conservative Groups: American Life League has pro-life
as its foremost issue. It publishes All About Issues. It has a
large nationwide mailing list.<p>

Liberal Political Groups: Pro-Lifers for Survival, National
Pro-Life Democrats, Feminists for Life and Democrats for Life.<p>

Conservative Political Groups: Committee for the Survival of a
Free Congress, Conservative Caucus, Heritage Foundation,
Republican Pro-Life Impact Committee, and others.

<dt>Religiously Motivated Groups

<dd>These groups are growing and increasing in numbers. Most marked
recently are Evangelical and Fundamentalist Christian related
groups. An older bellwether was the Knights of Columbus. Some,
such as Moral Majority, U.S. Catholic Conference, and National
Association of Evangelicals are very large and influential. One
smaller group, the Christian Action Council, has moved from being
largely a lobbying presence in Washington to stimulating the
development of a large number of crisis pregnancy centers
nationally.

<dt>International Groups

<dd>The International Right to Life Federation, is the only single
issue RTL group with a central office (in Lausanne, Switzerland),
an elected board, and broad multinational, international
representation. It can be contacted at or through your own
national group.<p>

There are other multi-issue and church, or church-related groups
as well as caring and medical professional groups.

<dt>Planned Parenthood

<dd>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America is one of 90
national affiliates of the International Planned Parenthood
Federation (London). It gets about two-thirds of its financing
through tax money, local, state, and national. It has five
regional offices, 177 statewide affiliates, 51 abortion
facilities, and 729 local clinics in the U.S. Its total annual
cash flow is estimated to be close to one-half billion dollars.
It concentrates its efforts on abortion, contraception, and sex
education.

<dt>What is Planned Parenthood's position on abortion?

<dd>In its early years of existence, Planned Parenthood limited
itself to contraception and specifically opposed abortion. The
following is a quote from an official Planned Parenthood
pamphlet:

<blockquote>
"Is birth control an abortion?"<p>

"Definitely not. An abortion kills the life of a baby after it
has begun. It is dangerous to your life and health. It may
make you sterile so that when you want a child you cannot have
it. Birth control merely postpones the beginning of life."<br>
<font size=-2>Planned Parenthood, Aug. 1963</font><p>

The Planned Parenthood pamphlet is available from Cincinnati
Right to Life, P.O. Box 24073, Cinn., OH 45224, $3. pp.
</blockquote>

<dt>But Planned Parenthood does abortions now?

<dd>Yes. It is the largest unborn baby killing conglomerate in
America. In their 51 abortion centers, they killed 111,189
preborn babies in the last reported year.<br>
<font size=-2>Planned Parenthood of America,
1989 Service Report, p.10</font>

<dt>Doesn't Planned Parenthood concentrate mostly on contraception?

<dd>In its earlier years, to a much larger extent, Planned Parenthood
clinics offered contraceptive advice and aid to married women so
that they could more responsibly plan their families. Because of
this, it generated widespread support from many areas of our
society.<p>

Those days are gone. Today its clientele consists largely of
unmarried teenagers. It dispenses medically hazardous drugs (the
pill) and devices (the I.U.D.) without parental knowledge or
consent. It is the largest provider of abortions in America,
again, to teenagers without parental knowledge or consent. It
aggressively promotes sex education that, rather than reducing
promiscuity, premarital sex, illegitimate pregnancies, abortion,
and venereal disease, has almost certainly had just the opposite
effect.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Ford &amp; M. Schwartz, "Birth Control
for Teenagers: Diagram for Disaster,"
<i>Linacre Quarterly,</i> Feb. 1979, pp. 71-811<p>

A. Jurs, "Planned Parenthood Advocates
Permissive Sex," <i>Christianity Today,</i> Sept. 2, 1982</font><p>

In its Five Year Plan, it openly stated: <u>Our mission is to serve
as the nation's foremost agent of social change in the area of
reproductive health and well being</u> [emphasis theirs].<br>
<font size=-2>Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, <i>A Five Year Plan,</i> 1976-1980, p. 5</font>

<dt>But all Planned Parenthood affiliates don't agree with abortions or
support the ones who do.

<dd>Some may not privately agree, but they must do so as a
requirement to be affiliated with and to use the Planned
Parenthood name. (See Planned Parenthood standards of affiliation
article IX, Sect. 1a, 1c, Sect. 2b, Sect. 3c, and Sect. 4a.) They
must support the National Federation (Sect. 4d). Failure to do so
can result in their disaffiliation (Sect. 7).

<dt>That is hard to believe. I've heard that Planned Parenthood is
pro-family, pro-life, and pro-child.

<dd>Their paid TV commercials say that, but their own official
documents, their leaders, and their actions say quite the
opposite.<p>

In 1976, the Planned Parenthood's Five Year Plan (see reference
above) laid out in detail what their goals were. We quote:

<ul type=disc>
<li> Objective #2: "Reaffirming and protecting the legitimacy of
induced abortion as a necessary back-up to contraceptive
failure, and extending safe, dignified services to women who
seek them."

<li>Purpose: "To provide leadership in making . . . abortion and
sterilization available and fully accessible to all."
</ul>

"The various activities that we undertake are not 'separate'
and certainly not competing. Rather, they are all complementary
parts of a single national strategy" (page 5).<p>

"Services to be made available at <i>all</i> clinics include . . .
<i>abortion services (or local referral)</i>" (emphasis in original,
page 6).<p>

Program Emphasis #2: "Keeping abortions legal and accessible to
all persons" (page 9).

<dt>Is their emphasis still on abortion?

<dd>Since the Five Year Plan above, the Planned Parenthood agenda is
even more openly and militantly pro-abortion as outlined in their
newest action agenda. For example, in Goal $no3, they state that
Planned Parenthood will "increase the number of Planned
Parenthood affiliates providing early ambulatory abortion
services."<br>
<font size=-2>Planned Parenthood of America, <i>Til
Victory is Won,</i> 1982, 1984, p. 16</font>

"To increase the availability and accessibility of high quality
and affordable reproductive health care services [abortion]."<br>
<font size=-2>PPFA Five Year Plan 1986-1990, preamble</font><p>

"Until we reach the millennium . . . Planned Parenthood will
continue to provide not only sex education and contraception,
but also abortion."<br>
<font size=-2>A. Moran, Exec. V.P., Planned Parenthood of
New York City, <i>New York Times</i>, Dec. 27, 1982</font><p>

[Planned Parenthood] is not just a social or medical service
agency. It is part of a cause, a movement. One of the principles
of Planned Parenthood is that reproductive freedom is
indivisible. You either have it or not. Everybody has it or none
has it."<br>
<font size=-2>Don Weintraub, V.P. for Int'l Affairs,
PPFA, Madison, Mar. 12, 1985</font><p>

On the 10th Anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court Decision
(January 22, 1983), the central news event was a debate arranged
by the National Press Club in Washington, DC, that was seen or
heard by over 100 million people. To represent the pro-life side,
they chose one of your authors, Dr. J. C. Willke, then President
of National Right to Life. To represent the pro-abortion side,
they chose Ms. Faye Waddleton, President of Planned Parenthood.
Each represented the leading force on the two sides of this
national struggle.<p>

An audio tape of this debate is available from Cincinnati Right
to Life, P.O. Box 24073, Cinn., OH 45224, $1. pp.<p>

In April 1978 Planned Parenthood circulated a "bigot-pack" of
cartoons smearing Roman Catholics. One of the cartoons showed a
Catholic bishop holding a can of gasoline and a book of matches;
the caption said, "Now we're losing the flock on the subject of
abortion -- but we're not worried . . . We've got the faithful
out burning down the clinics."<p>

Copies of these cartoons may be ordered for $1. from Friends for
Life, 180 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60601.<p>

Family Planning Association should not use the absence of law or
the existence of an unfavorable law as an excuse for inaction.
Action outside the law, and even in violation of it, is part of
the process of stimulating change . . . of fertility regulation
services or specific methods."<br>
<font size=-2>Art. 106, p. 28, Int. P.P. Fed., Nov. 1983</font><p>

Planned Parenthood has promoted a pro-abortion "comic book,"
geared for teenagers, entitled <i>Abortion Eve</i>. On the back cover is
a caricature of the "Assumption of the Blessed Virgin" depicting
a pregnant Mary with the idiot face of <i>Mad</i> magazine's Alfred E.
Neumann. The caption says, "What, me worry?"<p>

It is the policy of Planned Parenthood to insure that women have
the right to seek and obtain safe legal abortions. Planned
Parenthood has the responsibility to provide access to
high-quality abortion services. . . .<br>
<font size=-2>Federation Policies, PPFA, Jan. 1986</font><p>

Faye Wattleton, Pres. of P.P., has said, "I make it very clear.
If you're not clear where you stand on the abortion issue, if
you're worried that birth control for teenagers encourages
promiscuity . . . this [P.P] is not the kind of outfit you're
comfortable with."<br>
<font size=-2>"The Faye Wattleton Comeback," P.
Span, <i>Wash. Post,</i> Oct. 14, 1987</font>

<dt>What does Planned Parenthood think of Right to Life?

<dd>They have an opinion.

<blockquote>
"In every generation there exists a group of people so filled
with bigotry and self-righteousness that they will resort to
any means -- even violence -- to impose their views on
society. Today, such fanatics dominate a movement ironically
called 'the Right-to-Life,' a movement which threatens the
most basic of all human rights."<br>
<font size=-2>Planned Parenthood Pamphlet, the Justice
Fund, 810 7th Ave., New York, NY, 10019</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>But Margaret Sanger, its founder, opposed abortion.

<dd>Not so! Not only did she favor abortion, but she proposed forced
sterilization for those whom she considered unfit to reproduce.
She worked hard for a "race of thoroughbreds" until Hitler's
similar "Master Race" made that goal unpopular. She was a true
eugenist. For example, her April 1933 <i>Birth Control Review,</i>
devoted an entire edition to eugenic sterilization.

<dt>Who did she consider unfit?

<dd>Black people, Jews, Southern European immigrants (especially
Italians), but also others of "low I.Q." These "feebleminded"
people were a "menace to the race."<br>
<font size=-2>E. Drogin, <i>Margaret Sanger: Father
of Modern Society,</i> CUL Publishers,
1980, Section 1, p. 18-24</font><p>

Let us quote from her "Plan for Peace," which was little more
than peaceful genocide. She wanted the United States:

<ul type=disc>
<li> "To keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of
certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to
the stamina of the race, such as the feebleminded as determined
by Stanford-Binet I.Q. tests.

<li> "To apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and
segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is
already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that
objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.

<li> "To insure the country against future burdens of maintenance
for numerous offspring as may be born of feebleminded parents
by pensioning all persons with transmissible diseases who
voluntarily consent to sterilization.

<li> "To give dysgenic groups in our population their choice of
segregation or sterilization.

<li> "To apportion farm lands and homesteads for these segregated
persons where they would be taught to work under competent
instructors for a period of their entire lives. [Practically
speaking, a concentration camp.]

<li> "[To] take an inventory of the secondary group such as
illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes,
dope fiends; classify them in special departments under
government medical protection, and segregate them on farms and
open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and
development of moral conduct." (Again, concentration camps.)<br>
<font size=-2>M. Sanger, "Plan for Peace," <i>Birth
Control Review,</i> vol. 16, no. 4, April 1932</font>
</ul>

<dt>NARAL
<dd>Originally, the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion
Laws, this group was a prime mover in getting the first abortion-
on-demand law in New York passed.<p>

Since abortion legalization, and now entitled The National
Abortion Right Action League, it has been a major force opposing
the Right to Life movement.

<dt>ACLU

<dd>The American Civil Liberties Union has been consistently
selective as to whose civil liberties it protects. Totally blind
to the existence of the preborn baby, it has served as the legal
defense arm of the pro-abortion, anti-family movement.<p>

An offshoot of the ACLU, the John Madison Institute for
Constitutional Law is a small but sharply focused pro-abortion
legal group.

<dt>N.O.W.

<dd>The National Organization for Women is a national group of
radical anti-life feminists heavily influenced by the militant
lesbian faction of its membership. While claiming to seek
economic and employment equality for women, seven of its eight
resolutions at a national conference clearly show it to be
primarily radically feminist.<p>

Its two major goals are Reproductive Rights (i.e., abortion
rights) and Lesbian Rights.<br>
<font size=-2><i>Nat'l NOW Times,</i> July 1987</font><p>

It claims to represent the women of the U.S., but a national poll
demonstrated that most women don't see it as representing them.

<blockquote>
"Only 28% of women said they thought groups such as N.O.W. and
National Women's Political Caucus speak for a majority of
American women, while 56% said that these groups represent a
'small minority.'"<br>
<font size=-2>Poll, <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> Sept. 2, 1983</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights

<dd>This is a collection of clergy and 'religious' groups who are
pro-abortion. Probably its best known sub-group is the very small
(but very vocal), militantly pro-abortion Catholics for a Free
Choice, which is largely made up of former Catholics.

<dt>YWCA

<dd>The Young Women's Christian Association was captured two decades
ago by a group of radical anti-life feminists. Its policies today
are aggressively pro-abortion. For example, in 1973, its 26th
National Convention voted "to support efforts to provide safe
abortions to all women who desire them." In 1989, it restated its
1985 policy of support for "Repeal of all laws, restricting or
prohibiting abortions . . ."<br>
<font size=-2>YWCA Position on Abortion Rights</font>

<dt>National Education Association

<dd>Sadly, this once fine trade organization of teachers is solidly
in the grip of national leadership that is dedicated to the
pro-abortion cause. To give but one example of its
short-sightedness: In the city of Tulsa, every week, three
classrooms of future students are killed in their mothers' wombs.

<dt>American Association of University Women

<dd>In June 1977, AAUW's Biennial Convention voted as a priority
issue the "Right to Choose."

<dt>National Women's Political Caucus

<dd>"From its beginning, it has been pro choice. On the issue of
reproductive freedom, including abortion, the Caucus remains
single-minded and strong."<br>
<font size=-2>D. Broder, <i>Wash. Post</i>, A-23, Aug. 26, 1987</font>

<dt>League of Women Voters

<dd>At its 1982 National Convention, on a 753 to 472 vote, it stated
that "the LWV of the U.S. believes that public policy in a
pluralistic society must affirm the constitutional right of
privacy of the individual to make reproductive choices."
(Ninety-two percent of their chapters agreed).

<dt>National Abortion Federation

<dd>This is the trade association for operators of abortion chambers.

<dt>Network

<dd>A group of Roman Catholic nuns who have defied their church's
teachings and adopted a permissive attitude toward abortion.

<dt>International Planned Parenthood, Pathfinder Fund, and United
Nations Fund for Population Activity

<dd>In the past, all three of these organizations were heavily funded
by the U.S. State Department through its Agency for International
Development. All three have actively promoted and subsidized
abortion in Third World countries. In 1984, President Reagan
completed cutting off all funding for the first two unless they
completely discontinued their involvement in and promotion of the
overseas abortion business. In 1985, the U.S. Congress also cut
off funds for the UNFPA under the same conditions because of its
support for the genocidal Chinese abortion program.<p>

It Stated: "The Congress strongly condemns the continued
violations of human rights by the Government of the People's
Republic of China, including the one-child-per-family policy
adopted in 1979 that relies on coercion, economic penalties, and
forced abortions (often late in pregnancy) as a means of
enforcing compliance . . . [and] the use of forced abortions and
involuntary sterilizations of Tibetans by Chinese authorities in
Tibet." It also linked Red China's policies to "the declaration
made at the Nuremberg War Crimes trials that forced abortion is
to be regarded as a 'crime against humanity.' "

<dt>People for the American Way

<dd>This heavily funded group has carried on an effective
pro-abortion campaign in the national media under the leadership
of Norman Lear.

<dt>Clergy Counseling Service

<dd>Prior to national legalization of abortion, this small group of
Protestant clergy actively recruited women and helped them travel
to states where legal abortions could be obtained.

<i>Alternatives to Abortion;
Caring Groups</i><p>

This book deals primarily with the half of the pro-life movement
called Right to Life. The other half, the service effort, is
devoted to helping pregnant women and offering them alternatives
to abortion. There is also a growing network of helping groups
for women suffering from the aftermath of abortion as well as a
rapidly expanding number of maternity homes.

<dl>
<dt>Alternative to Abortion and Birthright Groups

<dd>These traditional type groups number over 3,000 organizations in
North America. Made up of volunteers (usually women), these
groups stand ready to offer to the troubled pregnant woman
whatever help she needs to continue her pregnancy. This can
include medical care, legal or spiritual help, a job, a home,
counseling, etc. They also provide help in placing the baby for
adoption. If she keeps her baby, they will find her a crib and
baby clothes if she needs them. The women who come to these
groups usually do so seeking a second opinion other than the
pro-abortion advice they have received.<p>

These groups have saved the lives of tens of thousands of babies
and have prevented untold psychic and physical problems in women
who have been saved from being the abortionist's second victim.<p>

For a directory of these groups, write to Alternatives to
Abortion International, 1213-1/2 S. James Road, Columbus, OH
43227, 614-239-9433 ($6 per copy).

<dt>Pregnancy Problem Centers

<dd>These are commonly storefront operations. Also entirely volunteer
and not under any church auspices, they offer free pregnancy
tests. While the woman waits, she is told and shown about
pregnancy, fetal development, and abortion, and is offered
alternatives.<p>

The women who come usually have already decided to have an
abortion, and many come to these centers for an abortion. After
being fully informed, however, approximately 80% change their
minds and carry their baby to term and deliver.<p>

These centers have offered consistent and dramatic evidence to
prove that the typical abortion chamber does not tell women the
facts of fetal development, of the reality of abortion, or of the
availability of alternatives. The ultimate impact of Problem
Pregnancy Centers has only begun to have been felt.

<dt>Crisis Pregnancy Centers

<dd>Similar to the Problem Pregnancy Centers, these differ in that
they are usually set up by and through a Christian church. They
do counsel mothers, however, of any or no faith. These centers
are being rapidly set up throughout the U.S. and Canada.<p>

When these newer helping centers, plus other church and civic
groups are added to the traditional Birthright-type centers,
there may soon be approximately 4,000 such groups in operation in
the U.S.A.

<dt>Maternity homes and mom houses

<dd>In the years immediately following the Supreme Court Decision on
abortion in America, and after the passage of pro-abortion laws
in other nations, many homes for unwed mothers closed their
doors.<p>

A rapidly developing and new phenomenon all over the country is
the reopening and re-establishment of new maternity homes. Also,
mom houses are becoming common. These are residences where a
woman can go after delivery, with or without her baby. She'll
live there until she can get her life in order, get a job,
apartment, etc., and go out on her own.

<dt>American Victims of Abortion (AVA)

<dd>This is the communication center, the public relations, and
lobbying office for women who have been victimized by abortion.
Across the U.S. and Canada, in the mid and late 1980s, such
groups began to spontaneously spring up. Women Exploited by
Abortion, Open Arms, Rachael, PACE, and others are made up of
women who've had abortions and now want to help others who are
hurting. For information, write to American Victims of Abortion,
419 7th Street, N.S., Suite 500, Wash. DC 20004.

<dt>I've Heard That Right To Lifers are only Fetus Lovers!

<dd>In fact, there are more volunteer centers in the U.S. to help the
pregnant woman before and after delivery than there are RTL
offices to protect the babies -- (over 3,000 compared to less
than 3,000).<p>

Furthermore, RTL people are involved, on the average, in far more
helping projects than either the pro-abortionists or the
population at large. As an example, a poll was taken at a state
RTL convention. Two hundred and forty-two attenders were asked
what helping activities they were involved in other than

<dl>
<dt>What percent of unmarried mothers place their babies for adoption?

<dd>Over 90% keep their babies. This is a sharp reversal from two
decades ago when the ratio, at least among white mothers in some
areas, was almost the reverse.

<dt>How long is the wait to adopt a baby?

<dd>For newborn white babies, it varies from three to five years to
forever. For "special needs" babies and children, it varies from
quick to never.

<dt>Are there studies claiming that adopted children have more problems
than biological children?

<dd>This has been thoroughly debunked by MarQuis and Detweiler in the
<i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.</i> On seven separate
measures, adopted persons rated their parents as superior as
compared to their non-adopted peers.

<blockquote>
"There is not a shred of evidence that indicates any of the
previously reported negative characteristics of dependency,
fearfulness, tenseness, hostility, loneliness, insecurity,
abnormality, inferiority, poor self-image, or lack of
confidence."
</blockquote>

If different, the adopted are more positive and better adjusted.<br>
<font size=-2>Marquis &amp; Detweiler, J. Personality
and Social Psychology, abstract in
Nat'l Adoption Report May 1985.</font>

<dt>What are "special needs?"

<dd>These are babies with medical problems; those who were neglected,
abused, or disabled; and those over six years old, frequently of
minority or mixed racial background.

<dt>People don't want them?

<dd>Well, not really. The problems are complex. Let's mention a few.
<ul type=disc>
<li> The physically or mentally handicapped child who was (unwisely)
not placed for adoption as a newborn is much harder to place
now that she is older. This is a tragedy because "Many
prospective adoptive parents will accept children [referring to
infants] if informed frankly about possible health defects,
often even when definite abnormalities have been found."<br>
<font size=-2>S. Wolff, <i>Archives of Disabled
Children,</i> 1974, pp. 49-165</font>

<li> In some areas, minority race babies are another such group.

<li> One other reason is that many single mothers will not legally
relinquish them, even though they cannot care for these
children themselves. After several years and a succession of
foster homes, the child is sometimes emotionally unstable. If
the mother then finally does legally release him, he is hard to
place.
</ul>

<dt>What of minority race babies?
<dd>Actually, there are enough couples wanting these babies, but,
sadly, they sometimes aren't adopted. Reasons include
unwillingness of the natural mother to release the child,
unrealistically high standard for minority parents to meet in
order to qualify, and unwillingness of agencies to allow white
parents to adopt them.<br>
<font size=-2>E. Lee, "White Couples' Obstacles
to Adopt Nonwhites," <i>Wall Street
Journal,</i> Feb. 27, 1987</font>

<dt>Unwilling?

<dd>If a baby is placed for adoption at birth, the social agency gets
X number of dollars. For every child in foster care for a year,
the agency gets 3X or 4X dollars. The charge has been made that
minority race babies are not being placed at birth because the
agency needs the additional money it gets for foster care.

<blockquote>
"The system has evolved into an industry with perverse
incentives for social agencies to maintain children in the
system because of the increased revenue. Some 70% of the money
for foster care is spent for administrative overhead and
services. What we have done, according to the National Council
of Family and Juvenile Court judges is 'replace parental
neglect with governmental neglect.'"<br>
<font size=-2>R. Woodson, "Bureaucratic Barriers
to Black Adoption," <i>Wall Street
Journal,</i> June 26, 1984, p. 34</font><p>
</blockquote>

Over half of the 36,000 available, but unadopted, children in the
U.S. are black and over age five.
<br>
<font size=-2>E. Lee, "White Couples' Obstacles
to Adopt Nonwhites," <i>Wall Street
Journal,</i> Feb. 27, 1987</font>

<dt>How do transracial adoptions fare?

<dd>"Transracial adoption has been successful," say Drs. Simon and
Alsteen. "On any variable, we can discuss about quality of family
life, it is no different with these kids" . . . "they'll probably
marry non-white, but live in a racially-mixed neighborhood."<br>
<font size=-2>"Identity and Committment, Transracial
Adoptees and Their Families," <i>Praeger
Pub.,</i> 1986, from Nat'l Adoption Report, May 1987</font>

<dt>Isn't foster care good? I know some super people who take these
kids and they really try.

<dd>You're right. Most foster care is certainly better than either
institutional care or some of the inadequate homes they come
from, and we warmly thank those generous people who offer their
foster-love to these children.<p>

<i>But</i> -- and a big but -- it is nowhere near as good as one pair of
loving adoptive parents from birth. One constant and perhaps
unsolvable problem is the reluctance of the courts to take
children away from mothers who are clearly unsuitable. Judges
quickly place them in foster care, but they seldom legally
terminate the birth-mother's "rights" and allow adoption.<br>
<font size=-2>J. Kwitng, "Nobody's Kids," <i>Wall
Street Journal,</i> Sept. 6, 1978, p. 1</font>

<dt>Why early placement?

<dd>In recent years we've learned a lot about early bonding between
parents and child. The father in the delivery room, the baby
"rooming in" with the mother, immediate breast feeding, etc., are
all part of creating that very special and truly unbreakable
emotional tie between this tiny one and her parents.<p>

In adoption, the infant, of necessity, must lose those precious
early hours and days with her new parents. That generous
birth-mother must have a few days to make her final decision. But
then? What is best for the baby?<p>

Without a shade of doubt, that infant <i>must be</i> in his or her
adoptive parents' arms as early as possible. Some irreplaceable
early bonding is gone, but more slips away every day, every week.
Whenever possible the baby must go directly from the hospital
into those new parents' arms.

<dt>But what if the baby is handicapped?

<dd>All the more reason for immediate adoption. What if birth-parents
have a handicapped baby? Do they give him back? Of course not.
What of a handicapped child to be adopted? Should we keep him in
an institution until all medical questions are answered? Or in
foster care? Then maybe no couple will want him. How cruel! He
needs loving parents from the beginning, and maybe even more than
a "normal" child.<p>

Please, these infants with handicaps should also be adopted
directly from the hospital. There are parents who will take them.
Once he is "their baby," they will rarely give him back.

<dt>Are there comparisons of children placed in adoptive homes with
children kept and raised in a fatherless home?

<dd>Children born out of wedlock and kept and raised by their mothers
alone show educational failure and psychiatric disorders "far
more commonly" than adopted children, as they are commonly
exposed to major social and family stress. In contrast, adopted
children are rated by parents as no different than natural
children in the same social strata. Their teachers rated them as
doing only "slightly less well intellectually and
psychologically" if at all.<br>
<font size=-2>S. Wolff, <i>Archives of Disabled
Children,</i> 1974, pp. 49-155</font>

<dt>What of the unmarried father, if the mother is willing to place the
baby for adoption?

<dd>In that case, he has the legal right to claim the child. He does,
that is, if he comes forward and if she admits his paternity.

<dt>What if, in early counseling, the young mother is bitter toward
him, says she'll never let him have the baby and flatly states that
if she is forced to disclose the father's name, she'll get an
abortion?

<dd>In that case, if she really means it, most conscientious
counselors unofficially advise her to "not to remember who the
guy was." It is true that there is a court decision requiring her
to disclose his name. But, if the baby's life is in jeopardy,
then the actions necessary to save that baby's life must be
taken.

<dt>Why do so few mothers place their babies?

<dd>In society, customs change. Right now it is the "in" thing to
keep your baby. Part of the reason for this has been the
overemphasis on women's "rights" (as in abortion) over the baby's
rights, and the concept of the mother's "ownership."<p>

A very insidious influence has been the almost condemnation of,
and the "poor mouthing" of adoption by many sex educators,
Planned Parenthood people, and others. Another reason is money.

<dt>Money?

<dd>Yes! Here's how it works. A pregnant woman goes to the doctor.
She is considering an abortion. She really doesn't want one but
can't afford to have the baby. She'll need some living expenses
and she wants a private hospital and obstetrician. If these are
provided, she will agree to carrying the baby and adoption. The
problem is that (in most areas), the adoption agency doesn't have
funding to do all of this.<p>

One good answer is to have a private adoption. The doctor
contacts another doctor and a lawyer whom he trusts, and a
procedure is worked out. The other doctor knows a childless
couple who can afford to pass-through the money needed. The
lawyer acts as the intermediary. Total confidentiality is
maintained if the birth-mother and/or the adopting parents desire
it. Assuming the birth-mother does release the child, the infant
is taken directly from the hospital as young as legally
permissible and given directly to the new parents. Your authors
have been involved in many such adoptions, where the baby would
otherwise have been killed by abortion.

<dt>But isn't that selling babies?

<dd>In the vast majority of such cases, the lawyer only charges for
her or his professional time, which may cost up to $500 or $800,
depending upon whether there was lengthy counseling, etc. This is
legitimate.<p>

There are well-publicized cases where childless couples pay huge
sums and "buy" a baby. This is not right, and also, the child may
not be well served.<p>

The answer is to correct such abuses, if that is necessary.
Certainly it is not to abolish private adoption as some suggest.

<dt>Do you prefer private over agency adoptions then?

<dd>In general, certainly not. If an agency does most things right
(i.e., early placement, etc.), we believe that there is
consistently better parent screening, better records, better
follow-up, etc. Private adoption can be all of these good things
too, but sometimes, is less. We believe that both are absolutely
necessary but that both need improvement and the elimination of
abuses.

<dt>What of open records?

<dd>In recent years, organizations have been formed to lobby state
legislatures to open previously sealed confidential records. Only
three states had never sealed their records -- all other states
had. One of these three, Pennsylvania, legally closed their
records in the fall of 1984. One other, Ohio, opened some in the
same year.<p>

About one-third of the states, containing over 50% of the
nation's population, have solved the release of identifying
information with voluntary mutual consent registries. In almost
one-third more, Right to Life groups have worked to defeat open
record laws.<p>

The arguments for open records are twofold. There is a very small
percentage of adopted children (over 21 years old) and
birth-mothers who want reunions. In addition, some of today's
young mothers may be reluctant to adopt (and may abort) if there
is absolutely no hope of an eventual reunion.<p>

The arguments for confidentiality are also twofold. A high
percentage of young mothers in years past placed their babies in
adoptive homes only because the law guaranteed a seal of
confidentiality on that adoption. Today, many of these generous
women are terrified that confidentiality will be stripped away.
Also, some of today's mothers will abort if they know that their
privacy will some day be revoked.

<dt>What is a mutual consent registry?

<dd>It is the compassionate answer to the problems discussed above.
Under it, an adopted child over 21 years of age may enter his or
her name in the state registry indicating that he or she seeks a
reunion. Birth-mothers may also register and request the same. If
there is a match, a meeting is arranged. Unless both request it,
however, the previous seal of confidentiality is preserved.

<blockquote>
"A more sensible approach, and one that takes into
consideration the rights and feelings of other parties in the
adoption, is the establishment of registries where sensitive
information can be exchanged only with mutual consent."<br>
<font size=-2>Editorial, "Unsealing Adoption Records,"
<i>Washington Post,</i> Sept. 10, 1983</font>
</blockquote>

<dt>What if the right to confidentiality is taken away?<p>

<dd>"More girls will get abortions; perhaps 50% of those who come
to our Gladney homes now would do so. Also, many girls who do
give birth will lie about their backgrounds to protect
themselves, and then we won't get the honest information we
need to help the children."<br>
<font size=-2>R. L. Piester, Exec. Dir., Edna
Gladney Home, Dallas. Interview
in <i>People</i> Magazine, Nov. 1983, p. 60</font>

<dt>How many babies are adopted?

<dd>In an average year, according to the National Committee on
Adoption, about 50,000 babies are placed for adoption in
non-related families.

<dt>How many couples are waiting?

<dd>Senator Gordon Humphrey has said, "an estimated two million
couples . . . plus one million single persons. This means there
are at least 60 homes for every child adopted."<p>

Double or triple this because these couples would take two or
three babies each, if available.<br>
<font size=-2>Senate Hearings, Apr. 17, 1986</font>

<dt>But what of babies with handicaps?

<dd>There is a long waiting list for Down's Syndrome babies (see
chapter 26). For example, when Baby Doe was starved to death in
Bloomington, Indiana in 1982, eight couples had asked to adopt
him.<p>

There is a national organization of parents of Spina Bifida
babies. At this writing, over 100 couples are on the waiting list
to adopt such a baby, no matter how severe their problem (see
chapter 26).

<dt>What is National Right to Life's position?

<dd>It will support any reasonable effort to promote the adoption
option over abortion. It approves both agency and private
adoption, but wants them both well regulated. It opposes
completely open or completely closed birth records and supports
a mutual consent registry.<br>

<i>The most important thing that you can do is to become
personally involved. Unless you do, nothing will change.</i><p>

<dl>
<dt>Educate

<dd>First, educate yourself. Read this book carefully two more times.
Then, carry it with you and refer to it. If you haven't seen a
pro-life slide presentation, you must. Then, watch one or more of
the excellent movies now available.<p>

In addition, there are numerous excellent books that go into
depth on any and all aspects of the Human Life issues. There also
are less expensive booklets and inexpensive pamphlets. Some
additional materials are available from your local Right to Life
offices.<p>

After educating yourself, then you must educate others.

<dt>Lobby, write letters

<dd>Subscribe to your local RTL chapter newsletter, to the National
RTL News, or to one of the other independent or church-related
group publications and stay informed. Then, write letters, write
letters, and write letters to your elected officials at local,
state, and national levels; to radio and TV stations; to media
sponsors; and to others in your community whom you wish to
influence. Write also to your newspaper and to other civic or
religious publications. Visit your public and elected officials.
Tell them how you feel about current or proposed legislation
regarding abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide.

<dt>Vote

<dd>Register and vote. Get your family, your club, your friends, your
church members to register and vote. Nothing will change until
you do. Everything will change when you do.

<dt>Volunteer

<dd>Volunteer as a member of your local RTL chapter. Can you make
phone calls, baby-sit, run errands, type, stuff envelopes? Can
you lecture?

<dt>Contribute

<dd>Some have no time but can give money. This movement is rich in
people but almost destitute for funds. If you can give, do so. Be
sure that your gifts go to groups that use them wisely and are
not largely burned up on overhead and mailing costs. Your first
responsibility is to your local RTL chapter, then to your state
RTL group, and then to National. Give also to other pro-life
groups whose types of action programs you admire and approve.
Unless Right to Life groups begin to develop more secure
financial bases, nothing will change, for we are fighting the
mega-millions of anti-life foundations, of Planned Parenthood, of
ACLU, and of much of the government.

<dt>Pray

<dd>Pray as if everything depends upon your prayers, for it just
might be so. Pray that God will stay His hand. Do we, will we, as
a nation, deserve His help and His Mercy?<p>

"When the time comes as it surely will, when we face that
awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as
Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of
loneliness. You have no advocates, you are there alone
standing before God -- and a terror will rip your soul like
nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the
pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there'll be a
chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but
are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world -- and
they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement.
They will say to God, 'Spare him, because he loved us,' -- and
God will look at you and say not, 'Did you succeed?' but 'Did
you try?'"<br>

<STRONG>The Moral Question of Abortion</STRONG> by Stephen Schwarz is a significant work of philosophical reflection upon the absolute value of human life. Tightly argued from firm rational foundations, this book can be used to articulate an anti-abortion apologia as well as to inspire those in the trenches and at the barricades of the conflict.  The book also includes a number of photographs that dramatically show the humanness of the fetus. This is an informative resource for anyone concerned about the abortion issue.<P>

<STRONG><EM>About the author:</EM></STRONG><BR>
Stephen Schwarz received his Ph.D. from Harvard University.  He is currently Professor of Philosophy at the University of Rhode Island.

<EM>"I unhesitatingly recommend this book as an indespensable Baedeker through the tortured landscape of the abortion wars. It should be read by every thinking, morally responsible citizen in the country."</EM>

<EM>"This book does what no other book I know does: carefully and fairly faces and answers every one of the philosophical arguments that have been given to justify abortion. Although hundreds of books on the subject of abortion have appeared, none of them is as thorough as this one."</EM>

<EM>"I predict that this book will soon become the one indispensable sourcebook for the abortion debate. Well written, it can be understood by the front-line troops on either side, but it is profound and thorough enough to give pause to the highest legal and philosophical minds. It appeals to no religious faith, only to reason. It magnificently sorts out and identifies most of the greatest confusions in the present abortion debates.... This book is must-reading for everyone."</EM>

This is truly an encyclopedic work, spanning as it does the spectrum of the abortion dilemma, from the anatomy 
and physiology of the unborn child to the complex legal and ethical questions involved in the wanton destruction of that child.  It will
serve as an invaluable guide through the moral thickets of the abortion question.<P>

The book correctly emphasizes that the mere size of a human being is no measure of his/her value; it has long been my contention that 
in the tiny, almost invisible thirty-two cell blastocyst - in that one gram or so of tissue - there is a physical potential and moral 
density unparalleled in our universe.  Next to it, a gram of plutonium is a triviality: plutonium cannot compose a symphony, cannot cure 
cancer, cannot plan our course to the stars.<P>

I unhesitatingly recommend this book as an indispensable Baedeker through the tortured landscape of the abortion wars.  It should 
be read by every thinking, morally responsible citizen in the country.<P>

The aim of this book is to present a clarification of the moral question of abortion,
by a careful and thorough analysis of all its essential aspects. What does abortion 
involve? Is it a private matter? Does it have a victim? Is it ever morally justified?
Should it be legal? The analysis starts at the beginning and pursues these questions 
to their logical conclusions.<P>

The book is addressed to a variety of readers:<P>
<EM>To Those Who Have Mixed Feelings About the Morality of Abortion.</EM> For example,
those who oppose some abortions but approve others; or who believe a child is present
and are unsure how to balance the rights of the child and those of the mother; or who
are uncertain when the child begins her existence. The book is intended to provide you
with a clear picture; with conclusions based on careful reasoning.<P>

<EM>To Those Who Are Pro-Life.</EM> You will find a confirmation of your position, a 
carefully reasoned analysis to support and defend it.  You will, hopefully, find answers
to some of the questions you have, as well as replies you can offer to those who ask you 
questions or challenge your position.  You may wonder whether exceptions should ever be made;
that question is carefully considered.<P>

<EM>To Those Who Are Pro-Choice.</EM> My hope is that this book will give you a new perspective
on this most important life-and-death issue.<P>

In another direction, the book is addressed to a wide audience:<P>

<EM>To The General Public.</EM> The book does not assume any familiarity with philosophy, 
natural science, medicine or law.<P>

<EM>To Philosophers.</EM> The book is intended to be a careful and thorough philosophical
defense of the "pro-life" position. It offers detailed replies to some major recent
"pro-abortion" positions, notably Warren-Tooley and Thomson (chapters 
<A HREF=7-0.htm>7</A> and <A HREF=8-0.htm>8</A>), including
an analysis of an important distinction for the Philosophy of the Person, being a person and 
functioning as a person.<P>

<EM>To Those Concerned With The Law: Judges, Legislators, Other Goverment Officials,
Professionals in the Social Sciences and Medicine.</EM> The book is intended to help clarify
the essential moral and legal questions so important to your profession.<P>

The argument makes no appeal to religious faith, only to reason, including basic moral 
principles. It pursues the moral question of abortion as a philosophical question.<P>

The fundamental premises of the book are that intentionally killing an innocent person 
(someone who is not an aggressor) to benefit oneself or others is wrong; and that all
persons as persons have an equal intrinsic value, and an equal right to live, which must
be respected by all. The ideal of equal treatment of all persons is consistently carried 
through to its various conclusions.<P>

The basic aim of the book is to see abortion as it really is. Certain points, explained in
earlier parts of the book, are stressed and repeated later to help develop the total picture
of the reality of abortion (and to remind the reader of things that are easily forgotten
or overlooked).<P>

There is a sad chapter in the history of America: slavery. How could something as horrible
as slavery be practiced and approved in a country based on human dignity and equal rights for 
all people? How could we have been so blind to this evil? If some people at that time were
blind to a great evil, is it possible that some of us now are blind to a similar evil?<P>

<P>                The moral question of abortion focuses on the central question: 
What is
                the nature of the being in the womb that is destroyed by an abortion?  
Is
                it mere tissue? Is it a part of the woman's body?  Is it a potential 
person?
                Is it something that will become a child?  Or is it already a child, a 
small
                baby not yet born?  The purpose of this chapter is to answer these
                questions on the basis of authoritative scientific findings and careful
                philosophical analysis, and thereby to show - as a foundation for 
everything 
	else in this book - that what lives in the womb is a real child, a small
                person, a human being essentially like us, in the first phase of his or 
her
                existence.<P>

                    The reality of the child in the womb will be established on the basis
                of four main considerations, four mutually supporting lines of 
argument:<P>

                    First, the scientific facts about the child in the womb will be
                considered, a brief account of his early development.  We will see how
                rapid this development is, how quickly the bodily organs and parts 
come
                into place as distinct and identifiable elements and develop as active
                functioning units, and how soon he or she becomes recognizable as a
                small baby.<P>

                    Second, pictures of the being in the womb make it clear that this
                being is a small child.<P>

                    Third, reflection on these matters reveals an elementary point: the
                child who is born and later grows into an adult is the very same being
                who before birth was in his mother's womb.  He is a person later, he is
                a person earlier, the very same person.  This is the continuum of 
human
                life.<P>

                    Fourth, we will see that none of the differences between a preborn
                child and a born child or other born person make a difference with 
respect
                to the reality of their being as persons.<P>

These four lines of argument provide a basis, which will be confirmed,
 and further developed, in chapters 4 through 7. What exists in
   the womb is not something that develops into a person, but the person
   himself, in the first phase of his existence.  When I speak of the child as
   a person, I mean a person in the sense that a small born baby is a person,
   the same human person who is later an older child and still later, an adult.
   (A full analysis of personhood appears in chapter 7.)<P>

<P>
   The reality of the child in the womb as a real human being in the first
   phase of existence is brought out in a statement entitled "The Unborn
   Person Is Also a Patient." It was presented by a group of more than two
   hundred doctors, many of them members of the American College of
   Obstetrics and Gynecology, in a Friend of the Court Brief filed before the
   United States Supreme Court.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          From conception the child is a complex, dynamic, rapidly growing
          organism.  By a natural and continuous process the single fertilized
          ovum will, over approximately nine months, develop into the trillions
          of cells of the newborn.  The natural end of the sperm and ovum is
          death unless fertilization occurs.  At fertilization a new and unique
          being is created which, although receiving one-half of its chromosomes 
from each parent, is really unlike either.<P>

               About seven to nine days after conception, when there are
          already several hundred cells of the new individual formed, contact
          with the uterus is made and implantation begins.  Blood cells begin at
          17 days and a heart as early as 18 days.  This embryonic heart which
          begins as a simple tube starts regular pulsations at 24 days, which,
          in about one week, smooth into a rhythmic contraction and expansion.<P>

                Straus, et al. have shown that the ECG on a 23 mm embryo (7.5
          weeks) presents the existence of a functionally complete cardiac
          system.... All the classic elements of the adult ECG were seen....<P>

                Commencing at 18 days the developmental emphasis is on the
          nervous system even though other vital organs, such as the heart, are
          commencing development at the same time.  Such early development
          is necessary since the nervous system integrates the action of all other
          systems.  By the end of the 20th day the foundation of the child's brain,
          spinal cord and entire nervous system will have been established.  By
          the 6th week after conception this system will have developed so well
          that it is controlling movements of the baby's muscles, even though
          the woman may not be aware that she is pregnant.  By the 33rd day
          the cerebral cortex, that part of the central nervous system that
          governs motor activity as well as intellect may be seen.<P>



                 The baby's eyes begin to form at 19 days.  By the end of the first
           month the foundation of the brain, spinal cord, nerves and sense
           organs is completely formed.  By 28 days the embryo has the building
           blocks for 40 pairs of muscles situated from the base of its skull to the
           lower end of its spinal column.  By the end of the first month the child
           has completed the period of relatively greatest size increase and the
           greatest physical change of a lifetime.  He or she is ten thousand times
           larger than the fertilized egg and will increase its weight six billion
           times by birth, having in only the first month gone from the one cell
           state to millions of cells.<P>

                 By the beginning of the second month the unborn child, small
           as it is, looks distinctly human.  Yet, by this time the child's mother is
           not even aware that she is pregnant.<P>
                 At the end of the first month the child is about 1/4 of an inch in
           length.  At 30 days the primary brain is present and the eyes, ears and
           nasal organs have started to form.  Although the heart is still incomplete, 
	it is beating regularly and pumping blood cells through a closed
           vascular system.  The child and mother do not exchange blood, the
           child having from a very early point in its development its own and
           complete vascular system.<P>
                 Earliest reflexes begin as early as the 42nd day.  The male penis
           begins to form.  The child is almost 1/2 inch long and cartilage has
           begun to develop.<P>
                 Even at 5 1/2 weeks the fetal heartbeat is essentially similar to
           that of an adult in general configuration.<P>
                 <EM>By the end of the seventh week we see a well proportioned 
small
           scale baby.</EM> [Emphasis added.]  In its seventh week, it bears the
           familiar external features and all the internal organs of the adult, even
           though it is less than an inch long and weighs only 1/30th of an ounce.
           The body has become nicely rounded, padded with muscles and
           covered by a thin skin.  The arms are only as long as printed
           exclamation marks, and have hands with fingers and thumbs.  The
           slower growing legs have recognizable knees, ankles and toes.<P>

                 The new body not only exists, it also functions.  The brain in
           configuration is already like the adult brain and sends out impulses
           that coordinate the function of the other organs.  The brainwaves have
           been noted at 43 days.  The heart beats sturdily.  The stomach
           produces digestive juices.  The liver manufactures blood cells and the
           kidneys begin to function by extracting uric acid from the child's
           blood.  The muscles of the arms and body can already be set in 
motion.<P>

                 After the eighth week no further primordia will form; 
<EM>everything</EM>
           is already present that will be found in the full term baby.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes1.htm#1>1</A></SUP> As one
           author describes this period: "A human face with eyelids half closed
           as they are in someone who is about to fall asleep.  Hands that soon
           will begin to grip, feet trying their first gentle kicks."<P>


               From this point until adulthood, when full growth is achieved
           somewhere between 25 and 27 years, the changes in the body will be
           mainly in dimension and in gradual refinement of the working parts.<P>
               The development of the child, while very rapid, is also very
           specific.  The genetic pattern set down in the first day of life
           instructs the development of a specific anatomy.  The ears are
           formed by seven weeks and are specific, and may resemble a family
           pattern.  The lines in the hands start to be engraved by eight weeks
           and remain a distinctive feature of the individual.<P>
               The primitive skeletal system has completely developed by the
           end of six weeks.  This marks the end of the child's embryonic (from
           Greek, to swell or teem within) period.  From this point, the child will
           be called a fetus (Latin, young one or offspring).<P>
                In the third month, the child becomes very active.  By the end of
           the month he can kick his legs, turn his feet, curl and fan his toes,
           make a fist, move his thumb, bend his wrist, turn his head, squint,
           frown, open his mouth, press his lips tightly together.  He can swallow
           and drinks the amniotic fluid that surrounds him.  Thumb sucking is
           first noted at this age.  The first respiratory motions move fluid in and
           out of his lungs with inhaling and exhaling respiratory movements.<P>
                The prerequisites for motion are muscles and nerves.  In the sixth
           to seventh weeks, nerves and muscles work together for the first time.
           If the area of the lips, the first to become sensitive to touch, is gently
           stroked, the child responds by bending the upper body to one side and
           making a quick backward motion with his arms.  This is called a total
           pattern response because it involves most of the body, rather than a
           local part.  Localized and more appropriate reactions such as swallowing 
	follow in the third month.  By the beginning of the ninth week, the
           baby moves spontaneously without being touched.  Sometimes his
           whole body swings back and forth for a few moments.  By eight and a
           half weeks the eyelids, and the palms of the hands become sensitive to
           touch.  If the eyelid is stroked, the child squints.  On stroking the palm,
           the fingers close into a small fist.<P>
                 In the ninth and tenth weeks, the child's activity leaps ahead.
           Now if the forehead is touched, he may turn his head away and pucker
           up his brow and frown.  He now has full use of his arms and can bend
           the elbow and wrist independently.  In the same week, the entire body
           becomes sensitive to touch.<P>
                 The twelfth week brings a whole new range of responses.  The
           baby can now move his thumb in opposition to his fingers. He now
           swallows regularly. He can pull up his upper lip; the initial step in the
           development of the sucking reflex.  By the end of the twelfth week, the
           quality of muscular response is altered.  It is no longer marionette-like
           or mechanical - the movements are now graceful and fluid, as they are
           in the newborn.  The child is active and the reflexes are becoming more
           vigorous.  <EM>All this is before the mother feels any 
movement....</EM><P>


             Every child shows a distinct individuality in his behavior by the
       end of the third month.  This is because the actual structure of the
       muscles varies from baby to baby.  The alignment of the muscles of the
       face, for example, follow an inherited pattern.<P>
             Further refinements are noted in the third month.  The fingernails 
appear.  The child's face becomes much prettier.  His eyes,
       previously far apart, now move closer together.  The eyelids close
       over the eyes.  Sexual differentiation is apparent in both internal and
       external sex organs, and primitive eggs and sperm are formed.  The
       vocal cords are completed.  In the absence of air they cannot produce
       sound; the child cannot cry aloud until birth although he is capable
       of crying long before.<P>
             The taste buds and salivary glands develop in this month, as do
       the digestive glands in the stomach.  When the baby swallows amniotic
       fluid, its contents are utilized by the child.  The child starts to urinate.<P>
             From the twelfth to the sixteenth week, the child grows very
       rapidly.  His weight increases six times, and he grows to eight to ten
       inches in height.  For this incredible growth spurt the child needs
       oxygen and food.  This he receives from his mother through the
       placental attachment - much like he receives food from her after he is
       born.  His dependence does not end with expulsion into the external
       environment.  We now know that the placenta belongs to the baby, not
       the mother, as was long thought.<P>
             In the fifth month, the baby gains two inches in height and ten
       ounces in weight.  By the end of the month he will be about one foot
       tall and will weigh one pound.  Fine baby hair begins to grow on his
       eyebrows and on his head and a fringe of eyelashes appear.  Most of the
       skeleton hardens.  The baby's muscles become much stronger, and as
       the child becomes larger his mother finally perceives his many
       activities.  The child's mother comes to recognize the movement and
       can feel the baby's head, arms and legs.  She may even perceive a
       rhythmic jolting movement - fifteen to thirty per minute.  This is due
       to the child hiccoughing .... The doctor can already hear the heartbeat
       with his stethoscope.<P>
             The baby sleeps and wakes just as it will after birth.  When he
       sleeps he invariably settles into his favorite position called his "lie".
       Each baby has a characteristic lie.  When he awakens he moves about
       freely in the buoyant fluid turning from side to side, and frequently
       head over heel.  Sometimes his head will be up and sometimes It will
       be down.  He may sometimes be aroused from sleep by external
       vibrations.  He may wake up from a loud tap on the tub when his
       mother is taking a bath.  A loud concert or the vibrations of a washing
       machine may also stir him into activity.  The child hears . . . his
       mother's voice before birth.<P>
             In the sixth month, the baby will grow about two more inches,
       to become fourteen inches tall.  He will also begin to accumulate a little
           fat under his skin and will increase his weight to a pound and 
three-quarters.  This month the permanent teeth buds come in high in the
           gums behind the milk teeth.  Now his closed eyelids will open and
           close, and his eyes look up, down and sideways.  Dr. Liley feels that the
           child may perceive light through the abdominal wall.  <EM>Dr. Stiff has 
noted
           that electroencephalographic waves have been obtained in forty-three
           to forty-five day old fetuses, and so conscious experience is possible
           after this date.</EM><P>
                 In the sixth month, the child develops a strong muscular grip
           with his hands.  He also starts to breathe regularly and can maintain
           respiratory response for twenty-four hours if bom prematurely.  He
           may even have a slim chance of surviving in an incubator.  The
           youngest children known to survive were between twenty to twenty-five 
weeks old .<SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#2>2</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

           Note especially the statement: "By the end of the seventh week we see
    a well-proportioned small scale baby." This is before most abortions are
    performed.  An abortion is not simply a medical procedure performed on
    a woman; it involves a "well-proportioned small scale baby."<P>
           Many facts and experiences illustrate the reality of the child in the
    womb.<SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#3>3</A></SUP> Here is one particularly 
strong experience:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>           Dr. Liley relates the experience of a doctor who injected 
an air bubble
           into an unborn baby's (eight months) amniotic sac in an attempt to
           locate the placenta on x-ray.  It so happened that the air bubble
           covered the unborn baby's face.  The moment the unborn child had air
           to inhale, his vocal cords became operative and his crying became
           audible to all present, including the physician and technical help.  The
           mother telephoned the doctor later to report that whenever she lay
           down to sleep, the air bubble got over the unborn baby's face and he
           was crying so loudly he was keeping both her and her husband
           awake.<SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#4>4</A></SUP>

<EM>      The Child Is Not a Part of the Mother's Body.</EM>  As is clearly illustrated 
from
      the scientific facts, the child in the womb is not a part of the mother's body,
      but a full individual, a distinct being.  He is as much his own person (and
      not part of another) as he will be later in life.  He is dependent on his
      mother, as I would be dependent on you if I were dying from lack of blood
      and were receiving a blood transfusion directly from you.  I would of course
      remain completely distinct from you.  In fact, the child does not even
      receive such a transfusion from his mother.  He has his own independent
      blood circulation and his blood does not typically mix with that of his
      mother.
<P>             Dr. Bernard Nathanson adds an interesting point:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
             I have countered the old pro-abortion slogan, "It's a woman's right to
             control her own body," by pointing out that the modern science of
             immunology has shown us that the unborn child is not a part of a
             woman's body in the same sense that her kidney or her heart is.
             Immunologic studies have demonstrated beyond cavil that when a
             pregnancy implants itself into the wall of the uterus at the eighth day
             following conception the defense mechanisms of the body, principally
             the white blood cells, sense that this creature now settling down for
             a lengthy stay is an intruder, an alien, and must be expelled.  Therefore
             an intense immunological attack is mounted on the pregnancy by the
             white blood cell elements, and through an ingenious and extraordinarily efficient 
defense system the unborn child succeeds in repelling
             the attack.  In ten percent or so of cases the defensive system fails and
             the pregnancy is lost as a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage.<SUP><A

	<EM>
	Third: The Continuum of Human Life
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

      The third of the three mutually supporting considerations to show the
      reality of the child in the womb is the <EM>continuum argument</EM>.  Human life is
      a single continuum, from conception-fertilization to death (or beyond).  I
      will now examine several aspects of this argument, each in its basic
      formulation.  Taken together - and supplemented by the other lines of
      argument of this chapter, and completed by the arguments of later
      chapters - these aspects of the continuum argument form the basic
      premise for establishing what underlies this book as a whole: the reality
      of the child in the womb.<P>

             (1) The life of a human person is a single continuum, having
      different phases.  Being a child in the womb is the first of these phases;
      further phases include being a newborn baby, a born baby in his fifth
      month, his second year, a child of eight, a young adult, a person in middle
      age, an older person.  Life in the womb is part of life.  Each of us can say,
    I was once a child of three; a newborn baby; a baby two months before
    birth; six months; and so on.  Small children have a perfectly clear
    understanding of this, remarking, "When I was in Mommy's
    tummy...."<P>

          (2) The core of the continuum argument is that the child in the womb
    is the same person as the born child he will become, as well as the
    youngster of six, the teenager, the adult, he will become later.  I am now
    the same person I was ten years ago, even though I have changed.  That
    "I have changed" means that I, the same person, have changed; these
    changes happened to me.  I am now the same person who was once a
    newborn baby; and before that, a preborn baby in the womb. (Person
    means here simply "human being"; in chapter 7, I will analyze these
    terms carefully, thereby completing the present argument.)<P>

          I am now the same person as I was ten years ago.  One way to
    understand this is through memory.  I remember, not only events that
    occurred ten years ago, but myself experiencing these events.  To remember an experience is to reach 
back, not only into the past, but into
    another phase of one's own life, the life of the same person.<P>
          Memory of one's own past experiences presupposes oneself as
    experiencing them.  I who now remember, and I who had those experiences, must be the same 
person.<SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#6>6</A></SUP> Memory can stretch no farther back
    than identity; I cannot remember an experience occurring before I came
    to be, for obviously such an experience was not my experience.  But the
    converse is not true, for one's identity can, and does, stretch farther back
    than one's memory.  That I cannot remember an experience does not mean
    it was not my experience.  I cannot remember being born, nor any of the
    moments of my existence before birth.  But each of these moments was a
    moment in my existence, a part of that continuum that is my life on earth.<P>
          The function of memory in the continuum argument is to provide a
    clear and vivid understanding of the meaning of personal identity.
    Suppose the being in the womb had mental capacities that were far more
    developed than they actually are.  Then she could later say, I now
    remember experiencing such and such while in the womb.  That is - and
    this is the crucial point - I now remember myself, <EM>the same person</EM>, having
    these experiences.  That means of course that I was already present then.
    The absence of such developed mental capacities means the absence of
    such (actual) memory experiences; it does not mean the absence of the
    real identity that links the person as she exists now and as she existed
    then, and that is made intelligible by this (supposed) memory experience.<P>

          (3) It is not so that there is something in the womb -- "a blob of tissue"
    or a mere biological organism - that turns into a child.<SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#7>7</A></SUP> 
The child is
    already there, the same child, the same person all the way through.  There
      are significant developmental changes, but these occur in the life of one
      and the same being who is present throughout; and who is the being to
      whom these changes occur.<P>
           Later chapters will confirm this point.  Thus chapter 4 will show
      that there is no point in pregnancy where one could draw a line to mark
      the place where something nonpersonal "turns into" a person.  Chapter
      5 will show that a person does not come into existence gradually; i.e.,
      nothing "turns into" a person gradually.  Chapter 6 will show that a
      person's existence begins at conception-fertilization, as opposed to
      something else coming into existence then, which later turns into the
      person.  Finally, chapter 7 will show that the being who exists throughout pregnancy is indeed a 
person, not a potential person who somehow
      "turns into" a person.<P>
           (4) The person is already there in the womb: nothing needs to be
      added to make him a person.  Indeed nothing can be added.  This too will
      be confirmed in later chapters; for example, none of the suggested places
      to draw the line marks the addition of what is needed for becoming a
      person.<P>

           Before concluding the continuum argument, two points of clarification are in order.  First, the 
argument does not refer merely to the biological
      continuum of a single organism.  Rather, it is the identity of a person
      through various phases of his existence.  The biological continuity is
      certainly there, and it is an integral part of the continuum of the person.
      It is not the whole of it or its essence.  The biological continuum is a
      dimension of the personal continuum, as the biological physical is in
      general a dimension of the human person.<P>
           Second, the continuum argument is not the claim, often heard, that
      one cannot find a clear cutoff point in the life of a human being from
      conception to birth and beyond, a point marking the line between non-person and person, or merely 
potential person and actual person. If there
      is a spectrum, say from A to Z, the fact that no clear, non arbitrary cutoff
      point can be found along the way does not mean that A and Z cannot be
      radically different.  Think of such examples as the color spectrum from
      black to white, or night to day.  In each case A shades off into B, B into C,
      etc.  There are no clear dividing lines; there is a continuity.  But it is not
      the continuity of the continued existence of the same being; for example,
      a baby grows up to be a twenty-year-old, and always remains the same
      person.<P>
           If the continuum argument were merely that one can't find a clear
      cutoff point, it would indeed be invalid, and would not support the basic
      thesis, that the being in the womb is the same person who will later be
      born.<SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#8>8</A></SUP> Rejection of this argument does not touch the real 
continuum
      argument, the continuum of the same person.  As already indicated, and
     as chapter 4 will confirm, there is indeed no line to be drawn.  The reason
     for this is the continuum of human life.  Continuum implies no line; no line
     (by itself) does not imply continuum.<P>
           The child becomes an adult, and he is a child no longer.  The fetus
     becomes the born child, and he is a fetus no longer.  The stages - zygote,
     embryo, fetus, newborn baby, toddler, teenager-cease to be, but the
     person going through these stages continues to be, and continues as the
     same person.  Being a fetus is merely one stage in the life of a person.&nbsp;<SUP><A

	Fourth: Four Differences between Preborn and Postborn Persons
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->


     There are, of course, differences between the child in the womb and a
     born person.  What are these differences, and are any of them morally
     significant?  Let us examine this question now with regard to the child at
     seven to eight weeks, described earlier as "a well proportioned small-scale
     baby." Later chapters (4, 6, and 7) will confirm that what is established
     here for the older child at seven to eight weeks applies also to the younger
     child, the same child in earlier phases of her life.  There seem to be four
     major differences between a preborn and a born person:<P>

           <EM>Size</EM>.  The child in the womb at seven weeks is normally smaller than
     the newborn child.  The latter is normally smaller than a one-year-old
     child, who is normally smaller than a five-year-old child.  A 100-pound girl
     is smaller than a 250-pound football player.  This is of no moral significance.  The larger 
person isn't any more a person, or more precious, than
     the smaller.  A small newborn baby is just as precious as an older child,
     or an adult.  The child in the womb is simply a still smaller child.<P>

           <EM>Level of development</EM>.  A baby is less developed than a teenager.  Is
     he or she less a person?  Being less developed, as well as being smaller,
     represents earlier phases on the human life continuum.  But he is equally
     a person; he is the same person at his earlier stage of development as at
     the later stages, or else it would not be his development.<P>

           The child at seven to eight weeks is less developed than later, but he
     is already very well developed.  As noted earlier, "After the eighth week no
     further primordia will form: <EM>everything</EM> is already present that will be
     found in the full term baby." For example, "a human face with eyelids half
     closed ... hands that will soon begin to grip, feet trying their first gentle
     kicks" (see note <A HREF=notes1.htm#2>2</A>).<P>

           <EM>Environment</EM>.  If one person is in one environment and another
     person in another environment, nothing changes concerning the reality,
     or dignity and worth, of the two persons.  Being inside his mother, nesting
    in her womb, represents being in a different environment than the
    familiar environment we know.  But the being in the womb is as much a
    real person, a real child, at that time as after birth.<P>
         A child in an incubator is no less a real child than one in natural
    surroundings. The preborn child is in the incubator of his mother's womb,
    a warm, protective nesting place.  It is the necessary environment he
    needs while still small and fragile, what he needs for protection, nourishment, and growth.  It 
is the environment he needs to develop into a being
    who can survive the rigors of life in the outside world.  The difference
    between the preborn and postborn child is one of needs, not of reality or
    worth and dignity.<P>

         <EM>Degree of dependency</EM>.  We are all dependent on one another,
    physically and psychologically.  Some are more dependent than others:
    children, the sick, the handicapped.  A more dependent person - someone
    in an intensive care unit, for example - is not less of a person, than
    someone who is relatively more independent.<P>

         To see clearly the moral irrelevance of degree of dependency for the
    reality, dignity, and preciousness of a person, consider the following:<P>

         (1) Degree of dependency is relative.  It is, precisely, a matter of
    degree, of more or less.  Everyone is dependent on others to some extent,
    physically and psychologically.  At certain times, each of us becomes, or
    can become, more dependent on others than usual: if we are lost, if we've
    had a serious accident, if we are blinded.  Clearly these conditions do not
    affect our being as persons, our preciousness and dignity, our right to live.<P>

         (2) Specifically, it is important to remember that when you are
    dependent on others, that is, more dependent than usual, you are the
    same person as you were before, and will be later.  So, too, is the child in
    the womb.  He is at this stage of his life the same person who will later be
    born and grow up to be less dependent.<P>

         (3) Suppose that you are now healthy, thus relatively independent.
    Then you have a serious accident that leaves you paralyzed, thus very
    dependent on others.  The continuation of your life depends on others for
    protection and nourishment, parallel to the child in the womb.  You are
    still the same person.  You have the same dignity and right to live.<P>

         Suppose someone were to say to you, "You don't count: you are too
    dependent." This would be an outrage.  If this were used as a reason for
    killing you - that you were perceived as being in the way - it would be
    regarded as a terrible injustice.<P>

         Precisely this is what is said to the child in the womb by those who
    defend abortion on the grounds that the child is too dependent.  The fact
    that the child can't hear and understand what is being said, or that it is
    not said in so many words, or out loud, surely is of no moral significance.<P>

         (4) Physical dependency, as it applies to the child in the womb or to
    a person who is paralyzed, concerns a person's bodily dimension, and not
    the person as a person, or his right to live.  I remain myself through the
    various changes, phases of growth and development, phases of relative
    dependency or independence, that pertain to my body.  I am not any less
    <EM>me</EM> because my body may be in a state of greater dependency than at
    another time.  Thus we see that dependency through connection to
    another person has nothing to do with being a person.  It has only to do
    with how the body is sustained.<P>

         In short, to hold that a more dependent person - whether normally
    (in the womb) or not normally (as in paralysis) - is less of a person, less
    worthy of being treated like the rest of us is sheer prejudice, ungrounded in fact and reason.  
It is like the prejudice that asserts that
    certain people in distant lands, of different cultures and ethnic groups,
    are different in an odious sense, less human, not fully persons, whose
    death doesn't matter, or matters much less than the death of a familiar
    person.  A person who is different - whether it is because he belongs to
    a different culture, or because he is more dependent - is above all a
    person, like you and me, with the same right to live as we have.  The class
    of preborn persons is simply one instance of this.  Such a person should
    be treated just like any other person, with respect for his dignity and
    right to live. <SUP><A HREF=notes1.htm#10>10</A></SUP><P>

         To kill a normal child sleeping in his crib is a terrible evil.  Killing
    a child in an incubator, dependent on that incubator, is no less evil.
    Abortion is killing a child in the incubator of his mother's womb.  A more
    dependent child is a more fragile child.  He deserves more care and
    protection, not less.<P>

         That the child in the womb is dependent on another person, while the
    prematurely born child is dependent on an incubator has nothing to do
    with the status of the being who is thus dependent.  If person A is being
    sustained by, and thus dependent on, a direct blood transfusion from
    another person, while person B is similarly being sustained by a blood
    transfusion through a machine, then both are equally sustained, equally
    dependent; both are persons nevertheless.  That is, the kind of
    dependency, whether it is on another person or on a machine, has nothing
    to do with the person's being and his moral status. (dignity, right to life,
    etc.)<P>

         These four features that differentiate preborn persons and born
    persons can be conveniently put together and easily remembered by the
    acronym SLED:

	</CENTER>


	<P>

        A brief word about some of the other differences between preborn
     and post-born babies.  Preborn babies cannot be seen, they have no name,
     and they are incapable of social interaction.  These differences are of no
     moral significance.<P>

        That preborn babies cannot be seen really refers to the fact that we
     cannot see them, not to anything about their being.  A person enclosed in
     something - whether it is a closet or a womb - cannot be seen, for obvious
     reasons.  That says nothing about him as a person.<P>

        That a preborn child has no name says nothing about him as a person.
     An unnamed orphan is as much a baby as a named child.<P>

         No social interaction, to the extent that it applies, is an obvious
     consequence of the child's level of development and environment.  Even
     if he were more developed, he couldn't very well carry on a conversation with us in his 
present position.  But again, that says nothing about
     him as a person.<P>

         Finally, the child in the womb lacks mobility: he cannot move about.
     First, this is only partly true.  Beginning in the third month he becomes
     very active, and moves about in his amniotic sac.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes1.htm#11>11</A></SUP> Second, where it is
     true, it is due to his lack of development at the beginning, and later, his
     cramped quarters as he grows larger.  Third, it is in any case morally
     irrelevant.  A paralyzed person is as much a person as one who is
     fortunate enough not to be so afflicted.  Mobility, to the extent that it
     pertains to the child in the womb, is a matter of development,
     environment, and degree of dependency.<P>

         <EM>The Child in the Womb Is Not a Potential Person</EM>.  It is false that the
     being in the womb is merely a potential person.  He is not a potential
     person, but an actual person, a fully real person, the same person he will
     later be.  He is only smaller, less developed, in a different environment,
     and more dependent, in comparison to a born baby.  Just as the small born
     baby is not a potential person but an actual person, so too is the preborn
     baby, who is simply a baby at an earlier phase of development.  Both the
     postborn baby and the preborn baby are persons with potential, which
     is true of older children, and to a large extent, of all adults.  We are actual
     beings with varying potentials for growth and development.  In short, the
     child in the womb <EM>has</EM> potential, but he is an actual person, just like the
     rest of us.<P>

          <EM>Being a Person and Functioning As a Person</EM>.  Persons under anesthesia 
cannot feel pain, think, or communicate intentionally.  That they
     cannot do these things means they cannot <EM>function</EM> as persons.  But they
     have the <EM>being</EM> of a person.  The child in the womb has a potential capacity
   to function fully as a person; in terms of being, the preborn is an actual
   person.<P>

         The greater the level of development, the greater the capacity to
   function as a person.  Level of development is relevant only to functioning as a person not to 
being a person.<P>

         <EM>Concluding Remark</EM>.  The term fetus is in itself a perfectly proper term,
   meaning "young one," and in the context of human persons, a young
   human person.  But in recent times it has come to be understood in a very
   different, even an antithetical way, as something other than a person, a
   child.  For some people it is a fetus instead of a child that a woman is
   carrying.  It is psychologically easier to speak of the destruction of a fetus
   than of a child.  Defenders of abortion object to the use of the term child -
   they generally do not want to appear as defending the killing of a child.
   So it is a fetus; destroying a fetus does not sound so bad.  It is for this
   reason that it is imperative that we speak of the child and not the fetus.
   The reality of the child in the womb must be emphasized and conveyed
   to others.<P>
         Suppose a woman suffers a miscarriage.  A sympathetic doctor will
   not tell her, "You have lost your fetus"; he will say, "You have lost
   your child." If the child is marked for destruction he may well be
   referred to as a fetus, for this term has a cold scientific neutrality that
   effectively obscures the reality and preciousness of the small preborn
   child.  For this reason I shall always use the term <EM>child (or baby)</EM> rather
   than <EM>fetus</EM> (except in quotation marks).<P>

         A woman is walking down the street carrying a child in her arms.  She
   is with child.  Another woman is walking down that street.  She is pregnant.
   She too is carrying a child, only in a different way.  She too is with child,
   an expression often used, and most aptly, of a pregnant woman. The child
   carried in the arms is dependent, so is the child carried in the womb, only
   it is a different kind of dependence.<P>

         The woman and the child in her arms make two persons, two distinct
   individuals.  The pregnant woman and her child also make two persons,
   two distinct individuals - one seen and one hidden from view, but each as
   real as the other.<P>

	Methods of Abortion

	<P>

Abortion is generally described as the termination of pregnancy.  It is
     terminated by the removal of the child from the womb.  That is done by
     several methods:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
                  <EM>D & C or Dilation and Curettage:</EM>  Performed between 7 and 12 weeks, this method utilizes a sharp
             curved knife.  The uterus is approached through the vagina.  The
             cervix, or mouth of the womb, is stretched open.  The surgeon then
             cuts the tiny body to pieces and cuts and scrapes the placenta from
             the inside walls of the uterus....<P>
                  One of the jobs of the operating nurse is to reassemble the parts
             to be sure the uterus is empty, otherwise the mother will bleed or
             become infected.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#1>1</A></SUP><P>

             <EM>Suction or Vacuum Aspiration: </EM> A powerful suction tube is inserted
             through the cervix into the womb.  The baby is violently torn to pieces
             and sucked into a jar.  Used between 7 and 12 weeks.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#2>2</A></SUP><P>

             <EM>D & E or Dilation and Evacuation: </EM>Used between 12 and 24 weeks.
             Here, too, the child is cut to pieces by a sharp knife, as in D & C, only
             it is a much larger and far more developed child, weighing as much as
             a pound, and measuring as much as a foot in length.  A newspaper
             report on abortion and live births describes it:<P>

                   It involves dismembering the fetus while still in the womb, which
             eliminates any possibility of live birth.  It is a relatively new procedure
             in late abortions and is generally believed to be among the safest for
	women and the least psychologically painful.  However, it is also
            generally considered the most traumatic for doctors and staff... [The
            use of this method] in second trimester abortions [twelfth to twenty-fourth week] has increased greatly in recent years.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#3>3</A></SUP><P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

            While in these three methods the child always dies, there are other
     methods that generally result in the death of the child, but occasionally
     result in a live birth:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
                 <EM> Saline Solution or Salt Poisoning:</EM>
            This method is generally used after thirteen weeks of pregnancy.  A
            long needle is inserted through the mother's abdomen and a strong
            salt solution is injected directly into the amniotic fluid that surrounds
            the child.  The salt is swallowed and "breathed" and slowly poisons the
            baby, burning his skin as well. The mother goes into labor about a day
            later and expels a dead, grotesque, shriveled baby.  Some babies have
            survived the "salting out" and were born alive.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#4>4</A></SUP><P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

            "It takes over an hour to slowly kill a baby by this method."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#5>5</A></SUP>
     Another description of this procedure explains:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
            A very long needle pierces the skin near the belly button and is driven
            through the abdomen into the womb and amniotic sac (the bag of
            water surrounding the swimmer).  If the preborn does not push the
            needle away (which they are often known to do) about one hundred
            and fifty cc's of his fluid environment are removed to be replaced by
            the deadly saline solution.<P>

                  Sometime during the next hour comes the most difficult part
            (and the part most likely not to be told to the woman considering
            abortion).  More difficult than making The Choice, more difficult than
            seeing that huge needle bearing down on the stomach, is the time
            when the saline begins to affect the preborn and s/he begins to react
            to it with the basic tools for survival used by every living creature -
            fight or flight.  The preborn kicks, thrusts, and writhes.  Soon, since s/he can neither fight the poison nor run from it, the convulsions begin.
            The death throes of the preborn can be very uncomfortable for the
            mother; she can ... feel ... them [if the child is 20 weeks old or more].
            There is no escape for her either.  After the preborn dies labor begins,

                 <EM> Prostaglandin Chemical Abortion: </EM>
            This ... form of abortion ... uses chemicals developed and sold by the
            Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company.... These hormone-like compounds are injected or otherwise applied to the muscle of the uterus,
         causing it to contract intensely, thereby pushing out the developing
         baby.  Babies have been decapitated during these abnormal contractions.  Many have been born alive.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#7>7</A></SUP><P>

              <EM>Hysterotomy or Cesarean Section Abortion: </EM>

         Used in the last trimester of pregnancy, the womb is entered by
         surgery through the wall of the abdomen. The tiny baby is removed and
         allowed to die by neglect or sometimes killed by a direct act.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#8>8</A></SUP>

<EM>Is Abortion <A NAME=killing></A>Killing?</EM><P>

   Is abortion the killing of a preborn child?  That it is called removal does not
   mean that it is not also killing.  There are essentially three types of cases
   here.<P>
         First, abortion may be removal of the child by killing him or her.  The
   ultimate intention is removal, but it is carried out by a method that is in
   fact killing, such as dismembering or poisoning.  Hence abortion in such
   cases is killing: the method of "removal" kills the child.<P>

         It is sometimes said, "We only want to remove the child, not kill her,
   though she may die as a result." Where the first three methods are used
   (D & C, suction, D & E), this is hardly plausible. One "removes" the child
   by a method that cannot be anything other than killing, even if one's
   interest lies in removal rather than in death.  And where the next two
   methods are used (saline and prostaglandin) and result in death, the
   same applies; for example, one kills the child by poisoning and burning.<P>

         Second, there are some cases in which the distinction between
   removal and killing has meaning, namely hysterotomy, which is very rare,
   and those cases, also rare, when saline and prostaglandin result in live
   births.  I will deal with these cases shortly.  They constitute rare exceptions
   to the general rule that abortion is indeed the killing of a child.<P>

         Third, termination of pregnancy may sometimes be carried out with
   the explicit purpose of killing the child.  This is explained by Steven L.
   Ross, who points out that abortion is not, in many cases, abandonment
   of the child, or merely wanting him removed, but rather wanting him
   dead.  He says:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          If upon entering a clinic women were told, "We can take the fetus out
          of your womb without any harm to you or it, keep it alive elsewhere
          for nine months, and then see it placed in a good home," many would,
          understandably be quite unsatisfied.  What they want is not to be
          saved from "the inconvenience of pregnancy" or "the task of raising a
          certain (existing) child"; what they want is <EM>not to be parents</EM>, that is,
          they do not want there to be a child they fail or succeed in raising.  Far
          from this being "exactly like" abandonment, they abort precisely to
          avoid being among those who later abandon.  They cannot be satisfied
          unless the fetus is killed; nothing else will do.&nbsp;<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#9>9</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         Obviously abortion means killing the child in such cases.  On the
   whole, apart from the rare instances where there are live births, abortion
   is the killing of the child.  It is a deliberate and intentional killing; either
   because one wants the child dead, or because one chooses a method of
   removal that in fact constitutes killing.<P>

   Abortion is a moral evil because it is a form of infanticide: the killing of a
   small child.  One usually thinks of infanticide as the killing of a born child.
   But the killing of a preborn child is not any different.  He is hidden from
   view, he is smaller, more dependent, more fragile.  But he is a real person,
   just like the born child.  He is simply at an earlier stage of his life and
   development.  If it is wrong to kill him later (post-birth infanticide) it is
   equally wrong earlier (prebirth infanticide).<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#11>11</A></SUP><P>

        The moral equivalence of infanticide (afterbirth) and abortion (before
   birth) is illustrated clearly in the Kamchadal practice: "The Kamchadal of
   northern Siberia ... have practitioners who specialize in killing a fetus
   through the wall of the abdomen, during the last stages of pregnancy.  This
   may result in a stillbirth or in the birth of an injured but living infant that
   is killed forthwith."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#12>12</A></SUP><P>

        Is this abortion or infanticide?  It is abortion because the child is
   killed while still in the womb.  It is infanticide because a person aims a
   knife or dagger directly at a child in order to kill him, a child whose
   presence is obvious by the bulge in the mother's abdomen, a child who
   could be seen and touched except for the abdominal wall that shields him.
   It is infanticide because it is killing a baby who is right there.<P>

          What this practice shows with unmistakable clarity is a practical
      identity of abortion and infanticide.  It is not really one rather than the
      other.  It is a form of abortion that vividly displays the identity of abortion
      and infanticide, and precludes any attempt to draw a line between them
      rationally.<P>

          What the Kamchadal practice amounts to is simply early infanticide:
      one doesn't even wait for the child to be born.  What are called abortions,
      such as saline injections, D & C, and D & E are basically Kamchadal-like
      practices carried out earlier, and with different instruments.  In D & C, for
      example, the knife has to be carefully inserted into the womb, because the
      baby is hidden away and not protruding as in the Kamchadal practice.  In
      other words, it is easier to do a late Kamchadal because the baby is
      protruding in his mother's abdomen, it is more difficult to do an early
      Kamchadal (e.g., D & C or suction) because the baby is more remote.  But
      morally, there is nothing that differentiates them.<P>

          Abortion is infanticide.  Whether the child is killed while still in the
      womb or after she has emerged from the womb is morally irrelevant.  It is
      the same child before and after.<P>

	Is Abortion Murder?
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

      Suppose someone intentionally kills an adult to get him out of the way (an
      innocent person, not an attacker). That surely would be murder.  Suppose
      it was not an adult, but a child.  Would that not be equally a case of
      murder?  Size, age, level of development are irrelevant here.  Suppose it is
      a very small child, a baby just born.  Suppose the child is not yet born, but
      about to be born.  Suppose he still has a month to go before birth.  More
      than a month.  All of these refer to different points on the same human
      continuum.  It is the same person throughout, only smaller, less developed, and sometimes out of sight, in the earlier stages.  If it is murder at
      a later stage, it is also murder at an earlier stage.  Merely being in another
      place (the womb), and smaller, cannot take away the reality of murder.
      Abortion is the killing of an innocent human being: murder.<P>

           To substantiate the thesis that abortion is murder, some points of
      clarification are in order.  First, murder is the <EM>intentional</EM> killing of an
      innocent person.  Not all causing of death of innocent persons is intentional, thus murder.  Suppose I'm driving a school bus with twenty-nine
      children, on a treacherous mountain road, going down a steep incline.
      The brakes fail, and the bus is about to plunge down the abyss and kill
      all thirty of us.  The only way I can avoid this catastrophe is by quickly
   veering sharply to one side.  Unfortunately a person is walking there, and
   I will hit him, causing his death.  It is too late to warn him.  If I veer the bus
   sharply to the side, I cause his death, tragically.  But I do not kill him
   intentionally.  And so I do not commit murder.<P>

        Second, murder is the intentional killing of an <EM>innocent</EM> person.  If the
   only way I can defend myself, or another, from a murderous attacker is
   by killing him, I kill in defense, which is not murder.  Innocent in this
   context means non-aggressor; it does not imply lack of moral guilt in other
   matters (though that is in fact the case with regard to the child in the
   womb).<P>

        Both of these, intentional killing and killing an innocent person,
   clearly apply to abortion.  The child is absolutely innocent.  He is not an
   attacker.  He is in his natural place.  Abortion is the deliberate and
   intentional killing of this innocent person.<P>

        Third, it is important to distinguish clearly between murder as
   applying to <EM>actions</EM>, and as applying to <EM>persons</EM>, making them guilty, or
   murderers.  Thus, to say that abortion is murder is to classify the <EM>action</EM>
   of killing an innocent preborn child as murder, it does not make a
   judgment about the <EM>personal guilt</EM> on the part of the woman, the doctor,
   and those who assist.  In saying, quite generally, that A's killing of B is
   murder, the action is characterized as murder - as opposed to justified
   killing (e.g., self-defense), or unjustified killing, which is nonetheless not
   murder (e.g., a soldier who kills in an unjust war).  In characterizing the
   action as murder, the question remains whether the moral guilt of the
   agent is that of a murderer.  It may or may not be, due to extenuating
   circumstances.  A person who is terribly frightened may shoot someone in
   desperation.  The act is murder, the person is less guilty than someone
   who kills intentionally without being frightened.  Thus, two people may
   perform what is morally the same act (e.g., killing someone to get him out
   of the way), but one is more guilty than the other.  The first may realize with
   full clarity the wrongness of the action; the second may be in a confused
   state of mind, half realizing it is wrong, half trying to justify to himself that
   it is right, or not so bad.  The first may act entirely on his own initiative;
   the second may be under strong pressure to do the killing.  Clearly such
   differences among agents are to be found in the practice of abortion.
   Therefore, to say that abortion is murder is to say that the action of killing
   a child in the womb is murder, just as any other intentional killing of an
   innocent person is murder.<P>

        Does a doctor who performs an abortion in order to benefit the
   woman commit murder if his motive is to help her?  Is this not a good
   motive? How then can the action be murder?&nbsp;<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#13>13</A></SUP><P>

        In Dostoyevskys novel <EM>Crime and Punishment</EM>,  Raskolnikov kills an
    old woman so that he can distribute her money to the poor.  Good motive?
    Perhaps.  But the fact that he intentionally kills an innocent person makes
    it murder, good motive or not.  To point to a good motive is to refer to the
    end; the means are murder nonetheless.  If I kill an innocent person for
    you in order to get him out of the way and thereby save you serious
    hardship, I may be motivated by good intentions, but my action is still
    murder. This is exactly what happens in the case of a doctor who performs
    an abortion: good motives or not, he commits murder.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#14>14</A></SUP><P>

        Does a woman who has an abortion commit murder?  Some women
    are literally coerced into their abortions and are of course entirely
    innocent of murder.  Some women decide voluntarily and then later deeply
    regret their abortions, exclaiming in some cases, "I have murdered my
    baby!."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#15>15</A></SUP> They feel they have committed murder.  The <EM>action</EM> is murder;
    were they guilty as <EM>persons</EM>? There are many factors that can mitigate or
    remove guilt, such as ignorance of what abortion is and altruistic motives;
    for example, "I would rather abort than cause my parents shame." To a
    large extent, women are the second victims of abortion, often pressured
    into it by others, wanting to keep their babies but agreeing to an abortion
    only because they see no realistic alternative.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#16>16</A></SUP><P>

         Whatever the status of the doctor's motives, and the woman's
    motives and circumstances, the <EM>action</EM> of abortion, as the deliberate
    killing of a small child, is murder.<P>

         Fourth, in saying that abortion is murder, we speak of such an act
    in the moral, not the legal, sense.  Whether a given act of intentionally
    killing an innocent person is legally murder or not depends of course on
    the status of the law.  Where such killing is allowed under the law it is, of
    course, not murder in the legal sense.  Thus the Nazi extermination
    process was not legally murder, but it was obviously murder in the sense
    that is really important, the moral sense.  The Nazi extermination program
    was the mass killing of innocent persons who could not defend themselves, who were in some respects different or seen as different, in order
    to get them out of the way - a perfect description of abortion today.<P>

         That something is allowed by law, or even mandated by it, does not
    settle the moral question.  Intentionally killing an innocent person, at
    whatever age, and in whatever location, is morally an act of murder.  No
    law can alter that fact.<P>

         Finally, it is important to stress the point that abortion is murder.
    Otherwise one may have the impression that abortion, though wrong,
    though it is the taking of a human life, is somehow less wrong than
    ordinary murder.  It is not.  It is the same thing, morally, as the deliberate
    killing of a born innocent person.<P>


<EM>    Objection and Reply: "He Will Never Know the <A NAME=DIFFERENCE>Difference</A>"</EM><P>

    A fundamental assumption underlying much of the support for abortion
    is the idea that the being in the womb may be aborted because he will
    never know the difference.  "If I kill an adult or a child who realizes what
    is happening, that is, of course, terrible [so goes the assumption], but if
    I destroy the child in the womb, he will never know it.  So what difference
    can it make to him?  He just won't be born, and will never realize it.  How
    can abortion be wrong?"<P>

          If the being in the womb is indeed a child, a person, then whether or
    not he realizes he is being killed is irrelevant.  Murder is murder whether
    the victim realizes what is happening or not.  If I kill a born person
    painlessly in his sleep, he will never wake up.  He will never know the
    difference.  But a murder has been committed nonetheless.  If a preborn
    child is killed in his sleep, his state in the womb, he will never wake up
    to be born; he will never know the difference.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#17>17</A></SUP> But again, a murder has
    been committed nonetheless.<P>

          This is the primary reply, which grants the objector his assumption
    that the child in the womb is in a state like that of sleep, and will never
    know the difference.  A second reply is this.  We do not know that the child
    will never know the difference.  He may feel terrible pain when the
    abortionist's knife cuts him to pieces.  There is strong evidence that this
    is so, as I shall show in the next chapter.<P>

    A reprint of an article in the <EM>Philadelphia Inquirer</EM> entitled "Abortion: The
    Dreaded Complication,"<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#18>18</A></SUP> reports:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          Something happens in a very small number of abortions, performed
          relatively late in pregnancy, that no one wants to talk about.  It
          horrifies many of the medical personnel who have encountered it.<P>

                What happens is that about once a day somewhere in the U.S.,
          something goes wrong and an abortion results in a <EM>live baby</EM>.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#19>19</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

          "When a crying baby emerges instead of a lifeless fetus, doctors have
    a problem with no easy answer."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#20>20</A></SUP> Some examples:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          A baby girl, weighing 1 pound 11 ounces, was born in February 1979
          after a saline abortion at Inglewood (Calif.) Hospital.  Harbor General
          Hospital, which is associated with UCLA and is fully equipped to care
            for premature babies, was called to help, but the neonatal rescue team
            did not respond.  The infant died after three hours.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#21>21</A></SUP><P>

                  January 1969.  Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland: A custodian heard a cry from a paper bag in the snow beside an incinerator.
            He found a live baby.  It was taken inside and cared for in the hospital's
            operating theater but died nine hours later.  The infant's gestational
            age had been estimated at 26 weeks by the physician performing the
            abortion.  It was actually closer to 32 weeks.  No efforts were made to
            check for signs of life before the aborted baby was discarded.  No
            charges were filed.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#22>22</A></SUP><P>

                  [In another case,] the abortion, induced by an injection of
            prostaglandin, a substance that stimulates muscle contraction and
            delivery of the fetus, was filmed for use as an instructional film.  The
            film showed the three-pound infant moving and gasping.... A nurse
            and a medical student testified that they had noticed signs of life.  No
            charges were filed.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#23>23</A></SUP><P>

                  [Finally, there is the case of an abortion live birth in the mid-70s
            in a Florida hospital.  The infant was dumped in a bedpan without examination, as was standard practice.  "It did not die," the nurse said.
            "It was left in the bedpan for an hour before signs of life were noticed.
            It weighed slightly over a pound."
                  The baby remained in critical condition for several months, but
            excellent care in a unit for premature infants enabled it to survive.  The
            child, now five years old, was put up for adoption.  The nursing
            supervisor, who has followed its progress, said she has pictures of the
            youngster "riding a bicycle and playing a little piano."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#24>24</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

           Unfortunately, this last case represents an exception.  Most of these
     babies die.  Some are too immature to survive.  Some are too severely
     injured by the abortion process.  Some are directly killed.  Many are left to
     die.  "This is happening all over the place," says a California prosecutor.
     "Babies that should live are dying because callous physicians let them
     die."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#25>25</A></SUP><P>

          The evil of abortion, the moral equivalent of infanticide, is starkly
     illustrated when we analyze the phenomenon of live births.  If a live birth
     occurs after an attempted abortion (or a hysterotomy), there are basically
     three things that may be done.<P>

          First, the medical staff may deliberately kill the child.  As one
     obstetrician describes it, "You want to know how they kill him?  They put
     a towel over his face so he can't breathe.  And by the time they get him to
     the lab, he is dead."<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#26>26</A></SUP> This is obviously murder, infanticide, a clear-cut
    evil.  What should be noted is that if the abortion procedure carried out
    before was done with the intention of killing the child then the deliberate
    killing of the child after a live birth is perfectly consistent with it.  If one
    does not succeed before, one does so now, and finishes the job.  If the child
    is to be killed, it makes no difference morally whether this is started and
    finished in the womb, or started there and finished outside the womb. The
    moral equivalence of abortion and murder of a born child stares us in the
    face.<P>

         Abortion is sometimes carried out with the explicit purpose of killing
    the child (see note <A HREF=notes2.htm#9>9</A>).  Essentially the same point is made by Dr. Thomas
    F. Kereny, a New York expert on abortions: "You have to have a feticidal
    [fatal] dose of saline solution.... it's almost a breach of contract not to.
    Otherwise, what are you going to do - hand her back a baby having done
    it questionable damage?"<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#27>27</A></SUP><P>

         Second, the medical staff may neglect the child; throw him out alive
    in the trash for example, and thus let him die.  Again, there is a moral
    consistency.  It corresponds to abortion as removal of the child, by the
    methods described above.  Throwing her out in the trash is simply more
    of the same.  It is an expression of the idea that the child is worth nothing,
    and can therefore be disposed.<P>

         In both cases, the procedures after a live birth illustrate the horror
    and clear-cut wrongness of abortion.  They are the logical, natural
    sequences to the original act.  If we are appalled by the deliberate killing
    of a child or his callous abandonment after a live birth, we should be
    equally appalled by the procedure that does the same to him before his
    birth: abortion.<SUP><A HREF=notes2.htm#28>28</A></SUP><P>

         Third, the medical staff may make every effort to save the child. This
    is of course what should be done.  But if it is, it stands in direct
    contradiction to what was done before in the abortion or the attempted
    abortion.  First one tries to kill the child or one removes him by a procedure
    that is in fact killing him in most cases.  Then one makes an about-face,
    and tries desperately to save him.  Here is an incredible inconsistency.  If
    the child is now worth saving, he should not have been subjected, just
    moments before, to a procedure that in almost all cases would have killed
    him.  The evil of abortion as death-dealing comes out again, this time in
    its contrast to concern for the child in trying to save him.<P>

         Why the double standard?  Because the child is now born?  But why
    should his location have any moral bearing?  He is the same child before
    and after birth.  It should not be thought right to kill him simply because
    he is no longer a burden on the woman.  Is it thought right merely because
    abortion is legal, whereas killing a born child is illegal?  Are we going to do
   whatever the law allows, regardless of its moral status?  Slavery was once
   legal in the United States: that hardly made it moral.<P>

        Is abortion the killing of a child?  In almost all cases it is, for one either
   intends to kill him and does so: or one intends to remove him by a
   procedure that in fact kills him.  In a few cases the child is born alive,
   despite the abortion, but is then deliberately killed, or allowed to die by
   neglect; or the child dies despite all efforts to save him, after being fatally
   wounded by the abortion procedure, or because he is born too soon to be
   able to survive outside his natural habitat.  In all these cases it is clear that
   abortion means killing the child.<P>

        The very few cases where an abortion leads to a live birth, followed
   by intense and successful efforts to save the child, do not constitute a
   significant exception to this statement.  Abortion is still a procedure
   undertaken with the intention of killing the child or removing him by a
   procedure that in fact kills him.  This is enough to make abortion murder.
   The few isolated instances in which the victim survives, and is then
   successfully cared for, does not alter the nature of this action as an act
   of killing.<P>

         There is an outcry today against child abuse.  It is plain that abortion
   is one of the worst forms of child abuse.<P>

	A Review of the Methods
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

    To determine whether abortion causes pain to its victim, I will review the
    methods of abortion.<P>

           (1) <EM>D & C or Dilation and Curettage</EM>.  The child, seven to twelve weeks
    old, is cut to pieces by a sharp knife.<P>

           (2) <EM>Suction</EM>. The child, also seven to twelve weeks old, is torn to pieces
    by a suction machine, twenty-nine times as powerful as a home vacuum
    cleaner.<P>
           Wouldn't any sentient being with functioning nerve endings and a
    nervous system feel pain, probably excruciating pain, when subjected to
    such procedures?  As I will show, the child at this stage has functioning
    nerve endings and a nervous system sufficient for feeling pain.<P>

           (3) <EM>D & E or Dilation and Evacuation</EM>. As in D & C, the child, now much
    larger and more fully developed, is cut to pieces by a sharp knife. "This
    procedure requires the inflicting of innumerable knife wounds until death
    results.  It takes about ten minutes."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#1>1</A></SUP> In the booklet <EM>Fetal Pain and
    Abortion: The Medical Evidence</EM>, we read:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           D & E abortions are performed after the 12th week of pregnancy (and
           are performed up to and including the period of viability) when fetal
           bones are too large and brittle and the size of the fetus is too great for
           standard first trimester abortion techniques.  D & E involves the
           progressive dismemberment of the fetus prior to extraction in order to
           facilitate removal of the fetal parts from the uterus.  The slicing and
           crushing involved in dismemberment of the fetus in D & E abortions
           would obviously excite pain receptors and stimulate the neural
           pathways, thereby evoking an aversive response in the fetus whose
           central nervous system is functioning.  It must be concluded, therefore, that the fetus suffers pain as the result of D & E abortion.<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#2>2</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

    This booklet is by Dr. Vincent J. Collins, with Dr. Steven R. Zielinski and
    attorney Thomas J. Marzen.  Dr. Collins is Professor of Anesthesiology
    at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois, and author
    of <EM>Principles of Anesthesiology</EM>, one of the leading medical texts on the
    control of pain.<P>

           (4) <EM>Salt Poisoning or Saline Solution</EM>. Here the child is older (thirteen
    weeks or more), and thus more developed, and the procedure takes longer
    (one to two hours), so the amount of pain is undoubtedly much greater.
    The child is bathed in a chemical solution that poisons him and burns his
    skin.  Curt Young writes of the effect of saline solution on the child:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           Because the salt is so concentrated, it chemically burns human
           tissue.  The child assaulted with saline looks as though he has
           succumbed to an attack with napalm.  Much of the outer skin has
           simply been burned away.<P>
                 No one can imagine how excruciating the pain is.  We do know
           that physicians recognize immediately the effect of instilling saline
           into the woman's gut rather than the amniotic sac.  The pain is so
           unbearable the client may throw herself off the table.  This is exactly
           what the unborn child does in his mother's womb.  In fact the mother
           can feel this:<P>
                 ". . . Once they put in the saline there is no way to reverse it.  And
           for the next hour and a half I felt my daughter thrash around
           violently while she was being choked, poisoned, burned, and suffocated to death.  I didn't know any of that was going to happen.  And
           I remember talking to her and I remember telling her I didn't want
           to do this, I wished she could live.  And yet she was dying and I
           remember her very last kick on her left side.  She had no strength left.
                 "I delivered my daughter whose name is now Charmaine Marie.
           She was 14 inches long.  She weighed over a pound and a half.  She had
           a head of hair and her eyes were opening."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#3>3</A></SUP><P>

                 [Another report tells us that] saline abortions cause the fetus to
           feel "the same agony as an adult who has suffered burns over 80% to
           90% of his body.. . . The fetus squirms, throws himself around, and
           shows a total grimacing pattern of withdrawal."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#4>4</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

        (5) <EM>Prostaglandin</EM>. The child is subjected to violent muscle contractions as he is forced out of the womb.  Some babies have been decapitated.
   Another factor: "The method of abortion involving the introduction of
   prostaglandin into the mother's system may bring about death of the
   fetus by constricting the circulation of the blood and/or impairing the
   heart function.  Pain analogous to that of a person experiencing a heart
   attack can be assumed."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#5>5</A></SUP><P>

        Death for the child by prostaglandin may be a long agony: "Another
   intended effect of this chemical is the induction of labor so that the woman
   delivers a stillborn infant much as she would be induced to deliver a live
   one.  In this method, then, the infant dies very gradually (maybe over a
   two-day period) from severe cardiovascular complications."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#6>6</A></SUP><P>

   When we see another person brutally cut by an ax screaming and
   bleeding, we know he is in pain, even though we do not perceive his or her
   pain directly.  Pain is known to exist, or can be inferred, when (a)
   functioning neurological structures necessary for pain sensations exist,
   (b) there is overt behavior expressive of pain, (c) there is a cause for pain.<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#7>7</A></SUP><P>
        Elements (a) and (b) are necessary for pain, and they are also
   sufficient for us to establish or infer its existence; element (b) provides
   additional evidence, but is not necessary for inferring that pain exists.
   Condition (c) is certainly fulfilled in these methods of abortion: the sharp
   knife, the suction machine, the chemical solution that poisons and
   burns, the violent muscle contractions.  Element (b) is also present in
   some of these procedures: "I felt my daughter thrash around violently
   while she was being choked, poisoned, burned, and suffocated to death."
   The crucial question to be examined is whether condition (a) is fulfilled.<P>

   What are the neurological structures necessary to feel pain?  The booklet,
   <EM>The Medical Evidence</EM> states that three elements are required: "Pain
   receptive nerve cells, neural pathways and the thalamus."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#8>8</A></SUP> The thalamus
   is a portion of the brain that "lies above the spinal cord and brainstem,
   but below the cerebral cortex."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#9>9</A></SUP> The cortex is the seat of higher mental
   functions.  It is very significant, in the present context, that<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          the presence of a functioning cortex is not necessary to pain sensation.  Even complete removal of the cortex does not eliminate the
          sensation of pain; no portion of the cortex, if artificially stimulated,
          results in pain sensation.  It follows, therefore, that neither the
          presence of the cortex nor transmission of pain impulses to the cortex
          are essential to pain sensation.  When the cortex (which develops and
          functions later in human gestation than the thalamus) is involved in
          a pain response, it generates elaborated aversive behavior and adds
          psychological and cognitive components to pain sensation.<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#10>10</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

          The functioning neurological structures necessary to suffer pain are
    developed early in a child's development in the womb.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          Functioning neurological structures necessary for pain sensation are
          in place as early as 8 weeks, but certainly by 13 1/2 weeks of gestation.
          Sensory nerves, including nociceptors, reach the skin of the fetus
          before the 9th week of gestation.  The first detectable brain activity
          occurs in the thalamus between the 8th and 10th weeks.  The
          movement of electrical impulses through the neural fibers and spinal
          column takes place between 8 and 9 weeks gestation.  By 13 1/2
          weeks, the entire sensory nervous system functions as a whole in all
          parts of the body ....<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#11>11</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

          That functioning neurological structures necessary for pain are in
    place between eight and 13 1 / 2 weeks corroborates and supplements the
    <EM>Amicus Curiae</EM> statement that in the seventh week, "the brain configuration is already like the adult brain," that "brain waves have been noted at
    forty-three days (6.14 weeks)," and particularly, "After the eighth week
    no further primordia will form: <EM>everything</EM> is already present that will be
    found in the full term baby."<P>

          If a full-term baby can feel pain, then it is reasonable to infer that a
    baby that is essentially like her, one in whom everything is already
    present that will be found in the full-term baby, must also feel pain when
    she is destroyed by the violence of abortion.  Recall also, <EM>"Dr.  Still has noted
    that electroencephalographic waves have been obtained in forty-three to
    forty-five day old fetuses, and so conscious experience is possible after this
    date."</EM><SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#12>12</A></SUP> With conscious experience, or soon after, comes the possibility
    of feeling pain.<P>

          The development of the central nervous system leading to "functioning neurological structures necessary for pain sensations" at an age
    between 8 to 13 1/2 weeks begins early in the child.  As was stated before,
    "commencing at eighteen days the developmental emphasis is on the
    nervous system"; and "by the end of the twentieth day the foundation of
    the child's brain, spinal cord and entire nervous system will have been
    established."<P>

           Turning to element (b), overt behavior expressive of pain, <EM>The Medical
    Evidence</EM> booklet tells us: "Concurrent with the development of the
    sensory structures is the emerging responsive behavior of the fetus.  By
    the end of the 5th week a tap on the mouth of the fetus will cause the lips
    to draw back."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#13>13</A></SUP><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           The <EM>Amicus Curiae</EM> states:<P>

           In the sixth to seventh weeks, nerves and muscles work together for
           the first time.  If the area of the lips, the first to become sensitive to
           touch, is gently stroked, the child responds by bending the upper body
           to one side and making a quick backward motion with his arms. . .<P>

                 In the ninth and tenth weeks, the child's activity leaps ahead.
           Now if the forehead is touched, he may turn his head away and pucker
           up his brow and frown.... In the same week, the entire body becomes

           <EM>The Medical Evidence</EM> adds:<P>

           By 10 weeks, the palms of the hands are sensitive to touch, and at 11
           weeks the face and extremities likewise respond to tactile stimuli.  By
           13 1/2 weeks, these responses are sufficiently elaborate and sufficiently avoidant to warrant the definite conclusion that the fetus
           responds aversively, not reflexively.  They evidence an integrated
           physiological attempt to escape noxious stimuli.  In response to
           experiments performed on 12 to 16 week fetuses, movements of the
           head, body, and limbs have been observed.  These movements were
           vigorous, and consisted of ventro- or dorsoflexion of the trunk, flexion
           of the limbs, and turning of the head, indicating the presence of acute
           fetal pain.  It is agreed that a fetus must be heavily sedated before
           intrauterine manipulation, such as transfusions, because such painful stimuli cause the fetus to move, making the procedure difficult.<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#15>15</A></SUP><P>

           The <EM>American Medical News</EM> reprint reports, "Physicians know that

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           Nerves connecting the spinal cord to peripheral structures have
           developed between six to eight weeks.  Adverse reactions to stimuli are
           observed between eight and 10 weeks.... You can tell by the contours
           on their faces that aborted fetuses feel pain," added obstetrician
         Matthew Bulfin, M.D., of Lauderdale by the Sea, Florida.  He described
         the case of a 25-year old woman administered a prostaglandin
         abortion, who expelled her fetus in the middle of the night.  Before
         hospital nurses arrived, she witnessed "the thrashing around and
         gruesome trauma on his face, and knew that the fetus had suffered."<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#16>16</A></SUP><P>


         <EM>The Medical Evidence</EM> concludes:<P>

         When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb, they did
         not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion
         as a child would.  But they soon learned that he would.  By no means
         a "vegetable," as he has so often been pictured, the unborn knows
         perfectly well when he has been hurt, and he will protest it just as
         violently as would a baby lying in a crib.<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#17>17</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

    <EM><A NAME=Objections></A>Objections and Replies</EM><P>

    <EM>First:</EM> "Suppose abortion causes pain to the child.  Causing someone pain
    is a frequent occurrence in medicine.  It is hardly a reason not to proceed
    with a medical procedure."<P>

         Granted, the causing of pain is a frequent occurrence in medicine.
    This by itself does not show that a particular instance or type of causing
    pain (as in abortions) is morally justified.  To be justified, at least three
    conditions must be fulfilled:<P>
<OL>
         <LI> There must be an overriding, justifying reason for causing the
    pain.  In a typical abortion, the woman wants to end an unwanted
    pregnancy.  Is this a sufficient reason for cutting a child to pieces, or
    subjecting her to an hour or more of burning?  Suppose we caused the
    woman that kind of pain to benefit the child.  Who would claim that this
    constituted a justifying reason?<P>

         <LI> In the normal medical case, the procedure benefits and hurts one
    and the same person.  We do something that causes a person pain but
    results in an overall benefit for him.  If two patients are involved, causing
    pain becomes much more problematic. Ordinarily, we cannot cause B
    pain for the sake of A. Only in extreme cases, for example, saving
    someone's life or preventing permanent paralysis, could one do this.  Even
    then, as the pain becomes greater, the justification becomes more difficult.  When the pain for B is very great, such as what may reasonably be
    inferred from dismemberment or saline burning, and the benefit for A is
    not commensurate with it, it is clear that this second condition is not met.<P>

        <LI> Pain should not be inflicted if there is a reasonable alternative.
   Couldn't an anesthesia be given to the child to eliminate any chance of
   pain?  Killing the child is the primary evil.  Causing her needless pain adds
   to the horror.<P>
</OL>

        <EM>Second:</EM> "The child in the womb cannot feel pain because he lacks a
   sufficiently developed physical basis for pain experience.  The brain and
   nervous system may be there but only in rudimentary form; what is
   missing is maturation."<P>

        <EM>Third:</EM> "The child in the womb cannot feel pain because pain involves
   not merely physical sensation, but also higher psychological functions,
   such as a certain degree of self-awareness, memory (of the immediately
   past sensation), and anticipation (of the immediate future).  Pain is a
   cognitive as well as a physical experience; and for such a cognitive
   experience to be possible, the cerebral cortex needs to be developed,
   which is not the case in the preborn child."<P>

        In reply to the second and third objections: No one knows that the
   child cannot feel pain.  The possibility of pain is surely there, and must be
   taken seriously.  Specifically:<P>

        (1) Look again at the saline procedure described at the beginning of
   this chapter.  "No one can imagine how excruciating the pain is." If the
   woman is affected by the saline solution, "the pain is so unbearable . . .
   [she] may throw herself off the table." This solution affects the whole body
   of the child, for an hour or more, a child that may be fourteen inches long
   and weigh about a pound and a half.  Suppose this child is not sufficiently
   developed to feel pain to the full extent, quantitatively and qualitatively,
   that we would feel pain under these conditions.  Suppose her pain is only
   ten or fifteen percent of what our pain would be.  Isn't that horrible enough
   for the child so that we ought to shrink back from inflicting this on her?
   Hold your hand to a warm-to-hot stove - that is less painful than the pain
   of being burned all over your body, but surely it is painful enough to
   shrink back from.  Hold your hand to the stove for just ten seconds - that
   is much less than one hour, but painful enough Similar consideration
   applies to D & E, where a well-developed child is cut to pieces.  Perhaps
   she feels much less pain than you would.  But ten to twenty percent of that
   is horrible enough.<P>

        (2) In regard to the point that the cortex is not sufficiently developed to allow for the cognitive elements in pain experience, it is
   possible that this may increase, rather than decrease, the intensity of the
   pain:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         While the likelihood of weak participation by the cerebral cortex will
         work against the magnification of the pain, there will also be an
         absence of the inhibitory input from the brain which modulates and
         balances the sensory input in more developed beings.  Consequently,
         the possibility exists of smaller and weaker sensory inputs having the
         same effect which later is achieved only by larger and stronger
         sensations.<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#18>18</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

         (3) The risk argument: Suppose there is some doubt in the minds of
    some people: "We do not know that the child feels pain." To which we must
    immediately add: "And we do not know that the child does not feel pain!"
    The evidence presented here - the presence of nerve endings and a
    functioning nervous system, the sharp knife or chemical solution, and the
    child's agitated attempt to escape - makes it at least extremely likely that
    the child does feel pain, probably excruciating pain.  We cannot risk
    causing such pain!<P>

         A deer is eaten alive by a tiger; a baby seal is clubbed and left to die
    on the ice.  One might argue that it is not known for sure if such animals
    feel pain, perhaps they are not enough like us to feel pain as we do.  But
    they are enough like us to make it overwhelmingly likely that they do feel
    terrible pain.  The same applies to the preborn child.<P>

         We shrink back from the risk of causing pain to animals because we
    identify with them: "If I were in his place I would not want to suffer such
    pain." If we identify with the child, we must say the same thing.<P>

         Would you do something that might cause terrible pain to a loved
    one?  Even if the probability of pain was fairly low?  If the probability of pain
    is as high as it is for the preborn child subject to the knife or chemical
    solution of abortion, one would certainly not risk the pain.  What is true
    for the born loved one should also be true for the preborn child.  It follows
    that one cannot risk causing the terrible pain probably associated with
    abortion.<P>

         (4) There is some evidence that the child of seven or eight weeks who
    is the victim of suction or D & C suffers pain in some way.  As the child
    advances to twelve weeks and beyond, the probability that he or she feels
    pain increases, to the point where it can hardly be doubted.  There is an
    increasing gradation.  As the child grows older, the physical elements
    necessary for suffering pain become more fully developed (brain, peripheral nervous system, etc.). This means that, as the child grows older, there
    is an increase in: (a) the likelihood that there is pain; (b) the physical
    intensity of the pain; (c) the psychological intensity of the pain: it is more
    fully experienced, and at a more conscious level; and (d) the length of time
    of the painful death, due to the methods of abortion corresponding to the
    child's size (one to two hours for saline, one to two days for prostaglandin).<P>

     <EM><A NAME=Concluding></A>Concluding Remarks</EM><P>

    This should emphatically not be taken as an argument for early abortions.
    <EM>There should be no abortions!</EM> For there should be no killing of innocent
    children.  Late abortions simply add a new horror: greater pain.  For the
    same reason, even if all abortions were painless, they would all be wrong.
    The pain of abortion simply adds a new evil to the evil of killing an innocent
    child.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          All this [pain] is happening right now, in our own cities, towns, and
          neighborhoods. If we avert our gaze from this ocean of pain - if we fail
          to acknowledge the excruciating death agonies of one and a half
          million tiny victims every year in the U.S. alone (one abortion every
          twenty-one seconds) - if we close our ears to all those "silent screams,"
          how can we still call ourselves compassionate human beings?<SUP><A HREF=notes3.htm#19>19</A></SUP>

    Abortion is a moral evil because it is the killing of a child, a person.  I have
    shown (in chapter 1) that the being in the womb is a small child.  I now
    want to reinforce this and show explicitly that he is a child all the way
    through pregnancy (chapters 4 and 5); that his existence begins at 
conception-fertilization (chapter 6), and that he is truly a person (chapter 7).<P>

         What is in the womb is a real child all the way through pregnancy.
    A major stumbling block to realizing this is the idea that there is a line to
    be drawn sometime during pregnancy or at its end, a line marking the end
    of <EM>potential</EM> human life and the beginning of actual human life.<P>

         This is not so.  Human life is a continuum; all the changes occurring
    during pregnancy and through birth are changes in the life of one and the
    same person.  I will now develop these points more specifically by
    examining ten suggested places to "draw a line" between nonperson and
    person.<P>

There seem to be four main reasons for suggesting that birth marks the
    beginning of human life.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#1>1</A></SUP> (1) At birth the child becomes fully independent
    of his mother. (2) He can be seen and touched. (3) He becomes a member
    of society. (4) Age is marked from one's day of birth.  Are any of these, if
    true or valid, morally relevant?  Do any of them, if true or valid, distinguish
    persons from nonpersons?<P>

         Regarding (1), the dependency of a child on his mother does not make
    him a nonperson or a lesser person.  The dependency of the child on his
   mother before birth says something about the state of his body, his bodily
   needs, his fragility; it says something about his phase of existence.  It says
   nothing about him as a person.  Dependent persons are persons.<P>

        Regarding (2), a child inside an opaque protective shell cannot be
   seen, nor can any person for that matter.  This indicates nothing about the
   status of his being.<P>

        Regarding (3), it is not true that a child in his mother's womb is not
   a member of society.  For a long time preceding birth, the mother knows
   the child is there, even if she knows little about him. That the child is
   known to be there and is expected makes him, in a very real sense, a
   member of human society.<P>

        Through instruments of modern technology, especially with fetoscopy
   and hysteroscopy, we can literally see the child and perform diagnoses
   and surgery on him.  As Dr. Nathanson tells us, "With fetoscopy we are
   looking at the child eyeball to eyeball, seeing it in living color."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#2>2</A></SUP> Surely
   anyone whom we can see, and perform surgery on, is a member of our
   society.<P>

        It is true, of course, that the child in the womb is not an active
   participant in society.  He cannot be! Part of the evil of abortion is that it
   takes unfair advantage of this.  He has no voice with which to defend
   himself.  Nonparticipation in society, far from being an argument for
   abortion, throws further light on its evil.  Abortion is the killing of a small
   person that takes unfair advantage of his not being among us as an active
   participant - like a shut-in, ignored, out of sight and out of mind.<P>

        (4) No one would have a birthday unless he were already there to be
   born.  A birthday is a day of entry.  But a person must already be in order
   to enter into something. That we mark our age from our birthday is simply
   a social custom we have.  The Chinese mark a person's age from
   conception.  Ours is a more convenient custom, because one's birth date
   is easily known.  One's conception date is not.<P>

        That birth should even be suggested as a line is incredible.  For the
   baby just before birth and just after birth is obviously the same child, and
   hardly different in appearance.  The baby just before birth is fully there,
   waiting to be born.  The doctor listens to his heartbeat, determines his
   position, and so on.  How could a change of location, from inside the
   mother to outside, change a nonperson into a person?  There is also a
   change in how nourishment (oxygen, food, water) is taken, from direct
   input to the stomach via the umbilical cord to breathing, eating, and
   drinking through the mouth.  How could such a change transform a
   nonperson into a person?  The irrelevance of birth is clearly explained by
   Nathanson.  Referring to the preborn child as <EM>alpha</EM>, he says:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          The most obvious change at birth is breathing, as the lungs are
          galvanized into activity.  Inside the uterus, alpha carries out spontaneous respiratory movements, but the lungs are not expanded since
          their function is not necessary and they are bathed in amniotic fluid.
          The routing of blood in the circulatory system and the intake of
          nutrients and the outgo of wastes are shifted.  All other functions of the
          newborn baby, even crying, may occur within the womb.  In terms of
          metabolism, biochemistry, brain and heart function, and most everything else, birth is an insignificant event, indeed a mythology.  At term,
          i.e., at the end of pregnancy, alpha's growth needs simply outstrip the
          ability of the placenta to supply food and oxygen, so the lungs and
          mouth must take over. The organism is put into a different physiological milieu - and nothing more.  It is like switching from AC to DC
          current; the energy connection changes, but the basic mechanics
          remain the same.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#3>3</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

          If birth is so irrelevant as a line, why is it nevertheless so widely
   accepted?  I suggest that the reason is not the status of the child, which
   is the same before and after.  Perhaps it is that the preborn child is more
   dependent on the mother, while after birth he is relatively independent.
   That is often the reason given for selecting birth as the line.  I think it hides
   a deeper reason; namely, the claim that a woman has "a right over her
   body," in the sense of "a right to an abortion." If one assumes this right,
   it becomes plausible to say that a woman may remove a being that is
   inside her and burdensome to her.  But if such a removal is killing,
   and killing persons is wrong, it must be held that this being is not a
   person.<P>

          Thus the impetus to make birth the line stems not from anything to
   do with the child, but from the desire to get rid of him.  He is in the way,
   and so he must be labeled the sort of being who may justifiably be
   terminated.  And he is in the way until birth.  That is why birth is selected
   as the place to draw the line.<P>

A second point suggested to draw the line between person and nonperson
   is viability.  Viability refers to the child's ability to live outside the womb.
   Why would one think that a postviability child is to be counted as a full
   person, a real baby, while a previability child should not be counted as a
   real person?<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#4>4</A></SUP> Three possible reasons come to mind. First (it is said), the
   child in the early stages, prior to viability, is part of his mothers body.  In
   being viable he shows his independence, that he is a distinct being.
  Second, the previability child is too intimately involved in the body of his
  mother to be his own person.  Third, the child after viability is too much
  like a born child to be dismissed as a nonperson, but this is not true of
  the child in the earlier stages.<P>

       The first and second points are simply false.  First, the child is not a
  part of his mother's body.  For example, their blood circulations normally
  do not mix; the child may have a different blood type from the mother, the
  child may be male, and his male body is obviously not part of his mother's
  female body.  Second, the intimate involvement of the child in his mother's
  body reflects his dependency on her.  But dependency does not affect
  personhood.  He is dependent because he is small and fragile; he needs the
  protective nest of his mother's womb.  This says something about his
  body, its state of development.  It says nothing about his status as a
  person.  Dependence on, and the ensuing involvement in, his mother's
  body simply reflects the state of his development along the continuum of
  human life.<P>

       In short, a previability child is simply one who has a greater need for
  his natural incubator, his mother's womb, than a postviability child does;
  just as a fragile, premature baby has a greater need for an artificial
  incubator than a stronger baby does.  Both are real babies. both are
  equally persons.<P>

       Third, even a child before viability (at ten weeks) looks like a familiar
  baby.  "By the end of the seventh week [long before viability at present] we
  see a well-proportioned small-scale baby."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#5>5</A></SUP> So this point does not
  establish viability as the place to draw the line.  Much more important,
  however, is that it creates confusion.  The fact that the baby in his very
  early stages doesn't look familiar to us, does not resemble what we are
  accustomed to as a baby, says very little about him.  He is what he is,
  regardless of resemblances.  That he is noticeably different from the highly
  developed baby in middle and late pregnancy and at birth is hardly
  surprising: he is near the beginning of his development.  Looking like a
  familiar baby means having the physical features of a familiar baby, and
  these take time to develop.  Before this time elapses, a less developed, and
  therefore a less familiar-looking, baby is just what we should expect.<P>

       The irrelevance of viability for the real status of the child becomes
  even more clear when we consider the following points.<P>

       First, viability is not a definite line, much less a morally significant
  one.  It can only properly refer to an extended period of time during which
  the probability of a child's surviving outside the womb increases.  Near the
  beginning of this time, the child might have only a twenty-five percent
  chance of surviving, later fifty percent, then seventy-five percent, still
  later perhaps ninety percent.  None of these, even assuming the figure
   could be accurately assessed, is able to mark the point of viability, and with
   it the alleged beginning of real human life.<P>

        Second, viability is not a real line because it is a constantly changing
   point.  According to Nathanson, writing in 1979, viability is around twenty
   to twenty-eight weeks.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#6>6</A></SUP> With advances in technology, it will be pushed
   back farther and farther, perhaps even to point zero with the creation of
   an artificial womb.  That is, viability is a function of advances in medical
   technology; it has nothing to do as such with the child.  It measures our
   ability to sustain human life, not the status of that life.  The same child will
   be viable given one degree of medical technology, not viable given another.
   Viability, then, cannot be the determining factor for whether the being in
   the womb is a real person or not.<P>

        Referring to the child in the womb as <EM>alpha</EM>, Nathanson says:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Viability is the current reflection of medical achievement and is too
         evanescent to deal with such a fundamental issue.  An infant could be
         "viable" in New York City but not in a rural U.S. town, or in the rural
         town but not in Bangladesh.  Everything is potentially viable; there are
         only limits of technology to overcome.  The lines are shifting, and they
         will shift to earlier and earlier points.  In the future, artificial incubation may make alpha "viable" at any time in pregnancy.  The whole
         concept of viability is currently in danger of obsolescence; one might
         even say that the concept itself is not viable.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#7>7</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        The child may be viable if he is New York City, but not if he is in
   Bangladesh.  Is he not the same being in either place?  If abortion is wrong
   in one place, it is equally wrong in the other place.<P>

        Third, the arbitrariness - indeed, the unfairness - of making viability the line at which to say that a real person begins to exist is well
   expressed by Blumenfeld.  Referring to a recent determination of viability,
   he asks:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Why choose viability as the cut-off point? The human fetus is not
         viable before the twenty-fourth week merely because its lungs are not
         sufficiently developed for outside respiration.  Nature decided that
         lung development could wait because it had nine full months in which
         to do its work.  It gave priority to brain, neural, sensory, skeletal,
         digestive, and circulatory development before it completed its work on
         the lungs.  So why penalize an unborn infant because nature decided
         to complete its kidneys before its lungs?<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#8>8</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        Fourth, viability has to do with environment.  That is, a previability
child can live only in a certain environment, his mothers womb, while a 
   postviability child can live either in his mother's womb or outside it.  For
   the previability child, this is simply an instance of a general truth: every
   organism needs its proper environment.  A fish can live only in water, not
   in dry air.  A cat can live only in dry air, not in the water.  Each is nonviable
   in the other's proper environment.  So too, an adult human being would
   be nonviable inside a uterus (if we imagine one large enough to hold him).
   Human beings are not viable in most parts of the universe, because they
   are too hot, or too cold, or lack oxygen, etc.  One class of human beings,
   those in the early stages of their development, are further restricted in
   regard to their viability.  But this concerns the relation of their bodies to
   an environment, not the reality of their being as persons. "The decisive
   objection to viability is that there is no reason to suppose that the fact that
   a given creature cannot live outside a given environment provides a
   reason why depriving it of that environment should be totally acceptable."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#9>9</A></SUP> There is still less reason why the creature may be killed in its
   present environment.<P>

Quickening refers to the time when the mother first feels the baby inside
   her, at approximately sixteen to seventeen weeks.  Quickening refers to
   the mother's perception of the baby's movements; it has nothing to do
   with the baby himself, who is there long before quickening.  In the very
   early phases of his existence he does not move, but he is there, and that
   is the important point.  Later he moves, but the mother cannot feel the
   movements; the important point is that he is there.  Dr. Liley states:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        Historically "quickening" was supposed to delineate the time when the
        fetus became an independent human being possessed of a soul.  Now,
        however, we know that while he may have been too small to make his
        motions felt, the unborn baby is active and independent long before
        his mother feels him.  Quickening is a maternal sensitivity and
        depends on the mother's own fat, the position of the placenta and the
        size and strength of the unborn child.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#10>10</A></SUP><P>

Sensitivity to pain might be suggested as a place to draw a line between
   person and nonperson.  After this point the baby suffers pain in being
   subjected to abortion, before he does not.  This surely is a morally relevant
   difference.  But the moral relevance of this line is not the difference
   between murder and non-murder, but rather between painless murder
   and painful murder.  Painless murder is still murder, a moral evil.  Painful
   murder is a greater evil.  So this line simply marks the difference between
   a moral evil and a greater moral evil.<P>
         That sensitivity to pain cannot mark the beginning of the person is
   too obvious to need much elaboration.  Someone who loses his sensitivity
   to pain through nerve damage is not thereby a nonperson.  That the very
   young preborn do not feel pain is simply an aspect of their gradual
   development.  It says nothing about their status as persons.<P>

Richard Werner argues "that being a sentient human being is the relevant
   criterion for being a fully fledged member of the moral community, for
   having full moral rights. . . . "<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#11>11</A></SUP> The argument is based on the idea "that
   we have no obligations except when some improvement or impairment of
   someone's life is involved ... [and] also that we have a prima facie
   obligation <EM>whenever</EM> this is involved."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#12>12</A></SUP><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
         Werner states his argument as follows:<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

         Simply put, one cannot make a creature's life good or bad, better or
         worse unless that creature is capable of experiencing and, in particular, capable of experiencing pleasure, satisfaction, happiness, pain,
         dissatisfaction, or anguish.  One cannot help or harm another creature unless that creature is capable of help or harm, capable of having
         experiences consonant with help or harm.  Clearly, a creature that has
         no experiences is not capable of having experiences consonant with
         helping or harming the creature.  If the creature is destroyed before it
         becomes sentient, appeal to the better or worse condition of its future
         experiences is irrelevant.  Hence, one cannot have moral obligations to
         a being that is not sentient and will not become sentient and, thereby,
         such a being cannot have moral rights.<P>

                In the case of a being that is not yet sentient but will become
         sentient, certainly we can help or harm this being by an action we
         perform today that will affect the future experiences of the being.
         However, it would seem that our moral obligations are not to the
         nonsentient being that now exists.  So a being would not have rights
         until it became sentient.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#13>13</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         In reply, the mere addition of sentience cannot turn a nonperson into
   a person.  If there is no person before sentience, adding this feature will
   not transform it into a person.  An insentient frog does not become a
  person by acquiring sentience.  And if there is a person after sentience is
  acquired, that being must already have been there, as the being who
  acquires this feature, as the same being who first lacks sentience then has
  it. Sentience comes about through physical development of the being who
  is there, before and after sentience is attained.<P>

       After sentience is acquired, there is a being who can function as a
  person on an elementary level; for example, he can feel pain.  But his being
  a person is not affected by this; he was that already.  An adult who is awake
  can function as a person: feel pain, think, communicate, etc.  But he is
  equally a person, the same person, when he is under anesthesia, even
  though he cannot then function as a person since he temporarily lacks
  sentience.<P>

       Sentience, then, does not affect the <EM>being</EM> in question (whether
  person or not), but only a capacity of certain beings (persons, animals) to
  <EM>function</EM> as sentient beings, for example, feel pain.<P>

       To kill a small, very young, nonsentient baby in the womb, or to kill
  an adult under anesthesia, both are cases of killing a nonsentient being
  who, were he not killed, would wake up to sentience.  The only difference
  is that the child was never sentient while the adult was.  But this makes
  no moral difference.  To kill the child is to deprive him of the only sentient
  existence he would ever have.  If anything, abortion is therefore a still
  greater evil.<P>

       Suppose, through some strange disease, a baby were born insentient
  and did not acquire sentience until, say, age one.  Would it be right to kill
  such a child after birth?  But if not after birth, why before birth?  If not
  when the insentience is abnormal, why when it is normal?<P>

       That a baby in the very early phases of her existence in the womb is
  insentient simply means that she is in a kind of deep sleep.  This says
  something about the level of her development; it says nothing about her
  as a person.  Clearly, sentience is not a place to draw the line.  It represents
  merely the acquisition of another characteristic by the child in the womb,
  a further dimension of her development.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#14>14</A></SUP><P>

It is also argued that the line between nonperson and person may be
  drawn at the development of a familiar human form.  In the very early
  stages of his development, a human being lacks certain features.  He will
  soon have, and maintain, these through the remainder of his time in the
  womb and after birth.  These features make him look familiar to us,
  because he resembles born persons. What is important here is to realize
  that familiar human form is a relative concept.  After certain developments
  are completed, the child looks familiar to us, because he looks more and
  more like us.  In reality, he is the same being all along.  His status as a
  person is unaffected by these physical developments and by how these
  developments appear to us.<P>

         Before certain developments are completed, the child in the womb
  lacks <EM>familiar</EM> human form.  But he does have human form, he does look
  human; that's what we all looked like when we were at that stage of our
  existence.  If fetoscopy and hysteroscopy and similar techniques become
  widespread and more advanced, so that we can all watch tiny babies grow
  as a matter of course, these babies would begin to look familiar to us.  So,
  familiar human form does not designate a characteristic of the being in
  the womb, but rather something about us.  Since it is not a characteristic
  of the being in the womb, it cannot mark the time when he becomes a
  person.<P>

         In short, it is not how the child looks to us, or if he is familiar to us,
  that is important.  What is important is his own status, what he really is.
  He is essentially the same being before and after acquiring (what we now
  call) familiar human form; if he is a person after, he cannot be a nonperson
  before merely because he looks unfamiliar to us.  Hence, familiar human
  form cannot be the place to draw the line.  It is merely an aspect of the
  development of the child in the womb, the same child all the way through
  the various phases of development.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#15>15</A></SUP><P>

  Baruch Brody holds that it is the presence of a functioning brain that
  marks the beginning of a human person's existence.  He argues:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         The property of having a functioning brain (or, at least, a brain that,
         if not functioning, is susceptible of function) is one that every human
         being must have because it is essential for its being human, by the
         time that an entity acquires that property, it has all the other
         properties that are essential for being human; the class of human
         beings is a natural kind; therefore, when the fetus acquires that
         property, it becomes a human being.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#16>16</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         This, Brody says, occurs at about the end of the sixth week.  Before
  that, he holds, the being in the womb is not a human being.  He offers two
  arguments to support his view - that the fetus becomes a human being
  about six weeks after conception."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#17>17</A></SUP> Both rest on "the fact that electroencephalographic waves are noticeable at that time, and therefore the
  fetal brain must clearly be functioning."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#18>18</A></SUP> The first of these arguments is:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         The absence of electroencephalographic waves has come to be regarded by physicians as the indicator of the moment of death, the
         moment at which the entity in question is no longer a human being.
         So on grounds of symmetry, it would seem appropriate to treat the appearance of such waves as the indicator of the moment at which the
         entity in question becomes a human being.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#19>19</A></SUP><P>
</FONT>

        The second argument is:<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
         One of the characteristics essential to a human being is the capacity
         for conscious experience, at least at a primitive level.  Before the sixth
         week, as far as we know, the fetus does not have this capacity.
         Thereafter, as the electroencephalographic evidence indicates, it
         does.  Consequently, that is the time at which the fetus becomes a
         human being.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#20>20</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        The first argument, the <EM>symmetry argument</EM>, states that if the
  absence of brain waves indicates the death of a person, his ceasing to
  exist as a human being, then it must be the presence of such waves that
  indicates his coming into existence.  Before that, when he is in the embryo
  stage of his existence, he is, according to this argument, not a human
  person.  There are several reasons why this argument is fallacious.<P>

        First, in an adult, the loss of certain brain waves, indicating the
  cessation of brain activity, implies (or is taken to imply) death.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#21>21</A></SUP> But the
  absence of brain waves in an embryo obviously does not indicate that he
  is dead.  Far from it, he is very much alive.  In fact, it would be very strange
  if he did have brain waves.  In an adult, brain death (defined with sufficient
  precision) implies death of the whole body, of the person.  This simply does
  not apply to the embryo.  And the reason for this asymmetry is plain: an
  adult needs a brain to live, an embryo does not.  The loss or absence of
  brain activity is not in itself crucial for deciding life or death, the presence
  or absence of a person.  It is only crucial for certain human beings, namely
  those who have reached phases of development where the presence of
  brain activity is essential for life.  The embryo has simply not reached this
  phase, so for him the absence of brain activity is not crucial.  That is, it is
  not the lack of something essential for life but, on the contrary, something
  perfectly normal.<P>

        Second, another aspect of this asymmetry is that in an embryo there
  is the mere <EM>absence</EM> of brain activity, while in an older person or an adult
   who no longer has brain activity, there is something essentially different:
   there is the <EM>death</EM> of the brain, the dying of an organ that had been alive.
   There is simply no symmetry between a dead brain and the absence of a
   brain, or between a brain that no longer functions because it has fatally
   deteriorated and the absence of a functioning brain that has not yet
   developed, because the time is not ripe.<P>

        Third, in an adult the cessation of brain functioning must be
   irreversible to constitute the death of the person.  If the brain is merely
   temporarily out of order, its role perhaps taken over by machines, then
   the patient is clearly not dead.  If he still has the potential to function as
   a person (to think, to communicate, etc.), though incapable of functioning
   at present, then surely he is a person now.  But this is precisely what the
   embryo has: the potential to function as a person, though incapable of
   this at present.  The person with irreversible loss of his brain function has
   no future on this earth; the embryo indeed has a future.  There is clearly
   a world of difference between no brain activity in the sense of "no more"
   and in the sense of "not yet." If a human being with irreversible "no more"
   is dead, it does not follow that a human being whose lack of brain activity
   has the character of "not yet" is dead, or otherwise not a human being.  A
   human being with "not yet" is simply in an early phase of his existence.
   He is "not yet" displaying brain functioning because he has not yet
   reached that phase of his existence where this is appropriate.  We throw
   out food that has lost its nourishing power, that has it "no more": we do
   not, however, throw out food that has "not yet" developed its nourishing
   power.  We wait, and give it a chance.  This is what we must do with human
   beings in their embryonic stage.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#22>22</A></SUP><P>

        The second argument advanced by Brody is, "One of the characteristics essential to a human being is the capacity for conscious experience,
   at least at a primitive level." Since the embryo lacks this capacity, it is not
   a human being.<P>

        This is essentially the same argument as the one previously discussed, that sentience marks the beginning of a human person's existence.  We have seen that this is false; that an unsentient person (for
   example, someone under anesthesia) is as much a real person as one who
   is sentient.  He temporarily lacks a capacity that the rest of us have.  This
   does not change his nature as a person.<P>

        We may also say, in a deeper sense, that the child in his embryonic
   stage does have "the capacity for conscious experience." For he is already
   the kind of being who normally has conscious experiences.  He has the
   capacity, but it is still dormant, undeveloped.  For he now already has
   what will become his brain; it must unfold, develop, grow, be nourished.&nbsp;<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#23>23</A></SUP><P>

       A succinct, and conclusive, refutation of the idea that it is only when
  a functioning brain is present that a human being comes into existence
  is that there must already be a human being in existence for the brain to
  emerge as a functioning organ.  "<EM>Only a human being can develop a human
  brain, a human brain cannot develop before a human being exists.</EM>"<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#24>24</A></SUP><P>

       Finally, we should be point out that even if Brody's argument for
  drawing the line at functioning brain were successful, it would be of little
  help to the abortion cause.  That line is at about six weeks, and most
  surgical abortions take place after that time, beginning at about seven or
  eight weeks.  Such abortions are morally wrong regardless of whether the
  line should be drawn at six weeks or earlier.  The significance of refuting
  Brody's line is to help gain a clear understanding of the nature of the child
  in the womb all the way through pregnancy.  This applies equally to the
  three remaining lines to be considered.<P>

Heartbeat begins by day twenty-five, very early in the life of the child.  One
  might think this an appropriate place to distinguish between a nonperson
  and a person because it seems that a heartbeat is essential to being alive.
  But what is really essential to being alive is what results from the
  heartbeat: circulation of the blood, nourishment of the different parts of
  the body.  If the body can be nourished and sustained in other ways, then
  a heartbeat is no longer essential to being alive.  And this, of course, is
  what applies to the zygote-embryo before day twenty-five.<P>

       A heartbeat is a familiar sign of life, but not an essential one.  Even
  an adult can be alive without a beating heart, if its function is taken over
  by a heart-lung machine.<P>

        A functioning heart is one more aspect of what develops in the
  growing child as he exists in the womb.  He is the same being both before
  and after; the development of the heart occurs within the growth process
  that characterizes a child's early existence in the womb.  There is no
  essential difference before and after, just more development after.<P>

About seven or eight days after conception, the tiny zygote implants in the
  wall of the uterus, after floating down the fallopian tube.  Nathanson, in
  <EM>Aborting America</EM>, suggested why implantation might be selected as the
   beginning of human life: "Biochemically, this is when alpha [the zygote]
   announces its presence as part of the human community by means of its
   hormonal messages, which we now have the technology to receive.  We
   also know biochemically that it is an independent organism distinct from
   the mother."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#25>25</A></SUP><P>

        But clearly the time when a being announces its presence is not
   identical with the time when it comes into being.  It may already <EM>be</EM> before
   it is <EM>known</EM> or it may be and be known by one person and not another,
   or in one way and not another.

	<P>

The tenth and final point where a line may be drawn between a nonperson
   and a person is at segmentation.  Identical twins develop from a single
   conceptus, formed at conception-fertilization by the union of sperm and
   ovum. The conceptus divides and twins result.  This can occur up until the
   time of segmentation, roughly seven to eight days after conception.  Hence
   segmentation marks a real line in human development, but is it the point
   at which human life begins?<P>

        Why might someone think this is so?  A human person is essentially
   one, an absolute individual.  A person cannot be split in two.  Since the
   conceptus that divides to form two identical twins obviously does split, it
   cannot be an individual.  Hence it cannot be a person, and a person cannot
   be said to exist prior to segmentation.  Hence (it is argued) segmentation
   marks the beginning of a human person's existence.<P>

        It is certainly true that a person is an individual who cannot be split
   in any way.  But it does not follow from this that segmentation is the place
   to draw the line, that the individual human person does not exist prior to
   segmentation.<P>

        First, consider the case where twinning does not, and cannot, occur.
   This is where the conceptus is, and always will be, an individual.  Here the
   problem discussed above does not arise.  For there is simply one conceptus who is one individual person.  That another conceptus is different,
   since it has the potential to split, says nothing about the first absolutely
   single conceptus.<P>

        Second, there will be, or can be, twins (or possibly other multiple
   births) stemming from one conceptus.  There is no reason for saying that
   the individuals who result from the twinning process came into existence
   at that time, and did not exist prior to it, from the moment of 
conception-fertilization.  Rather, they existed together in one conceptus, and at
   segmentation (or prior to it) they separated.  It is clearly possible for two
   individual persons to exist somehow bodily joined together, especially at
   the very beginning of their physical development.<P>

        Consider Siamese twins, joined together at the head, or perhaps
   back to back.  There are different degrees being joined imaginable, and
   the two individual persons joined together in one conceptus before they
   divide at segmentation are joined in the closest way imaginable.  Just as
   each of the Siamese twins is an individual person, though joined to
   another person, so each of the two newly-conceived persons is an
   individual person, though joined - in this case much more closely - to
   another individual person.  The two individuals joined together in one
   conceptus are an extreme case of what we see in a much milder form in
   Siamese twins: two individual persons joined together.<P>

        That two individual persons can "co-exist" in one body (hence be
   present before segmentation) is illustrated vividly in this instance.  On the
   television show "That's Incredible!" on March 2, 1981, an interesting story
   was told.  A person had recurring headaches, which resisted the usual
   cure.  Diagnosis revealed a kind of tumor, which was then removed from
   his brain area by surgery.  It was benign, and it turned out to be a
   misplaced twin, stunted in growth.<P>

        This story is very significant.  Consider two sets of twins, and
   designate them case A and case B. Case A refers to the case on "That's
   Incredible," from whose brain area this "tumor" was removed.  He is a
   human being from conception; he has a twin who never develops, and
   breaks off, but remains somehow attached to him.  Case B refers to
   another human being, brought into existence at conception; in his case
   his twin breaks off at segmentation and develops on his own, into an adult
   human being, just like his twin.  What is different in the two cases is the
   fate of the second member of the set of twins: in case A this second
   member remains joined to the first member, while in case B the second
   member separates and develops on his own.  The first members of each set
   are alike, not only in that each develops into an adult, but also in that each
   began his life joined to another human being.  And, of course, that is the
   crucial point.  In their first days of existence, before the time of segmentation, the twins in cases A and B were not so different.  Each was a case
   of two human beings joined in one body.<P>

        If segmentation were the beginning of human existence, it would
   mean that no human person could exist before segmentation.  But the
   person described on the television show obviously did exist before his
   segmentation: his being separated from his twin lodged in his brain.  It
   follows that segmentation cannot be held to be the beginning of human
   existence.  Not only is there no reason to believe it is the place to draw the
   line, there is every reason for saying it cannot be the place to draw the line.<P>

         In short, human development is largely a matter of unfolding.  The
   development of the child in the womb, especially at the early stages, up
   to eight weeks - after which "no further primordia will form; <EM>everything</EM> is
   already present that will be found in the full term baby"<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#26>26</A></SUP> is a series of
   unfoldings, of moving from the potential to the actual, on the part of the
   being who is already an actual reality, whose actual reality underlies
   these unfoldings, in whom they occur, and of whom they are developments. "Though his parts are not yet fully expressed, a whole new human
   being is there, and he manifests his fully given reality by growing."<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#27>27</A></SUP> The
   potential for the brain is already there at conception-fertilization, it only
   needs to unfold.  Now this unfolding sometimes includes the unfolding of
   two separate bodies, in the case of identical twins.  Potentially the two
   bodies are there all along; the actual separation takes some time.
   Segmentation represents, not the beginning of human existence, but a
   certain stage of development; when, in the case of identical twins, their
   bodies actually separate.


   <EM>Conclusion</EM><P>

   Thus at each of the places suggested for drawing the line, the being in the
   womb is essentially the same on either side of that line.  He may be a little
   larger and a little more developed, but he is the same being, the same
   human person, before and after.  He acquires nothing at any of these
   suggested places that would transform him into something else, as the
   fairy-tale frog is transformed into a charming prince.  Here would be a
   radical break, a real place to draw a line.<SUP><A HREF=notes4.htm#28>28</A></SUP> Nothing of this sort occurs at
   any of these places.  Rather, what we have is like the tadpole developing
   into a mature frog, a development in the life of one and the same being.<P>

        What all this means is, among other things, that the often-heard
   question, "At what point, or stage, in pregnancy does a human person
   begin to exist?" is a false question.  That is, it rests on a false premise: that
   there is a point or stage during pregnancy (or at its end in birth) at which
   a human person begins to exist. There is not.  The person is there all along.<P>

       "No  one  knows  when human life begins." Let  me  call  this  the 
  <EM>agnostic position</EM>.<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#1>1</A></SUP> I 
offer two basic replies: (1) The position is not 
  tenable; (2) even if it were, it would not support abortion.<P>

<OL>
<LI> What can it  mean  to  adopt  this 
  position?  First, it could be said that a person begins to be when  the 
  soul  is infused into the body (or some similiar event), and  that  no 
  one  knows  when this occurs. Second, it could mean that we  do  not  know 
  which  features make the being in the womb a person, or when  these 
  features come to be. <P>

       First,  if  a person comes to be at the moment when  the  soul  is 
  infused  into  the body, then this represents a radical  break,  before 
  which  there is no person, after which there is. That there is  such  a 
  radical   break,  and  that  we  can  know  when  it  is   (conception-fertilization),  will  be  shown  in the  <A HREF=6-1.htm>next chapter</A>.  That  is  one 
  refutation of the agnostic position.<P>

       Second,  (a) We do know  which 
  features  make the being a person, namely his identity with  the  being 
  who is later clearly a person: I was once a being in my mother's womb; 
  I am now that same person. And we do know when this feature comes  to  be: 
  conception-fertilization.<P>

       (b)  We  also know  that  a  person does  not  come  into  being  after 
  conception-fertilization, as was shown by refuting each of the proposed 
  lines: none of them mark the beginning of being a person. Thus  reply 
  (b) confirms the validity of reply (a).<P>

       (c)  When  those who adopt the agnostic position say we do  not  know  
which 
  features make a person or when they appear, it is likely that  they 
  have in mind capacities such as sentience and the relative  independence 
  of  being  able to live outside the womb. But these capacities  do  not 
  constitute  being a person, which is our theme here (When  does  human 
  life begin?  When does a person come into existence?)  Thus part of the 
  fallaciousness  of the agnostic position is often a  confusion  between 
  <EM>being</EM> a person and <EM>functioning</EM> as a person; for 
example sentience,  thought. 
  The position is agnostic about which features to designate as 
  the beginning of being a person when in fact the features it  considers 
  are of significance only with respect to functioning as a person.<P>

<LI>Even  if  the agnostic position were tenable,  it  would  not 
  support  abortion. Let us grant, for the sake of argument, that  we  do 
  not know when a person comes into being. There is a gradual development 
  of a being; at an unknown point it becomes a person. Call this point X. 
  Now surely we can specify a point in the life of a human being when it certainly 
is a person. Call such a point Y. Now consider the stage immediately prior 
  to  point  Y. Surely there is an extremely high  probability  that  the 
  being is a person already then. As we move backward in time, towards X, 
  that  probability, though it diminishes gradually as we go back,  still 
  remains  very high. It remains a  significant probabilty for the 
  following  reasons:  (a) It is the same being all the way  through,  at 
  every point.  (b) The changes that occur from point to point are 
  only  changes in size and level of development; development of what  is 
  already  there, the essential structure of the being. This  applies  to 
  all  points.   (c)  Thus all the points that precede  point  Y  are 
  essentially  similar in regard to the significance of  the  probability 
  that  a  person is there. Since there is a high  probability  that  the 
  being is a person at the points immediately preceding Y, there must  be 
  at  least a very significant probability that he is a person  at 
  all the earlier points.<P>

       Therefore,  even  if we do not know what point X is, 
and  when  it 
  occurs,  we  do  know  one very important thing  about  
it:  it  occurs 
  somewhere  along  a  continuum  of  development,  where   
every   point 
  represents  a significant probability that a person is 
there.  So  this 
  reply  to the agnostic position is essentially very 
simple: Even if  we 
  do not have the <EM> certainty</EM>  of knowing<EM>  
precisely</EM>  when a 
person begins  to 
  exist  (since,  by hypothesis, we do not know when X is),  
we  have  a 
  continuum - the whole time the being is in the womb - 
during which  there 
  is a  <EM>significant probability </EM> that a person 
exists.<P>

       Significant probability can be illustrated in the 
following way. 
A  person you love is lost at sea. You 
  don't  know if he is still alive.  But if there is a 
chance that he is alive, and that he  can  be 
  found and rescued, you proceed with the rescue efforts. 
The probability 
  may  be small, but you proceed nonetheless. As long as the  
probability 
  is  of  some significance you proceed. <P>

As long as there is a  significant 
  probability that human life exists, we must assume it is 
there, and act 
  accordingly: we cannot kill this being. If there is 
someone  present, 
  who,  as  far  as you can tell, is either dead or alive,  
you  must  of 
  course  treat  him as being alive. Even if the probability 
that  he  is 
  still  alive  is  low (he has been severely  injured  and  
is  not 
  moving), you cannot treat him as dead. You must give him 
the benefit of 
  the  doubt.  You cannot, for instance, dismember him to  
get  a  bodily 
  organ, even if doing so would save the life of another 
person. As  long 
  as  death is not certain, a person must be treated as 
alive.  If  you 
  were  in  the  position  of  the victim,  and  in  fact  
alive,  though 
  seemingly  dead to an onlooker, you would certainly want 
to be  treated 
  as alive.               <P>

Even if it is claimed that the probability is very low  that 
  the  being  in the womb in the early stages is a person,  
it  is  still 
  wrong  to destroy this being, parallel to the accident 
victim. We  must 
  always  give  the benefit of any doubt to the presense of  
human  life. 
  Where  there  is a significant probability, even a low  
one,  that 
  human  life exists, we must treat it as such: we must show 
it  respect, 
  we  may  not  destroy it. Therefore, even  on  the  
agnostic  position, 
  abortions (including very early ones) are wrong, because 
they destroy a 
  being who deserves our respect.<P>

     Any plausibility the agnostic position might have is 
limited to  the 
  very,  very early stages of pre-natal life, when the being 
in  question 
  is  extremely  small and does not look like a familiar 
baby. It  is  to 
  this  time that the argument above mainly applies. Recall 
that at seven weeks, 
 "we see a well proportioned small scale baby"; and at  
eight 
  weeks, "<EM>everything</EM>  is already present that will 
be found in  the  full 
  term baby." At this stage it cannot reasonably be doubted 
that a  small 
  child is present. The probability that it is a small 
person is not just 
  significant, which includes low probabilites as well as 
high  ones, 
  but   overwhelming.

   Another reaction to the failure to establish a line at which a human person
   begins to exist is to hold that there is no specific place at which human
   life begins, that it is a gradual process.  At the beginning (so goes the
   theory) there is no real person, only a potential person; at the end there
   is a real person.  And there is no point at which the one changes into the
   other.  It is gradual development, like day to night and youth to old age.
   So reads the <EM>gradualist position</EM>.<P>

        The gradualist position justifies abortion in this manner: "At the
   early stages, abortion is either morally justified or only a lesser evil.  As one
   progresses through the stages, abortion becomes progressively more
   wrong, a more serious evil, until the killing of this being becomes the
   moral equivalent of killing a born person.  Because of this, earlier
   abortions are more easily justified than later abortions."<P>

          The impetus for adopting the gradualist position is not only the
   recognition of the impossibility of drawing a line, but also the closely
   related idea that a baby about to be born seems very much like one of us,
   while a zygote or embryo seems very different and that there is a gradual
   development from the one to the other.  As Foot expresses it:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          One of the reasons why most of us feel puzzled about the problem of
          abortion is that we want, and do not want, to allow to the unborn child
          the rights that belong to adults and children.  When we think of a baby
          about to be born it seems absurd to think that the next few minutes
          or even hours could make so radical a difference to its status; yet as
          we go back in the life of the foetus we are more and more reluctant to
          say that this is a human being and must be treated as such.<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#2>2</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

          Corresponding to this is the idea "that abortion ... become[s] harder
   and harder to justify as pregnancy proceeds."<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#3>3</A></SUP><P>

          The gradualist position is, then, the thesis that "personhood is a
   quality the developing human creature acquires gradually."<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#4>4</A></SUP><P>

          Let me offer three replies to this position.  First, the theory is at best
   a mere hypothesis.  It is not known to be true.  There is no evidence for it.
   The quotation from Philippa Foot merely expresses how many people feel
   about the developing being (namely puzzled).  It says nothing about the
   facts of the matter, whether the being is a person or not, or when and how
   it comes into being as a person.<P>

          To be validly adopted as a theory of the coming into being of
   persons - and as a basis for deciding the moral question of abortion - the
   gradualist position would have to be established with an extremely high
   degree of probability.  Failing this, there would be a significant probability
   that it was false, and therefore a significant probability that human life
   actually exists during all the stages to which it is applied.  As was shown
   above, we must always give the benefit of any doubt to the presence of
   human life.  Where there is a significant probability (even a low one) that
   human life is present, we must treat it as such; we may not destroy it.<P>

          Second, the theory is not even a reasonable hypothesis.  It is false; it
   cannot possibly be true.  Let me bring this out in three closely related
   ways:<P>

          (1) There is a gradual process in the <EM>development</EM> of a person,
   physical and psychological, but there can be no gradual process in the
   <EM>being</EM> of a person.  Many years ago when I was a child, I was less developed,
   physically, psychologically, spiritually.  But that child was <EM>me</EM>, the same
   person I am now.  No matter how much less developed I was then, I was
   not less me.  I was myself, a fully real person, a whole person.  As a small
  newborn baby, my development was very incomplete.  But it was my
  development - the development of <EM>me</EM>, a whole person - that was incomplete.  If I continue my imaginary journey backward in time, I discover
  myself as a tiny baby in my mother's womb.  Going back farther, I find less
  and less development, but it is always <EM>me</EM>.  The potential for development
  is all there, and it takes time to actualize.  But this occurs in the life of a
  person.  It is I who undergo this development.<P>

       The gradualist position points to gradual development.  But this
  refers not to the <EM>being</EM> of a person, but to his capacity to <EM>function</EM> as a
  person. The growing person gradually becomes conscious, aware of
  himself and his surroundings, and acquires the capacity to communicate, to think, to make up his own mind, and so forth.  So, too, the body
  gradually develops, mostly during the first seven weeks.  All this development takes place in the life of one and the same person, who is there all
  the way through, who is the being to whom this development applies.<P>

       A less developed person is not less of a person.  A child of four is not
  less of a person because he has not yet matured sexually.  So too, a baby
  in the early phases of his existence is not less of a person because he has
  not yet matured, as he will later on, in the womb and after birth.<P>

       (2) There can be no such thing as half a person.  If a person does not
  exist fully as a person, he does not exist at all.  He may be only half awake,
  or only semi-rational; but if he exists, he is a full person.  Now consider the
  gradualist position: At the beginning there is no person, there is only
  potential, at the end there is a person, and in between a person gradually
  comes to be.  Consider what is roughly the halfway point in this process.
  What would we have there?  A being who is "half-person"?  But that is
  impossible; there cannot be half a person, or a "half-person." A being who
  is fully a person?  Then the theory is abandoned.  A being who is not at all
  a person?  Again the theory is abandoned.<P>

       In short, if a person comes into being at a certain point during
  pregnancy, we have one of the lines previously refuted.  If he comes into
  being gradually, there must be some point at which he is, roughly, half
  there: half person, half nonperson.  But that is impossible.  Since the
  gradualist position essentially involves an impossibility, it must be false.<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#5>5</A></SUP><P>

       (3) What lies behind the gradualist position is, I think, a certain
  picture of the development of a being, the "assembly line picture." Imagine
  an assembly line where cars are made.  At the beginning there is relatively
  little, a frame perhaps, but surely nothing that could be called a car.  At
  the end there is a car; it can be driven off the assembly line by its own
  power.  Where, in between, does the car come into being?  There is no
  specific place; it is a gradual process.  There is "less car" in the earlier
  phases, and "more car" in the later ones.  When such a picture is applied
   to the being in the womb, the gradualist position results.  But there is a
   fallacy here: a person is <EM>totally unlike</EM> a car, and the gradualist picture
   completely falsifies the being of a person, and with it his gradual
   development.  A car is constituted by its parts, in proper relationship to
   each other.  It comes into being when these parts are all there, assembled
   properly.  A person is not made up of parts; if he were, there could be such
   a thing as "half a person," namely half those parts.<P>

        Consider a newborn baby.  The reality of this being is not a sum of
   parts properly ordered, as in a car.  She is a <EM>person</EM>, a small, young person,
   with a lot of growing ahead of her.  Exactly the same applies to the baby
   in the womb, who is smaller, less developed, in a different environment,
   and more dependent, but essentially the same, a <EM>person</EM>.  She too is not
   a "sum of parts properly ordered." The assembly line picture is absolutely
   inapplicable to her.  And if this picture is inapplicable to the child in the
   womb, so is the gradualist position that is based on it.<P>

        Third, there is another way of seeing the failure of the gradualist
   position as an answer to the question of the beginning of a person's
   existence.  That is by confronting it with the "time frame" problem.  It is
   clear that human beings develop, from the beginning of their existence,
   during the time in the womb, during infancy, through childhood, to
   puberty, and to maturity.  At first it is a development that is largely
   physical, but soon the psychological development begins and expands.
   The physical development does not, of course, end with birth.  According
   to the gradualist position, this is a development that is itself the coming
   into existence of a person.  At the beginning (according to this view) there
   is no person at all, only an "organism." As this organism grows and
   develops, it gradually becomes a person; as the entity on the assembly line
   gradually becomes a car, as youth gradually turns into old age.  At the
   beginning, there is no person, at the end there is a full person, in between
   there is a partial person, or a being that is not a person "in the full sense."<P>

        It follows that on the gradualist position a baby is not a real person,
   only a "person in the making." But of course this is not limited to preborn
   babies.  It applies to post-born babies as well.  A baby at birth is a being
   farther along the path to becoming a person "in the full sense" than a child
   in the womb, but "he" is not there yet.  In fact, at birth he is far from being
   even half there in terms of psychological development, though his
   physical development is nearly complete.<P>
        Hence the gradualist position implies the thesis that a born baby is
   "less a person" than an older child or an adult; that a one-year-old child
   is "less a person" than a two-year-old; a two-year-old, than a 
three-year-old; and so on.  But this is clearly absurd.  The younger child is less
 developed, knows less, has fewer skills, etc., than an older child or an
 adult.  But he is equally a person; he has the same dignity as the rest of
 us. I was not "less a person" when I was younger and immature; I was
 <EM>myself</EM>, the <EM>same person</EM> I am now.<P>

      The gradualist position correlates the wrongness of killing a being
 that is (allegedly) "developing into a person" with the degree of development attained.<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#6>6</A></SUP> It follows  that killing a small baby is less wrong than
 killing an older baby or an adult.  A series of killings of babies would
 become gradually less wrong as one went from older babies to newborns.
 This is absurd.  But it follows necessarily from the Gradualist Position.  We
 must conclude that a theory which entails such absurd and clearly false
 consequences must itself be false.  Pointing to these consequences
 provides a <EM>reductio ad absurdum</EM><SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#7>7</A></SUP> of the gradualist position.<P>

      Philip Devine, in his criticism of the gradualist position, recognized
 this point when he said, "Moreover, if personhood or humanity admits of
 degrees before birth, then it would seem that it must admit of degrees after
 birth as well."<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#8>8</A></SUP><P>

      What a defender of abortion who adopts the gradualist position
 wants is a "becoming of the person" limited to the time of pregnancy, so
 that early killings are less wrong and easier to justify than later ones.  But
 what the gradualist position <EM>actually produces</EM> is a view that implies the
 same result for a whole class of human beings after birth as well; namely,
 that they, too, are not "persons in the whole sense," but only "partial
 persons" who are still in the process of becoming persons, and that earlier
 killings (e.g., born babies) are less wrong and easier to justify than later
 ones.<P>

      Now the abortion advocate may try to block this by holding that the
 development of a nonperson into a person is completed at some time
 within pregnancy.  This would require a line marking the end of the
 <EM>development</EM> of the being of a person before birth.  Could there be such a
 line?  Clearly not, for the simple reason that the "development of a person"
 does not stop within the time in the womb but continues well into the time
 after birth.  A line to mark the <EM>end</EM> of the <EM>development</EM> of a person during
 the time in the womb is as absurd and arbitrary as one intended to mark
 the <EM>beginning</EM> of the <EM>being</EM> of a person during this time.  Just as in the
 latter case, the person was already there before any alleged line, so too,
 in the former, he continues to develop after any such line.  That is, just as
 none of the items (e.g., viability) marking any of the lines are necessary
 for being a person, so too, none of the lines during pregnancy mark the
 end of the development of the person.  For what we have during the time
 in the womb is a smooth transition from earlier stages of lesser development to later stages of greater development.  The degree of development,
   physical and psychological, increases gradually without ever reaching
   the full capacity to think, decide, intentionally communicate, etc.  Now if
   it is the process of developing these capacities that constitutes the process
   of "developing into a person," as the gradualist position maintains, then
   clearly one cannot draw a reasonable line during pregnancy.<P>

        Can one draw a reasonable line at birth?  No, for as I showed in
   chapter 4, birth marks no change in the being of the child.  He simply
   changes location and method of nourishment intake and is no longer
   directly dependent on his mother.  Clearly none of this affects the status
   of his being.  If he is not a person before birth, he is also not one
   immediately after.<SUP><A HREF=notes5.htm#9>9</A></SUP> If he is a person immediately before birth, he is also
   a person immediately after.  If he is in the process of "developing into a
   person," as the gradualist position holds, then he is in that process just
   before, during, and just after birth.  In the same way, he is in that process
   during any time span of equal length before birth or after birth.  Birth is
   of no significance whatever for the status of a "developing person."<P>

I have considered three main hypotheses used by defenders of abortion
   to try to justify it: One, that there is a line to be drawn, before which there
   is no person or only a potential person, after which there is a person.  Two,
   that no one knows when a person comes into being, the agnostic position.
   And three, the gradualist position, that what is in the womb starts out
   being a nonperson but gradually becomes a person, a smooth transition
   from the impersonal to the personal.  Now, underlying all these is a simple
   fact.  That there is a being in the womb, distinct from his mother, who
   grows and develops, and is then born: a newborn baby.<P>

        Suppose we kill this newborn baby.  For one thing, we cut short his
   life; we deprive him of his entire future.  We deprive him of the most basic
   thing he has, which is presupposed for everything else: his life.  Surely this
   is a great moral evil.<P>

        Suppose we kill this being shortly before birth.  We deprive him of his
   whole future.  Suppose it is earlier, and then earlier still.  The same applies.
   The crucial point is this: <EM>no matter when we destroy the being in the womb,
   we deprive him of his entire future</EM>.  From this all-important perspective,
   what difference does it make whether it is earlier or later?  Either way, the
   being in the womb (regardless of how his status is now designated) is
   robbed of his entire future.<P>

        This makes the whole debate about where to draw the line, or
   whether we can know what the proper place is, or whether there is not
   perhaps a smooth transition from nonperson to person, totally irrelevant.
   For the being in the womb, it makes no difference (apart from pain)
   whether she is robbed of her entire future at an earlier or later date.  The
   effect is the same: she is deprived of her future, and that is a terrible moral
   evil.<P>

        Whether I kill a sleeping person (painlessly) five minutes after he falls
   asleep at night, or five minutes before the alarm goes off in the morning
   makes no difference to him.  Either way I cut short his whole future life;
   I deny him his existence as an awakened being.  The being in the womb
   is in a "sleep," relative to the "awakened" state of his later life.  What is the
   difference, for him, whether he is killed early or late in this "sleep"?  Either
   way, his existence is ended.<P>

        Even if the "fetus" were only a "potential person," abortion would be
   wrong.  For it means the destruction of the whole of that being's life. (That
   this does not apply to the sperm and ovum will be shown in the next
   chapter.)<P>

   <EM><A NAME=Summary></A>Summary Statements</EM><P>

   The agnostic position cannot rationally support abortion. (1) It is not a
   tenable position.  This is because: (a) We do know when a person comes
   into existence, namely at conception-fertilization, when his identity as a
   person begins. (b) We know a person does not come into existence at any
   later point during the time in the womb (refutation of the alleged lines).
   And (c) in looking for the features that mark the coming into <EM>being</EM> of a
   person, the agnostic position generally considers features that are in fact
   relevant only for <EM>functioning</EM> as a person, thus confusing these two essentially different things.<P>

        (2) Even if this position were tenable, it would not support abortion.
   It says we do not know with certainty and precision the moment when a
   human person begins to be.  But we do know the time frame (pregnancy)
   during which there is a significant probability that a person exists (at
   every point).  Where there is such a significant probability (as with a
   motionless accident victim), we must treat the being as a person.  We must
   give "it" the benefit of any doubt.<P>

        The gradualist position cannot rationally support abortion.  First, it
   is at best a mere hypothesis, unsupported by evidence.  There is,
  therefore, a significant probability that the position is false, and therefore
  that a human person is present all the way through pregnancy, a being
  to which we must give the benefit of any doubt.<P>

       Second, when we examine it closely, we see that it cannot possibly
  be true: (a) "Gradual process" refers to my development, not to my being
  as a person.  No matter how much less developed I was at any time in the
  past, I was always "me," fully a person. (b) if "gradual process" refers to
  the coming into being of a person, then at about its midpoint there would
  be "half a person," which is impossible. (c) A car on an assembly line
  comes into being gradually. The being of a person is totally unlike that of
  a car and the coming into being of the one is totally unlike that of the
  other.<P>

       Third, there is the "time frame" problem.  If the full being of a person
  is not attained until her development is completed, it follows that newborn
  babies are not fully persons, that younger babies are "less persons" than
  older ones, and that the younger a baby is, the less wrong it is to kill her.
  This is absurd.  A theory that necessarily implies such an absurdity must
  be false.<P>

       The "No Difference Argument." There is a sense in which all these
  claims - that there is a known line to be drawn, that we do not know where
  the line is, that there is no line but rather a smooth transition to being a
  person - are irrelevant.  For the being in question: if she is to be killed by
  abortion, what difference does it make whether it is earlier or later?  No
  matter when it is, she is deprived of her whole future.<P>

       A final point.  The agnostic position and the gradualist position both
  rest on a common false assumption: that development turns a nonperson
  into a person.  The agnostic position says that there is a point in this
  development when "being a person" begins, but we do not know when this
  point is.  The gradualist position says that there is no such point; that the
  gradual development is itself the transformation of a nonperson into a
  person.<P>

       On the contrary, development does not turn a nonperson into a
  person: <EM>a person is there already, the same person, all the way through this
  development</EM>. This is the continuum argument of chapter 1. It underlies
  the argument of chapter 4, that there is no break in prenatal development.
  It is, of course, the basis of the argument of this chapter.  In the next
  chapter it will be established that this continuum begins at 
conception-fertilization, the one genuine "radical break" in prenatal development.
  This continuum refers to the being of a person, not to his capacity to
  function as a person, a point to be examined in detail in chapter 7.<P>

    The life of a human person is a single continuum, whose first phase begins
    in the womb.  But <EM>when</EM> does this phase actually begin?  When does a new
    human person come into existence?  To answer these questions we need
    scientific data, though it is not essentially a scientific but a philosophical
    question.  Consider the following:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          The birth of a human life really occurs at the moment the mother's egg
          cell is fertilized by one of the father's sperm cells.  When an egg is
          ripe ... it leaves the mother's ovary and moves slowly down the
          fallopian tube towards the uterus on a current of special fluid .... The
          male sperm as they enter the cervix are affected by the presence of the
          egg.  If there is no prospect of an egg, they just mill around aimlessly.... But while an egg is present - and for a time before and
          after - they stream purposefully toward it.... Swimming upstream by
          lashing their tails back and forth, they move at a rate of three inches
          per hour across the cervix, through the uterus and up the fallopian
          tube to meet the egg.  There are actually more than 200 million sperm
          engaged in this race - but [generally] only one will win and fertilize the
          egg.  The egg, which carries all the food and energy, is about 90,000
          times as large as the sperm, but [normally] egg and sperm each
          contributes exactly half of the new individual's total hereditary
          material.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#1>1</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         The eminent embryologist, Dr. Bradley M. Patten states, "It is the
    penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoon and the resultant mingling of
    the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the
culmination of the process of <EM>fertilization</EM> and <EM>marks the initiation of the
 life of a new individual.</EM>"<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#2>2</A></SUP><P>

      F. R. Lillie: The elements that unite are single cells, each on the
 point of death, but by their union a rejuvenated individual is
 formed."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#3>3</A></SUP><P>

      Geraldine Lux Flanagan: "A baby begins life as a single cell, smaller
 than the period at the end of this sentence."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#4>4</A></SUP><P>

      E. Blechschmidt: "A human being does not <EM>become</EM> a human being
 but rather is such from the instant of its fertilization."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#5>5</A></SUP><P>

      Ashley Montagu: "Life begins, not at birth, but at conception.... in
 spite of his newness and his appearance, he is a living, striving human
 being from the very beginning."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#6>6</A></SUP><P>

      Science helps to answer the question where to draw the line between
 what is merely a <EM>preparation</EM> for a human being and that human being
 himself.  Scientific facts reveal that sperm and ovum are each merely
 preparations for a human being.  When they come together, they cease to
 exist. Their interaction is their transformation into something new, a new
 individual human being at the beginning of his existence.  The penetration
 of the ovum by the sperm transforms what had been ovum and sperm into
 something radically different, an individual human being.  At this first
 phase of existence, he or she is called a <EM>zygote</EM>.<P>

      But is there not a continuity in the biological process?  Yes, for the
 father's sperm and the mother's ovum each contribute (normally) one half
 of the final gene complement, as well as other cellular materials, to the
 new human being.  But there is also a radical break, a real line, marking
 the end of that which is merely the preparation for a human being, and
 that human being himself.<P>

      The radical break at conception is that before this event there are two
 things: the father's sperm and the mother's ovum.  After conception, there
 is one being: the new human person.  The transformation of two into one
 is surely a radical break, a real line, in contrast to the lines examined
 earlier, where it was not only one being before and after, but the same
 human person.<P>

      The mother's ovum loses its identity as ovum.  After being fertilized
 by the father's sperm it is no longer an ovum, a <EM>preparation</EM> for a person,
 but a person.  The same is true of the father's sperm.<P>

      This change of identity is expressed, in a striking way, by the fact that
 the ovum that comes down from the ovary is at the point of maturity.  It
 is at the <EM>end</EM> of its <EM>life</EM>, "on the point of death." It dies if it remains
 unfertilized, and it dies in fertilization because it ceases to exist.  The
 zygote is, on the contrary, at the <EM>beginning</EM> of his life, at the point farthest
 removed from maturity and death.  A more radical break can hardly be
     imagined than that break between a being at the end of its existence and
     another being that somehow comes from it, but is at the beginning of his
     existence.<P>

            Sperm and ovum cease to exist.  What used to be the sperm and the
     ovum becomes transformed by fertilization into the new human being in
     his zygote stage.  That a new and different being comes into existence at
     fertilization is reflected in the fact that this new being has his own specific
     genetic code, different from that of the sperm (and the father), different
     from that of the ovum (and the mother).<P>

            Sperm and ovum do not really unite.  They cease to be and lead to a
     new being:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
            The nuclei of the sperm and ovum dynamically interact, and in so
            doing they cease to be.  One might say they die together, but one really
            should not say that they unite. That notion suggests they remain and
            form a larger whole.  But the new single-celled individual is not a
            continuing partnership of the two parent sex cells.  In their interaction
            and mutual causation of the new being, the sperm and ovum are 
self-sacrificial.  Their nuclei are the subject of the fertilization process; the
            zygote is the result of this process.  There is neither sperm nor ovum,
            once the process of interaction is completed, even though cytoplasmic
            matter from the ovum remains.  It is really a misleading figure of
            speech to say that the ovum is fertilized by the sperm, fertilized as
            passively as a farmer's field.  It is proper rather to speak of the 
sperm-ovum interaction process.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#7>7</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

            Conception-fertilization is the radical break, the coming into existence of an individual human being.  Sperm and ovum are merely carriers
     of human life.  Each alone is not a human being, but only a part - though
     a very special part - of the body of either the father or the mother.  It is a
     part of his body and her body that will contribute toward a new human
     being who stems from them, who is generated from the union of their
     bodies, but who is absolutely distinct from both of them.  The new human
     being, the child, is as distinct from the mother as from the father.  The
     child merely resides in the mother, is protected by her womb, is warmed
     and nourished by processes in her body.<P>

            Conception-fertilization is the beginning of a person's existence.
     More precisely, fertilization itself is the process (the intermingling of the
     ovum and sperm "nuclear material" from the parents) that culminates in
     the moment of conception, which is the precise "initiation of the life of a
     new individual." Since fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube, the term
     womb can be said to encompass not only the uterus but the fallopian tube
     as well.<P>

         Conception, the culmination of the process of fertilization, marks the
    beginning of the continuum of human life: I was once a newborn baby,
    and before that, "a well-proportioned small scale baby at seven weeks,"
    and before that, a zygote, right after conception.  I am a person now, I was
    a person in those early phases.<P>

 Discussions of these matters often use the term <EM>fertilized egg</EM> or <EM>fertilized
    ovum</EM>. This is a serious mistake, for the result of conception is not a certain
    kind of egg, namely a fertilized egg, but a new human person.  After
    fertilization, the egg no longer exists, and is therefore not a kind of egg at
    all.<P>

         To speak of unfertilized eggs and fertilized eggs is to suggest that
    there are two kinds of eggs, as there are, for example, two kinds of
    tomatoes, unripe and ripe.  Both unripe and ripe tomatoes are really
    tomatoes; they are two variations of the same thing.  But unfertilized eggs
    and fertilized eggs are not variations of the same thing, but two realities
    that are radically different: one is a mere preparation for a person, and the
    other is that person himself.<P>

         The expression <EM>fertilized egg</EM> (or ovum) is also scientifically wrong.
    The new human being is no more the egg fertilized than he is the sperm
    fertilized, or modified.  He is as little the one as the other, but a new being.
    The ovum is merely bigger than the sperm, hence the tendency to speak
    of it as a fertilized egg, but each contributes exactly one half to the genetic
    makeup of the new person.  And in the process, each ceases to be.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#8>8</A></SUP><P>

         Use of the term <EM>fertilized egg</EM> (or ovum) obscures the radical difference between egg, or ovum, and person.  It makes it seem as if there is
    merely a gradual transition, from one state of the egg (unfertilized) to
    another (fertilized), when in fact there is a radical break between non-person and person. It also invites the question why we should respect and
    protect fertilized eggs when we do not accord such reverence to unfertilized eggs.  Indeed it is hard to see why one state of an egg should be highly
    revered when another is not.  The solution to all this is simple: the result
    of conception is not an egg, but (normally) a small human being.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#9>9</A></SUP><P>

     Let's now consider a series of objections to conception-fertilization as the
    radical break that marks the beginning of a person's existence, and
    replies to them.<P>

<OL>
          <LI> "The zygote cannot be a human person because it is too small.  It
       is only barely visible to the naked eye."<P>

             Yes, a zygote is tiny - to us.  That is, in comparison to our size and
       what we consider normal, he is very small.  But for a conscious being that
       size, the zygote would be of normal size, and we would appear abnormally
       large.  Going in the other direction, imagine a giant who could hold the
       earth in his hand like an orange.  To him each of us would be tiny, much
       more tiny than the zygote is to us.  But each of us would not be less of a
       person for our small size, or less valuable. If you were to shrink in size,
       to the size of a zygote, you would still be the same person, equally a person.<P>

             Size is relative, and completely irrelevant for the status of being a
       person.  A larger person is not more a person than a smaller person; the
       smaller person is not less precious.  What is obviously true of, say, an
       80-pound person in comparison to a 240-pound person is equally true
       when the comparison is continued: 80-pound person and 8-pound
       person, all the way down to the smallest person, the newly-conceived
       child.  In a very short time, she will increase enormously in size.  She
       will develop more, but she will not become more a person through
       this increase in size and level of development, for she is always, in her
       very nature, fully a person.  In short, size is an irrelevant factor in the
       being of a person.  A person is a person regardless of her size.<P>

             The same applies to development.  A person at an earlier stage of his
       development, say age 4, and later, say 24, is the same person, and is
       equally a person at both stages.  In fact, the whole notion of development
       here means the development of a person.  It is not the development of
       something into a person (as was shown, that is impossible<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#10>10</A></SUP>), but a
       development within a person who is already there. Thus the objection that
       the zygote cannot be a person because it is too undeveloped rests on a
       false assumption; namely, that to be a person, one must already have
       reached a certain level of development.  On the contrary, if there is
       development, then the being who reaches it must already be a person.  It
       cannot be that a non-person reaches this level of development and then
       becomes a person.<P>

             Human life is a series of unfoldings.  This can be seen clearly on the
       psychological and spiritual levels.  A child unfolds as a personality.  An
       artistically gifted person unfolds his creativity.  A small bud unfolds into
       a mature flower.  On a much deeper level, and in many more ways, a
       person unfolds.  Now the psychological and spiritual unfolding is clearly
       apparent to us in the child after birth.  His physical unfolding before birth
       is less apparent to us, but it is just as real, and just as much a part of the
       unfolding that is human life.<P>

             The newly-conceived child represents a special moment in the
       unfolding process: the moment it begins.  And the child begins to be at this
   moment.  The unfolding process coincides with the life of the child.  The
   child must really be for the unfolding process to begin, for it is the
   unfolding of his being.  That the child is undeveloped at this moment
   should hardly be surprising; it is precisely his first moment.<P>

        So the development one expects to find later, the development whose
   absence lies at the heart of this objection, is not there.  Of course the
   person at this stage of his existence does not show development: he is at
   the beginning of his development process.<P>

      <LI>"But there must be some structure present for us to be able to
   speak of a person.  The zygote lacks this structure.  He/it is merely an
   ovum changed by infusion of the sperm."<P>

        The zygote is not an ovum changed by infusion of the sperm.  He is
   a new being brought into existence by the interaction of two elements,
   sperm and ovum, which play equal roles, despite the much larger size of
   the ovum.  Sperm and ovum are transformed into a new being.  This new
   being has a specific genetic structure and associated cellular structure,
   which will progressively unfold as the being develops, from its beginning
   through subsequent, progressively more complex forms of this structure.
   The zygote needs time, as well as nourishment, protection, and other
   environmental factors, to unfold and thereby to develop into what is
   recognized as a familiar human being.<P>

        This is the structure that constitutes the individual person, at that
   stage of his development.  It is a specifically human structure, unlike the
   structure of an animal zygote, as can be clearly determined by inspection
   under a microscope. (See also note <A HREF=notes6.htm#5>5</A>.)<P>

        Perhaps the above objection refers to something else: a more
   developed structure, as is found in a newborn child.  A developed
   structure will come, but it takes time.  This objection rests on an
   unreasonable expectation.  The being, the zygote, is at the beginning of his
   existence.  Hence what can only come later as a result of his development
   cannot be present yet.  But the being who is developing, who is just
   starting his process of development, is there.  That is the all-important
   point.  Were he not there, his unfolding as a person, could not begin.<P>

<LI>"But the zygote is not conscious, he cannot think and communicate.  How can he be a person?" That he cannot think and communicate
   means merely that he cannot function as a person, not that he lacks the
   being of a person.<P>

<LI>"The zygote cannot be a human person because it doesn't look like
   a human person."<P>

              But it does look like a human person, at that stage of her development.  What the objection must mean is that the zygote does not look like
         a familiar human person.  That says nothing about her being, and it is the
         status of her being that matters.  That the zygote has an appearance
         unfamiliar to us is a function of our limited range of experience, not of her
         humanity.<P>

              Looking like a familiar human person is a function of genetic
         endowment, level of development, and environment.  People look familiarly human because they have human eyes and ears, arms and legs, etc.
         If we cannot expect the results of development in a being who is at the
         beginning of her development. we also cannot expect that which accompanies those results - looking like a familiar human person - in such a
         being.  In fact, it would be strange if a human person at the very beginning
         of her development did look like the more developed human beings we are
         used to seeing outside the womb.<P>

<LI>"The zygote cannot be a human person because it is absolutely
         unconscious; it does not even have the capacity for consciousness."<P>

              That the zygote is absolutely unconscious only means that he is
         unable to function as a person, not that he lacks the being of a person,
         and it is of course being a person that counts.  In regard to capacity, he
         does possess the essential structure for having this capacity.  What he
         lacks is the immediate capacity for consciousness, which is simply an
         aspect of his lack of development, something entirely appropriate for a
         being at the beginning of his development.  The zygote is a person who is
         not <EM>yet</EM> conscious, not a being who is simply not conscious like a stone.<P>

              There is a common element in these first five objections: they are all
         based on the expectation that what is a person must be like us.  It must
         be the right size (a size like ours); it must have a level of development comparable to ours; it must look like us; it must, like us, be conscious. These
         are not true criteria for being a person but simply expressions of our
         expectations, of what we are used to, of what appears familiar to us.  It is
         not that the zygote fails to be a person because it fails these tests; rather
         it is we who fail by using these criteria to measure what a person is.<P>

              To consider a zygote less a person because of his appearance is
         similar to a white person to whom a black person appears strange because
         he is different.  The white racist measures being a human person by what
         is familiar to him, namely being a white person.  When the black person
         fails this test, he is considered not fully human. Of course, the failure lies
         not on the part of the black, but on the part of the white, and his narrow
   standards.  Being a white human person is one way of being a human
   person: being a black human person is another.  Existing outside the
   womb, having reached a high level of human development is one way of
   being a human person; being a small person, a zygote inside his mother,
   is another way.<P>

<LI>"The zygote is only a blueprint for a human being, not an actual
   human being.  It is merely an information code for a human being, a guide
   for the development of that being, and not the being himself."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#11>11</A></SUP><P>

         This is simply false.  The zygote, like every other human being,
   contains, in every cell, a blueprint for his development and structure, and
   information code, namely DNA. Although he contains this DNA information code, he is not the information code itself.<P>

         The small-scale baby in the womb is surely not a blueprint, or an
   information code, for the full-term infant, any more than the full-term
   infant is for an older child.  Each of them is already a fully real, small
   human person.  The zygote is essentially the same, only smaller and less
   developed, and different in appearance.  And he is the same being as the
   seven-week-old child, at an earlier phase of development.  There is no
   transformation of blueprint for x into x itself, but rather a child just
   starting his development, and that same child having reached a later
   phase in his developmental process.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#12>12</A></SUP><P>

<LI>"The zygote is no more a person than an acorn is an oak tree.  Just
   as an acorn is not a tree, a zygote is not a person, though in each case the
   latter grows out of the former."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#13>13</A></SUP><P>

         If this objection seems to have some force, it is because it assumes
   a discontinuity between acorn and oak tree.  That is, that the acorn and
   the oak tree are two distinct things, that the acorn somehow causes the
   oak tree to come into existence but is in no way the same being, and
   (perhaps), that the acorn dies in the process.  But if this assumption is
   made, the analogy does not fit.  The acorn and the oak tree are not distinct
   organisms.  Rather, the acorn contains the embryonic plant that will
   become the oak tree.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#14>14</A></SUP> The acorn is the embryonic plant, plus other
   organic material, such as nutrients.  The planted seed does not die: the
   embryo it contains is the plant that will grow and thereby assume the
   familiar form of a tree.  Essentially the same is true of the zygote.  It is the
   being who will later be a born child.<P>

         "The zygote is no more a person than an acorn is an oak tree." On the
   contrary, the acorn /embryo is the oak tree, in its earliest phase.  And
   the zygote is the person in her earliest phase.  In each case the early phase
   looks different from the later phases, does not have the same functions
     (it cannot provide shade; she cannot read), and is in a different location
     (underground, then both underground and above ground; in the womb,
     then outside the womb).<P>

          If we assume discontinuity, the analogy fails.  If we recognize the
     continuity between acorn and oak tree, then the analogy fits perfectly,
     and merely points out that the acorn and the zygote are different from the
     oak tree and the later child, respectively.  The force of the objection is then
     simply to emphasize this difference.  "See how different they are." Yes, they
     are different.  The acorn differs from the oak tree in being much smaller,
     in being less developed, in location, and in appearance.  So too, the child
     in her zygote stage and her later stages.  Thus the acorn objection merely
     recapitulates, in a vivid way, the first three objections.<P>

<LI>"An egg after fertilization is a zygote, a single cell that divides if
     development continues.  Since it is not indivisible, a zygote cannot be
     considered an individual or person."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#15>15</A></SUP> In other words, "To be a person, one
     must be indivisible, a unity.  The zygote is not indivisible, since it does
     divide; therefore, it is not a person."<P>

          The single-celled zygote divides into two cells, then four, and
     continues, reaching trillions of cells.  But this division is in fact his
     development.  Speaking of this, "the first division of the zygote into two
     equal parts by the process known as cleavage." Shettles and Rugh
     explain, "It is through this process that a single fertilized ovum will give
     rise to the more than trillions of cells of the unborn baby."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#16>16</A></SUP> Cellular
     division, far from negating the reality of the individual person, makes
     possible the physical development of that individual person.<P>

          At the beginning, there is a one-celled being.  When cleavage occurs
     there are two cells, but not therefore two beings (except in the case of
     identical twins).  Rather, cleavage means that the original being is now
     composed of two cells.  Later he will be composed of many more cells, but
     he is the same single being all the way through this development by
     cellular division.<P>

          The objection would only be valid if division meant separation into
     two beings.  It does not.  "Cleavage is not at all comparable to a single knife
     stroke that cuts an egg in two."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#17>17</A></SUP><P>

<LI>"The answer to this whole question - whether human life begins
     at conception, or later - is very simple.  Human life never begins; except
     once, long, long ago.  It is just passed on from one generation to the next.
     The sperm and the ovum are forms of human life, the resulting zygote is
     human life; it is a continual process that goes on and on.  Thus, human
     life (except in the distant past) has no beginning."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#18>18</A></SUP><P>

       Life as a biological phenomenon has no beginning (in our time), it is
  just passed on.  But the life of a person has a definite beginning.  The
  general phenomenon of biological life is a continual process; but the life
  of an individual person is not.  It is a continuum, with a definite beginning,
  and end.  The biological is a dimension of human life but not the whole of
  it. From the fact that biological life is carried on, it does not follow that
  personal life is simply carried on. The fact that my biological being has its
  roots in the distant past, and is in some way continuous with it, does not
  mean that my identity as a person reaches into the distant past.  I surely
  did not exist at the time of Bach or Alexander the Great, even if my
  biological heredity is somehow traceable to those who existed at those
  times.<P>

       Once we see that biological continuity is absolutely distinct from
  individual personal life, which has a definite beginning, we can see a deep
  and meaningful connection between them.  This refers to the begetting of
  a new person by his parents.  My being as a person has an absolute
  beginning, at conception-fertilization.  That event is the union of two
  things, the sperm from my father and the ovum from my mother: two
  things that represent my connection with the past.  I am not created out
  of nothing but somehow out of a material (sperm and egg) that already
  exists.  Life is transmitted from one generation to the next.  This transmission is not the continuity of one thing, life, but the begetting of a new
  person by two persons already in existence.<P>

<LI>"There is no such thing as the moment of conception, since
  conception is a process that takes time."<P>

       This is inaccurate.  <EM>Fertilization</EM> is a process that takes time.  But, as
  Joyce tells us, "It has a definite conclusion.  The moment at which this
  process terminates in the resulting zygote can be called <EM>conception</EM>."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#19>19</A></SUP> So
  there is a moment of conception: the culmination of the process of
  fertilization.<P>

       Moore describes the process as follows: "<EM>Fertilization is a sequence
  of events</EM> that begins with contact between a sperm and a secondary
  oocyte [mature ovum] ... and ends with the fusion of the nuclei of the
  sperm and ovum and the intermingling of maternal and paternal chromosomes."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#20>20</A></SUP> Further, "<EM>Embryonic development commences with fertilization.</EM>
  The fertilization process lasts about 24 hours."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#21>21</A></SUP> He then describes the six
  stages of this process, the last stage being "<EM>The male and female pronuclei
  fuse</EM>, forming a new cell called the <EM>zygote</EM>."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#22>22</A></SUP><P>

<LI>It is sometimes asked, "If we are to revere and protect fertilized
    eggs, why not also unfertilized eggs and sperm?"<P>

           The answer is simple.  Unfertilized eggs and sperm are not persons;
    each is merely a preparation for the coming to be of a person.  A "fertilized
    egg" is not really an egg, but rather a small new person, a zygote, who
    should be respected for just this reason.<P>

<LI>"Some entities that stem from the union of sperm and egg are not
    human beings and never will develop into them." Thus:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
                  1. The hydatidiform mole, an entity which is usually just a degenerated placenta and typically has a random number of chromosomes (aneuploidy).<P>

                 2. The choriocarcinoma, a "conception-cancer" resulting from
           the sperm-egg union is one of gynecology's most malignant tumors.
           Aneuploidy is also common.<P>

                 3. The "blighted ovum," a conception with the forty-six chromosomes but which is only a placenta, lacks an embryonic plate, and is
           always aborted naturally after implantation.<P>

                 Also I wonder, are all fertilized eggs "lives" that must be protected and cherished?  Many do not implant and are simply washed
           away.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#23>23</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

           Suppose it is true that some entities stemming from the union of
    sperm and egg are not human beings.  Some surely are, and they begin
    their existence at conception.  That other entities may also stem from a
    sperm-egg union does nothing to show that those entities that are human
    beings do not begin their existence with the sperm-egg union (i.e.,
    intermingling).  All that the objection can show is that not all cases of
    biological fertilization represent the conception of a new person.<P>

           In addition, some persons are conceived who are too weak, fragile,
    and handicapped to survive, and thus are "washed away." That happens
    later in life as well; not all human beings survive to maturity.  This does
    nothing to show that they were not real human beings before their death.<P>

<LI>"If and when human cloning occurs, is this not a human life
    because it does not result from the union of sperm and egg?"<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#24>24</A></SUP><P>

           Suppose cloning is possible.  That would simply mean that there is
    another way in which human beings can come into existence.  It does
    nothing to show that the first way - normal fertilization - is not a way in
   which human beings come into existence; or that this process does not
   represent the beginning of a person.  Cloning or not, the rest of us begin
   at conception-fertilization.<P>

<LI>Someone could ask, "Granting all that has been said so far in
   this book, isn't it still possible that, though a new biological entity
   comes into being at conception-fertilization, a person does not come into
   being until some time later, when the soul is infused into the body?  By
   <EM>soul</EM>, I mean that which makes us persons, and not merely biological
   organisms: the capacity to think, and feel, and love, etc., or at least the
   basis for this capacity.  If the soul is infused only later, then 
conception-fertilization is not the beginning of a person's existence: and destroying
   the zygote (and perhaps the embryo) is not the killing of a person, and
   therefore allowable."<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#25>25</A></SUP><P>

       Regarding the thesis that the soul is infused into the individual
   human organism only at some time after conception. four important
   points should be made.  First, we do not know that this is in fact what
   happens.  We have absolutely no evidence for it, no reason to believe it,
   nothing that would make it even probable.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#26>26</A></SUP> It is, at best, a pure
   hypothesis.  As such, it offers no basis to anyone seeking a justification for
   abortions.<P>

       Second, even supposing it is true, we do not know when the crucial
   moment is.  To know that it is after conception-fertilization is not enough.
   We would have to know precisely when the soul enters the body, so that
   we do not destroy the being after that point.  So, even granting the thesis
   to be true, it provides no practical help to anyone seeking to justify
   abortion, or wondering whether some abortions might not be justified.<P>

       Third, there are many reasons to believe this thesis is false.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#27>27</A></SUP> in
   addition to what has already been offered here, especially that conception
   is a radical break, let me suggest two further points.<P>

        1. A human person is a whole being, bodily dimension and personal
   being, deeply united into one.  He is not a mere biological organism, nor
   merely a soul, nor a soul lodged in a body.  He is a bodily person. The idea
   of infusing a soul into an already existing biological organism, with the
   unity and uniqueness (genetic code) that the zygote certainly has, runs
   counter to what a human person is.  The infusion view is too much like
   that of an empty bottle that is then filled with something.  That is a
   completely false and distorted view of the human person.  Our bodies are
   not bottles to be filled with our souls.  Each human person is a unity, a
   person with a bodily dimension; for example, my right arm is a dimension
   of me.  The human body is not a mere body, but an aspect of the person.
   The infusion view seems to require a separation of body and soul (or
   spiritual person) that is untenable.  Body and soul are essentially distinct;
       we are not mere biological organisms.  But a person is also a unity, a
       profound unity of the spiritual and the physical.  My body is not just a shell
       in which I live.  My body is, in a real sense me, though of course not all of
       me. My body is a dimension of my being as a person.<P>

            Each human person is a unity.  The full reality of this unity is in the
       zygote, though of course not yet consciously experienced as it will be later.<P>

            2. The infusion view would have the curious effect of implying that
       I am not conceived by my parents.  For what is conceived by them would
       be an entity, a mere biological organism, that forms a kind of vessel into
       which a soul is then infused.  But if my parents conceived me, they
       conceived me when conception took place.  This means that I came into
       existence when conception took place, and not at some later time. when
       a soul was infused into a body.  In short, my parents conceived <EM>me</EM>, not just
       my  body.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#28>28</A></SUP><P>

            A fourth argument is that even if the infusion view were probable,
       though uncertain, it could not be used as a basis for justifying abortions.
       For if there is a risk, even a small one, that it is not true, one cannot rely
       on it.  If there is a small though realistic chance that the being in the womb
       before the point when infusion is thought to occur is a person, we cannot
       destroy her by an abortion.  Where there is uncertainty, all benefit must
       be given to human life.  We must know that the being in question is not
       a living person (either not yet or no longer), before we can destroy her.  So,
       even if the infusion view were highly likely, it could not be used to justify
       early abortions.<P>
</OL>
            Only conception-fertilization represents the radical change that
       adequately corresponds to, and makes possible, the change from 
non-person to person.  Only conception-fertilization can represent the physical
       change necessary to transform what is a biological preparation for a
       person into that person himself.  What preexists on the biological level
       must be radically altered to become a human body, and thereby the
       physical dimension of a human person.  There is no other place, besides
       conception-fertilization, where such a radical physical change occurs.
       None of the suggested places to draw the line marking the beginning of
       a person's existence were even close to being a radical physical change.
       They were all merely stages in the development of the same being.<P>


       <EM>The Role of Natural Science</EM><P>

       An individual human person begins his existence at 
conception-fertilization.  Is this something that science can establish?  There is no
       one single answer to this question.<P>

      First, it is a scientific fact that human life begins at conception.  Here
  <EM>human life</EM> refers to an individual of a zoological species, part of the proper
  subject matter for scientific inquiry.<P>

      Second, scientific inquiry does not establish the further, crucial
  point that this individual human life is a person; for the term <EM>person</EM> is
  a philosophical category, not a scientific one.  Personhood is something
  that must be understood philosophically, rather than be proved scientifically.  An abortion advocate who admits that the being in the womb is
  human life but denies that that human life is a person cannot be refuted
  on purely scientific grounds.  Likewise, science does not establish the
  personhood of a black person or white person.  A racist who acknowledges
  that a black human being is human but denies that he is a person in the
  full sense cannot be refuted on purely scientific grounds.<P>

      Third, scientific data, though not sufficient to establish that the
  preborn human being is a person, are nonetheless immensely valuable
  for understanding his status as a person, and that it is at 
conception-fertilization that he begins his existence.  Science presents a detailed
  picture of the coming into existence of a new individual human being, and
  of his early development.  That this human being is a person, the same
  person who will later grow into a recognizable baby, and an adult; that he
  is as much a person as the rest of us, the differences between him and the
  rest of us being morally irrelevant; that he has the same preciousness and
  dignity as any other person - these are matters of philosophical understanding rather than scientific knowledge.  But science plays a key role in
  enabling us to reach this understanding.  The detailed picture science
  provides is a kind of raw material for philosophic understanding.  Scientific data provide part of the evidence for that which is philosophically
  understood.  Certain scientifically established facts correspond in an
  intelligible way to what is understood philosophically.  Thus it is science
  that explains the biological continuity between the zygote and the later
  child and that the zygote comes into being as sperm and ovum interpenetrate, thereby ceasing to exist.  Scientific data show that the zygote has his
  own specific genetic code, distinct both from that of the sperm and that
  of the ovum.  Again, the scientific facts concerning viability - for example,
  its relativity to medical technology - play a key role in constituting the
  philosophical argument that it is not the place to draw the line marking
  the beginning of an actual human person.<P>

       Thus, though science itself does not establish the reality of the
  human person in the womb, since the whole question of the reality of the
  person is a philosophical question and not a scientific one, science
  nonetheless plays a key role in providing data used by philosophy to
  establish that it is indeed a person, one of us, who inhabits the womb.<P>

         In the words of Robert Joyce:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         What is a person?  When is a person?  These questions are essentially
         philosophical.  They require an integration of our knowledge of certain
         basic data and conclusions in embryology.  But they are not specifically scientific questions.  We go beyond the eyeball vision and
         verification involved in natural science, while taking it carefully into
         account, and we try to say ultimately what this tiny, microscopic
         creature called a human zygote really is.  Biologically viewed, even an
         adult human being cannot be said to be a person.  For a biologist as
         a biologist, you and I are simply human organisms.  But for the
         biologist as a philosopher - and everyone is a philosopher to some
         extent - you and I can be readily recognized as persons.<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#29>29</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME=Abortion></A> <EM>Abortion and Contraception</EM><P>

  The destruction of a zygote is the killing of a real human person; it is
  therefore a form of abortion.  Abortion is therefore essentially different
  from contraception, which, as the name implies, means the prevention of
  conception; no new human being comes into existence.  Abortion, in
  contrast, means that an existing human being is killed.  Abortion implies
  a victim; contraception does not.<P>

         Thus devices, such as the I.U.D, that cause the death of the zygote
  are methods of abortion and not of contraception, though they are often
  misleadingly labeled as contraceptive devices.  They are abortifacients,
  devices that cause an abortion, and should be labeled as such.<P>

<A NAME=Significance>  <EM>The Significance of Establishing Conception<BR>
  As the Beginning of a Person's Existence</EM><P>

  The basic argument against abortion is that it is the killing of a human
  person.  That the being in the womb is really a person is established
  through the continuum argument: human life is a single continuum
  whose first phase is life before birth.<P>

         It is important to establish precisely when this continuum begins, so
  that a clear picture emerges: human life is a single continuum beginning
  at conception-fertilization, continuing through the time in the womb.
  entering a new phase at birth, and continuing after birth to death.  If
  conception-fertilization is not clearly established as the first point of this
  continuum then the beginning of a person's existence will be lost in
  obscurity.  This will have serious consequences for an understanding of
  the moral evil of abortion.  A person for whom the early phases (zygote and
  embryo) are somehow lost in obscurity, who does not see them as the first
  phases of the life of a person, may be confused about later phases in the
  continuum before birth as well.  "If the very small being (e.g., zygote) is not
  clearly a human person. then perhaps the larger, later, child is not either."
  There is a valid point here: if the zygote is not a real person, he cannot
  become one just by getting bigger and developing more.  The conclusion,
  validly drawn, would be that the being in the womb at later stages is not
  a real person, but only looks more and more like one; that he is only a
  potential person, and thus may be aborted.  This shows how important it
  is to establish clearly that the premise is false, that the zygote is a real
  person.  He does not become a person; he only grows larger and becomes
  more developed, until he is able to change his environment, and become
  relatively independent.<P>

       Many people feel confused about abortion.  They clearly recognize the
  born child as a real person, and that killing her is morally wrong.  They
  somehow realize that the being in the womb is essentially such a child,
  except that he happens not to have been born yet.  As they learn more
  about the development of the being in the womb, they begin to realize
  more and more that she is a small child, differing from a newborn baby
  only in size, level of development, etc.  But if the continuum is not clearly
  established as far back as conception, their whole insight into the reality
  of the person in the womb is in jeopardy.  For, as noted, if the zygote is not
  a real person, she cannot become one merely by growing bigger: perhaps
  the larger child in the womb is not (in their minds) a person either.  So the
  confusion sets in, and with it sentiments such as, "It is a complex
  question, so each person must decide for herself whether abortion is
  immoral or not." The victim of this liberal sentiment is the innocent child
  in the womb.  To protect her we must establish absolute clarity about her
  existence in the womb as a real person from conception-fertilization.<P>

       There is another reason for establishing clearly that 
conception-fertilization is the beginning of a human person's existence, and that
  concerns abortifacients such as the I.U.D., the "morning after" pill, and
  certain forms of The Pill.  All these devices kill an individual person,
  already conceived, and their use is therefore morally wrong.<P>

	Is the Zygote a Person?
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

The zygote is merely still smaller, and less developed, than the child in the
  womb at say, seven weeks.  That he is smaller and less developed should
   not deny him personhood; he is simply a tiny person at the beginning of
   his existence, and therefore of his development.  It is then only natural
   that he is not yet developed.<P>

        The zygote does not seem to be a person; he is not what we think of
   as a person.  But that is partly a fact about us, what appears familiar as
   a person to us, and partly a matter of relationships: the zygote does not
   live in a social environment as other persons do. The first says something
   about us, the second about the zygote's environment.  Neither says that
   he does not have the status of a person.<P>

        If the zygote does not seem to us to be a person, then we must expand
   our concept of person to include him.  There are, unfortunately, numerous
   occasions where a person appears unfamiliar in some way (race, nationality, ethnic group, size, level of development, etc.), and is then not
   accorded full status as a person.  But all these factors are equally
   irrelevant in regard to personhood; the unfamiliar person is as much a
   person as the one to whom he happens to appear unfamiliar.  The failure
   lies not with the person who appears unfamiliar, but rather with the
   person who fails to recognize and acknowledge the personhood of the one
   who appears to him as different.<P>

        It is helpful to remember in this connection the simple fact: I was
   once a zygote, just as I was once a newborn baby, only earlier.  I am surely
   a person now; I was a person when I was newborn, just before that in my
   mother's womb, and equally before that at the beginning of my existence.<P>

        A person in a deep sleep is surely a person.  A zygote is a person in
   a kind of deep sleep.  Given time, proper warmth, nourishment, and
   protection, he will wake up.  He will surely be a person then.  But if he
   wakes up, he was also a person before, while in his state of sleep.<P>

        Is destroying a zygote then murder?  Is killing an innocent person in
   general murder?  Why is it any different for a tiny person?  An innocent
   person is the victim.  This suffices to constitute murder.  Our concepts
   must be broadened.  If the destruction of a zygote is not thought of as
   murder, the failure lies with us.  We fail to identify with him merely
   because he is small, undeveloped, and unseen.  These are hardly things
   that make him any less a person, or that make his destruction any less
   murder.<P>


<A NAME=Egg></A>  <EM> The "Fertilized Egg" Fallacy</EM><P>

   Defenders of abortion sometimes argue their case along these lines: "You
   mean that a fertilized egg has the same status as a fully mature person?
   That the rights of an hour old fertilized egg, one-fourth the size of a period
  on a printed page, would take precedence over the wishes and interests
  of a mature woman?<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#30>30</A></SUP> That to destroy a tiny fertilized egg is the moral
  equivalent of murdering a child or an adult?  Absurd!"<P>

      I would like to offer three replies to this argument.  First, what is
  called the fertilized egg seems not to be a person.  The important question
  is not what something seems to be but what it really is.  Appearance does
  not always equal reality.  Appearances can be, and often are, deceiving.  As
  this chapter has shown, together with the arguments of the previous
  chapters, the so-called fertilized egg is a tiny person at the beginning of
  his existence.  He is small and undeveloped precisely because he is at the
  beginning of his existence.  If that is so, then he does indeed have the same
  status as a fully mature person.  Denying him this is a form of discrimination: "You don't count, you're too small, too undeveloped." Or,  "You
  have the wrong size and shape to be a real person." Of course the right to
  life of any person - whether he is "the size of the period at the end of this
  sentence," or smaller or larger  "takes precedence over the wishes and
  interests of a mature woman," or any other person.  A person's right to life
  is not dependent on his size.<P>

      So the first reply to this argument for abortion amounts to denying
  the premise on which it is based, that the "fertilized egg" is not a person;
  and that killing it cannot be seriously wrong.  He is not a fertilized egg, but
  a small human being in the first phase of his existence. (Notice how the
  use of the term <EM>fertilized egg</EM> creates the impression that this is an
  impersonal being, hence can be readily disposed.  This is an illustration
  of the point stressed earlier, that use of this term should be avoided.)<P>

      Second, the arguments proposed here clearly establish the personhood of the zygote (in the sense in which any child, large or small, is a
  person).  If this is questioned, it must at least be admitted that there is a
  high probability that the zygote is a person.  If the arguments do not
  establish certainty, they surely provide a strong probability that a person
  is there at this stage of human development. If this is so, the same
  conclusion follows.  We cannot destroy what is most probably a human
  being.  If we are not certain that someone is dead, he must be presumed
  to be alive, and treated as such.  So too, if we are not certain that the zygote
  is nonliving as a person (a non-person), he must be presumed alive as
  a person, and treated with respect, not killed on behalf of the wishes and
  interests of another person.<P>

       The second reply to this argument for abortion says to its advocates.
  "You claim to know the zygote is not a person.  You don't know this! Your
  reasons - its tiny size, not looking like a familiar human being, being
  undeveloped - are not good reasons, let alone grounds for claiming to
  know that the zygote is not a person.  If you don't know this, your whole
      argument collapses.  Your conclusion, that the zygote may be destroyed,
      is based on the premise that he is known not to be a person.  This is not
      known. the premise is false, hence the conclusion cannot be drawn."<P>

           Third, if the fertilized egg argument is offered as a defense of abortion
      in general<SUP><A HREF=notes6.htm#31>31</A></SUP> (and not merely for destroying zygotes, as with abortifacients), it suffers from another, rather serious, defect: it becomes an anti-abortion argument.  Suppose it convinces a person that a "fertilized egg"
      counts for virtually nothing in comparison to a mature person.  The reason
      would be its tiny size and undeveloped status, implying that with
      development and a more normal size, the being in question would be
      valued.  But that is precisely what is true of a seven-week-old baby in the
      womb, or that same child in later phases.  Thus, if the zygote may be
      destroyed because it is so tiny, then precisely for this reason the child who
      is a victim of standard abortion techniques may not be destroyed, because
      he is not tiny.  Therefore abortion is wrong.<P>

          When examined carefully, the absurdity of this argument as an
      attempt to justify abortion confronts us.  "It's all right to destroy a tiny
      fertilized egg, because it is so tiny.  Therefore it's all right to take a 
well-developed child at twelve weeks or more, burn her skin and poison her by
      saline, or cut her to pieces by D & E."<P>

	<EM>
	A Theory About Human Beings and Persons
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Let us now examine a theory that defends abortion on the grounds that
the child in the womb, though undoubtedly a human being, is not a
person, and that it is only the killing of persons that is intrinsically and
seriously wrong.  The theory consists of two major theses: First, that
killing human beings is not wrong; second, that the child (in the womb
and for a time after birth) is human but not a person.  I shall argue that
both of these theses are mistaken.<P>

     This theory recognizes that abortion is the deliberate killing of an
innocent human being, but it denies this is wrong because it denies that
it is wrong to deliberately kill human beings.  What <EM>is</EM> wrong is killing
human beings who are persons.  Now, of course, many human beings are
persons, for example, normal adult human beings, and it is wrong to kill
them because they are persons.  But small infants. such as newborn
babies or babies in the womb, though they are undoubtedly human, are
not, according to this theory, persons.  And so it is not intrinsically wrong
to kill them.  That is, it is not wrong in itself, though it may be wrong
because of adverse consequences.  A small child, therefore, has no right
to life as a normal adult does, and if the child is unwanted, he may be
killed.<P>

     Thus, the theory allows for abortion and infanticide alike.  It rejects
the typical pro-abortion lines, such as viability and birth.  It agrees that
there is no morally significant difference between"before" and "after." But
instead of saying that killing a human being is <EM>wrong</EM> on both sides 
of such
a line, it claims that it is <EM>right</EM> (or can be right) on both sides of the 
line.<P>

        Joseph Fletcher expresses this view when he remarks, "I would
   support the ... position ... that both abortion and infanticide can be
   justified if and when the good to be gained outweighs the evil - that
   neither abortion nor infanticide is as such immoral."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#1>1</A></SUP><P>

        Michael Tooley has an essay entitled, "A Defense of Abortion and
   Infanticide." If the idea that killing babies is morally right is shocking to
   most people, Tooley replies in his essay that this is merely an emotional
   response, not a reasoned one.  "The response, rather than appealing to
   carefully formulated moral principles, is primarily visceral," he says.  And,
   "It is reasonable to suspect that one is dealing with a taboo rather than
   with a rational prohibition."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#2>2</A></SUP> His 
position is: "Since I do not believe human
   infants are persons. but only potential persons, and since I think that the
   destruction of potential persons is a morally neutral action, the correct
   conclusion seems to me to be that infanticide is in itself morally 
acceptable."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#3>3</A></SUP><P>

        I want to show that the theories held by Fletcher, Tooley, and others
   are absolutely wrong.  Infanticide and abortion are both morally wrong, as
   wrong as the deliberate killing of an older child or an adult, and thus our
   emotional response of shock and horror at killing babies is completely
   grounded in reason and moral principles.  I want to show that a small
   child, after birth or still in the womb, <EM>is</EM> a person, as much a person 
as
   the rest of us; that the notion of person as used by these writers is a special
   one, a narrower concept, and not the one that is crucial for morality.  I
   want to make clear why the attempts to show that a small child is not a
   person are mistaken, and that all human beings as such are persons.<P>

<A NAME=Warren></A>   <EM>The Argument of Mary Ann Warren</EM><P>

   In an argument for this theory, Mary Ann Warren examines "the traditional 
argument that since (1) it is wrong to kill innocent human beings,
   and (2) fetuses are innocent human beings, then (3) it is wrong to kill
   fetuses."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#4>4</A></SUP> This argument, she 
claims, is "fallacious," because "the term
   'human' has two distinct, but not often distinguished, senses."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#5>5</A></SUP> In
   premise one, human means person, or full-fledged member of the moral
   community, a being whom it is wrong to kill.  In premise two, on the other
   hand, the term human refers merely to a member of the biological species
   human, as opposed, say, to a rabbit or an eagle.  Warren's claim is that
   mere membership in a biological species is morally irrelevant and thus
   does not confer on the being in question a right to life.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#6>6</A></SUP><P>

        "Yes, a fetus is biologically human (human in the genetic sense), but
 that does not make it the kind of being who has a right to life.  It is only
 persons (those who are human in the moral sense) who have such a right.
 It is wrong to kill persons, and if a human being is not also a person he
 does not have a right to life, and it is, or often can be, morally right to
 destroy him." This, in essence, is Warren's argument.<P>

        Warren offers an analysis of what is a person, a full-fledged member
 of the moral community:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        I suggest that the traits which are most central to the concept of
        personhood, or humanity in the moral sense, are, very roughly, the
        following:

<OL><LI>consciousness (of objects and events external and/or internal to the
        being), and in particular the capacity to feel pain;

        <LI>reasoning (the <EM>developed</EM> capacity to solve new and 
relatively
        complex problems);

        <LI>self-motivated activity (activity which is relatively independent of
        either genetic or direct external control);

        <LI>the capacity to communicate, by whatever means, messages of an
        indefinite variety of types, that is, not just with an indefinite number
        of possible contents, but on indefinitely many possible topics;

        <LI>the presence of self-concepts, and self-awareness, either individual
        or racial, or both.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#7>7</A></SUP><P>
</OL>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        This, she acknowledges, is not a full analysis of the concept of a
 person.  It is not a list of necessary and sufficient conditions for being a
 person.  But, she says, this does not matter.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        All we need to claim, to demonstrate that a fetus is not a person, is
        that any being which satisfies <EM>none</EM> of (1) - (5) is certainly not a 
person.
        I consider this claim to be so obvious that I think anyone who denied
        it, and claimed that a being which satisfied none of (1) - (5) was a person
        all the same, would thereby demonstrate that he had no notion at all
        of what a person is - perhaps because he had confused the concept of
        a person with that of genetic humanity.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#8>8</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        We can now see Warren's argument for abortion in its entirety.  A
 fetus is human in the genetic sense; that is morally irrelevant.  A fetus is
 not human in the moral sense: he is not a person since he satisfies none
  of the criteria she has outlined.  Not being a person, he has no right to life,
  and abortion is morally permissible.  The same applies to the child after
  birth.  "Killing a newborn infant isn't murder."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#9>9</A></SUP> Infanticide is wrong,
  according to Warren, only to the extent that the child is wanted, that there
  are couples who would like to adopt or keep him.  "Thus, infanticide is
  wrong for reasons analogous to those which make it wrong to wantonly
  destroy natural resources, or great works of art."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#10>10</A></SUP><P>

        But destroying natural resources or works of art is not always wrong,
  and certainly not wrong in the sense in which murder is wrong.  Warren
  acknowledges this when she says, "It follows from my argument that
  when an unwanted or defective infant is born into a society which cannot
  afford and/or is not willing to care for it, then its destruction is
  permissible."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#11>11</A></SUP><P>
