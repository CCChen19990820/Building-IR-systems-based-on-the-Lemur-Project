<H3>PFANDBRIEF MARKET</H3> 
<H2>Can a jumbo give birth to a baby? </H2>
<H4>Optimists believe the new market in jumbo Pfandbriefe could become sophisticated,
liquid and efficient enough to be regarded as a kind of baby Bund. Pessimists
think overcoming image problems in the eyes of international investors will
prove too difficult. Philip Moore reports </H4>
At a recent get-together of Munich's city bankers, Bayerische Handelsbank
board member and new president of the Association of German Mortgage Banks
Walter Dieck fell into conversation with a professor of economics at the
University of Munich - a specialist in banking - about Germany's new &quot;jumbo&quot;
Pfandbrief market which combines issuing activity into offerings of Dm500
million or more, and promises market-making. The market's profile is improving,
they agreed. After all, remarked the professor, Pfandbrief had an accepted
English translation - &quot;mortgage bond&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Dieck smiles ironically when he recalls the depth of misunderstanding even
at the very nerve centre of the Pfandbrief market's development. As Stephan
Bub, treasury head at Bayerische Vereinsbank, says: &quot;The idea of the
jumbo Pfandbrief was born in Munich. The launch of the product demanded
a highly concerted effort by the three big Munich banks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Just how wildly misleading the translation &quot;mortgage bond&quot; has
become is revealed by an analysis of the first six months of the jumbo Pfandbrief
market. Between May or June 1995, when the first jumbo was issued by Frankfurter
Hypothekenbank or Bayerische Vereinsbank (definitions differ) and the end
of November, 31 Pfandbrief issues - with an average issue size of Dm1.285
billion and with maturities ranging from three to 10 years - raised a fraction
less than Dm40 billion. But only three of these, raising Dm5 billion between
them, were classified as <I>Hypothekenpfandbriefe</I> or debt securities
backed by a pool of mortgages. The remainder were <I>&ouml;ffentliche Pfandbriefe</I>,
which are backed by public-sector loans financing a wide range of projects
and buildings - but not mortgages. As a result, they theoretically offer
exposure to German government risk and, in effect, are baby Bunds. <BR>
<BR>
The reason for this is simple, but its longer-term implications are not.
German law dictates that each and every new Pfandbrief issue must be matched
by new lending. By definition, there is far more demand for large loans
to the public sector - to finance libraries, schools, hospitals - than to
individual mortgage borrowers. As Dieck says: &quot;I know of no German
house costing Dm100 million.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The result is that only a tiny handful of German mortgage banks - there
are 28 in all - have the capacity to issue jumbo bonds backed by mortgages
just once, let alone continuously. This means that the development of the
jumbo market will depend on the flow of large-scale loans to the public
sector. In other words, its growth will have almost nothing to do with the
German mortgage market. <BR>
<BR>
But international fund managers are neither stupid nor ill-informed. A promotional
campaign by the Association of German Mortgage Banks, together with recently
increased coverage of the market by international investment banks, has
cleared up most of the long-held misunderstandings. The vast majority of
investors now have a sophisticated understanding of the Pfandbrief market.
They know that Pfandbriefe are not backed by individual mortgages, like
the US mortgage-backed market; that no German mortgage bank has ever defaulted;
that Pfandbriefe offer a generous yield pick-up over Bunds; that they can
measure the performance of Pfandbriefe via the newly established PEX Index
and that in the new jumbo market, bookrunners guarantee to quote continuous
bid-offer spreads of between five and 10 basis points, depending on the
maturity of the issue. <BR>
<BR>
They know too that further important structural changes are imminent. Thorsten
Neufeld, a researcher at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, points to the imminent
launch of the new Pfandbrief trading system. The <I>Rentenofferten- und
Handelssystem der Deutschen B&ouml;rse</I> (ROHS) is yet another means through
which the transparency of the market will be enhanced. &quot;Everything
that investors have had in BOSS [Germany's electronic trading system for
equities] will be available through ROHS,&quot; says Neufeld. <BR>
<BR>
In short, the Pfandbrief market is virtually unrecognizable when compared
with what it was five years ago, when it was routinely dismissed by international
investors as an illiquid, invisible, esoteric and poorly defined product
suitable for German consumption only. <BR>
<BR>
But these reforms fail to address a fundamental point. International fund
managers need a more meaningful translation of Pfandbrief than &quot;mortgage
bonds&quot; - the literal translation is pledge letters - so that they can
tell trustees and unit holders what they are doing. And therein lies their
difficulty. At Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) in Frankfurt, fixed-income head
Matthias Preller goes directly to the root of the problem when he says:
&quot;Nobody will ever blame fund managers who underperform in the German
government bond market. But they will blame fund managers who underperform
when they've bought Pfandbriefe.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This situation is ludicrous but true. And it clearly exasperates a number
of issuers, such as Frankfurter Hypothekenbank. &quot;One of the things
which is still widely misunderstood is the issue of credit quality,&quot;
says the bank's head of treasury, Henning Rasche. &quot;If you look at our
&ouml;ffentliche Pfandbriefe, they are among the best you can get. They
are fully collaterized by loans to the German public sector, mainly to the
German federal and state governments. We have a very strong balance sheet
and so far our Pfandbriefe are the only ones rated triple-A by Standard
&amp; Poor's. What more do people want? But we still don't get enough of
a yield discount in return for this super credit quality.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With typical German tenacity, there is no hint of any plan to replace a
name which has been used for about 200 years with something that trips easily
off the international tongue. As Dieck says: &quot;We want to export the
name.&quot;<B> </B><BR>
<BR>
One or two Pfandbrief issuers in Germany are already looking forward to
the possibility of issuing Pfandbriefe in currencies other than Deutschmarks
- in the unlikely event that international investors begin viewing Deutschmark
exposure as dicey. Bub reports that Bayerische Vereinsbank has been studying
this option for &quot;a good nine months&quot; but adds that a non-Deutschmark
Pfandbrief would act only as a &quot;product to cater to very up-to-date
niche interests of the market - by no means would it replace the jumbo market&quot;.
Another bank clearly weighing up the possibility is the Frankfurt-based
Commerzbank subsidiary, Rheinische Hypothekenbank (Rheinhyp). &quot;If I
want to, I can issue a Pfandbrief in sterling, French francs or anything
else,&quot; explains R&uuml;diger Luchmann, head of treasury at Rheinhyp.
&quot;What I am not allowed to do is to take on currency risk. But that
does not matter because we have an increasing flow of foreign currency assets.
We have two offices in Spain, for example, and an office in the UK, and
we're about to open one in Denmark.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>A good mix</B> <BR>
<BR>
Adding credibility to Luchmann's observations about a possible non-Deutschmark
Pfandbrief market is his bank's initiative in appointing an overseas bank
as a member of the consortium of bookrunners for its most recent jumbo Pfandbrief
issue. Although BZW was officially the first non-German bank to lead a Pfandbrief
issue (in a Dm250 million issue on behalf of a Berlin-based mortgage bank),
UBS was the first to act as a joint bookrunner for a jumbo deal when it
joined Commerzbank, DG Bank and Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in running Rheinhyp's
Dm1.5 billion four-year issue of Hypothekenpfandbriefe<I> </I>in September.
UBS has since followed suit in co-leading issues on behalf of Hypo-Bank
and Allgemeine Hypothekenbank (AHB). &quot;I'm looking for a good mix of
international and domestic bookrunners,&quot; says Luchmann, &quot;because
our target must be to make the Pfandbrief more international. Sure, all
the German banks have good international contacts, but to be honest, you
need more than a typical German bank to reach investors in the US or Asia.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In 1996 and beyond, several other international banks are expected to join
UBS in running Pfandbrief issues, with JP Morgan widely tipped as the most
likely candidate to follow the UBS example. &quot;JP Morgan has officially
said that it will install a Pfandbrief desk, and that before it starts acting
as a market-maker, it will invest in a dealing desk and look for qualified
staff,&quot; says Luchmann. &quot;I think that is important because foreign
banks in this market must demonstrate that they have a long-term commitment
to its development. They must be prepared to play the market-maker game
for years - right up until the maturity of a 10-year issue, for instance.&quot;
At JP Morgan in Frankfurt, treasury head Peter Schwicht confirms the report:
&quot;At the moment, we're looking for the right people to trade Pfandbriefe
but I guess that by the start of 1996, we'll be all set,&quot; he says.
And once JP Morgan is in, suggests Schwicht, it will be there for the long
term: &quot;I think the Pfandbrief closes the missing link between the government
market and the Euro-Deutschmark,&quot; he adds, &quot;so it's a market we
will need to have a presence in for a long time. We're celebrating our 30th
year in Germany this year and we have a very large trading outfit here.
This speaks for itself.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
BZW is another foreign house with aspirations to play a more expansive role
in the Pfandbrief market in particular and the German domestic fixed-income
sector in general. As Preller points out, though, his department has only
been up and running since the beginning of April 1994, when he joined BZW
from Merck Finck. His team is now 12 strong and is looking to expand, but
this is difficult because competition for top-quality Pfandbrief staff is
intensifying in Germany. <BR>
<BR>
Preller adds that although BZW is marketing the Pfandbrief actively in London,
Amsterdam and elsewhere, he still finds it difficult to &quot;work through
prejudices&quot; against the instrument, with overseas investors generally
remaining &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;reluctant&quot;. Overall, the
jury appears to be out on the extent to which the speedy development of
the jumbo Pfandbrief market has succeeded in attracting more international
participation in it, and on the extent to which issuers have sought to promote
the bonds internationally. Take, for example, a heavyweight issuer such
as Bayerische Landesbank, which launched its first Dm1 billion jumbo at
the end of July, a 10-year issue for which the bank acted as the sole bookrunner.
&quot;The biggest part of the issue was placed domestically,&quot; says
Karl-Heinz Kr&ouml;ll, senior vice-president of domestic fixed-income sales
at Bayerische Landesbank's Munich headquarters. &quot;That was because,
in the initial stages at least, we have to make sure that the product can
cater to the needs of the investors which have been active in the market
for the last 20 years. For 20 years, it's been an illiquid product and the
first priority is to show German investors that it can be a liquid instrument.
But in the future, we may well bring in foreign bookrunners.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bayerische Vereinsbank also began by focusing on the domestic sector. &quot;In
our first 10-year issue, participation by foreign investors was about 15%,&quot;
says Bub, &quot;but of that 15%, the main portion was probably investors
in countries neighbouring Germany, such as Luxembourg, although we also
had one or two Asian investors involved. In our second jumbo, which was
a five-year issue, the ratio of foreign involvement improved to almost 40%.&quot;
Bub concedes that German funds domiciled in Luxembourg, for example, would
have accounted for some of this 40%, adding that probably around 35% went
- and stayed - overseas. Nevertheless, this represents an impressive improvement,
given that over the last five years it has been estimated that foreign investors
accounted for no more than 10% or 15% of the total volume of outstanding
Pfandbriefe. &quot;We organized numerous selective investor seminars in
Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and so forth,&quot;
says Bub, &quot;and we are touring Asia right now. We are seeing tremendous
interest from Asian central banks, for example, which are looking to invest
their Deutschmark reserves in paper with a credit quality which is very
close to Bunds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For the time being at least, a 35% overseas placement is clearly the exception
and not the rule. At Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, treasury department director
Thomas Ludwig says: &quot;There's still not the volume I would hope to see
from foreign investors. In rated issues, between 15% and 20% maximum is
taken up by foreigners; for unrated issuers, I'd say it's between 10% and
15%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>A question of support</B> <BR>
<BR>
There is also some difference of opinion about the extent to which jumbo
Pfandbriefe have been welcomed by domestic investors. Rasche at Frankfurter
Hypothekenbank notes that since the launch of the jumbo issues, a number
of heavyweight local corporate investors have returned to a market which
they previously refused to touch on the grounds of illiquidity. Ludwig at
Dresdner Bank agrees, adding that the jumbo issues have also bolstered German
investors' appetite for trading: &quot;In the jumbo Pfandbriefe, about 70%
or 80% of the buying has been trading-oriented,&quot; he reckons. <BR>
<BR>
Others are not so sure that this year's burst of activity will ensure a
noticeable increase in support for the jumbo Pfandbrief issues - either
locally or from overseas. At Merck Finck Investment Management in Munich,
managing director Josef Kaesmeier sounds two words of warning. First, it
is important to recognize that so far the jumbo issues have enjoyed something
of a honeymoon period during which investors have been able to exploit the
natural inefficiencies of an immature market. All appear to agree that the
spread between jumbo issues and government bonds remains artificially high
and almost certainly will not be sustained. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jumbos are still attractive in comparison to Bunds,&quot; says Deutsche's
Neufeld. &quot;Although the spread has come in a little recently, they are
still yielding 30 basis points over Bunds, which is a very considerable
pick-up. I think the spread must narrow and at the end of the day will stabilize
at around 10 basis points, which is why we are recommending that investors
buy the jumbo Pfandbrief now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The test for the market, say Kaesmeier and others, will come when the spread
has all but disappeared. At BZW, Preller reports that a number of clients
are already asking why they should forgo even 2bp or 3bp to buy jumbo issues
when they can buy illiquid issues with steady track records. However, Bub
of Bayerische Vereinsbank says that this is missing the point: &quot;One
group that isn't participating in the jumbo market at all are the buy-and-hold
investors who don't like giving up 7bp or 8bp and who claim they don't need
the liquidity,&quot; he says. &quot;But what they overlook is that, if they
were more flexible in their investment behaviour - if, for example, we had
much more activity in repos and securities lending in Germany - they could
achieve a much higher total return on the jumbos than via the standard illiquid
issues.&quot; For this to happen, Bub agrees, German banks themselves need
to be more active in developing efficient securities lending delivery and
payment systems. <BR>
<BR>
Kaesmeier's second warning about the future of the jumbo Pfandbrief is related
to the longer-term participation by domestic investors, who are the traditional
lifeblood of the Pfandbrief market. For years, local institutional investors
clamoured for increased liquidity in the German fixed-income market, Kaesmeier
explains. In August 1994, he says, they were at last given it - not through
the introduction of any new investment product but via a change in Germany's
KAGG (Capital Investment Act). This removed the requirement that Germany's
investment funds could invest no more than 20% of their assets in federal
government paper and the same proportion in the paper of other public-sector
issuers. In theory, therefore, the Act paved the way for local funds to
hold up to 100% of their assets in liquid Bunds and did away with a clause
which more or less forced any fixed-income fund to hold Pfandbriefe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Pfandbriefe vs Bunds</B> <BR>
<BR>
In its <I>Pfandbrief Quarterly </I>of August 1994, Deutsche Bank alerted
its clients to the possibility of a shift of asset allocation away from
Pfandbriefe and towards Bunds. Over a year later, Deutsche's Neufeld insists
that this has not happened and that the jumbo issues have, on the contrary,
made Pfandbriefe more popular than ever among German institutional investors.
<BR>
<BR>
Kaesmeier warns against complacency for two clear reasons. First, he says,
government bonds had an &quot;unfriendly&quot; year in 1994, suggesting
that few investors would have been grasping at the opportunity of jumping
back into the market in the last quarter of that year. Second, he explains
that the process through which Germany's investment funds and their investment
managers draw up and sign management contracts is a lengthy one: &quot;We
only changed our last agreement [dictating asset-allocation patterns] last
week,&quot; says Kaesmeier. As a result, the shift in assets away from Pfandbriefe
and into Bunds could well be still to come, especially if spreads between
the two products narrow. At Merck Finck - which has some Dm3 billion under
management - Keismeier reports that the change is already visible: &quot;Two
years ago, Bunds accounted for 15% of our assets under management,&quot;
he says. &quot;Today that share has doubled to about 30%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Aside from the longer-term buying intentions of international or domestic
investors, there are a number of other imponderables which have been raised
by the development of the jumbo Pfandbrief market. One of these concerns
the prospects for a Pfandbrief future which, until very recently, was cited
by international investors as a <I>sine qua non </I>upon which their future
participation in the market depended. Today, most market participants argue
that the emergence of the liquid jumbo market clearly paves the way for
the introduction of the futures contract. As recent research published by
Deutsche Bank notes: &quot;An underlying volume of Dm20 billion to Dm30
billion of deliverable paper is seen as the pre-condition for a functioning
Pfandbrief future.&quot; This had led Neufeld at Deutsche Bank to insist:
&quot;I think a futures contract will go ahead, although I have no idea
when.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But the longer-term value of a Pfandbrief futures contract appears to be
a subject on which German bankers and analysts are split. One camp argues
that the introduction of liquid jumbos, which bear the same risk profile
as German government securities, will lead first to a narrowing and then
to a stabilization of spreads between Pfandbriefe and Bunds. As a result,
they argue, a Pfandbrief future would be superfluous, given that investors
could use the Bund future as a perfect hedge. Exhaustive research recently
undertaken by Deutsche Bank found that, contrary to popular belief, there
appears to be little correlation between the buying behaviour of foreign
investors and the Pfandbrief/Bund yield spread. <BR>
<BR>
Others argue that the assumption that the Bund future would work as an adequate
hedge is at best hazardous and at worst downright foolish, given the historical
relationship between Pfandbriefe and Bund spreads. According to Deutsche
Bank, the average spread between Pfandbriefe and 10-year Bunds was 10bp
in 1991, widening to 19bp in 1992, 26bp in 1993 and 1994, then retreating
again to 19bp by May 1995. &quot;Spreads never stay stable,&quot; says Preller
at BZW. &quot;To hedge Pfandbrief positions with the Bund future may work
but it is a very dangerous game to play. I am still convinced that a Pfandbrief
future is necessary.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>What is jumbo?</B> <BR>
<BR>
An additional, and probably more important, imponderable resulting from
the evolution of the jumbo market is the future of Germany's smaller mortgage
banks. Few believe that in 1996 and beyond the jumbo market will be able
to continue to absorb the number of issuers it accommodated in its first
six months. Between May and November, 18 banks tapped the new jumbo market:
nine of those came to the market more than once. Ludwig at Dresdner Bank
believes that this pattern will intensify in 1996: &quot;I don't think we
will see many houses appearing as <I>new </I>issuers,&quot; he says, &quot;but
that is not to say that there won't be several more jumbos from existing
issuers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This profusion of new-issue activity has led some local bankers to question
the validity of the expression &quot;jumbo&quot;. Luchmann at Rheinhyp,
for one, believes it has very rapidly become a misnomer. A jumbo issue is
officially categorized as a Pfandbrief raising Dm500 million or more, in
which a sole manager or consortium of bookrunners guarantees to quote a
continuous bid-ask spread. Luchmann questions this definition: &quot;We
have to be absolutely clear about what a jumbo issue really is,&quot; he
argues. &quot;It seems to me that every Hypo [mortgage] bank could tap the
market for Dm1 billion or Dm1.5 billion at least once, and if that happens,
we're going to see 50 or 70 or 90 jumbo issues every year. The danger is
that issues of Dm1 billion will become as illiquid as the old Pfandbriefe
were.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The reason for this, says Luchmann, is clear: several of Germany's largest
institutions, such as the giant insurance companies, remain buy-and-hold
investors - or what German issuers and their bankers used to describe as
&quot;good&quot; investors. As a result, says Luchmann, it is quite probable
that of a 10-year issue of Dm1 billion, up to Dm800 million could very easily
be immediately locked away in the coffers of monolithic institutions and
not see the light of day for another decade. &quot;What we need to do,&quot;
argues Luchmann, &quot;is to increase the size of these issues step by step.
It makes no sense to get to Dm1 billion or Dm1.5 billion and then stop.
We need to get up to Dm3 million or Dm5 billion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If other issuers agree and the jumbo Pfandbrief market becomes more ambitious,
setting a floor of say Dm3 billion, a very obvious problem - in the form
of a very clear fragmentation among Germany's mortgage banks - could arise,
as the smaller mortgage banks will not be able to raise such large quantities.
On the one hand, there will be a cluster of perhaps 10 banks - spearheaded
by the likes of Depfa, Frankfurter Hypothekenbank, Westdeutsche Landesbank
and the major Munich-based banks - which will be able to raise highly competitive
funds and to attract liquidity-conscious international investors. <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, there will be a larger band of smaller mortgage banks
- typically those based in locations outside the main German cities - which
will suddenly find that their cost of funding rises dramatically, perhaps
prohibitively. The fragmentation will become even more pronounced if and
when a larger number of the issuing banks decide to apply for investment
ratings to back individual Pfandbrief issues. As a senior representative
of a mortgage bank puts it: &quot;Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, and IBCA
have all announced that not all Pfandbrief issuers would automatically be
AAA.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A fragmentation of this kind among the issuing banks would be no bad thing
for investors in the German fixed-income market. On the contrary, an element
of diversification in Europe's biggest bond market would be a positive development.
As Kaesmeier at Merck Finck says: &quot;Up to now, investors really only
had the two big segments to play with in the market - Bunds and Pfandbriefe.
Now we will have a third segment, with the Pfandbriefe being divided into
two - low-yielding jumbos and high-yielding illiquid Pfandbriefe.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But while more choice may be welcome to investors, the jury is out, for
now, on the long-term effects of a division within the market of smaller
mortgage banks in Germany. <BR>
<BR>
It is precisely because these smaller institutions are almost certain to
be confronted with higher refinancing costs that several bankers in Frankfurt
and Munich referred to &quot;overcoming resistance&quot; or &quot;breaking
the ice&quot; as a necessary part of introducing and developing the jumbo
Pfandbrief market. Over the longer term, they suggest, the growth and sustainability
of the jumbo Pfandbrief market seems likely to be a harbinger of mergers
among Germany's smaller mortgage banks. As one Munich banker asks rhetorically:
&quot;Why do Deutsche and Dresdner each need to have three mortgage banking
subsidiaries, all issuing Pfandbriefe of Dm500 million or Dm1 billion, when
they could combine their forces and issue blocks of Dm1.5 billion or Dm3
billion?&quot; Why indeed? <BR>

<H3>The Asian dimension </H3>
Thomas Reh, managing director of investment banking at D&uuml;sseldorf-based
Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), spent much of November in Asia. As a representative
of Germany's largest issuer of Pfandbriefe - the bank typically issues between
Dm40 billion and Dm50 billion each year - it was important for Reh to continue
to drum up support for the instrument among investors in Japan, Singapore,
Taiwan and Korea. &quot;I found on my most recent trip that more and more
investors are looking positively at the Pfandbrief market,&quot; he reports.
&quot;We saw interest from central banks in Asia, but also from pension
fund managers and from banks with asset management arms, especially in Japan.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
However, in spite of the good reception he enjoyed in Asia, Reh appears
to be keeping his feet firmly on the ground about the potential of the Pfandbrief
market, for a wide range of reasons. First, he acknowledges that, for the
time being, investors are for the most part capitalizing on a window of
opportunity which is unlikely to stay as widely open as it is now. &quot;We
have to be realistic,&quot; he says. &quot;We are now in a bull market and
spreads are very attractive in comparison with Bunds and other currencies.
Certainly, if we saw the spread come down to below 10 basis points, the
interest would disappear.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Over the longer term, more important than the spreads available between
Pfandbriefe and Bunds, according to Reh, is the level of commitment to quoting
prices market-makers will maintain if sentiment turns sour. He is unashamedly
sceptical about this. It is one reason why WestLB acted as the sole bookrunner
when it launched its first jumbo Pfandbrief - a five-year, Dm2 billion <I>Oeffentliche
</I>Pfandbrief - in September. &quot;One has to be sceptical,&quot; he says,
&quot;that if and when we see higher interest rates, the promises that have
been made by many of the smaller banks about market-making will be kept.
I know that in the 1980s many investors had their fingers very badly burned
by market-makers when the tide turned against the Pfandbrief market. I have
very serious doubts about the smaller bookrunners.&quot; In other words,
Reh suggests that investors ought to look as carefully - if not more carefully
- at the bookrunning consortium appointed by each Pfandbrief issuer, as
they do at the issuer itself. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not saying that in the future I would exclude appointing consortia
to lead-manage our deals,&quot; Reh continues. &quot;But if I did, I would
be very, very choosy about who I'd appoint.&quot; Nor is Reh attracted by
the idea of encouraging foreign investment banks to join bookrunning consortia:
&quot;I can't see that it would add any value,&quot; he insists. &quot;Euro-issues
co-led by foreign investment banks have not lived up to their promises,
and if we're talking about placing perhaps 10% of a Pfandbrief issue internationally,
we can do that efficiently ourselves.&quot; From his experience quizzing
investors in Asia, Reh believes that, for the larger German Pfandbrief issuers,
it is realistic to place between 5% and 10% of an issue outside Europe,
adding that &quot;anybody who tells you that they've placed 25% or 30% of
a Pfandbrief issue in Asia is, to put it bluntly, lying&quot;.<B>-</B> <B><I>PM

<H3>
<B>NETHERLANDS</B>
</H3>

<H2>
<B>Enter Fortis the fourth force</B>
</H2>

<H4>
<B>The sale of ABN Amro's merchant banking subsidiary, MeesPierson, has long been expected in the Netherlands. Selling it to the Dutch-Belgian group, Fortis Investments, has raised a few eyebrows, but is it part of a wider strategy that Dutch financial institutions are following to position themselves for the coming of the euro? Antony Currie reports.</B>
</H4>
<P>
A question mark has hung over the role of MeesPierson since the merger of its parent banks, ABN and Amro in 1991. Its constituent parts, Mees &amp; Hope and Pierson, Heldring and Pierson, were left untouched until they too were merged in 1993; but the newly created subsidiary retained its own corporate culture and supervisory board, and was often seen as competing with its owner. Something had to change, whether through integration or sale. Yet the press release that finally announced its future was a piece of supreme understatement.

<P>
Released at 7.30pm on October 1, just in time to make the morning papers, the fax simply stated that ABN Amro "has been approached by a number of parties" interested in buying its 275-year-old subsidiary. This coincided with ABN Amro's own strategic review of its child, the release said, adding that more information would follow "if developments so require".

<P>
They did. By the end of the week Belgian-Dutch group Fortis Investments had signed a letter of intent and gone straight into eight weeks of due diligence. Fortis, which owns VSB Bank &#173; the fifth largest Dutch bank by shareholders' equity &#173; was not everyone's first guess, being mainly a retail bank and insurance outfit. Competitors had mixed reactions. "It's, what, their 101st company?" said one. "They don't know whether they're Belgian or Dutch, and a huge acquisition such as MeesPierson might just be too much for them to integrate." A senior manager at another bank was slightly more sympathetic to Fortis: "From their point of view it's a chance they simply couldn't refuse. But is their management structure integrated enough for MeesPierson to fit in?"

<P>
Matthijs van den Adel, treasurer and managing director of financial markets at Fortis Investments, doesn't concern himself with the gibes of the competition. "I'm sure some of them weren't at all happy that we got MeesPierson, and I don't think they really understand our structure and strategy." Fortis has long since shown an interest in buying the merchant bank, and appears to have been the front-runner before the October 1 press statement. "We started looking seriously at the possibility over a 10-day period in mid-September," admits van den Adel. "And we made huge efforts to make sure that we got the right picture and the possibility to proceed." 

<P>
Van den Adel is a colourful character with more than 25 years in the business. After working at the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, he moved to Utrecht-based Rabobank in 1975. During his 15 years there he was instrumental in setting up Rabobank's presence abroad, being in charge of its first overseas office in Frankfurt. From there he went to Fuji Bank to head up its western Europe operations, again from Frankfurt, before joining Fortis Investments in 1995. He's even dabbled in a bit of journalism &#173; first as a contributor to <I>Euromoney</I> in the 1970s, and then in the 1990s as presenter of a twice-monthly programme on German TV entitled "<I>Ein Auge auf Japan"</I> (An eye on Japan). 

<P>
He is candid about the purchase: "Buying MeesPierson will allow us to make a quantum leap into those fields where we are looking for expansion, both in the Netherlands and world-wide. It will greatly strengthen our position in primary capital markets and corporate finance, and substantially increase the amount of assets under management." MeesPierson, always mainly a domestic merchant bank for ABN Amro, is for Fortis the gateway to the international capital markets. Of its 4,000 employees, 1,500 work abroad, mainly in London, North America, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. "By acquiring MeesPierson we'll be in the markets 24 hours a day," he says.

<P>
Van den Adel is unconcerned by fears that Fortis might be no more successful at integrating MeesPierson than ABN Amro was. "None of the 100 or so companies that we have are of comparable size to MeesPierson. It's a heavy step for us to take.

<P>
"If you look at the balance sheets of MeesPierson and the Dutch banking arm of Fortis Nederland you'll see that Mees is even larger. So we're not simply going to allow it to be subsumed. It's too important to become just another part of Fortis."

<P>
<B>Morale boost</B>

<P>
For their part, the staff at MeesPierson seem to be relatively happy with the proposed sale, whatever their competitors' misgivings. Chairman Joost Kuiper is said to be especially upbeat. It's easy to understand why. With increased competition from ABN Amro and its recent acquisitions, such as Alfred Berg in Scandinavia and Hoare Govett in the UK, MeesPierson was gradually being sidelined and deprived of its mandate to act independently. As Mr Beelaerts van Blockland, managing director at MeesPierson, puts it: "We clashed with ABN Amro on a lot of deals and we had no clear position as a bank in the eyes of the outside world. An institution of our size should have a clear strategic position within a financial group; we didn't have this at ABN Amro." It was also, he said, "good for morale to end the uncertainty".

<P>
Both he and van den Adel are coy about detailed strategy. To some extent this is because due diligence is set to continue until the end of November, although all three parties involved point to how smoothly and amicably the process is going and expect an agreement by mid-November. But some &#173; albeit tentative &#173; ideas have leaked out. It's more than likely, for example, that MeesPierson will remain in Amsterdam and become the focus for the investment banking side of the business, with Fortis's relevant Utrecht-based operations relocating.

<P>
ABN Amro's strategy is clear, at least on one level. Five years after the initial merger it is now by far the strongest bank in the Netherlands and in investment banking terms must rank in the top 10 in the world; it is positioning itself as one of the top global players for the 21st century. As such, it cannot afford to carry a subsidiary which, as a virtual rival, can offer little or no added value to its balance sheet and price-to-earnings ratio. As Menno de Jager, managing director at ABN Amro's equities joint venture with Rothschild, puts it: "If you've got yourself a nice investment banking network, and you're well covered in Holland, then why keep MeesPierson?"

<P>
Yet, for all the talk of wanting more competition from other Dutch institutions, ABN Amro could not risk selling MeesPierson to a rival, such as the international arm of Rabobank, Rabobank International. Nor was it feasible to split the bank up, because a dismembered bank would have fetched much less and would not have been popular with shareholders.  "We would certainly have been interested in parts of MeesPierson," says Chris Biermann, managing director at Bank Labouchere, "but as far as I'm aware that was never really an option entertained by ABN Amro."

<P>
<B>Positioning for the next century</B>

<P>
So the decision to sell now is an indication of ABN Amro's belief in its strength, both within the Netherlands and throughout its network of foreign-based institutions. "It's a clich&eacute;, I know," says de Jager. "But our philosophy is to think globally and act locally." The sale has also thrown up new rumours in the past two weeks that ABN Amro wants to use the proceeds of the sale to buy the UK-based insurance company, Commercial Union (CU), or at least its Dutch arm, Delta Lloyd. 

<P>
The rumours have certainly helped boost CU's usually soporific share price, but the Dutch markets are divided on the possibility. Some, such as Labouchere's Bierman and ING Bank's senior manager in fixed income and trading and sales Laurens Veldink, say it's no secret that ABN Amro wants to get into insurance. Others are more sceptical about its selling one business to buy another: "If you can't afford it, don't do it," says one senior executive. "If a new acquisition adds to the overall performance of your stocks in P/E terms, you can always get the money out of investors." 

<P>
On the other hand if you have a subsidiary you no longer need and a business you want to buy, it would make sense to match the requirements. According to some bankers, though, ABN Amro would be more likely to buy into other banks than into insurance, possibly spreading its presence in North America.

<P>
But at present its interest is no more than a rumour; CU has a policy of not commenting on rumours, and ABN Amro has made no comment as yet.

<P>
Buying into an insurance company would put ABN Amro in the same category as some of its main rivals: ING Group has Nationale Nederlanden, Fortis Investments is a mix of retail banking and insurance (and investment banking, once the MeesPierson sale is agreed).

<P>
It is also an indication of how it is preparing for its role after the creation of the euro bloc in 1999. All the main Dutch banks, regardless of size, are positioning themselves for the next century. ABN Amro's ambition is to consolidate and maintain its rank as one of the top 10 global investment houses. This is a position to which ING aspires but, having failed to make much impression on the North American market, it is likely to remain a regional player on a global scale, concentrating on its European, Latin American and Asian businesses. 

<P>
Rabobank International<B> </B>has a more modest ambition, says chairman Arthur Arnold, to be a "global niche player", concentrating on providing services world-wide in its four core specialist areas (see box page 68). Labouchere is opening offices in London and New York and looking at closer cooperation with other institutions in the next 12 months, whether through a merger or a joint venture. And Fortis's van den Adel speaks openly of the acquisition of MeesPierson as a means of expanding to avoid being squeezed out: "We have to spread our wings and leave the domestic markets &#173; buying MeesPierson will allow us to branch out of the retail business in the Netherlands and increase our diversity."

<P>
Dutch institutions appear to accept challenges with relish. "It's in our culture," says Arthur Arnold. "We're a small country, and no one else speaks Dutch, so we have always been among the first to seek opportunities elsewhere and cope with challenges."

<P>
Certainly, there was a swift, effective response to the loss of trading to London in the early 1990s. Much of the credit for reversing the trend goes to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, which in 1994 underwent its own technological Big Bang when it introduced the Amsterdam trading system. It also relaxed or discarded outdated rules that gave foreign competitors the upper hand by restricting the actions of Dutch institutions. "I'd certainly pay a compliment to the stock exchange and the regulators," says Beelaerts van Blockland at MeesPierson. It proves that we Dutch fight back when slapped in the face," he continues, chuckling softly.

<P>
But there were other reasons for the revival: "For UK-based investment banks and divisions Amsterdam is just one of their markets," says ING's Veldink. "They started paying less attention to the Dutch market.They could afford to have a more short-term view, whereas we are committed to the market." Jan Krager, Veldink's counterpart in equity sales and trading, adds: "To some extent, of course, it was all a masquerade. London acted as the bookkeeping centre. True, value was always here in Amsterdam. But seeing they were losing their grip on the market, the Amsterdam houses were finally willing to work for less. By cutting back drastically on commission, trading just had to be done here." 

<P>
The underlying strength of the economy has also contributed to the resurrection of Amsterdam. According to a report by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG), the fiscal deficit is down to 2.6% this year, below the 3% threshold set by the Maastricht criteria, and is expected to drop further; inflation, while rising slightly now, has hovered around 2% and no changes to key interest rates are expected. The guilder, long regarded as a surrogate Deutschmark by investors, has been stronger than its mentor recently, owing to Germany's painful integration of the five eastern L&auml;nder.

<P>
This has pushed guilder bond interest rates  between 20 and 60 basis points below those for the Deutschmark, depending on the maturity. This is good news for the issuers, but the lower yield has not deterred investors. "We placed Fls500 million of mortgage-backed paper in July this year," says van den Adel. "We were the first Dutch institution to do this kind of innovative deal. We priced it at 20 basis points over 10-year governments, and sold it within 10 minutes &#173; 60% of it to foreign investors.

<P>
Borrowers have also learned to appeal to a broad range of investor requirements. Long known for its predilection for 10-year paper, the Dutch bond market is now much more liquid, with issues covering the full range of maturities. Long bonds of 20 and 30 years have made appearances, and since 1994 there have been eight perpetual bonds, six of them issued by insurance group Aegon.

<P>
The low interest rates on bonds have led to growing investor interest in Dutch equities, until now usually regarded as the poor relation. The stock market is still admittedly top heavy with the shares of multinationals, such as Philips, Unilever and Shell, but new issues are picking up. Companies such as Gucci have recently done initial public offerings (IPOs), and entertainments group Endema is just finalising its share offer details. Labouchere's Bierman, reflecting the feeling of many, is bullish about the equity market: "The climate is still very favourable, so I expect to see more IPOs next year. In fact, we could use more equity issues in the Netherlands, although some companies just aren't that interested."

<P>
A spokesman at the stock exchange explains why: "Some don't come to the market because they simply don't feel ready for it, or can get funds cheaply elsewhere. The Dutch bank loan sector is well established and an efficient means of raising capital."

<P>
But compared with other stock markets in Europe, Amsterdam is very liquid, ranking as the fifth largest in Europe, and tenth in the world (last year's turnover was fls1.36 trillion &#173; about $800 billion) "You could trade 500,000 ING shares in two hours here,' says ING's Kager. "It would take a week to do the same transaction in France, and not much less time in Germany. Eight million of our shares were traded last Friday, and ING wasn't even the most liquid stock that day!"

<P>
With these trends set to continue, the Dutch institutions should stand in good stead for the future. Equity markets are expected to grow and most expect it will be at least six months before bond interest rates begin to converge with the Deutschmark. Such institutions are also among the most prepared for European monetary union: "It's not a question of what personal preferences are," says Veldink at ING. "It is going to happen and we are preparing for it."

<P>
Ron Lemke, senior managing director at Deutsche Bank de Bary, DMG's Dutch arm, is equally pragmatic: "The euro will unlock new possibilities because currency risk will be eliminated. And the Netherlands is a key European market place. It won't just disappear."

<P>
The big question in the run-up to the euro is what impact Fortis Investments can make on the capital markets through its acquisition of MeesPierson, and how much competition it will be for the top three Dutch banks. The chances are that an unshackled MeesPierson will excel and turn Fortis into a respectable fourth force in the Netherlands.&#009;*

<H2>
<B>Low-profile, high-impact</B>
</H2>
<P>
<I>Interview with R Arthur Arnold, <BR>
chairman, managing board, Rabobank International</I>

<P>
<B>Some might say that Rabobank is another Deutsche Bank. You have a triple-A rating, yet until recently were a relative unknown in the financial markets. You didn't even have an office outside the Netherlands until the early 1980s. Is there a feeling that more use could be made of your rating and balance sheet?</B>

<P>
I don't think it's fair to compare us to Deutsche. We're two completely different banks. We're a co-operative bank, and our mission is to increase customer value, not shareholder value. It's in our blood, our culture. Our customers recognize that we have to make a profit, but as we pay out no dividends, the profits are invested for all our customers.

<P>
We have to compete with the bulge-bracket firms, of course. Our customers are approached by them. We don't mind &#173; it keeps us alert and makes us invest more in our people and to value our customers. Sometimes we have to accept that others are better, and occasionally even advise customers to use a large firm like Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch.

<P>
<B>What progress has been made since the international branch of Rabobank was formed?</B>

<P>
We're growing rapidly, and have 3,000 people working for us now. Our strategy is to be a global niche player, focusing on particular areas. Our success lies in our in-depth knowledge of those areas, and that we don't overstretch ourselves; we stick to our resources &#173; capital and people.

<P>
<B>What are your specialist areas?</B>

<P>
I'd split them into four parts: food and agriculture; healthcare; financial institutions, and international corporates. Admittedly we don't deal with the latter as much as some of our competitors. We deal with them when we feel we can add something. We take a structured and tailor-made approach in which relationships take precedence over a quick deal.

<P>
<B>Is it true that the rating agencies are considering downgrading you?</B>

<P>
Well, I've heard those rumours, but I doubt they're true. The rating agencies do have a dilemma, though: are financial institutions worthy of a triple-A rating? I think they are, and I think the agencies do too. We've had no indication from the agencies that they're considering downgrading us. And I doubt they'll downgrade Deutsche, either.

<P>
<B>Being a relative newcomer to the international markets, do you find that Rabobank International has trouble attracting customers?</B>

<P>
Not at all. In fact I'd say it was quite the opposite, and many welcome our arrival. Our culture and reputation fit in well with their plans and expectations. The emerging markets we're in want us to participate in their growth. Look at Poland &#173; we had our banking licence there approved quicker than any other bank, and we're unique in getting a licence for a banking subsidiary in Brazil. Let's not forget that in these countries food and agriculture are big business, and accounts for about 20% of gross world product. In addition to the European markets, we have a strong presence in the United States, Latin America, Asia and Australia.

<P>
<B>What would you attribute this success to?</B>

<P>
The key to the whole process is networking. It's best not to impose too fixed a structure on your organization. We believe that our role is to offer professional interpretation of information to our customers, or else they will bypass you and go to the competition

<P>
<B>Where do you see the bank in 10 years' time?</B>

<P>
It's difficult to say because things are changing so rapidly. The biggest challenge for all of us is the single currency. Much will be lost: the guilder, for example, is recognized as a strong and stable world currency. It has a de facto fixed link to the Deutschmark &#173; you could say it's almost an extension of it &#173; and is an interesting option for investors as part of the Deutschmark. 

<P>
But with the single currency looming, we must be able to offer good quality euro service. And we shall. We at Rabobank see the euro as an evolutionary process, and we'll go forward with it. As part of this we are going to want to expand our distribution to institutional investors outside the Netherlands. We have a good network here already, and shall improve it with our acquisition of Robeco.

<P>
There is no way back from the single currency. It's driven by customer needs, something which many politicians and commentators tend to forget.

<P>
We also expect our knowledge-driven philosophy to be very successful, especially in the emerging markets. They appreciate our presence and realize that we have a long-term commitment to their markets. But we're not a global player like ABN Amro or Goldman Sachs. We're more of a low-profile, high-impact bank.

<H2> <B>Going native in emerging markets</B></H2> 

<H4> <B>The international houses can no longer claim to have a monopoly of
investment banking in emerging markets. But if you do decide to go native, which
institutions can you trust? We asked those in the know who they like to deal with
when a foreign bank just won't do. James Gordon-MacIntosh reports </B> </H4> 

<H2> <B>Europe</B> </H2> <P> <B>Greece</B>

<P> <I>Alpha Finance</I>

<P> Alpha Credit Bank is described by one analyst as the "most aggressive new
boy" in the Greek investment markets, competing against the big state-owned banks
for business. It is a major primary dealer in government debt, having
participated in all the auctions that have taken place, and is one of 13
market-makers. Alpha Brokerage, the brokerage arm, accounts for 6% of the group's
total revenues.

<P> Business for private banks in the Greek capital market has been hard to come
by because the large public-sector utilities use the state banks. Analysts expect
the private banks' position to improve as Greece liberalizes and the public
sector gets smaller. The state banks will, however, take most of the fee revenue
from any privatizations. Despite these impediments, Alpha has been appointed a
joint adviser to the Greek government on the national gas-distribution project,
and was heavily involved in the IPO of telecommunications company OTE.

<P> <B>Turkey</B>

<P> <I>Turk Ekonomi Bankasi</I>

<P> Turk Ekonomi Bankasi (TEB) has played an increasingly large role in the
Turkish markets as they have undergone rapid development. Over the past four
years it has participated in 11 major public offerings for private companies, in
nine of which it was the lead-manager. TEB's IPOs have been worth a total of $144
million, and in each one it was either lead-manager or co-underwriter. It has a
highly competent and well-regarded research arm, TEB Ekonomi Arastirmalari,
employing 18 people. TEB is an influential player on the Istanbul Stock Exchange,
its trades making up 1.36% of total volume.

<P> One respondent says: "They have a reputation for conservatism rare in Turkish
banks. While others generally borrow with Turkish lira and invest in government
securities, TEB has stuck to banking rather than playing the securities market."

<P> The main problem facing banks such as TEB is finding the large amounts of
capital needed to underwrite. This means that any large and medium-sized business
requires foreign funding input.

<H2> <B>Eastern Europe</B> </H2> <P> <B>Czech Republic</B>

<P> <I>Komercni Banka</I>

<P> The Czech bond market is fairly active, since interest rates are lower than
in other eastern European emerging markets. Komercni's primary issues totalled
Kr15.1 billion ($569 million) in 1995 and have reached Kr14 billion so far in
1996. It successfully joint-managed the Kr3 billion issue of  CEZ together with
ING Barings and has proved a trustworthy business partner. Komercni Banka can
also claim to be the only internationally trusted Czech bank. In 1996 it became
the first and as yet only Czech bank to co-manage a non-koruna Eurobond issue.

<P> Komercni dominates the market for domestic issues, accounting for 40% of the
total volume of domestic primary issues over the last three years. This is,
however, in a market where many major corporations are in effect owned by bank
funds. This has meant it has been difficult for foreign banks to build a firm
position in the market. Komercni's total reserves currently stand at some Kr28.5
billion and are expected to rise following a GDR issue that raised $87.4 million.

<P> <B>Hungary</B>

<P> <I>OTP</I>

<P> The Hungarian markets are still dominated by foreign banks. Privatization was
carried out through them rather than their domestic counterparts. Most corporate
activity has been in lending and the equity market. OTP has led the domestic
fight to regain control of the markets through investment arm OTP Brokers. It is
active in the corporate finance and equity markets and has had some involvement
in share-distribution schemes in more recent privatizations.

<P> The bond market in Hungary has suffered from high interest rates but analysts
expect these will fall and that local banks will be able to take up opportunities
presented by growing business. The locals are still up aganst stiff foreign
competition, however, since CS First Boston and Creditanstalt lead the markets.

<P> <B>Poland</B>

<P> <I>Bank Handlowy w Warszawie</I>

<P> Unlike many of the eastern European markets, Poland's are dominated by
domestic banks. Bank Handlowy, through investment banking arm Bank Handlowy
Capital Markets Centre (CMC), has capitalized on this and accounted for 13% of
stock exchange turnover in 1995. In the first half of 1996 it is estimated that
this has increased to more than 15%.

<P> CMC totally dominates brokerage, controlling 90% of business. It has become
the foremost investment house in Poland because it organizes most sales,
including trading bills and bonds outside the stock exchange and is in fact the
only Polish firm allowed to do so.

<P> In privatizations, domestic houses have been forced to set up joint ventures.
This has happened because, as Frances Cloud, analyst at Nomura Research
Institute, says: "The government wants domestic involvement, but the banks
themselves know they're not up to it." EU membership would offer great
opportunities for Bank Handlowy, as investors set up in the new member states.
Whether CMC will be able to keep its hold in the markets when the competition
hots up remains to be seen.

<P> <B>Russia</B>

<P> <I>Renaissance Capital</I>

<P> Renaissance owes much of its success in investment banking to a few key
members of its team, one of whom is Dirk Damrau, head of research. Damrau was
director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers' London office and is a
specialist on central and eastern Europe.

<P> Since November 1995, Renaissance has taken part in six equity and debt issues
including companies in catering, paper, and broadcasting. Renaissance accounts
for between 15% and 20% of equity broking. Its success is put down largely to the
experience of Anton Kudriashov, ex-head of Russian equity trading at CS First
Boston.

<P> In government securities, Renaissance has applied western techniques of
trading and analysis, while competitors are still using old-style techniques
unique to the eastern European markets. Richard Deitz, formerly of Credit Suisse
Financial Products, has pioneered this approach. Renaissance hopes that it will
become a major player in the GKO (government bond) market, helping western
investors as this market opens up.

<H2> <B>Asia</B> </H2> <P> <B>India</B>

<P> <I>DSP Finance</I>

<P> DSP has recently been ranked first in the Prime database as first in debt
issues and first in rights issues. It accounted for 34.25% of the market in
rights and public issues and has handled issues to the value of Rs138billion
($3.95 billion). This looks set to continue as DSP has mandates for an equity
issue for Bharat Petroleum, a Eurobond issue for State Bank of India and a debt
issue for Industrial Development Bank of India.

<P> <I>Kotak Mahindra</I>

<P> Kotak Mahindra has two arms, investment bank Kotak Mahindra Capital Company
and Kotak Securities, which deals with brokerage, distribution and research. Both
have impressive records, with a total of Rs83.06 billion ($2.37 billion) in
equity issues for 1995-96 and Rs52 billion completed so far in 1996-97. In the
coming months, Kotak is mandated to manage Rs20 billion in debt and equity
issues, including deals for Industrial Development Bank of India and Tata Steel.
Kotak vice-president Shanti Ekambaram says: "In a business dominated by volumes,
our focus has clearly been on quality in each of our products and services."

<P> <B>Indonesia</B>

<P> <I>Danareksa</I>

<P> Danareksa was involved in the issue of six IPOs in 1995, totalling Rp1.89
trillion ($813 million). Since 1983 it has been involved in issues worth Rp21.95
trillion. So far in 1996, liabilities stand at Rp1.78 billion and this is
expected to rise significantly by the end of the year.

<P> <B>Korea</B>

<P> <I>Daewoo Securities</I>

<P> Daewoo is one of the larger investment banks in Korea, having 2,692 staff,
with 45 in its research department. However, most research comes from the highly
regarded Daewoo Research Institute and Daewoo Capital Management. As far as
research goes, Daewoo is as yet unmatched in the Korean market.

<P> It lead-managed W2.9 trillion ($3.6 billion) in debt issues in 1995. The
securities arm managed 10.9% of the IPOs listed on the Korea Stock Exchange and
29.1% of those listed on the Korea securities dealers association automated
quotation system. It makes up roughly 10% of the domestic equity market, which
has a value of some W20.3 trillion.

<P> All this was more than enough to convince our respondents that Daewoo is the
bank to deal with in Korea. One said: "It has a reputation for clean management
both domestically and with the international banking community."

<P> <I>LG Investment Bank</I>

<P> LG Merchant Banking Corp has only 170 members of staff. Of these, 100 are at
head office, 70 in the Seoul branch and some 28 are involved in research. LG
claims it does not need any more employees because its philosophy is to focus on
what it is good at. Its liabilities and shareholder equity totalled W1.8 trillion
for the period to March 1996.

<P> Opportunities for privatization in Korea are extremely limited so the bank
has had no recent experience of dealing in this area. The emphasis is on debt
issues. So far in 1996, LG has managed issues totalling $103 billion and expects
this to rise to $500 billion by the end of the year.

<P> <B>Malaysia</B>

<P> <I>Arab Malaysian Bank Berhard</I>

<P> Arab-Malaysian (AMMB) has its own affiliated research support company,
Arab-Malaysian Securities Sdn Berhad, which employs 17 people. Respondents
consider this a well-run and successful part of the business. In corporate
finance, AMMB had a good year in 1995, managing IPOs worth M$164.6 million ($66
million). This included the IPO of South Peninsular Industries, itself worth
M$64.9 million.

<P> In mergers and acquisitions AMMB took part in a number of deals in 1995,
although all were with domestic companies. Moreover it has not yet had
significant dealings with foreign buyers. In capital-raising, AMMB was manager in
five deals throughout 1995. It is currently advising in eight deals in transport,
waste management and power generation. In equities AMMB has managed 16 issues so
far in 1996 and is mandated to manage another four, including the M$316 million
rights issue for Malaysian company Mulpha.

<P> <B>Philippines</B>

<P> <I>Philippine Commercial &amp; International Bank</I>

<P> PCI has a network of investment banking subsidiaries. The main arms are PCI
Investment Bank and PCI Securities, the stockbroking house. One respondent says
that it is PCI's "reputation for professional delivery" that swayed his company's
vote. This reputation is backed up by its market dealings. In the past four
years, PCI Capital has managed and underwritten Ps44 billion ($1.7 billion) in
equity offerings, counterwritten Ps43 billion and syndicated Ps23.4 billion in
debt and commercial paper.

<P> In 1994, PCI made its mark in the advisory field when it advised the
Philippine National Oil Company on the placement of a $502 million equity stake
in the Petron Corporation. This transaction was voted deal of the year 1994 by a
regional trade magazine. More recently, PCI has been building its international
links with firms such as Salomon Brothers and Jardine Fleming, with which it has
collaborated on equity and debt offerings. One respondent says PCI employs "very
professional people, often with international banking experience from elsewhere".

<P> <B>Taiwan</B>

<P> <I>Grand Cathay</I>

<P> Between 1992 and 1995 Cathay was the main lead manager in corporate bond
underwriting in Taiwan, accounting for 64.5% of a total market worth $2.8
billion. This is all the more impressive considering that its nearest rivals,
Capital Securities and China Securities, managed 9.61% and 4.9%, respectively.
Cathay's good record in this market has continued in the first six months of
1996: it has been bookrunner in issues worth $690 million, 32.6% of the market.

<P> In the first half of 1996 Cathay has lead-managed $54.16 million in IPOs and
rights issues, including the $21.4 million rights issue of Kuoyang and the $11.15
million<B> </B>rights issue of Kan Na Hsing. These mandates have made it the
leading underwriter and market-maker for debt. The upcoming IPO of Asustek, which
Cathay is to lead-manage, will add a further $9 million to its already large 1996
total

<P> One respondent says she voted for Grand Cathay because its research team,
which only numbers 20, is the best in Taiwan by a long margin, and because its
dominance of the local markets is unlikely to be broken in the  near future.
"They occupy the high ground in Taiwan," she says.

<P> <B>Thailand</B>

<P> <I>Phatra Thanakit</I>

<P> Phatra Thanakit places a heavy emphasis on research, as shown by the number
of staff involved in it. Of the 777 total staff,  54 are in research. In 1995,
the house underwrote four equity issues in the finance and printing sectors.
These totalled Bt3.3 billion ($132 million). Its debt issues in 1995 amounted to
Bt21.4 billion, and it has completed two issues to the value of Bt4 billion so
far in 1996. It has advised on seven of the eight Thai privatizations, including
the Bt5.7 billion issue of Thai Airways International and the Bt3.1 billion
Bangchak Petroleum issue.

<P> Phatra has had a consistently high profile in domestic equity marketse,
having been ranked in the top three for market share over the last three years.
In the first half of 1996 it accounted for 5.76% of the market as a broker, and
was ranked second. Phatra says its policy is to "innovate in both the products
and services provided", while "setting the pace in integrity and ethical business
practices".

<H2> <B>Latin America</B> </H2> <P> <B>Argentina</B>

<P> <I>Banco Rio de la Plata</I>

<P> Banco Rio's investment arm is relatively small, consisting of 24 personnel in
its investment banking section and a further 22 in brokerage house Banco Valores
SA Sociedad de Bolsa. In total, Banco Rio has participated in debt and equity
issues worth $1.38 billion. In deals to the value of $170 million it acted as the
sole arranger and dealer. Over the next few months, Banco Rio is mandated to deal
in the $250 million Eurobond issue of Multicanal and the $120 million issue of
Edenor.

<P> As far as equities are concerned, in April 1996 Banco Rio completed the IPO
of Siderar, which totalled $77.7 million. It accounts for 2.6% of trading in the
equities market and 3.5% of the debt securities market. In 1995 its trading on
the Buenos Aires stock exchange reached $5.3 billion in 1995 and has so far
reached $3.3 billion in 1996. For the first half of 1996, Banco Rio increased its
total volume traded in this market by 81% over the same period in 1995.

<P> <B>Brazil</B>

<P> <I>Garantia Bank</I>

<P> Garantia's strengths are in mergers and acquisitions, debt and corporate
finance, where it has consistently ranked higher than foreign banks operating in
Brazilian markets. In mergers and acquisitions, it advised in a greater number of
Brazilian deals than both SBC Warburg and Goldman Sachs. Its share so far in 1996
is 26.2% of the $3.07 billion market. In May 1996, Garantia completed the
acquisitions of Usiminas by its shareholders, the agricultural manufacturers
Iochpe Maxion by AGCO Corp, and Lacta by Philip Morris.

<P> In corporate finance, Garantia has delivered an equally impressive
performance raising over R$300 million ($300 million) in secondary offerings of
minority stakes in state-owned companies. In the private sector, it has done
almost as well raising a total of R$250 million. However, in only the smallest of
these deals was Garantia the sole player.

<P> Garantia has co-managed a total of $490 million equity issues in six deals
for 1996. It is to act as global coordinator of the $120 million to $150 million
issue of Celesc. Its debt issue record is equally impressive: it has participated
in deals worth $411 million so far in 1996.

<P> <B>Mexico</B>

<P> <I>Acciones y Valores de Mexico</I>

<P> Accival is the leader in the Mexican market in terms of market dominance.
With a staff of 300, of whom 16 are involved in research, it is a fairly small
operation, but its record shows it is at the top of its class. In global and
national offerings from 1991 to 1996, Accival accounted for 49.8% of the market,
its nearest rival accounting for 12.4%. For the last eight years, it has been the
market leader in the Mexican stock exchange, accounting for 20% of turnover of
stocks in 1996. This is an improvement on the early 1990s, when Accival's market
share fell from 30% in 1991 to 12% in 1994.

<P> Since 1991, Accival has lead-managed issues to the value of $8.8 billion for
20 companies. These have included Grupo Televisia, Telefonos de Mexico and Sears
Roebuck de Mexico.

<P> One respondent says the reasons for voting for Accival are obvious: "They
are, quite simply, the biggest and the best. They are ahead of the game."

<H2> <B>Africa</B> </H2> <P> <B>South Africa</B>

<P> <I>Standard Bank/Standard Corporate and Merchant Bank</I>

<P> Standard Bank Investment Corporation has proved to be the main agent for
investment into sub-Saharan Africa and is expanding, with offices worldwide. For
1995, its income after tax was R1.27 billion ($280 million), with R1.08 billion
coming from South African operations. However, R88 million of total income came
from continental Europe and the UK, and R12 million from Asian operations.
Standard owns subsidiaries throughout southern and east Africa, including SB
Zimbabwe, SB Uganda, SB Kenya, and SB Tanzania. For 1995, total liabilities and
shareholder equity stood at R87.4 billion for Standard Bank South Africa, while
Standard Merchant Bank had assets of R270 billion.

<P> In 1995, Standard recorded an increase of 8.7% in total funds under
management on the bond and equity markets, to R17.2 billion. Standard has also
been  fairly active in corporate finance, arranging the R1 billion
capital-raising exercise for cellular phone operator MTN. Standard expects
another good year in 1996, and is planning to expand further the range of
services offered.

<H2> <B>Middle East</B> </H2> <P> <B>Israel</B>

<P> <I>Batucha Securities &amp; Investment</I>

<P> Batucha's top position, surpassing Bank Hapoalim, was one of the shock
results of this poll. With only 130 employees in six branches nationwide, Batucha
is leaner than its commercial-banking competitors. It currently holds assets of
$2 billion, $600 million of which are put in the direct control of its investment
managers. Batucha is a growing player in the Tel Aviv stock market, currently
accounting for 7% of daily turnover. The firm runs both retirement funds and
mutual funds. This side of the business is carried out through subsidiaries Clal
Provident Funds and Batucha Mutual Funds Management.

<P> Clal Issuing, the investment banking arm of Clal Capital Markets, has major
dealings in Israeli project finance. It acts as adviser to projects with a total
value of $1.2 billion, acts as packager of the planned Israeli secondary-mortgage
market and is advising on the setting up of a mortgage guarantee company in
Israel. The international department offers detailed reports on equities and of
index options for a client list made up mostly of overseas brokers and financial
institutions.

<H2> <B>Definitions and methodology</B> </H2> <P> The rankings are based on the
views of emerging markets specialists in major international banks, investment
institutions and multinational corporations. <I>Euromoney</I> asked these
specialists to nominate their three most trusted domestic investment banks,
merchant banks, securities firms or stockbrokers. In total we received 196
country replies from 64 institutions. Banks' results are aggregated, where
appropriate, to include fully-owned subsidiaries

<P> For the purposes of this survey, a domestic investment bank is defined as one
which has less than 50% foreign ownership.

<P> <I>Please note that although we have tried to make this poll as reliable as
possible, no poll can be entirely definitive. Euromoney has tried to make the
process of compiling these rankings as transparent as possible. If you have any
further questions, or suggestions, or if you would like a more detailed breakdown
of the results, please call Rebecca Dobson on +44 171 779 8694</I>

<H3> <B>BZW lands CSFB's Morrice in Euromarket hiring spree</B>
</H3> 

 <P> 
 
<H4><B>ROBERT
MORRICE, head of fixed-income sales at CS First Boston in London, is to join BZW
as managing director and head of the firm's European credit business, <I>Euroweek
</I>has learned.</B></H4>

In a move that underlines the seriousness of the firm's
ambition to be a bulge bracket bond house, Morrice will take responsibility for
European origination, syndication and secondary trading in non-sterling
currencies.

<P> Besides his conventional fixed-income role, Morrice will also have joint
responsibility for asset swaps, credit derivatives and credit research. The
sterling bond operations at BZW will be ring-fenced under the &aelig;gis of Tony
Smith, formerly chief executive of the firm's bond division.

<P> Morrice will report directly to Bob Diamond, the former head of fixed-income
at CS First Boston who was recently appointed head of global markets at BZW.

<P> The hiring of Morrice, which should be announced today (Friday), is the
latest in a series of high-profile recruitments since Diamond's appointment,
including that of the highly regarded Abigail Hofman as managing director 
and global head of origination.

<P> But the BZW upheaval has also brought casualties. This week Rob Jolliffe
resigned as co-head of fixed-income syndicate to take a senior fixed-income role
at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.

<P> His departure follows that of his former colleague Steve Hones, who quit to
join PaineWebber two weeks ago. And there is continued uncertainty over the
future of Yann Gindre, BZW's former head of debt origination.

<P> With Hofman's arrival imminent, rumours surfaced this week that Gindre would
almost certainly decide to quit -- possibly taking a handful of his associates
with him -- despite strenuous efforts by the firm to find him a new position.

<P> BZW's hiring of Morrice is the latest in a series of high-profile
recruitments in the Euromarket origination and syndication arena as investments
banks jostle for position in the fiercely competitive debt capital markets.

<P> This week several leading fixed-income origination and syndicate executives
jumped ship, with rumours suggesting that several other key appointments will be
made in the next few weeks.

<P> The biggest casualty of this week's moves was Daiwa Europe, which lost its
two most prominent capital markets bankers -- Philip Porter and Paul Morganti --
in unconnected moves.

<P> Porter resigned as managing director and head of origination and syndicate at
Daiwa to join Tokyo-Mitsubishi International as head of fixed-income origination
and syndication, while Morganti, an executive director of Daiwa, joins HSBC
Markets as director of debt origination. 

<P> Elsewhere on the origination front Roy Boecker, who resigned last week as
head of the debt funding group at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, has resurfaced as
co-head of global origination at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.

<P> Patrick Mullins, who covered Scandinavian borrowers at Deutsche, is also
moving with Boecker to ABN to work on origination in Scandinavia and New Zealand.

Boecker joins ABN as co-head of origination
 
<P> ROY Boecker, managing director and head of the debt funding group at Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell, has resigned to join ABN AMRO Hoare Govett as co-head of global
origination with Donald Ogilvie.

<P> Boecker and Ogilvie will be responsible for international clients, and
Douglas Grobbe will continue to head up the bank's Benelux origination effort.
Boecker is an 11-year veteran of Deutsche Bank.

<P> Also leaving Deutsche and joining Boecker at ABN AMRO is Patrick Mullins, who
covered Scandinavian clients for Deutsche. He will be senior coverage officer at
ABN AMRO, initially focusing on Scandinavia and New Zealand. Both will <BR> be
based in London after spending a short time in Amsterdam.

<P> "These are extremely important hirings for us which I believe will bring a
new impetus to our origination effort," said Jonathan Greenwood, head of the
bank's fixed-income operation.

<P> The recruitments are part of the bank's strategy to base half its syndicate
and origination operations in London and half in Amsterdam. By the end of this
year, the bank hopes to have the dollar bloc syndicate function based in London
with Brian Lawson, global head of syndicate, and Paul White, head of new issue
trading, relocating from Amsterdam to London.

<P> Despite the two-centre operation, the bank will be treated as one unit
operating under one P&amp;L function, said Greenwood.  

<P> ROB JOLLIFFE, joint head of fixed-income syndicate at BZW, has left to join
<B>Goldman Sachs</B> as joint head of the Frankfurt office's fixed-income
operation with Karsten Moller.

<P> Jolliffe will be responsible for DM syndicate and will also assist with the
bank's sales efforts. Richard Mann takes over as acting head of syndicate at BZW
in London.

<P> <B>UBS</B> has appointed Chris Rogers as European utilities analyst,
specialising in electricity stocks. He joins from SBC Warburg where he held a
similar position.

<P> At UBS he will work alongside Paul Rogers, Iain Turner and Richard Franklin
and should take up his new position on September 9.

<P> <B>BZW</B> has made two new hirings to its yen business operation in Tokyo.

<P> Patrick Lin becomes managing director and head of fixed income, taking
overall responsibility for establishing BZW's yen business. He joins from Lehman
Brothers, where he was managing director in fixed income.

<P> Stuart Baker, who becomes a director of fixed-income trading, is also joining
from Lehman Brothers where he worked as co-head of Japanese government bond
trading.

<P> Both Lin and Baker will be working with Mark Dearlove, who recently joined as
director and head of short-dated Japanese government bonds and repo trading.

<P> Separately at <B>BZW</B>, Bill McQuaker and Nigel Hicks are joining the firm
as research analysts.

<P> McQuaker, heralded to be the number one quantitative analyst <BR> by Extel
and Reuters, leaves at NatWest Markets is to join BZW's strategy team, combining
his quantitative research with the firm's general research into the UK market.

<P> Hicks, recently ranked the best small companies analyst, will be joining the
leisure team at BZW, leaving Panmure Gordon where he has worked for the last five
years.

<P> <B>Sanwa International Plc</B> has been offered membership of the Amsterdam
treasury bond market, the Amsterdam Bourse announced this week. Sanwa is expected
to begin trading today (Friday).

<P> <B>HSBC Securities</B> has announced the appointment of Clive Bannister as
deputy chief executive officer in its New York office.

<P> He will be taking responsibility for equity capital markets, mergers and
acquisition orgination and advisory and Latin American origination and advisory.

<P> He will also be a member of the board of both HSBC Markets and HSBC
Securities. Bannister joined HSBC in 1994.

<P> Jerome Zurcher has been named as vice president in the derivatives sales
group at <B>Bankers Trust</B> in Zurich. He will be responsible for marketing
derivative products to the Swiss client base.

<P> Zurcher will report to Eduard Kauffman, a former colleague from Goldman Sachs
where he worked as a derivatives marketer to Swiss institutional investors.

<P> <B>Lehman Brothers</B> has hired Elise Horowitz as an Israeli country
analyst, strengthening the firm's emerging markets research team.

<P> Horowitz joins from Zannex Securities in Tel Aviv where she was responsible
for marketing Israeli equities to clients in North America, Europe and the Far
East, and for performing financial and securities analysis of public companies
listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

<P> <B>Commerzbank</B> has announced two new appointments this week to its sales
and trading businesses.

<P> Richard Hood is joining Commerzbank from Salomon Brothers as head of Gilts
trading. He will report to George Clark, head of trading.

<P> Also, Peter Hamlin is leaving Daiwa to become head of UK sales at
Commerzbank. He reports to Darryl Bilverstone, global head of sales.

<P> Both Hood and Hamlin are expected to start in mid-September.

<P> <B>NatWest Markets</B> has made several new appointments to its fixed-income
business in London.

<P> Johan Bjurenvall leaves BNP to become a senior fixed-income salesman covering
Scandinavia. Paul Silk will become head of the NZ$/DM government bond trading
desk reporting to Kevin Arnold, the European head of government bond trading. He
leaves Bain &amp; Company in Australia, where he was head of fixed income.

<P> Henri Lalanne has been hired as an asset swap trader reporting to Kanti Shah
who runs the credit rating group. Lalanne was previously at Cr&eacute;dit Local
in France where he held a similar position.

<P> Also, Harry Melandri will be joining as a bond options trader working for
Chris Jaques, the head of the firm's bond options <BR> desk. He previously worked
in a similar capacity for ING in New York.

<P>
<B>Kiwi market takes off</B>

<P>
ACTIVITY in the bond markets remained slow, with another highly successful global dollar offering from Canada and a record week for the booming New Zealand dollar bond market the highlights.

<P>
With the end of the holiday season fast approaching, the pace of new issuance is set to hot up in the coming weeks with most frequent borrowers said to be considering transactions, many of them in US dollars.

<P>
Among the potential deals at the most advanced stage of planning are a $200m 10-year issue for Kansai International Airport at 28bp over via IBJ, and up to $500m of 10-year debt at 33/34bp over for Kansai Electric Power, probably via Paribas. Export-Import Bank of Korea is rumoured to be looking at a five-year dollar offering at 40bp over.

<P>
Following a successful French franc debut for GMAC, the African Development Bank is expected to launch a Ffr2bn transaction, probably in 10 years via SocGen, following the completion of roadshows in London and Paris in mid-September.

<P>
Bankers in Frankfurt are now saying that French agency Cades is more likely to access the dollar market before the Euro-DM sector, particularly as the mixed reception for the DM4bn <I>L&auml;nder </I>issue last week has made further jumbo issuance more difficult.

<P>
The success of Canada's $1bn global, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Scotia, confirmed the possibilities for issues in the 10-year sector following the World Bank's deal last week, and Denmark tested the appetite for short-dated, retail-targeted paper.

<P>
A mixed bag of Euro-DM deals was helped by a market rally after the Bundesbank cut the repo rate to 3% on Thursday.

<P>
The Canadian dollar market reopened with two deals, but the recent upsurge in Kiwi dollar issuance reached new heights as six deals totalling NZ$600m came to the market.

<H3> ITALY </H3>


<H2> <B>The quest for a risorgimento</B> </H2> 

<H4>
<B>Italy's almost 1,000 banks are the least profitable in Europe and depend
heavily on traditional loan income. Consolidation of institutions and
diversification of products is seen as inevitable, particularly if further
privatizations are to succeed. Philip Moore reports on the problems and progress
of reconstruction</B> </H4> 

<P> The Italian banking system faces complex
challenges as it restructures in preparation for complete or partial
privatization. A recent report by US credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's
(S&amp;P) points to profitability and capitalization problems that partly result
from much of the industry being directly or indirectly state-controlled and
partly from fragmentation. It notes that although there has been economic
recovery in the past two years, Italy's banks are still dogged by the low
profitability that emerged at the beginning of the decade because of recession
and deteriorating asset quality. This stagnation, the report adds, reflects
"tougher competitive pressures on operating margins and insufficient cost
controls".

<P> Capitalization is another peculiarly Italian problem. Whereas banks in most
other European countries have strengthened their capital bases in recent years,
in Italy, the S&amp;P report notes, these have declined "because of poor earnings
retention and ambitious acquisition strategies".

<P> Low profitability and weak capitalization have adversely affected Italian
banks' credit ratings. The S&amp;P report notes that Italy is near the bottom of
the EU pile, with its "12 largest institutions having an average rating at the
low end of the 'A' category".

<P> Italian banking's sorry state is to a large extent a result of its history.
Until recently it was hemmed in by a banking law drawn up in 1936 which severely
restricted the services particular categories of banks could provide. In many
ways banks seemed trapped in a centrally-planned economy rather than enjoying the
opportunities of an open market.

<P> The curious ownership structure of many of Italy's 1,000-plus banks has
exacerbated their problems. Although privatization has begun, many banks are
still either directly state-owned (effectively controlled by the Italian
treasury) or under the control of charitable foundations that are themselves
government-supervised.

<P> "Foundations," explains the S&amp;P report, "are non profit-making bodies
whose goal is to promote public and social interests with particular regard for
the development of scientific research, education, the arts, social welfare and
other charitable concerns." At the end of 1995, foundations and associations
still controlled over half of Italian banks.

<P> This structure is in itself not particularly conducive to profitability and
the problem has been compounded by severe overstaffing. Italy is highly unionized
(40% of the labour force) and labour laws are legendary for their inflexibility,
so most Italian banks have more personnel than they need &#173; or indeed can
afford. Banks are traditionally higher payers than other Italian industries and
this has meant strikingly low return on equity (ROE) ratios compared with
European competitors. Goldman Sachs figures indicate that at the end of 1995
average ROE for European banks was 12.8%, with the UK at the top of the list with
21.1%; Spain and the Netherlands at 12.6% and 11.7% respectively, in line with
the average; France on 6.2%, considerably below the average; and Italy trailing
with 4.13%.

<P> <B>Belated change</B>

<P> Change is late in coming. But recently privatized banks have started speaking
a new language. At Credito Italiano, for example, managing director Alessandro
Profumo, a recent recruit from consultants McKinsey, has publicly announced that
his bank is seeking to lift ROE from 3.3% in 1995 to a lofty 11% in 1998. Few
analysts share Profumo's bullishness. For example, Stefano Alberti, head of
research at Intermobiliare Securities in Milan, suspects that 9% would be a more
realistic target. The important point though, say Alberti and other observers, is
that Italian bankers are starting to use &#173; and to understand &#173; terms
such as ROE. "Three or four years ago the only people in the banking industry who
were talking about ROE were foreign banks such as ourselves," says Alessandro
Massarelli, director at Citibank's Milan-based global relationship banking
department.

<P> Banks such as Credito Italiano or Banco Ambroveneto &#173; which posted a
1995 ROE of 8% and is projecting at least 10% in 1996 &#173; are, however, very
much the exception. At the other end of the spectrum are institutions like Banco
di Napoli, which reported 1995 losses of around $2 billion (the worst result in
Italian banking history). In between lie more than 900 other banks, 827 of which
have assets of less than L1,500 billion ($1 billion) and are categorized as being
"minor" by the Bank of Italy. It's small wonder Claudio Costamagna, vice-chairman
of the Goldman Sachs Sim (investment bank), describes Italy as "easily the most
fragmented banking industry in Europe".

<P> These daunting problems &#173; an opaque ownership structure, undistinguished
ROEs and absurd fragmentation &#173; have convinced most Italian bankers that
wholesale restructuring must precede widespread privatization. The impetus for
change, they say, comes from three related sources. First and foremost, the
regulatory authorities are seeking to bring Italian banking practices into line
with those elsewhere in Europe. As a result, the Bank of Italy has dictated that
foundations must reduce their banking stakes within the next five years. It has
also given its public blessing to hostile bank takeovers. This would have been
considered unthinkable five years ago, say local bankers.

<P> Second, adds Angelo Papa, head of financial products at Deutsche Bank in
Milan (which is widely cited by its competitors as by far the most successful
international bank in Italy), pressure for change has increasingly been brought
to bear by Italian industry through pressure group Cofinindustria, which has
concluded that inefficiencies in Italian banking now threaten the long-term
viability of Italian manufacturing.

<P> A particular problem is that lending policies have had much more to do with
politics and relationships than with balance sheets or fundamental analysis. A
recent report from credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service noted that "the
depth of loan quality problems has been exacerbated by generally unsophisticated
credit approval, review and monitoring systems". The report also points out that
the Italian Bankers' Association has drawn attention to "unsystematic <I>ad hoc 
</I>lending criteria, a superficial due diligence approach, insufficient
awareness about cross-group borrowing risks and undisciplined loan-monitoring
<BR> procedures".

<P> A third impetus for change is increased European integration and the threat
of greater competition from foreign banks. This is already evident in investment
banking. Italian government bond trading is dominated by foreign houses, with JP
Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers the leaders. In the first half of
this year, JP Morgan led more Eurolira bond issues than Credito Italiano, the
leading Italian house, with a market share of more than 15% in volume terms. In
no other Eurocurrency (apart from the recently established Czech koruna market)
do foreign houses enjoy such dominance as lead managers.

<P> Goldman Sachs's Costamagna reckons that to be overconcerned about investment
banking is to miss the point about foreign competition. "I would look at the
retail side, which is really the crucial point," he says. "Up until now the
retail banking sector has been heavily protected. Very few foreign banks have
entered the market in a massive way, with the possible exception of Deutsche
Bank. Looking forward, I'm not sure that the system will be able to sustain that
in the context of an <BR> integrated Europe."

<P> If and when that protection evaporates, international banks are expected to
home in on Italian savings, which are second in volume to those in Japan and
larger than any other European country's. Deutsche Bank has already made
substantial inroads and is now the ninth-largest fund manager in Italy. US
investment management company Puttnam has recently indicated its interest in
signing a joint venture with the regional bank Cassa di Risparmio di Brescia in
Lombardy.

<P> International interest in investment management in Italy is sure to gather
momentum for two reasons. First, the long-awaited development of a private
pension fund industry as government provision is reduced will attract
international fund managers with proven track records. And second, though
Italians are prodigious savers, the products on offer to them are for the most
part unsophisticated.

<P> Michele Calzolari, director general at the investment bank Caboto Sim (100%
owned by Banco Ambroveneto), points out that only around 25% of Italian savings
are managed professionally. The rest is channelled into government bonds, real
estate or bank deposits &#173; or kept under the mattress.

<P> <B>Cost-cutting and diversification</B>

<P> The restructuring of Italian banking will need to take place on two fronts.
First, it will have to involve dramatic cost-control measures allied to
diversification of products, and geographical penetration aimed at bolstering
ROEs and making Italian banks attractive to equity investors. Second, there will
need to be a restructuring of ownership and extensive concentration if Italian
banks are to become big enough to compete internationally. Neither process is
going to be easy.

<P> Banks are already attempting to cut staffing costs &#173; or at least, as an
initial move, to make better use of staff. A palliative was provided by a Bank of
Italy decision to remove an outdated law preventing banks from opening new
branches without its approval (which was seldom given). Several banks are taking
advantage of their freedom by opening smaller branches to which they are
relocating excess staff. Banco Ambroveneto, for example, is opening some 30 to 35
new branches a year, most of which are breaking even within one to two years,
says Gigliola Zecchi, head of the bank's international division.

<P> But banks cannot go on opening new branches forever. As the S&amp;P report
warns: "The traditional commercial banking market will soon be close to
saturation." Jobs will have to go altogether, rather than being moved from one
pocket to another. Kevin Tempestini, Italian equity strategist at Salomon
Brothers in London, says that the Italian banking industry's 330,000-strong
workforce needs to be reduced by at least 10%. "I would expect this to cost at
least around L50 million up-front on average for each employee," he says, "which
in total comes to L1.5 trillion (or $1 billion)."

<P> What is more, he points out, banks &#173; unlike industrial companies with
more than 5,000 employees &#173; are not entitled to government financial support
for redundancy payments. "As we have a centre-left government whose number one
priority is to reduce unemployment, political support for this is unlikely to be
very visible," he says.

<P> Many banks are addressing the problem through early retirement schemes, some
with a surprising degree of success. According to a recently published Morgan
Stanley research bulletin, San Paolo Bank, Italy's largest in terms of assets,
recently called for 600 employees to accept early retirement: in the event, 900
volunteered to leave.

<P> Productivity is the other face of cost-cutting and analysts argue that more
should be done through the adoption of such measures as Anglo-Saxon style
performance-related pay. San Paolo is another pioneer here, having introduced an
incentive-based salary plan for management. There's a long way to go, though, to
match standards elsewhere. Gregorio De Felice, head of the research department at
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) in Milan, notes that the "variable" (or
performance-related) share of personnel costs in Italian banking is still only
around 2% or 3% of the total, compared with anything up to 30% or 40% in the US
or the UK.

<P> A radical shift in the product range offered by Italian banks to increasingly
sophisticated and demanding local customers is an even more important priority.
"In the Italian banking industry about 80% of total revenues are generated from
lending," says Deutsche Bank's Papa. "Much too little comes from commission or
other fee-based income. The banking system here has to work on the development of
alternative products rather than relying on what seems to be an ever-dwindling
spread in the lending market." He suggests that Deutsche's Italian operation,
which derives roughly half its income from non-lending activities, could act as a
"model" for other Italian banks.

<P> As examples of potential growth areas, Papa cites credit cards,
bancassurance, custody services and payment systems. "The concept of the back
office as a profit centre has rarely been explored in Italy," he says. "Foreign
exchange dealing, for example, has been seen purely as a service to the branches
rather than as a profit centre in its own right."

<P> Asset management is the most important area for diversification. Although
international banks would hardly regard this as ground-breaking, in Italy, it
would involve a marked cultural change. "Don't forget that until very recently
the banking industry was actually afraid of asset management," he says. This was
simply because asset management was seen as a dangerous new-fangled competitor to
familiar bank deposits.

<P> Alongside product restructuring goes geographical restructuring.
Traditionally, Italian banking has been strongly regionalized in three distinct
areas: north, central and south. Historically, banks that have attempted to
expand much beyond their local franchise have met with a chilly response and have
often been forced to withdraw, licking their wounds and counting their
non-performing loans.

<P> The south &#173; where compared with the north the economy is weak, staff
costs are high and the ratio of bad debts is some three times higher &#173; has
historically been considered perilous territory for northern-based banks. But
those with franchises in the south are also said to have struggled to do well in
the north. Stefano Marsaglia, director at Rothschild Italia, which is working
with JP Morgan on restructuring Banco di Napoli, explains that the southern
bank's ill-fated forays into the north accounted for "huge losses". With only a
1% market share in the north, the bank was forced to lend to take on relatively
risky borrowers in its endeavours to expand &#173; a move doomed to failure.

<P> Today, however, a number of the stronger banks &#173; Ambroveneto is the best
example &#173; are seeking to expand by acquisition into previously unexplored
regions. Although risks are higher in the south, so are potential rewards, given
the relative lack of sophistication of industries and investors there.

<P> According to figures published by the Bank of Italy, the surplus of deposits
to loans in the south is much higher than in the north. At the end of 1995,
deposits totalled L473,000 billion in the north, with a 15% surplus over loans of
L413,000 billion. In the south, deposits totalled L176,000 billion, compared with
total loans of L111,000 billion &#173; a surplus of 59%.

<P> <B>North-south divide</B>

<P> Ambroveneto believes that in spite of the risks involved in the south, the
region's potential in such sectors as agriculture and tourism justifies expansion
there, effectively making Italy south of Naples, say, the equivalent in global
banking terms of an emerging market for institutions located primarily in the
north. "We've been acquiring practically one bank per year, mainly in the south,
because our aim now is to become a strong national bank rather than one which is
strong only in the northern region," says Zecchi.

<P> As a result of initiatives by Italy's top banks to cut costs and restructure
their product ranges, international analysts are now starting to regard them as
heavily undervalued stocks with recovery potential. To date this year, Morgan
Stanley has published "strong buy" recommendations on San Paolo; commented on
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) as "1995 problems solved, ready to roar"; and
described Banca Popolare di Milano's performance as "a true turnaround".

<P> Morgan Stanley is not necessarily implying that these largely northern-based
banks are the acme of efficiency and profitability. Its view is rather that the
best Italian banks should not be valued at a discount to what is already Europe's
cheapest equity market in Europe on a price-to-cash-earnings basis. According to
the Morgan Stanley calculations, IMI stands at a 26% discount to the market on
this basis, while Banca Popolare di Milano's discount is closer to 50%. Both
discounts appear to be unjustifiably wide.

<P> Analysts consider that concentration among Italy's banks needs to be
accelerated. So far the majority of mergers have involved very small players. The
exceptions have been the creation of the new Banca di Roma through the merger in
1991 of Banco di Roma, Cassa di Risparmio di Roma and Banco di Santo Spirito;
and, more recently, the acquisition by Credito Italiano of Credito Romagnolo,
which was subsequently merged with Carimonte Banco to create one of the largest
private regional banks in Italy, Rolo Banca 1473.

<P> Some analysts express astonishment at the price Credito Italiano was prepared
to pay for Credito Romagnolo. One competitor in Milan scoffs that "Credito
Italiano paid more [over two times book value] for Rolo than [state holding
company] IRI generated from the privatization of Credito Italiano in the first
place, which is a nonsense".

<P> The pricing problem is one of the biggest obstacles to further banking
consolidation. Rothschild Italia's Marsaglia points out that "Italy is probably
the most expensive place in Europe to buy a bank. Typically acquirers would have
to pay more than two times book value."

<P> There are sound reasons for these distorted prices, say Milan-based bankers.
First, given that the obstacles to opening new branches have been removed only
recently, one of the few viable ways to grow was through acquisition. Banks
quoted on the stock exchange have typically been cheap &#173; trading at around
0.7 times book value &#173; but have also been unattractive and usually
unattainable acquisition targets. Low returns on equity plus with extensive
cross-holding ownership structures (and, in the case of Credito Italiano, an
in-built poison-pill mechanism) have combined to rule out publicly-quoted banks
as acquisition targets.

<P> <B>The cost of consolidation</B>

<P> This has left the smaller, regional banks as potential prey. However, few of
these offer acceptable levels of profitability, so demand for those that do far
exceeds supply. As a London-based investment banker explains, a small, regional
Italian bank that is profitable may attract 15 or more bidders, while a larger,
"available" institution would be unlikely to attract more than three at the most.

<P> The London banker says two further complications impede mergers. "The first
problem," he says, "is that if you're a large listed bank and your shares are
trading at 0.7 times book value, it is enormously dilutive to fund an acquisition
through the equity market if you're buying a bank at 2.5 times book value."

<P> A second obstacle, he says, derives from Italy's labour laws. In most
friendly bank mergers in Italy, he explains, the acquirer will have to sign
contracts pledging to protect jobs in the newly-merged bank. "That means that in
the concentration process which we have seen so far very little added efficiency
has been created. Shareholders of listed or even unlisted banks are unlikely to
support bids when they do not believe in the ability of the merged banks to
deliver immediate returns in terms of higher efficiency. So it's a difficult
puzzle and I wonder if we will see the sort of concentration among the banks
which some people expect and which this market so desperately needs."

<P> Others share this concern. Deutsche Bank's Papa says: "Consolidation is the
only way forward if we are to create large banks which can compete in a
meaningful way internationally. But unfortunately I don't see the likelihood of
big mergers among the top banks which would create five or six genuinely large
players, rather than 25 or 30 medium-sized banks."

<P> Rothschild Italia's Marsaglia is more sanguine. "I wouldn't be surprised if
we were to see a big merger within two years. We will have to, if Italian banking
wants to avoid being marginalized internationally. After all, if you're five
times smaller than Deutsche Bank, what sort of role can you expect to play
internationally?"

<P> At the moment Italian banks have virtually no international presence. One of
the few exceptions is BCI, which in May 1994 raised to almost 100% its holding in
Grupo Sudameris, which consists of more than 30 banking and finance companies in
Latin America with some 250 outlets and 6,000 employees. However, as a recent
report published by London-based credit-rating agency IBCA notes, BCI may be the
fifth-largest bank in Italy in terms of consolidated assets, but ranks a modest
80th in the world.

<P> Far from seeking to expand internationally, a number of other Italian banks
are closing down their limited foreign operations to cut costs. "What is very
clear and in many ways very sad is that Italian banks have basically disappeared
from the international scene," says a representative of a US investment bank in
Milan. "For example, 20 years ago the likes of BCI were able to compete overseas
with SG Warburg or Deutsche Bank. Today they most obviously cannot."

<P> Whether or not this matters is a moot point. Some Italian bankers argue that
international expansion has hardly been spectacularly successful for some of the
world's most deep-pocketed banks and that Italy's banks have a fairly impregnable
hold on the local retail market, which is where the serious money is to be made.
Others, however, suggest that Italian banks' lack of international expertise will
mean that they are less well placed than their foreign competitors to benefit
from structural changes to the Italian financial services industry.

<P> <B>Corporate bond market</B>

<P> One of these changes, several Milan-based bankers suggest, will be the
introduction and rapid evolution of a corporate bond market, the impetus for
which is expected to be the recent changes to fiscal legislation that reduce the
attractiveness of certificates of deposit as a means of raising bank funding.

<P> The Bank of Italy has indicated in its latest annual report that it would
like to see a bank bond market develop which could later act as the benchmark for
a corporate bond market. This in turn would present Italian banks with both
opportunities and threats. For the stronger players, it will offer further
opportunities for product diversification, allowing banks to act as issuers,
distributors and market-makers; for the weaker institutions an active bond market
would simply add yet another source of funding to compete with bank deposits.

<P> But the development of a corporate bond market &#173; if it evolves in tandem
with a more sophisticated institutional investor base in Italy &#173; would also
benefit international banks in Italy that have a proven track record in
fixed-income markets elsewhere in Europe.

<P> Market observers seem agreed that the formidable restructuring challenges
which lie ahead for Italian banking will make the eventual privatization process
a delicate one.

<P> Currently on the agenda, and originally scheduled for the second half of
1996, are the partial sales of stakes held by controlling foundations in Bancario
San Paolo di Torino and savings bank CARIPLO.

<P> In both sales, say investment bankers in London and Milan, the selling
foundations will need to pursue a phased approach, beginning with stakes of
perhaps 20% and being satisfied &#173; at least in the initial tranches &#173;
with very low prices.

<P> As a London investment banker uncompromisingly puts it: "Investing is the art
of pricing. Everything has a value and everything is a good investment at the
right price. In the case of the Italian banks, that price is currently well below
book value. So the foundations will have a choice &#173; either to sell cheaply,
or not to sell at all.

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<H2>Moving into the end game </H2>
<B>by David Roche</B> <BR>
<BR>
It's an irony that better economic performance heralds thinner pickings
in the financial markets. And faster global growth lies ahead. That's why
it's time investors reduced their equity holdings, got out of most bonds
and built up cash. <BR>
<BR>
There is a growth shock out there for all the OECD economies. I expect real
GDP to grow at 3.4% next year. What's more, inflation will be over 3% in
the OECD by mid-1997, compared with just over 2% this year. <BR>
<BR>
This growth shock is the result of extraordinary monetary easing and the
amazing purchasing power created not only for corporations through their
increasing profit share but also for households. Money supply is growing
much faster than GDP in the OECD and it also costs less than the average
of the last 10 years in both nominal and real terms. And international liquidity
is booming, too. <BR>
<BR>
Labour income has soared in most places, despite rising unemployment in
Europe and Japan. Most people have kept their jobs and got paid more in
real terms, while in the US <BR>
8 million new jobs have been created in the last three years. Households
have also got richer through their investments. <BR>
<BR>
So the purchasing power of households and corporations (the two major economic
players) has steadily increased, while that of governments has steadily
declined. Corporations got richer because unit costs dropped (principally
through new ways of working and making things) and so profits rose as a
share of value added. Households got richer because workers who kept their
jobs (as in Japan and Europe) or were recruited into new ones (as in the
US), got paid more because their productivity rose. Also, the price of many
goods and services fell, increasing households' purchasing power. This is
not the stuff of recessions, particularly if money is cheap. Household savings
rates are already at, or above, long-term averages, and it doesn't pay to
save. <BR>
<BR>
But don't be fooled. This burst of growth is an end-of-cycle affair, with
all that that entails for productivity, interest rates and inflation. This
has been a very long cycle. In the OECD it has been more than five years
since the trough. This cycle now contains the seeds of its own undoing.
The phenomena which caused its longevity - wage disinflation, rising
profit shares, increasing productivity and pricing power to the people<I>
</I>(PPP) - are unrepeatable. <BR>
<BR>
The combination of PPP (which held down prices) and wage disinflation (which
pushed profits up without destroying real incomes from work) created a happy
history. Corporations got richer, their employees got wealthier, inflation
and interest rates fell, and financial markets went up. To put icing on
the cake, the three major world economies (the US, Germany and Japan) combined
big budget deficits with loose money. <BR>
<BR>
<B>High growth kills the cycle</B> <BR>
<BR>
The cycle will end for three reasons. First, as at the end of every cycle,
productivity growth is waning, particularly in the US and Europe. And in
Japan the corporate welfare state keeps unemployment on companies' P&amp;L
rather than the government's accounts. That will keep productivity from
rising much more. As productivity growth slows, increased demand will raise
the cost of satisfying it. <BR>
<BR>
Second, PPP is being transformed into CPP (corporate pricing power). So
much has been done to streamline corporations that they are now in a position
to recapture some of their lost pricing power. <BR>
<BR>
Third, cyclical effects are made worse by tardy fiscal and monetary reactions
to them. In this cycle, the central bankers will respond belatedly because
each of them has a hot domestic reason not to tighten. US Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan has a presidential election to contend with. Bundesbank
president Hans Tietmeyer is pandering to chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans
for European monetary union (EMU). And Yasuo Matsushita at the Bank of Japan
has a bust financial sector to keep afloat. Lax money may lie at the root
of the growth burst that's unfolding. But it also means it will be excessive.
That's called a cycle! <BR>
<BR>
Higher real growth will create demand for capital, which will in turn shove
up interest rates. And higher inflation - or the fear of it -
will cause interest rates to rise too. Either way, you don't want to be
in bonds while this is happening. The exception is where something sound
and structural is happening to the budget arithmetic, so that bond yields
may actually fall or their spreads improve relative to their peers. <BR>
<BR>
New Zealand fits that picture. So does Canada. And German Bunds look better
than other bonds in Europe. I think the budget mess there will be brought
under control long before it is in France. Yet French bonds are selling
on yields below that of Bunds. This can't hold for long. <BR>
<BR>
Until now, industrial commodity prices have lagged behind those for energy
and wheat. But they will rise as growth in industrialized economies does.
And that's before accounting for the shift in demand and supply caused by
an acceleration of growth in China. That makes global resource stocks look
attractive. I prefer Canada's to their Australian peers, and Scandinavian
and Canadian forest-product companies to Indonesian ones. <BR>
<BR>
My outlook on the economic cycle is bad for most equity markets in the short
term. In the long term I expect an increasingly efficient use of capital
generally, and the OECD corporate sector will capture the growth and returns
of the emergent economies as they integrate into the global economy. That
favours equities over bonds, since bonds are really the equity of the most
risky, unstable and economically profligate users of capital - governments.
<BR>
<BR>
But in the short term, equity valuations will have to contend with rising
interest rates and lower profit growth. And then will come tighter liquidity,
when the central bankers get back in the driving seat. Equities will fall
as cyclical growth rises (irrespective of whether the growth is real or
nominal), because all that's missing for a real equity correction is rising
short rates. <BR>
<BR>
At first sight, stronger growth may seem bullish for EMU success and Europe
- but maybe not. Rising interest rates in the core will increase yield
gaps with the high deficit-and-debt southern comfort countries (SCC). Interest
rates drive SCC budget arithmetic. Even in the core countries I don't see
growth being strong enough to stop unemployment rising. That will lead to
bigger budget deficits in France, but not in Germany, because Kohl's Dm70
billion spending-cuts programme will more than offset the impact of rising
unemployment. <BR>
<BR>
Emerging markets will not be immune from this deleterious fallout of the
global cycle. I'd stay out of some of the big emerging democracies. Where
democracies have carried through economic reform, they have won support
- Poland and Argentina, for example. Where they have been half-hearted,
it has led, or will lead to, rejection by the electorate. India is one of
those. The others will be Brazil (high public deficits and debts); South
Africa (inadequate savings, unemployment and separatism); Russia (bureaucracy
and corruption). Failure to restructure will mean that these economies will
become waterlogged, neither emerging nor submerging. <BR>
<BR>
Latin America will suffer from rising US interest rates and a concomitant
drop in portfolio inflows. But the equity markets of Chile, Argentina and
Mexico - in that order - are reasonable value. Brazil's reforms
are likely to fail and the market is expensive. <BR>
<BR>
East Asia still causes delusions among strategists. The growth story is
as old as the hills. Valuations often reflect that story. What is often
left out of the picture is that East Asia is in the dollar bloc. Overheating
hit East Asia before it affected the OECD because of excess money creation
(be warned!). <BR>
<BR>
Many of its more overheated economies will have to raise rates when the
US does, and for as long as the dollar is strong. That's bad news in a region
where what you invest in are Chinese family-owned companies in real-estate
and its financing (with the exception of Korea and Taiwan, which are real
industrial economies). So avoid Hong Kong (because of the impact of the
Chinese takeover and the threat to the dollar peg of rising US rates). And
Malaysia and Indonesia have hot economies and valuations. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The silver lining</B> <BR>
<BR>
But there is a positive story, too. You should buy into the equities -
and the bonds, if you can get them - of those economies that are over
the hump of overheating - Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and, believe it or
not, the Philippines. And Singapore sits there like a sub-tropical Switzerland
that you should never be out of. <BR>
<BR>
In eastern Europe, I continue to love Poland, its people and all things
Polish. It's the only eastern European economy that gets anywhere near being
an Asian tiger. However, I am increasingly concerned about rising trade
deficits throughout the region and the potential spillover effects of a
Bulgarian debt default. <BR>
<BR>
The German economic cycle is turning and will not be far behind Japan's.
Indeed, I expect confidence in German recovery to be greater than in Japan's
by mid-year. That's when Japan's fiscal stimulus package runs out and the
private sector has to take up the running. So it's dangerous to be long
the yen and short the Deutschmark on the expectation that the Bank of Japan
will raise short-term interest rates before the Bundesbank does. I also
think the Deutschmark could be a winner once the markets realize that chancellor
Kohl means business about shrinking government. <BR>
<BR>
The US is likely to recover faster than Japan and US interest rates will
rise first. US trade won't tank as this happens. Rising exports to Canada
and Mexico will help drive US recovery rather than tax it. And Japan's external
surpluses will continue to be eroded by double-digit import growth. Also,
the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates by the fourth quarter
of 1996 and Japan won't. So the dollar will be strong up to the year-end
and could reach &#165;115. ><BR>

<H3> <B>Spain leads sovereigns in dash to beat end of year</B> </H3> 

<P> <B>SOVEREIGN ISSUERS took centre-stage
this week in a rush to complete fundings before the Christmas break. As expected,
Spain sold a jumbo Euro-DM bond and Israel launched its debut Eurobond. Argentina
continued its remarkable 1996 funding spree with a surprise double, issuing
Samurai and Euro-lira transactions. And French state agency Cades unexpectedly
launched its first-ever dollar bond issue.</B>

<P>

And the sovereign spree may not be
finished yet. While Spain's deal had been expected to be the last jumbo offering
of the year from an EU sovereign, bankers said that there was a growing
possibility that Italy would launch a $1bn global dollar bond next week.

<P> <I>Euroweek</I> understands that bankers have been in Rome this week making
presentations to the Italian treasury for a possible 10-year global offering of
at least $1bn.

<P> Should Italy do so, it will be hoping for a better reception than that
afforded to Spain's DM2bn 10-year offering launched on Thursday.

<P> The Spanish treasury had been considering the possibility of either a DM or a
yen transaction before awarding the mandate for a DM bond to Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson late on Wednesday.

<P> The deal was launched on Thursday morning at a spread of just 24bp over
10-year Bunds, which rival bankers said was too tight for Kingdom of Spain paper.

<P> Before details of the deal had been finalised, bankers in Frankfurt had been
quoting a minimum spread of 24bp on a five-year deal should Spain want to attract
sufficient demand for a jumbo transaction, but they were concerned that the
five-year part of the curve would have been unable to absorb a transaction of
size. They said that for a 10-year deal, the spread should have been in the 28bp
to 30bp region over Bunds.

<P> One syndicate member in the group argued that the bond was mispriced: "At
24bp over, this bond is 11bp through domestics and so holds no appeal for German
institutional accounts.

<P> A syndicate official from Dresdner Kleinwort Benson disagreed. "As expected,
some banks criticised the 24bp over spread, although the six bidders for the deal
were within 1bp or 2bp of that figure," he said.

<P> According to Federico Ferrer, head of foreign funding at the Spanish
treasury: "We had been advised against a five-year deal in Deutschmarks, because
of the amount of oversupply there had been in that maturity, so we decided to go
for 10 years."

<P> Deutschmarks were Spain's preferred choice of currency for several reasons,
Ferrer added. It was a European currency which the country had not tapped since a
DM2.5bn bond in December 1994.

<P> It offered Spain attractive long-term funding levels, as much as 1% through
10-year domestic paper, which trades at an equivalent of around 130bp over Bunds,
although Ferrer declined to say whether the proceeds of the transaction would be
swapped.

<P> Spain could possibly have achieved more attractive levels in the French franc
market, but it had already raised Ffr9bn this year. Elsewhere in Europe, sterling
could not offer Spain the rates it wanted and other currencies could not sustain
the size that it was looking for.

<P> Some bankers had expected Spain to launch a second yen transaction this year,
following its &#165;150bn 10 year via Nikko in September, but the treasury
decided against it.

<P> "The yen sector may have been cheaper but we felt that the risk involved was
higher than the Deutschmark, in part because 20% of our portfolio is in yen which
is well above the normal benchmark of 13%-14%," said Ferrer.

<P> But while Spain got its 1997 funding programme off to a flying start in terms
of the cost of funds it was able to command, bankers complained that it was yet
another example of Spain showing a disregard for the market by launching deals
that are simply too tight.

<P> Similar complaints had been made about Spain's two forays into the French
franc market this year -- a Ffr6bn 10-year issue in July which was subsequently
upped in October by a further Ffr3bn, creating the largest-ever Euro-Ffr bond,
but both of which were criticised by syndicate members as being excessively
tight.

<P> Bankers said they were frustrated that Spain was one of the last major
issuers in the Euromarkets to launch jumbo transactions through a bidding auction
rather than awarding mandates on the basis of negotiated pricing.

<P> Ferrer said that, as with all transactions from the Kingdom of Spain, the
mandate had been awarded after a competitive bidding process. "We are obliged to
accept the lowest bid that is close to the market," said Ferrer.

<P> "If an offer is too expensive for the deal to work, then we will not accept
it. But if everyone else is bidding 26bp over, and an offer comes in at 24.5bp
over, then we are obliged to take it."

<P> If Italy decides to squeeze in a transaction before year-end the deal is
likely to come to the market next week. Bankers said that a $1bn 10-year deal
would probably come at a spread of 35bp to 37bp over Treasuries.

<H3> Kelleher leaves Daiwa </H3> 

<P> DENIS Kelleher has left Daiwa
to join <B>Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (TMI) </B>as managing director and head of
debt syndicate.

<P> The move reunites Kelleher with his former colleague Philip Porter and
underlines TMI's capital market ambitions; it also further depletes the
management of Daiwa's Eurobond business. Syndicate manager Kelleher's resignation
comes just four months after Porter left as head of origination and syndication
to join TMI in a similar role.

<P> At the same time Paul Morganti has left Daiwa -- where he held a senior
origination position -- to join HSBC Markets. Martin Davies had earlier resigned
as head of sales to join DKB.

<P> Alex Monnas, deputy chief executive of Daiwa Europe, said the bank was moving
to strengthen its origination team and would now seek a syndicate manager from
outside to replace Kelleher.

<P> The recruiting process had itself been slightly delayed by negotiations over
Kelleher's role, said Monnas, and while he was sad to see him leave, the
departure did at least leave the bank free to seek new people.

<P> The gap left by Morganti was partly filled in November when Maria Grippenberg
joined from BNP as head of western European syndication.

<P> Rival bankers said Kelleher's move made it harder for Daiwa to regain some of
the momentum in the new issue market that had been dissipated since its
origination and syndication team began to unravel.

<P> The exit of so many senior and well-regarded staff reflected the slowness of
the bank's management in coming up with a clear strategy to take the business
forward, they argued.

<P> Monnas pointed out that defections in the investment banking business often
came in twos and threes, and denied that the Daiwa departures were a result of a
lack of commitment to the Eurobond market.

<P> "We will be broadening and deepening our Eurobond business in terms of
products and distribution over the next 12 months," he stated.

<P> For his part Kelleher said he was attracted by the opportunities on offer at
the world's biggest bank. He said it was particularly strong in the banking and
derivatives areas and had made a clear commitment to beefing up its Eurobond
business.

<P> "All the pieces are there," he said. "It's just a question of putting them in
place."

<P> The chance to join forces with his former colleague Porter was clearly an
important part of the equation, he added.

<P> Kelleher's move represents an leap forward for TMI which has a clear
intention of establishing itself among the top rank of Japanese investment
banking operations.

<P> "TMI wants to be a significant contributor to the capital markets community,"
said Philip Porter. "Denis' hiring demonstrates that intention very clearly."

<P> The move represents a slip down the league tables for Kelleher: TMI ranks
40th for 1996, compared with 19th for Daiwa.

<P> <B>Santander Financial Products</B> in Dublin has appointed Anthony Pesco
president and chief executive officer. Before his appointment, he was a managing
director and has been a vice president responsible for risk management and
business strategy for OTC derivatives.

<P> Previously, Pesco worked at AIG Financial Products as a vice president and
head of product development and risk management. He has also been a vice
president in the interest rate and equity derivatives group at JP Morgan.

<P> <B>Euro Brokers</B> has made four  management changes. Robin Clark and
Paul Dunkley succeed Cindy Buggins at the London firm.

<P> For the last nine years Dunkley has managed the interest rate options desk.
Clark has been head of the yen derivatives operation for the last three. The two
will continue in those roles.

<P> Buggins will remain a paid consultant for the firm.

<P> Gilbert Scharf replaces Don Marshall as president, following the resignation
of the president and chief executive. Scharf is president and chief executive
officer of Financial Services Acquisition Corp, Euro Brokers' new parent company.

<P> Michael Morrison, chief financial officer, becomes chief executive officer.
Morrison will run most of the firm's regular operations.

<P> Paul Doust has joined <B>ANZ Investment Bank</B> as a director of structured
products. At ANZ he will be heading a group focusing on emerging market
structured transactions. He will report to Barry Field, head of new issues.

<P> Doust joins ANZ after five years at BZW, where he had a senior role
developing BZW's derivatives capability in the swap and FX areas.

<P> Additionally, Charles Marston has been promoted to assistant director, global
syndication. He will continue to concentrate on expanding ANZ's distribution
capabilities. Marston joined under a year ago as manager, reporting to Roscow
Lucas, who heads the syndication function.

<P> <B>NatWest Markets</B> has formed a specialised finance group to be based in

through Nikko's capital markets group in Tokyo, as well as Euromarket products
underwritten by Nikko Europe.

<P> Jane Miller has joined the structured finance group of <B>Royal Bank of
Canada</B>. She is responsible for marketing and developing unique cross-border
financing structures. She reports to David Cole, vice president of the structured
finance group.

<P> Miller joins from Simpson Thatcher &amp; Bartlett where she was a tax lawyer.
She previously worked with BZW/Barclays in New York.

<P> <B>AIM Global Advisors Ltd</B> has hired Anthony Myers as a director. He was
previously managing director of Gartmore Money Management Ltd, Gartmore's

<H2> Year-end spree ushers in expectations for 1997 deluge </H2> 

<P> THE INTERNATIONAL bond market indulged in
a new issue spree despite the approach of year-end with the launch of several
sizeable benchmark transactions and a number of debutantes in a variety of
sectors.

<P> The prize for shock tactics was awarded to BZW and JP Morgan which astonished
the market by launching a $2bn global FRN for French welfare refinancing agency
Cades without prior warning or premarketing.

<P> The deal had its critics. Some felt the pricing was too tight at Libor minus
14bp for an entity which does not have the explicit guarantee of the French
Republic.

<P> Others commented that the issue would have benefited from premarketing given
the time of year and consequent slowdown of investor participation. But all noted
the scarcity of sovereign debt in the floater market and commended the lead
managers for defending the price at re-offer.

<P> Many participants reported healthy worldwide sales at that level to a variety
of central banks, money market funds, investment managers and bank treasuries.

<P> Spain's first visit to the Deutschmark market after an absence of over two
years also caused a stir.

<P> The deal had been expected since last week but certainly not at the tight
spread at which Dresdner Kleinwort Benson won the mandate from a group of six
bidders. The DM2bn 10-year issue was launched at 24 over when expectations had
been for a spread of 26/28 over.

<P> The deal also had the misfortune to coincide with a market correction of
close to a point and widened in aftermarket trading to 26/27 over. But despite
the tight re-offer level, the scarcity of 10-year sovereign debt in Deutschmarks
-- there has been only one other such issue this year -- generated good
institutional demand.

<P> Talk is now of Italy's financing intentions with rumours of a $1bn 10-year
global bond surfacing. Market players expect an early January launch for the
transaction but Italy could provide the last surprise of 1996 by launching next
week.

<P> Retail buying of short-dated dollar bonds reached fever pitch, encouraging
Swiss Bank to increase its three-year transaction by $100m to $400m. The bond
tightened from flat to Treasuries to 4bp through.

<P> S&uuml;dwestdeutsche Landesbank tapped the same maturity with a $250m bond
also lead managed by SBC Warburg. Huge redemption flows in November, December and
January are driving the demand, and creating rapid and dramatic spread tightening
in all short-dated bonds.

<P> The debutantes in the emerging markets sector achieved undoubted success.

<P> The State of Israel's $200m five-year Euromarket debut lead managed by
Merrill Lynch received an enthusiastic welcome from international accounts
looking for first-time fixed-income exposure to the A3/A- rated country via the
Eurobond format.

<P> The success of the sovereign deal augurs well for next week's $400m 10 and
30-year Yankee bond issue for Israel Electric Corp.

<P> Separately, Baa3/BBB- rated Slovakian water management company
Vodohospod&aacute;rska Vystavba enjoyed a positive reception for its $200m
10-year Eurobond issue via JP Morgan -- the first major Euromarket transaction to
emerge from the country since it became independent in 1991.

<P> From the Czech Republic, the City of Ostrava's DM75m five-year FRN issue led
by ING Barings proved a hit with European bank investors despite an optically
tight coupon of 22.5bp over six-month DM Libor.

<P> Argentina took advantage of a revival of interest in Latin bonds by launching
its first Samurai since the 1980s and the largest and longest lira deal for an
emerging market credit.

<P> At the same times, reports circulated that the republic is planning a jumbo
dollar global for launch early January.

<H2>Holm steps up to run Sweden's debt management department </H2>
CHRISTINE Holm started yesterday (Thursday) her new job as director of the
debt management department at the Swedish National Debt Office. <BR>
<BR>
She will oversee central government borrowing and debt management in both
Swedish kronor and foreign currencies. <BR>
<BR>
She succeeds Jonas Lind, who begins a new post as chief financial officer
at Stadshypotek from October 1. <BR>
<BR>
It is a major step-up for Holm, a veteran of the debt office, who since
1981 has overseen the kingdom's remarkable and successful record as the
most frequent sovereign issuer in the international debt market. <BR>
<BR>
Holm is viewed by many coverage officers as one of the most professional
and most demanding of all treasury officials. <BR>
<BR>
Prior to joining the debt office Holm worked for the First National Bank
of Chicago in Stockholm. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1990 she had been director of the international market department,
and in April this year, as part of the reorganisation of the debt office,
she became director and head of funding. <BR>
<BR>
Her new role will also give her responsibility for domestic borrowing and
the office's asset and liability management programme. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Christine has wide experience of the work involved in borrowing and
debt management and has been a key person with regard to borrowing in foreign
currencies,&quot; commented Thomas Franz&eacute;n, director general of the
Swedish National Debt Office. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a result of the integration of Swedish and foreign markets, her
knowledge and experience has taken on even greater importance.&quot; <HR><BR>
<B>Salomon Brothers</B> has appointed Hendrik Borggreve to the managing
board <I>(Vorstand)</I> of their German banking affiliate, Salomon Brothers
AG. He will serve as joint speaker with Daniel Lee, who joined the firm
in Frankfurt in 1987 and became head in 1993. Borggreve will also be managing
director of Salomon Brothers Inc and head of German corporate finance. <BR>
<BR>
Borggreve was previously with Kleinwort Benson GmbH, which he founded in
1991 and from 1986 to 1991 was head of operations at Lehman Brothers Bankhaus
AG. Before that he held senior posts at Paribas (1980-1986) and Commerzbank
(1975-1980). <BR>
<BR>
He is replaced at Kleinwort's Frankfurt office by his former deputy Konstantin
von Klitzing. <BR>
<BR>
ABN AMRO subsidiary <B>ABN AMRO North America Inc</B> is to purchase CNBC
Bancorp Inc of Chicago, the holding company for Columbia National Bank.
The cash deal is due to close in the fourth quarter of 1996. <BR>
<BR>
Columbia National Bank is the area's 20th largest bank and employs 280 staff.
ABN AMRO is the largest foreign bank in the US, and the new acquisition
will become part of ABN AMRO's LaSalle banking group. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Lehman Brothers</B> is to shake up its global debt and equity capital
markets organisations with a series of internal appointments among Lehman
veterans designed to try to charge up its equity business, which has so
far failed to match the bank's leading position in the international fixed-income
business. <BR>
<BR>
The equity and fixed income businesses will each be managed by a partnership
of three managing directors, and both groups will have an overall head,
an origination head and a head of global sales. <BR>
<BR>
Joseph Gregory, who has been with the firm for 22 years, will be overall
head of equities. Michael McKeever, a 17-year Lehman veteran, will be responsible
for equity origination, and Stephen Lessing, with the firm for 16 years,
will have responsibility for sales in both equity and fixed income. <BR>
<BR>
Jeffrey Vanderbeek will be head of the fixed income business and Bradley
Jack will be responsible for debt origination. <BR>
<BR>
Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive officer, said: &quot;Our earnings
performance in the second quarter clearly demonstrates the significant progress
the firm has made over the past two years in profitably building our fixed
income, equity, and corporate finance advisory businesses.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Paul Williams, the previous head of equities, will retire. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The European Investment Bank</B> has appointed Thomas Oursin as chairman
of the financial committee of the European Investment Fund. <BR>
<BR>
This follows the appointment of the current chairman, Georges Ugeux, as
group executive vice-president, international of the New York stock exchange.
Oursin was previously with the World Bank, and joined the EIB in 1974, becoming
director for financing outside the Union and secretary general from 1994.
<BR>
<BR>
Sir Brian Unwin, president of EIB and chairman of the supervisory board
of the EIF, said: &quot;Thomas Oursin has the essential qualities to preside
over the activities of EIF, combining both an in-depth knowledge of the
financial and banking sector and long experience of multilateral institutions.
I am sure that EIF will continue its success under his leadership.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Merrill Lynch</B> has appointed David Benson as head of its Eurobond
trading business, reporting to Steven Blakey, head of international credit
trading. Benson will continue as manager of FRNs and bank capital trading
in London. <BR>
<BR>
Benson has been with the bank for eight years and was previously responsible
for US domestic MTN and FRN trading, EMTN trading and global risk management.
<BR>
<BR>
Benson replaces Steve Gallagher, who had been with the bank for nine years,
and who is understood to be returning to New York where he will take up
a position with Bear Stearns. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ANZ Financial Markets Group</B> has appointed Justin Doyle director,
distribution capital markets in Asia. Doyle will be based in <BR>
Hong Kong and report to John MacMahon, director and head of distribution,
capital markets group. <BR>
<BR>
Doyle was previously head of fixed income sales, non-Japan Asia at Paine
Webber. <BR>
<BR>
Separately, Frederique Peeters has been appointed manager of distribution
in Europe, also reporting to John MacMahon, and will be involved in expanding
ANZ's distribution capabilities in Europe, particularly Switzerland, Benelux
and France. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale </B>has appointed Chris
Day as executive director of corporate finance and Rodney Gritten head of
the financial institutions group in its corporate banking division. <BR>
<BR>
Day was previously with Paribas Capital Markets and will be responsible
for advisory and equity capital markets services to financial institutions
and the provision of structured and derivative solutions to client problems.
<BR>
<BR>
Gritten joins from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, and will be responsible for
client coverage and debt capital market services for financial institutions.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cr&eacute;dit Suisse</B> has appointed Christopher Rist head of acquisition
finance, responsible for developing the firm's business in the UK and assisting
in the execution of transactions throughout Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Bahman Jahanshai, head of structured finance, said: &quot;Establishment
of this unit complements our existing product range in London and will be
used to strengthen our execution capabilities within a growing market.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Congratulations to <B>Robin Hall</B>, new issue trader at DKB International,
who is quitting his bachelor status to marry Caroline on July 13. <BR>

<H2>Global triumph as PRC prices to ensure success </H2>
<H4>THE People's Republic of China this week launched its planned global
bond offering, provoking what bankers described as a feeding frenzy among
investors. <BR>
<BR>
</h4>Syndicate members reported massive demand for the $700m five-year deal
priced yesterday (Thursday) by joint leads CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley.
<BR>
<BR>
The lead managers on the transaction claimed the deal would come to be viewed
as the moment when China's story finally took off with investors. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is an overwhelming vindication of China's credit quality,&quot;
said one banker, &quot;setting a new standard for PRC debt and re-positioning
the republic in international markets.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Stung by their inability to find enough paper to allocate to frantic investors,
some syndicate members expressed disappointment at the size of the deal
-- talk went as high as $1.25bn -- as well as the absence of a possible
10-year tranche. <BR>
<BR>
Others argued the overwhelming demand for the issue showed that it had been
priced too generously. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We could have sold our ticket 20 times over,&quot; said one syndicate
member. &quot;I have never seen so much time wasted arguing over allocations
with our sales people.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Priced at 99.565 and with a coupon of 7.375%, the bonds yielded 80bp over
the five-year Treasury, at the bottom end of the last bout of official price
talk of between 80bp and 83bp. <BR>
<BR>
Critics said that equated to between 55bp and 60bp over Libor on an asset-swap
basis, while there was enough demand to clear the market at between 40bp
and 45bp over on the same basis. <BR>
<BR>
These arguments missed the point of the transaction entirely, said officials
at CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley. China's principal aim had been to
erase the bad memory of its previous 1994 global, which had widened dramatically
after launch, and target a new investor base, so it had wanted to structure
a transaction that was priced to sell. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There has been a lot of volatility surrounding China in the past and
the ministry of finance was determined to launch a transaction which worked
well and left a constructive feeling in investors' minds,&quot; said one
banker. <BR>
<BR>
Another added: &quot;The 1994 global almost doubled in spread before coming
in again and investors were very conscious of that fact. It was therefore
critically important that there was no risk of this deal widening, and indeed
it immediately came in a couple of basis points on breaking syndicate.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The bonds were quoted at 77bp on the offer at the close of business yesterday
(Thursday). <BR>
<BR>
Bankers involved in the transaction explained that the issue had also targeted
a different investor base to its earlier deals. These transactions, most
recently the republic's $300m seven-year issue launched in January 1996
at a spread of 113bp over Treasuries alongside a $100m century bond paying
299bp over, had focused on US investors. <BR>
<BR>
This time the bonds were aimed firmly at fixed-rate European buyers. &quot;Investors
in Europe have the credit lines in place to take China,&quot; said an official
at one of the lead banks, &quot;But in the past they have not been offered
very much. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In terms of placement, we also wanted to attract pure fixed-rate buyers,
rather than asset swappers. We saw a very balanced book comprising investment
funds, government agencies and private banks -- mainly from Switzerland,&quot;
he added. <BR>
<BR>
Demand was said to have been split about 50% Europe, with up to 30% from
first-time buyers, 35% Asia and the balance in the US. &quot;This doesn't
really tell the full story though,&quot; continued the banker. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The whole deal could easily have been placed in Europe. The point
was to achieve greater depth and penetration among European investors and
the deal succeeded on all counts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The two leads took books of $279m apiece, leaving the syndicate with a 20%
take on books of $10m for co-leads and $4m for co-managers. Co-leads numbered
Daiwa, DBS, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and UBS, with Bank of China, BZW,
Bear Stearns, PCBC, Citicorp, Commerzbank, Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, Dresdner,
IBJ, LTCB, Nomura, Smith Barney, SBC Warburg and Tokyo-Mitsubishi as co-managers.
<BR>
<BR>
China analysts said that the warm reception granted to the deal owed much
to the perception of the republic's austerity programme, which had contained
inflation and slowed growth since its introduction in 1993. <BR>
<BR>
Said one Asian-based strategist: &quot;We are much more confident about
China now than we were one year ago, and our house takes a very bullish
view both in the long and short term. Everyone has been very impressed by
the success of the reform and austerity programme, while the Chinese government
remains fully aware of what needs to be done to overhaul the state enterprises
and banking systems.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bankers also added that the senior vice minister of finance Liu Gibin and
his deputy director Gao Jian had been impressive during roadshow presentations
in explaining the development of the credit. <BR>
<BR>
Investor demand was said to be at least partly a reflection of their being
bombarded with impressive headline figures from the country, which has the
highest domestic savings rate in the world, the largest foreign direct investment,
over 10% annualised growth for the last decade, reserves totalling $80bn
and a rate of inflation which has been steadily brought down to under 8%.

<H1>Dollar bloc dominates </H1>
TWO NEW dollar benchmarks dominated proceedings in the international bond
markets, prior to what many bankers expect to be a quiet period next week
as the US celebrates Independence Day and awaits FOMC and labour statistics
which are likely to determine the mood of the Treasury market in the run-up
to the summer break. <BR>
<BR>
China's return to the global market met with overwhelming demand -- so much
so that some bankers said the $700m five-year issue led by CSFB and Morgan
Stanley had been too generously priced. <BR>
<BR>
Syndicate officials were unanimous in their praise of the realistic pricing
of IFC's $500m five-year Euro, via DKB and JP Morgan, and National Power's
$350m transaction through JP Morgan and UBS further demonstrated the pull
of the five-year sector for sensibly priced issues. <BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere short-dated retail was again prominent, with Morgan Guaranty the
pick of a very mixed bag, and SBC Warburg's $200m issue for Mobil, returning
to the sector for the first time in five years, almost unanimously slammed
for its aggressive pricing of 2bp over Treasuries. There were also signs
that the market is beginning to tire of December-dated transactions, with
some syndicate officials complaining about the choice of maturity date on
BMW's $200m 3-1/2 year issue. <BR>
<BR>
There was a distinct Antipodean flavour to the week's offerings, with six
A$ and three NZ$ transactions taking advantage of the retail demand for
higher-yielding paper and the high level of redemptions in the C$ sector.
<BR>
<BR>
Still to come before the summer slowdown, Poland will roadshow its long-awaited
DM250m five-year transaction with CSFB and Deutsche MG next week, and Discover
Master Trust will tap the DM asset-backed market, likely this Tuesday. <BR>
<BR>
Expected today (Friday) is a debut offering of Eurosterling bonds from the
UK's recently-privatised Railtrack, with SBC Warburg in the lead manager
role. <HR><B>Bookrunners of Ffr bonds -- 1996 <BR>

<H3> <B>NatWest blooms with $5bn global loans sale</B> </H3> 

<H4><P> <B>NATWEST MARKETS this week launched its $5bn
Rose Funding securitisation of corporate loans, capping a process that had
involved nine months of structuring and a month of roadshows.</H4> </B>

The issue was
almost three times oversubscribed in what proved a vivid illustration of one of
this year's key investment themes -- the growing depth of demand for the high
credit ratings and attractive yields offered by structured securities.

<P> The Rose transaction follows a number of large, high-profile securitisations,
including deals for Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, aircraft leasing company GPA and a
consortium buying the housing portfolio of the UK's Ministry of Defence.

<P> Rose Funding securitised over 200 loans advanced by NatWest Markets to
companies in 17 different countries in a transaction described by participants as
ground-breaking and likely to create a precedent for other lending institutions.

<P> Some rival bankers have cavilled at the way the transaction has been
structured, but few deny it will provide a boost to the universe of securitised
solutions.

<P> As previously reported in <I>Euroweek</I>, the $5bn transaction was divided
into 11 tranches: six senior; four mezzanine and one junior.

<P> The senior and subordinated tranches were further carved up into sterling and
US-denominated portions.

<P> Priced at the lower end of the last indicated ranges, after just one downward
shift during the marketing process, the bonds proved a roaring success.

<P> NatWest acted as lead manager on the transaction, with CS First Boston,
Rabobank and Salomon as co-leads on the A1 to A3 US dollar and
sterling-denominated tranches (with $20m and &#163;5m in total) and Goldman
Sachs, Lehman and SBC Warburg as co-leads, each with $5m of the dollar
securities.

<P> As is common on such transactions, NatWest kept the majority of the bonds.
Almost all of the &#163;1.8bn of sterling bonds were promptly sold into Rose Inc,
a Delaware-based CP-funded multi-seller conduit.

<P> The $2.62bn of dollar notes were all sold into a public market primed by the
bank's multi-centre, four-week roadshow.

<P> "We had $6bn of demand for the five dollar tranches," said Andrew Pelling,
head of the debt syndicate at NatWest Markets. "The toughest task for our sales
team has been to meet the needs of our clients."

<P> "We saw demand across the board," added a syndicate official at one of the
co-managers.

<P> Nick Hamilton, a director of asset trading at NatWest Markets said there had
been areas of concentrated demand --money market funds proved keen buyers of the
shorter-dated tranches while the longer-dated and subordinated tranches played
particularly well in east Asia -- but overall demand reflected the wide compass
of the roadshow.

<P> Hamilton broke sales down along the following geographical lines: Switzerland
2.5%; UK 28%; Australia 2%; Benelux 4%; France 2%; Ireland 2%; east Asia 7%;
southern Europe 1%; the Middle East 2%; Austria and Germany 6.5%; Scandinavia 1%
and the US 44%.

<P> The extraordinarily high proportion of US placement under the 144A rule
naturally reflects the US investor base's comfort with securitised product. It is
also likely to be a result of the experience of Greenwich Capital Markets'
distributive powers in the area.

<P> NatWest's purchase of Greenwich closed recently and the outfit operated as
selling agent for the bonds in the US.

<P> Logistical needs put a Thursday launch in the balance until the last minute,
but the issue was officially opened at 2.30pm London time, by which time
allocation, not sales, had become the key issue. The issue was freed to trade at
3.45pm.

<P> NatWest's Hamilton said the bonds were all bid at the offer price but no
meaningful trading had developed by the close of play on Thursday.

<P> The issue securitises around a sixth of NatWest's large corporate loan book,
freeing up credit lines which the bank said were -- in some cases -- in danger of
clogging. That may provide a template for future securitisations.

<P> "We have now developed the technology," said Andy Clapham, a director in
NatWest's asset securitisation group. "That's the big breakthrough."

<P> Getting comfortable with the bank's internal credit scoring <BR> system was
one of the keys to the rating process, according to Kimberly Slawek, co-head of
European structured finance at Fitch, one of the four agencies that rated the
transaction (Duff &amp; Phelps, Moody's and S&amp;P are the others).

<P> Although many banks are looking at the precedent of the Rose transaction, the
need to have systems in place such as NatWest's internal credit rankings may slim
the number that can follow that route.

<P> NatWest also benefited from having a portfolio of loans large enough to carve
off an asset pool without undue geographic, sectoral or name exposures.

<P> To preserve the bank's relationship with the companies that it lends to, the
transaction was structured as a sub-participation and not a true sale.

<P> According to Fitch's Slawek, that imposes a ceiling of the bank's own rating
on the transaction, as in the event of a bank default the Rose bondholders would
become general NatWest creditors.

<P> That did not matter for NatWest -- the double-A notes proved attractive for
investors in a low interest rate environment -- but it might limit the
attractions of the route for lower-rated banks.

<P> NatWest's Clapham said that constraints such as these could be side-stepped
and that there were, in any event, enough banks with the appropriate
characteristics to make such a securitisation attractive. 

<P>

<P>

<H3> French francs in focus </H3> 

<P> THE MOST popular marketing
ploy of the month is the Euro-Asian concept. After TMCC and Associates Corp had
exploited the structure in dollars and TMCC in DM, DePfa took the Pfandbrief
sector a step further by launching a DM1bn Euro-Asian transaction, listed in
Singapore and Frankfurt.

<P> The trio of lead managers reported 35% placement in Asia, but syndicate
members were sceptical about the level of demand in the region.

<P> NTT, which is said to be <BR> contemplating a Euro-Asian dollar issue later
in the year, returned to the sterling market after a five-year absence with a
&#163;250m December 2003 bond, adding more supply to an already saturated area,
although the market loved the name.

<P> Another imminent candidate for sterling issuance is rumoured to be Anglian
Water, and Chugoku Electric is said to be looking at dollars, Deutschmarks and
sterling for its long-expected deal.

<P> The French franc sector was swamped with 10-year paper, and only lead manager
SocGen had a good word to say about the Ffr3bn increase to Spain's Ffr6bn
transaction launched in July.

<P> More supply is expected in the coming weeks. Roadshows for Fannie Mae are
anticipated soon, hosted by Merrill Lynch and SocGen, with a Ffr3bn to Ffr5bn 10
or 12-year issue in view. <BR> Price talk, depending on the size, <BR> is between
10 and 12 over.

<P> CDC will roadshow NordLB early next week, and Telstra's debut Ffr transaction
is still on course via BNP and JP Morgan.

<P> The dollar pipeline looks thin, with the lack of swaps preventing issuance at
most maturities.

<P> However, ICO is said to be preparing a $500m-$600m five-year bond at around
18 over. Goldman Sachs, as arranger  of ICO's Euro-MTN programme, is tipped as
lead manager. Huntington National Bank is set to debut with an FRN issue via
Morgan Stanley.

<H4>Daiwa in bid to build up structured finance group</H4> 
 
  <P> DAIWA Europe has announced nine appointments to its
recently established structured finance division in London, expanding its size to
25 professionals and underlining its importance in the bank's overall strategy.

<P> Set up in May this year, the structured finance division groups a variety of
non-vanilla products under co-heads Robin Nydes and Hidetada Oshima.

<P> "We aim to be pre-eminent in the origination, structuring, distribution and
trading of credit and structure-intensive debt products," said Nydes.

<P> "These are instruments with the potential for extraordinary returns at any
given levels of risk.

<P> "We are not looking at conventional risk/return profiles," he added.

<P> The chosen product areas range from asset swaps through securitisation to
emerging market debt. The structured finance tag has encouraged comparisons with 
divisions in other banks, most noticeably Nomura, Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust
(Nydes' previous employer).

<P> While acknowledging some similarities in outlook, Nydes pointed out that
Daiwa was the only house to have such a range of activities grouped in one
division, and with such a consequent potential for cross-fertilisation.

<P> He said the division was still hiring, aiming to increase its size to around
40 professionals. The nine recent recruits are:

<P> Lincoln Benet, formerly of Morgan Stanley, as executive director, head of
repackagings and tax advantaged financing;

<P> Nick Richards, formerly of Lehman Brothers, as executive director, head of
asset finance including real estate and securitisation;

<P> Julia Campbell, formerly of Chase Manhattan, as director, co-head of the
value-based analytics group;

<P> Hossein Panbechi, formerly of Credit Suisse Financial Products, as director,
head of emerging markets local currency trading; and

<P> Ian Wilson, also formerly of Credit Suisse Financial Products, as director,
UK and Middle East marketing;

<P> Harald Berg, formerly of Credit Suisse, as associate director, Scandinavia
and Germany marketing;

<P> Lucien Selce, formerly of Cargill Financial Markets, as associate director,
head of value impaired restructurings;

<P> Joel Smalley, formerly of Chase Manhattan, as associate director, structured
credit trading;

<P> Bertrand Bricheux, formerly of Citibank, as manager, France and Benelux
marketing.                   


<P> <B>Lehman Brothers</B> this week named Richard Dickey as managing director
and head of global equity sales as part of the continued expansion of the firm's
worldwide equity activities.

<P> He replaces Raymond Struble, a 15-year veteran of Lehman who is retiring.
Dickey joins from Dillon Read, where he had been a managing director and head of
equity research for the past two years.

<P> <B>Lehman Brothers</B> is also expanding its emerging markets business,
setting up a new London-based group to focus on eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Africa.

<P> Kerim Derhalli, formerly a director with Merrill Lynch, has joined as an
executive director. At Merrill he was responsible for running the firm's local
currency trading activities in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

<P> Besides developing a customer base in these regions, Derhalli will also be
responsible for establishing a local market presence for Lehman in a wide range
of bonds, currencies and fixed-income derivative products.

<P>


<P> Christian Purslow is joining <B>Salomon Bothers</B> in London as a director
and co-head of the European telecommunication and media group within the firm's
investment banking division.

<P> He will have particular responsibility for the firm's media practice and will
work alongside Jim Cantwell, managing director and head of Salomon's European
telecoms team.

<P> He joins from CS First Boston, where he was a director responsible for
mergers and acquisitions in the UK.

<P> David Wallis has joined <B>AMBAC</B> as a first vice president, responsible
for marketing and structuring deals out of the London office of the joint venture
with fellow monoline <BR> insurer MBIA.

<P> Wallis joins from the debt structuring desk of NatWest Markets, where he most
recently worked on a number of long-term bonds guaranteed by AMBAC.

<P>


<P> <B>Merrill Lynch</B> has agreed in principle to buy Carnegie Italia, the
Milan-based equities research and sales subsidiary of Carnegie.

<P> Managing director Tony Morrongiello, the chief of Carnegie Italia's team,
will head the firm's local institutional sales presence in Milan in tandem with
the US firm's existing sales, research and trading teams in London.

<P> Carnegie Italia's research analysts, led by Paolo Baccanello, will boost
Merrill's existing Italian research effort.

<P> Douglas Cliggott has joined <B>JP Morgan</B> as a vice president and equity
strategist.

<P> He formerly spent three years at Merrill Lynch, where he was manager of the
global investment strategy team, having previously been head of research at
Alfred Berg in Denmark.

<P> Also joining with Cliggott is Tom van Leuven, who has also worked at Merrill
for the past three years.

<P>


<P> Hugh de Lusignan has been appointed head of UK product sales and marketing at
<B>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</B> and will join the firm's
London-based equities division by the end of the year.

<P> De Lusignan joins SocGen after spending 13 years with NatWest Markets and
Wood Mackenzie, the stockbroking firm that was acquired by NatWest in 1988. Most
recently he was head of UK equity sales at NatWest Markets.

<P> <B>Nomura Research Institute</B> in London has hired Suha Najjar as an equity
analyst to cover the emerging markets of the Middle East, with particular
emphasis on Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.

<P> Najjar joins from Robert Fleming where she spent the last two years covering
the Middle East. She will report to Nick Knight, head of equity research at
Nomura in Europe.

<P> Marle Wittman, head of Nikko Europe's Asian equity team in London for the
last two years, has transferred to <B>Nikko Securities</B> in Hong Kong to take
up a new position as director of Asian capital markets.

<P> She will be responsible for the origination of debt and equity issues for
Nikko in the Asian region, with the exception of Japan.

<P> <B>Bankers Trust</B> has made two senior appointments in Spain, naming Pedro
Perez as non-executive president  and promoting Julio Garcia to be CEO of the
bank's Spanish office.

<P> Perez, previously CEO of the Spanish tobacco monopoly Tabacalera, will advise
Bankers Trust on aspects of its international strategy and key client
relationships in Europe and Latin America. He will also work closely with Garcia
on the implementation of Bankers Trust's strategy in Spain.

<P> Garcia was previously head of the bank's Spanish private banking group.

<P>


<P> Aida der Hovanessian has left Morgan Stanley to join <B>Bear Stearns</B> as
associate director in the capital markets department in London responsible for
covering eastern European issuers, principally in Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary.

<P> <B>Merrill Lynch</B> has announced the appointment of Frank Knowles as a vice
president in its London-based fixed-income research group. Specialising in
non-investment grade credits, Knowles will report to group head Rick Deutsche.
Knowles was formerly at Lehman Brothers.

<P> <B>SBC Warburg</B> has expanded its global trade and export finance effort
with the creation of an export credit capability team.

<P> The team includes David Bird, Colin Wesbroom and Keith Garner, who have
recently joined the firm from Barclays, Standard Chartered and BZW respectively.
They report to John Turnbull, head of global trade finance in London.

<P>

<H3> <B>Borrowers line up as new issue wave begins to build</B> </H3> 

<H4><B>NEW ISSUE activity in the international bond markets looks set to hit a new peak in the coming weeks, with
an array of regular and infrequent borrowers looking at potential debt
fund-raisings across the currency and maturity spectrum.</B></H4>

At least three European sovereigns -- the UK, France and Italy -- are planning jumbo bond issues
worth around $2bn each, while the positive tone in fixed-income markets is
causing many other borrowers to accelerate their autumn issuance plans.

<P> Primary market momentum built quickly during a hectic first week back from
the summer break. More than $9bn of new issues were launched in the Eurobond and
global bond markets, including almost $2.5bn in the Eurodollar market alone.

<P> It is in dollars that the pace of issuance is likely to be at its most hectic
-- and in the widest range of maturities -- as investors of all types and sizes
seek new paper.

<P> The rapid take-up of this week's dollar bond supply underlined the renewed
interest among retail investors at the shorter end, with deals in the two and
three-year sectors, and institutional demand at 10 years.

<P> Successful issues for the Inter-American Development Bank and Deutsche
Ausgleischbank also demonstrated the demand for five-year dollar paper.

<P> The short end in particular will be supported by an unusually high level of
bond redemptions ahead, totalling $12.6bn in September and $10bn in October.

<P> A number of deals in the pipeline are likely to be given the go-ahead in the
coming days and weeks, depending on the market environment following the release
of US non-farm payroll data today (Friday).

<P> The new issue rush will begin on Monday with a $500m five-year offering for
Export-Import Bank of Korea via Nomura and SBC Warburg, with price talk focusing
on a spread of 42bp to 44bp over Treasuries.

<P> The success of this week's 10-year dollar issues for Kansai Electric Power
and Kansai International Airport is likely to presage the launch of a number of
similar deals for Japanese issuers.

<P> Among the government-guaranteed names, the City of Yokohama is looking to
launch a $300m 10-year offering via Tokyo-Mitsubishi International in late
September or early October, while TMI is also expected to bring Trans-Tokyo Bay
at 10 years for $200m.

<P> Also said to be considering transactions are Metropolis of Tokyo and the
Electric Power Development Corporation.

<P> All these deals are likely to pay a spread in the mid-20bp region over
Treasuries, given that the Kansai International Airport bond tightened in from
27bp to 23bp in the week of its launch.

<P> Among Japanese power generators, Hokuriku Electric Power is said to be
looking to raise $350m over five years -- with Goldman Sachs a likely choice as
lead manager, given that it led its last issue and advised Hokuriku in obtaining
credit ratings. Fellow electric power companies Chubu and Kyushu are also
potential candidates for Eurodollars.

<P> France T&eacute;l&eacute;com is said to be looking at the possibility of
launching a 10-year issue in mid-September, and among the issuers looking at the
short-dated retail market is Toyota Motor Credit, possibly with a three-year
offering.

<P> There could also be a slew of highly-rated sovereign dollar floaters set to
emerge in the coming weeks. The UK is rumoured to be considering a return to the
sector, and is expected to refinance the remaining $2bn of a $4bn 10-year FRN
which matures on September 30.

<P> A new FRN would form the second leg of the refinancing package, following the
UK's highly successful $2bn fixed-rate bond issue in mid-July, which was lead
managed by Goldman Sachs and SBC Warburg.

<P> Bankers were wary about discussing specifics of the UK transaction this week,
but the floater would be expected to command a yield of around 20bp through Libor
-- compared with a spread of 5bp over Treasuries for the fixed-rate issue.

<P> Spain and Italy are also said to be looking at $2bn five-year floaters,
although Spain may instead opt to issue a jumbo Euroyen bond for up to
&#165;150bn.

<P> Bankers in Paris expect Italy to come to the market with a jumbo French franc
offering of up to Ffr7bn sometime soon, reporting that investors were clearing
their lines to make way for the issue.

<P> A $500m five-year floater for Bank of America is said to be imminent, and
Council of Europe is reported to be another potential dollar FRN candidate.

<P> In Germany, the coming weeks are set to be no less busy, although attention
is focusing on the upcoming return of the Republic of South Africa to the
Deutschmark sector.

<P> The country's roadshow will end on Friday (September 13), with launch
scheduled for the following week. The financing is set to match the DM400m
outstanding issue that it replaces, and the maturity will likely be seven years.

<P> Momentum is building fast among investors for the bonds, and lead managers
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Morgan Stanley expect strong demand due to the lack
of sovereign paper in the market and the attractive yield pick-up the bonds will
offer to other sovereign paper.

<P> The presence of South African finance minister Trevor Manuel at the
presentations is likely to generate even greater interest, local bankers said.

<P> Price talk is still very wide, with a spread of anywhere between 125bp and
150bp over Bunds. Most bankers expect it to come at the lower end of the range,
but are concerned that the good early reaction does not induce the leads to go
any lower than 125bp over, quoting the poor aftermarket of Poland's Deutschmark
debut as evidence of what can go wrong.

<P> The success of a jumbo Pfandbrief issue for Bayerische Vereinsbank this week,
which achieved an unusually high level of international distribution, should be
followed up by a DM1bn five-year offering with a Rule 144A tranche for Landesbank
Rheinland Pfalz via Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.

<P> Next week Tennessee Valley Authority will embark on a roadshow of Asia and
Europe, with Frankfurt-based bankers predicting that a successful reaction to the
German leg would likely prompt TVA to issue in Deutschmarks for the first time.

<P> Early indications suggest that the borrower would seek around DM1.5bn of
10-year paper via Deutsche and Lehman at a spread of between 15bp and 17bp over
Bunds, although some syndicate officials doubt that sufficient arbitrage exists
at the 10-year part of the curve for TVA to be able to hit its targets.

<P> However, recent DM transactions have demonstrated the existence of arbitrage
at the five-year sector, and despite warnings by some bankers of the onset of
investor fatigue, a number of other issuers are set to follow.

<P> Among them is Abbey National, which is said to be looking at a jumbo
transaction. Abbey is undergoing investor presentations in Germany, working
closely with likely lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The spread is likely
to be in the high 30bp area over Bunds, a level that would strike a balance
between the costs that Abbey can bear and a price that will appeal to investors,
bankers said.

<P> Other names mentioned as possible DM issuers include KfW (which may also
consider a sterling issue), OKB, EIB and SudwestLB. Meanwhile Japan's North East
Finance has ditched plans to issue in the Swiss franc sector and will instead
launch a DM150m seven-year offering via TMI.

<P> KfW is just one of the issuers which may be tempted to follow the Kingdom of
Sweden into the sterling market. Sweden's &#163;300m transaction via Goldman
demonstrated the good arbitrage opportunities which exist at seven years.

<P> In the French franc sector, the African Development Bank will launch its
long-awaited transaction at the beginning of next week following the completion
of roadshow presentations in Paris.

<P> The maturity is likely to be for 10 or 11 years, although lead manager
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale could opt for the shorter five to
six-year sector if the presentations reveal that the 10 to 12-year sectors, which
have seen high levels of new issuance on recent months, are over-saturated. Price
talk has narrowed to a level of between 17bp and 19bp over OATs.

<P> However the arbitrage opportunities which exist at 12 years, where the curve
is relatively expensive, are likely to tempt a number of other issuers.

<P> Paris bankers said potential candidates include Bankgesellschaft Berlin via
JP Morgan and Paribas, and Dresdner Bank and Total via BNP, all with Ffr2bn transactions.

<P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"> Market roars back to life </H4> <P> THE usual September rush
of new issuance quickly got into full swing this week as activity picked up
across most currency sectors after the summer break came to an end.

<P> A spate of deals at the short and long ends of the dollar curve bodes well
for forthcoming transactions. Most successful was a $300m five-year sector debut
from Deutsche Ausgleichsbank, via Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Lehman, which
tightened from 17bp to 10bp over in the two days after launch. The key was its 7%
coupon.

<P> That somewhat overshadowed the IADB's $500m five-year offering with a 6.875%
coupon, led by Goldman Sachs, although Deutsche Ausgleichsbank's tightening
showed that the IADB's pricing of 8bp over Treasuries was spot on.

<P> At the short end, Statoil's return to the Euromarkets after an eight-year
absence was greeted with a mixed reception. But the two Kansais -- Electric Power
and International Airport -- showed there was demand at the longer <BR> end with
10-year transactions.

<P> Elsewhere, the deal of the week was Sweden's &#163;300m offering via Goldman
Sachs, which took advantage of the recent lack of supply from sovereigns in the
seven-year Eurosterling sector.

<P> Two very different deals stood out in Deutschmarks. Argentina once again
showed the appetite for its paper among German retail investors, this time even
pushing out along the curve to 20 years in its two-tranche, CS First Boston-led
offering.

<P> And a five-strong lead group helped make Bayerische Vereinsbank's DM1bn jumbo
one of the most internationally placed Pfandbriefe transactions to date.

<P> Freddie Mac became the first US agency issuer in the French franc market, but
investors found it hard to understand the credit without the assistance of a
roadshow.

<P> Just to underline the renewed activity, this week also saw the first
Deutschmark Japanese warrant issue since January 1995.

<P>

<H4> BZW reorganises senior management structure </H4> 

<P> BZW's
reorganisation continued to take shape this week as the UK investment bank
unveiled a new senior management line-up and hired a top executive from JP Morgan
to run its North American securities business.

<P> Under the new management structure Bob Diamond, the recently recruited chief
executive of BZW's global markets division, joins the firm's management
committee.

<P> Patrick O'Sullivan, currently chief executive of structured finance, becomes
chief operating officer of the firm and also moves onto the management committee.

<P> Also joining the main BZW management committee are finance director David
Cannon, head of human resources Sally Bott and Steve Harker, the newly appointed
chief executive of the firm's equities division.

<P> Harker takes over from former equities chief Jonathan Davie, to whom he was
previously deputy and who becomes full-time deputy chairman of BZW.

<P> As part of the management shake-up Donald Brydon, who has been BZW's acting
chief executive for the last six months, has agreed to leave the firm as the new
team -- headed by chief executive Bill Harrison -- takes over.

<P> Said Harrison: "BZW has developed rapidly and can take great pride in its
progress to date. However, it is clear to me that we have by no means exhausted
our potential for further international growth."

<P> He added that the new senior management team, and the addition of new skills
and experience on the management committee, would help to unlock that potential.

<P> Brydon, who played a key role in building BZW's asset management
division and became acting chief executive following David Band's death earlier
this year, said it had been a "privilege" to be part of BZW's success.  

<P> Tim Lindberg has joined <B>Salomon Brothers</B> as a vice president in the
firm's London-based equity capital markets group. Reporting to John St John, he
will focus on corporate and equity-linked debt issues.

<P> Before joining Salomon, Lindberg spent five years in the equity derivatives
group at Goldman Sachs.

<P> <B>Colin Hermon,</B> a former director of Jardine Fleming Securities in Hong
Kong, has joined <B>Ivanhoe Capital Corporation</B>, a diversified finance
development group based in Singapore and chaired by Robert Friedland.

<P> Hermon, formerly head of Asian equity capital markets at Jardine Fleming and
a director of the Fleming Group, is joined at Ivanhoe by former colleague Matthew
Lechtzier.

<P> Based in London, they will be responsible for corporate finance and capital
market activities and will provide financial assistance to Ivanhoe associates
around the world.

<P> Rassem Zaouk is joining <B>Merrill Lynch </B>on September 23 as a vice
president with responsibility for the firm's debt markets coverage in the Middle
East. He will report to Paul Rafael, managing director responsible for Merrill's
debt markets coverage in central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. He
has previously worked at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in Paris and Sakura Finance
International in London.

<P> <B>JP Morgan</B> this week announced plans to open an office in Johannesburg
early next year to strengthen its commitment to, and involvement in, South
Africa. Subject to regulatory approvals, it will also set up a securities trading
operation that should give clients access to domestic and world markets in
commodities, bonds and related financial products.

<P> The new office will be headed by Ronald Gault, a managing director in the
firm's municipal finance group who joined JP Morgan from CS First Boston in 1993.

<P> In addition to other roles, Gault chairs the Professional Develop-ment
Program, which provides professional work experience for black South Africans in
banking, finance, law and general business.

<P> JP Morgan is a leading international trader in South African instruments and
has been at the forefront in raising capital for South African borrowers and in
facilitating international investment in the country.

<P> "This office signifies our continuing optimism about South Africa's future,"
said Walter Gubert, head of Europe, Africa and the Middle East for JP Morgan.

<P> "It will help us serve our clients there and the international corporations,
financial institutions and investors that are increasingly interested in doing
business in the country."

<P> Ian Shepherdson, chief UK economist at <B>HSBC Markets </B>in London, has
been appointed chief US economist at HSBC Securities Inc in New York with effect
from November 13.

<P> He will succeed Lacy Hunt, who is leaving the group in October. Based in New
York, Shepherdson will report to Roger Bootle, group chief economist of HSBC
Holdings, and to Jim O'Donnell, president and chief executive officer of HSBC
Securities in New York.

<P> Laurence Gergel has joined <B>Royal Bank of Canada</B> Europe's structured
finance group as senior manager of structured finance. He was previously
assistant director of leasing and asset finance at NatWest Markets.

<P> Gergel joins the expanding structured finance unit at Royal Bank of Canada,
which specialises in cross-border leasing, tax-based financing and other
structured transactions. The group is run by Luc d'Iorio, head of structured
finance and syndications.

<P> <B>BZW </B>has announced two senior appointments in its private equity
division. Paul Marcuse becomes divisional managing director while Graeme White
becomes managing director of UK private equity.

<P> They will report to Errol Bishop, head of the private equity division.
Marcuse was formerly head of the property advisory group, having previously spent
10 years with Goldman Sachs. Simon Fisk will replace Marcuse as head of the
property advisory group.

<P> BZW's private equity division has also appointed two directors to its
specialist infrastructure team, which will establish an equity fund investing in
UK infrastructure projects under the Private Finance Initiative.

<P> Bryan Smith, a venture capitalist with 14 years experience, joins the group
headed by Chris Elliott. Robert McClatchey joins the team from BZW's corporate
finance division, where he has worked for the past four years.

<P> Maureen Erasmus has joined the financial institutions group of management
consultant <B>AT Kearney</B>. Formerly head of the financial risk management
practice at Coopers &amp; Lybrand in London, Erasmus joins former Coopers
colleague Paul Reyniers, who was recently recruited to head AT Kearney's global
capital markets and risk management practice.

<P> Based in London, she will work with major securities firms and banks on a
variety of strategic and operational issues.

<P> <B>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale </B>has appointed Regina
Tully as director of credit in the London office with responsibility for
overseeing the credit management of the bank's UK businesses and ensuring a
consistent approach to risk management in liaison with the Paris head office.

<P> She joins from Chase Manhattan Bank where she was deputy head of credit for
the bank's European global markets division. Tully previously worked at Citibank
and Bankers Trust.

<H3> Euromarket in full flow as bond issuers descend</B> </H3> 

<P> <H4>EUROMARKET NEW issue volume broke all
records this week as the traditional autumn funding spree erupted on an
unprecedented scale, with issuers taking advantage of keen demand from
institutional and retail investors to launch an array of new bond
transactions.</H4>

More than $20bn of new debt had been issued in a multitude of
currencies, maturities and structures by yesterday (Thursday), with 15 different
currency sectors being tapped. On one day alone -- Tuesday -- almost $10bn of new
bonds hit the primary market.

<P> Among the deals stealing the limelight were the first global bonds for the
European Investment Bank and Tennessee Valley Authority in the dollar and
Deutschmark sectors respectively -- linked via an old-style back-to-back swap
arranged by Lehman Brothers (see page 3) -- and new jumbo sovereign bonds by
Italy and Spain.

<P> Italy's $1.5bn five-year issue via Morgan Stanley and SBC Warburg was notable
for its spread which, at just 24bp over Treasuries, underlined the dramatic
improvement in the perception of the country's credit in recent months.

<P> But the transaction also underlined the competitive appeal of the traditional
Eurobond -- with its ability to reach a mixture of institutional and retail
investors -- against the more recently introduced global bond structure.

<P> Fellow sovereign Spain steered clear of the new issue deluge in the dollar
and Deutschmark sectors, reopening the jumbo Euroyen market with a &#165;150bn
10-year issue through Nikko.

<P> But it was not just the large financings that caught the eye. The sheer
diversity of paper on offer -- from sovereigns, supranationals, agencies, banks,
corporates and emerging market issuers -- was breathtaking.

<P> Investment bankers said the extraordinary pace of activity was testimony to
the Euromarket's unparalleled versatility as a funding source for all types of
issuers. And they said the profitability of most transactions underlined the
growing maturity of the Euromarket.

<P> "The volume of business is incredible, but the quality of the business being
done is even more incredible," said one leading market participant. "Borrowers
are demanding successful deals -- and getting them. In terms of the quality of
business, this is an even better year than 1993."

<P> Added another senior banker: "We are seeing the pay-off from the structural
developments that have taken place in this market -- the fixed price re-offer
system; borrowers taking a more strategic approach to their issuance; and banks
trying to do profitable transactions.

<P> "What is heartening is that some very significant benchmarks are being set in
the Euromarket, rather than in the global bond market, and that shows that we now
have a system where borrowers and lead managers can choose the structure that
best suits market conditions at any given time."

<P>

<H3> Trickle turns to flood </H3>

A river of new issues turned into a torrent as international fixed-income markets
saw by far their heaviest week of issuance during 1996. In one day alone some
$10bn of securities were issued; unsurprisingly in this mayhem many smaller
issues were submerged. The highlight of the week was the Lehman-arranged
double-hander where a European Investment Bank $1bn global debut was swapped
back-to-back in the old-fashioned way with the proceeds from a DM1.5bn issue from
Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA bond was adjudged the best performer,
although both borrowers professed themselves delighted with the results of the
exercise. But outperforming both issues was a five-year $1.5bn Morgan Stanley/SBC
Warburg-led bond for Italy, brought at 24bp over Treasuries, which showed just
how far the country had come in credit terms. Elsewhere in the dollar market
smaller deals struggled to stand out from the crowd, but TMCC proved an instant
hit with European retail buyers with a new bond at 2bp over Treasuries. In the DM
market those rarest of borrowers Nestl and Unilever managed to arrive on the
screens within minutes of each other. Despite that and ferociously tight pricing,
both deals were describe as among the fastest selling in recent memory -
testament to the enduring lure of those names among Swiss buyers. In the face of
these deals it was perhaps not a surprise that well planned, priced and executed
strategic bonds from the Abbey National and Bankgesellschaft Berlin failed to
shine as fully as they deserved. Next week attention will remain focused on the
intentions of the UK, believed to be ready to launch a new $2bn floater before
the end of the month. Pricing talk indicates a range of 18bp-20bp below Libor,
although there is still no certainty that any deal will materialise. Elsewhere,
Metropolis of Tokyo will launch a $250m 10-year issue at 24bp over Treasuries
through IBJ.

<H2>Emerging markets boost ratings </H2>
<H3>Economists now predict an upturn in the world economy. Country scores
in <I>Euromoney</I>'s country risk ranking, based on our poll of economists
and political analysts, plus market data and World Bank debt figures, have
jumped by an average of 2.75 percentage points. Research and commentary
by Charles Piggott. </H3>
Overall scores in this month's country risk ranking are notably higher than
in September by an average of 2.75 percentage points. Emerging market countries
account in no small part for the improvement: trade finance houses are demanding
lower risk premiums on deals with emerging market countries and ratio's
taken from World Bank debt tables show lower debt burdens on most emerging
market economies. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg's healthy economy has pushed it back to the top of the ranking,
above Switzerland at 2, Singapore at 3, Japan at 4 and the United States
at 5. But the biggest changes come further down the ranking between the
Czech Republic at 36 and Uzbekistan at 114. <BR>
<BR>
Central and eastern European countries are the fastest risers. Russia rises
42 places to 100, Poland 14 places to 58, Latvia 27 places to 89, Lithuania
33 places to 85, Czech Republic five places to 36, Croatia 39 places to
78, Albania 47 places to 102, Kyrgyzstan 40 places to 121, Uzbekistan 29
places to 114 and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 45 places<BR>
to 110. <BR>
<BR>
Sub-Saharan African countries slip down the ranking. The exceptions are
Uganda which rises 54 places to 96, Zambia up 22 to 113 and Ethiopia up
20 to 132. Similarly many Latin American countries fall although Peru, Argentina,
Mexico and Bolivia regain some of the ground they lost during 1995. <BR>
<BR>
But on the whole, emerging market countries are doing better than 12 months
ago. Consistently higher scores from economists and political analysts for
economic performance and political stability are confirmed by World Bank
data. Growth in GNP levels and export earnings in emerging market countries
has helped to bring down debt levels in the past two years: the average
ratio of total debt service to export of goods and services (the level of
a country's debt payments compared with its export earnings) for non-OECD
countries in the top 100 has come down from 18.58% at the end of 1993 to
17.23% at the end of 1994. Current account deficits are down on average
by 22% while ratios of total outstanding debt to GNP have come down to an
average of a fraction over 54%. <BR>
<BR>
Better trade finance terms in the last six months have helped. Trade banks
and discount houses have lengthened out maturities offered to emerging market
countries and lowered forfaiting spreads over riskless countries such as
the US: in September 1995 the average maximum tenor offered on discount
on forfaiting minus the spread over US deals was -0.23. The spread has now
come down<BR>
to -0.16. <BR>
<BR>
Commercial bank lending to emerging market countries has also increased.
World Bank debt tables show disbursements of private non-guaranteed debt
to emerging market countries (mainly commercial bank lending) rose on average
from $957 million to $1.2 billion from year end 1993 to 1994. <BR>
<BR>
An extended survey of <I>Euromoney</I>'s country risk rankings from 1993
to 1996 will be published with April's issue of the magazine. For further
details please contact Charles Piggott on +44 171 779 8639. 
<H3>Methodology <I><BR>
<BR>
Euromoney</I> country risk assessment uses nine categories that fall into
three broad groups: analytical indicators, credit indicators and market
indicators. The weighted scores are calculated as follows: the highest score
in each category receives the full mark for the weighting; the lowest receives
zero. In between, figures are calculated according to the formula: Final
score = weighting/(maximum score &shyp; minimum score) x (score &shyp; minimum
score). The country risk ranking shows only the final scores after weighting.
<BR>
<BR>
Categories are: </H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Economic data </B>(25% weighting). Taken from the <I>Euromoney</I>
global economic projections 1995&shyp;96 (see page<B> </B>163). Each country
scores the average of the evaluations for 1995 and 1996. 
<LI><B>Political risk </B>(25%). <I>Euromoney</I> polled risk analysts,
risk insurance brokers and bank credit officers. They were asked to give
each country a score of between zero and 10. A score of 10 indicates no
risk of non-payment; zero indicates that there is no chance of payments
being made. Countries were scored in comparison both with each other and
with previous years. Country risk was defined as the risk of non-payment
or non-servicing of payment for goods or services, loans, trade-related
finance and dividends, and the non-repatriation of capital. This category
does not reflect the creditworthiness of<BR>
individual counterparties in any country. 
<LI><B>Debt indicators </B>(10%). Scores are calculated using the following
ratios from the <I>World Bank World Debt Tables 1995-96: </I>debt service
to exports (A); current-account balance to GNP (B); external debt to GNP
(C). Figures are the latest available, mostly for 1993. Scores are calculated
by the formula: C + (A x 2) &shyp; (B x 10). The lower the score,<BR>
the better. Because of the lack of consistent economic data for OECD and
rich oil-producing countries, these score full points with the exception
of Turkey, Portugal and Mexico which report debt figures to the IMF. Developing
countries that do not report debt data to the World Bank score zero. 
<LI><B>Debt in default or rescheduled </B>(10%). A score of between zero
and 10 based on the amount of debt in default or that has been rescheduled
over the past three years. Zero equals no non-payments; 10, all in default
or rescheduled. Scores are based on the <I>World Bank World Debt Tables
1995-96 </I>and<I> Euromoney </I>estimates for countries which do not report
under the debtor reporting system (DRS). 
<LI><B>Credit ratings</B> (10%). The average of sovereign ratings from Moody's,
Standard &amp; Poor's and IBCA. For the first time <I>Euromoney</I> has
scored countries that are not rated investment grade (ie BB-). This change
in methodology has altered scores for credit ratings, even where the underlying
credit ratings may not have changed. 
<LI><B>Access to bank finance</B> (5%). Calculated from disbursements of
private, long-term, unguaranteed loans as a percentage of GNP. OECD countries
which do not report under the debtor reporting system (DRS) score 10. Source:
<I>World Bank World Debt Tables 1995-96.</I> 
<LI><B>Access to short-term finance</B> (5%). Members of OECD consensus
group I score 10, members of group II score five, members of group III score
nothing. Coverage from US Exim Bank and NCM UK is worth between zero and
10, depending on the level of coverage available. 
<LI><B>Access to international bond and syndicated loan markets</B> (5%).
Reflects <I>Euromoney</I>'s<I> </I>analysis of how easily the country might
tap the markets now, based largely on issues since January 1995. A score
of 10 means no problem whatsoever; eight, no problem on 95% of occasions;
six, usually no problem; four, possible (depending on conditions); two,
just possible in some circumstances; zero, impossible. 
<LI><B>Access to and discount on forfaiting</B> (5%). Reflects the average
maximum tenor available and the forfaiting spread over riskless countries
such as the US. The score equals the average maximum tenor minus the spread.
Countries for which forfaiting is not available score nothing. Data were
supplied by Morgan Grenfell Trade Finance, West Merchant Bank, the London
Forfaiting Company, Standard Bank and ING Capital. 
</UL>
<H3>Economic Projections<BR>
</H3>
Euromoney received replies from 24 economists at leading financial and economic
institutions. They gave each country's economic performance a score out
of 100, after making comparisons between countries and years. The world's
fastest-growing, best-performing economy in an ideal year would score 100;
the worst economy in a disastrous year would score zero. The economists
were asked to look at sustained economic growth, monetary stability, current-account/budget
deficit or surplus, unemployment and structural imbalances. <BR>
<BR>
Respondents also gave their forecasts of real GNP growth for calendar years
1996 and 1997. The scores in the ranking are the average of these forecasts.

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3>
<H2> Why it pays to default </H2>
 <H4> It is hard not to feel sorry for the
Hungarians.</H4>

 Remember 1990. All the central European states were emerging from Communism
with their economies in tatters. The Polish government negotiated with its
creditors a debt reduction agreement which halved its outstanding foreign debt.
The Hungarians, on the other hand, despite an even more onerous debt burden,
refused to do so. "We are honest people who repay our debts," the government
argued. Over time, the Hungarians reasoned, investors would remember this stance
and reward the country by demanding a smaller risk premium for buying its bonds.

<P> Six years on, this has not happened. Poland finds it no harder to borrow than
Hungary. The most recent Polish Eurodollar bond issue &#173; for state-owned (but
soon to be privatized) Bank Handlowy &#173; came at 88 basis points over US
treasuries. The only Hungarian issue this year so far was a Deutschmark floater
at 90 basis points over Libor. It is hard to compare the two, but the Hungarian
issue was certainly no cheaper, and probably rather more expensive, than the one
for the Polish bank.

<P> That is unsurprising given the respective credit ratings of the countries.
Moody's, for example, rates Poland (Baa3) a notch above Hungary (Ba1) &#173;
although Standard &amp; Poor's has them the other way round. Poland's greater
creditworthiness is understandable given that its foreign currency debt-to-GDP
ratio is 43.4% (thanks to the debt reduction of 1990), compared to Hungary's
90.7%.

<P> Other emerging-market borrowers that are in favour with investors at the
moment include: Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines. All in the past six years
have renegotiated their foreign debts.

<P> At the end of May, Bulgaria's state-owned (and troubled) Mineralbank looked
on the verge of defaulting on a samurai bond. Judging from what happened to the
Hungarians, it should probably go ahead and default. As long as Bulgaria's
economic reforms continue (which is, admittedly, doubtful), it should have no
problem coming back to the international bond markets in a year or two.


<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2> Can it last?</H2> <P> It's hard to talk to an investment banker at
the moment without having him boast of the huge pipeline of deals he's working
on. This is true whether the banker works in mergers and acquisitions,
emerging-market bond issues, European equity origination or, indeed, almost any
market. Is this a sign that the financial markets are on the verge of a
tremendous boom, or that they are heading for a bubble that will burst with
horrendous consequences?

<P> The bursting-bubble scenario is the easier to argue. Signs of excessive
speculation in the US are already clear. Mutual funds continue to pour money into
the US stock market, as the article "What could kill the US bull?" on page 152 of
this issue describes. Anecdotal evidence abounds of US investors borrowing on
their credit cards to speculate in stocks. Optimists argue that this is a
"liquidity-driven" market but, as Byron Wien, Morgan Stanley's chief strategist
commented recently, "I remember the last market labelled that way in 1987, and it
ended badly enough that I feel a spinal shudder every time I hear the phrase."

<P> The recent rush in emerging market issues &#173; driven by that same
liquidity &#173; has a similar feeling of excess about it. After a quiet 12
months, a raft of privatization issues from Asia and Latin America will hit the
markets before the end of this year. In debt, the range of issuers able to tap
the market &#173; and the range of currencies they can issue in &#173; is being
extended all the time. Take Romania. In June, this country is expected to issue
its first Eurobond; bankers have already started arranging small private
placements for international borrowers in lei (Romania's currency) which are sold
to foreign investors.

<P> The alternative view is that the boom represents not so much a bubble as a
fundamental shift in the financial environment. The consequences of a sustained
low-inflation environment are only slowly becoming clear. (And the academic
dispute over whether inflation really is dead is irrelevant to this. What is
indisputable is that inflation has <I>already </I>remained low for a longer
period than at any time since the 1960s.)

<P> Low inflation will continue to turn upside down many of the key assumptions
investors and borrowers have made for the past three decades. It will promote a
sustained shift into equities. It will push investors to look further and further
afield for higher returns in bonds. Company chief executives, faced with low (but
predictable) growth in established markets, will need to restructure and acquire
in order to grow their earnings per share.

<P> If this argument proves correct, the boom for investment banks which began in
1992 (and was set back only temporarily by the rise in US interest rates in
February 1994 and by the peso crisis in January 1995) still has a long way to
run.

<H3>EMERGING MARKETS </H3><B> Edited by Brian
Caplen </B><BR>
<H4>PERU </H4>
<H2>Merrill and JP Morgan win bid </H2>
With 1996 barely under way Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan struck an early blow
in the battle for dominance in the Latin American underwriting league tables:
they won the mandate to lead the upcoming international equity offering
for Telef&oacute;nica del Per&uacute;. <BR>
<BR>
The announcement from the Peruvian government, which is disposing of its
remaining 29% stake in the privatized telecoms utility, came on January
30 following several weeks of delay and growing suspense among the mostly
US investment banks which were invited to pitch for the deal. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan and Merrill won out with a 2.42% fee after presentations were made
in Lima by five investment banks or groups. Their four rivals were CS First
Boston, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers together with SBC Warburg, and Morgan
Stanley together with ING. The winners will need all their global distribution
power and experience in leading underwriting syndicates in order to successfully
place the issue, which could top $1 billion, making it one of the largest
equity offerings ever to come out of the region. The Telef&oacute;nica board
has already agreed that following the international offering, which it is
hoped will come to market some time during the first half of the year, the
shares will be listed in New York, London, Madrid and Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
The Peruvian government has had plans to dispose of its 29% stake in Telef&oacute;nica
ever since the sale two years ago of a controlling interest in the telecoms
monopoly. At that time, the sector was structured as two companies, the
Lima operator Compa&ntilde;ia Peruana de Tel&eacute;fonos (CPT) and long-distance
carrier Entel Per&uacute;, both held 70% by the state with a free float
of 30%. In February 1994 Telef&oacute;nica Internacional (Tisa) of Spain,
the holding company for Telef&oacute;nica de Espa&ntilde;a's South American
operations, won the bidding and bought a 31.5% stake, with Peruvian partners
the Wiese and Grana &amp; Montero groups each coming in for a further 1.75%.
Telef&oacute;nica employees were allocated 6% of the company. <BR>
<BR>
The new management merged the two companies later in 1994, renaming the
new unit Telef&oacute;nica del Peru. The total price paid for the 35% was
$2.002 billion, but as part of the sale agreement, the government returned
$611 million to Telef&oacute;nica in order to support its ambitious capital
expenditure requirements. Thus the amount received by the Peruvian state
for its 35% stake totalled $1.39 billion. <BR>
<BR>
The current market capitalization of Telef&oacute;nica on the Lima Stock
Exchange is $5.3 billion and the latest share sale could bring in around
$1.5 billion, giving a valuable boost to Peru's overstretched public finances.
The underwriters will be helped by the fact that Telef&oacute;nica is seen
as the bellwether for the Peruvian market and that many institutions wishing
to increase their exposure to Peru will want the stock. <BR>
<BR>
Not all the shares will be sold internationally. The privatization agency
Comisi&oacute;n de Promoci&oacute;n de la Inversi&oacute;n is committed
to promoting widespread share ownership, and there will be a domestic offering
as part of its citizens' participation programme. The domestic offering
will be led by Banco de Credito, Peru's largest bank, for a 3% fee. In the
coming weeks Banco de Cr&eacute;dito will meet with Merrill and Morgan to
decide upon the exact allocation of shares domestically and internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
The award of the mandate was originally expected in mid-January, but was
delayed in part because of the winter storms which disrupted Wall Steet.
That prevented several of the investment banks from being in Lima on the
appointed day to make their presentations. Having agreed to reschedule,
the Peruvian authorities then decided to take some extra time to weigh up
the various presentations. <BR>
<BR>
Investors are likely to be attracted by the strong GDP growth in Peru and
by the tremendous growth potential for Telef&oacute;nica del Per&uacute;.
Peru has the lowest level of line penetration in Latin America, with a recent
report from ING Barings estimating that lines per 100 inhabitants stand
at only 4.6, compared with 17 in Argentina. Peru has a population of 24
million. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch initiated coverage of the stock in January with a buy recommendation
and noted that Telef&oacute;nica del Per&uacute; is the fastest-growing
publicly traded telephone company in the world, with the highest projected
five-year growth rates for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, and earnings per share of the 43 companies covered by
the Merrill global telecoms research team. &quot;This superior growth likely
will be driven by rapid network expansion, substantial productivity improvements,
a favourable regulatory environment and an experienced management team that
knows how to exploit the opportunity that it faces,&quot; the report said.
<BR>
<BR>
Since Tisa took over at the phone company, the service has improved following
years of state-run neglect. Expansion has been rapid. This year $600 million
in new investment is expected, with an additional 400,000 lines installed.
The company has a five-year monopoly, until May 1999, on both local and
long-distance wire telecommunications, and it is also pursuing opportunities
in cellular phones and cable television. The market will be opened up to
full competition in May 1999, at which point Telef&oacute;nica is certain
to be aggressively challenged by another public-listed telecoms company,
Tele 2000, which is already a competitor in the cellular and cable TV sectors.
<BR>
<BR>
By that time Telef&oacute;nica should also be benefiting from regional growth,
since from 1998 there will be a fibre-optic network in place linking it
with Argentina and Chile, where Tisa also has controlling interests in Compa&ntilde;ia
de Telecommunicaciones de Chile and Telef&oacute;nica de Argentina. Tisa
also holds a minority stake in Venezuela's telecoms company Compa&ntilde;ia
Anonima Nacional de Tel&eacute;fonos de Venezuela (CANTV). <BR>
<BR>
With such growth prospects Telef&oacute;nica del Per&uacute; should be a
big hit with buyers of Latin American equities, and by the end of 1996 their
depositary receipts are likely to be a core holding in the portfolios of
most large institutional investors interested in the region. <B><BR>Michael
Marray</B> <BR><BR><BR>
<H4>POLAND </H4>
<H2>The battle for Polish copper </H2>
The flotation of KGHM Polska Miedz in the third quarter of this year will
be Poland's largest privatization and one of the most significant in eastern
Europe since 1990. It's no wonder that such a prestigious mandate has drawn
most of the major investment banks into a bidding war that promises to be
tough. <BR>
<BR>
The path for the eventual victor is likely to be equally so, marked by political
interference, competing demands from management and unions, and controversial
legislation that reflects Poland's still unresolved ownership laws. <BR>
<BR>
Favourite for the mandate was SBC Warburg which has teamed up with Bank
Handlowy, Poland's most internationally experienced bank. (SG Warburg had
been appointed adviser for the country's suspended mass-privatization programme
back in 1991, but has not been paid - so perhaps its compensation will come
now.) But a more likely winner is the JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and
local bank Pekao consortium. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan's successful Poland Eurobond issue last year and the surprising award
of the Gdanski Bank mandate to HSBC (with Daiwa), despite Schroders' extensive
(although unsolicited) work, gives them an edge over rivals - even CS First
Boston which has been busy in Poland since 1990 and has joined forces with
Salomon. Other challengers are Flemings and BRE, Morgan Stanley and Dresdner,
and a powerful consortium of BZW, UBS and the Polish WBK bank. <BR>
<BR>
The most curious duo is Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale and
the highly respected BIG bank, the only organically independent bank to
form since 1989 and a haven for ex-communist apparatchiks. SocGen has little
experience with east European privatizations, but France has been a prominent
financier and adviser to Poland's structural reforms - creating the Warsaw
Stock Exchange, for example - and must be keen for some monetary reward.
Conspiracy theorists suggest that French representatives have been fiercely
lobbying the new communist government and that the BIG alliance with SocGen
is evidence of their success. <BR>
<BR>
The bidding process occurs in two stages. A technical proposal giving details
of the deal's management and underwriting structure, a timetable and distribution
forecasts, is sealed in an envelope and submitted for assessment by a privatization
ministry committee. Those who pass must then offer a financial proposal,
providing a breakdown of fees. <BR>
<BR>
The technical proposals were to be submitted on January 23, but were deferred
to January 30 and then again to February 2. Banks blame &quot;bureaucratic
delays&quot;, but Poland is more sensitive than other central Europeans
in ensuring its assets are not hijacked by western bankers. Intensive searches
are conducted on consortia personnel to weed out any directors with criminal
records and to check on the past behaviour of consortia firms - including
lawyers and accountants - in Poland. <BR>
<BR>
Unofficial estimates value the copper-mining company, the world's fifth-largest
producer, at between $2 billion and $3 billion. Banks have been privately
advised that their proposals should assume that the state will retain a
controlling stake in the company. KGHM is Poland's biggest export earner
and, with profits last year of over $200 million from sales worth $1 billion,
it is the country's most profitable company and the third most profitable
company in the Central European Free Trade Area. <BR>
<BR>
According to CRU International, a London-based copper research unit, KGHM
mines contain 1.25 million tonnes of copper ore - enough to sustain production
for 45 years. The company has benefited from government spending on research
and development, with the result that its extracting and processing operations
are efficient and comparable to western competitors. It has also enjoyed
high copper prices during the last two years, so its gamble not to hedge
has paid off - at least for the time being. But if copper prices fall to
below $1,500 per tonne, KGHM will operate at a loss. <BR>
<BR>
Other worries for investors are a history of political interference, escalating
fixed costs and a need for rationalizing support companies. Labour union
politicians forced the sacking of KGHM's president, Krzysztof Sedzikowski,
last May after his cost-cutting measures reduced the workforce and his disposal
of non-core businesses caused further redundancies. Record profits in 1994
prompted labour unrest last summer: instead of workers being rewarded with
one-off bonuses, long-term fixed costs were increased by wage rises. KGHM
Metale, a 90%-owned subsidiary, has started a programme of vertical integration
by purchasing copper component and manufacturing companies, but a major
concern is the pending rationalization of ancillary welfare businesses:
job losses and social infrastructure cuts might save money but are unlikely
to be popular or accepted by the unions. <BR>
<BR>
The biggest problem is the ownership of KGHM - or any Polish company for
that matter. A 1990 law stipulates that employees must be allocated 20%
of the shares of a privatized company at half the offer price, as long as
the value of each individual's portion does not exceed the average annual
Polish wage. On that basis, KGHM's 30,000 workforce would take up considerably
less than 20%. <BR>
<BR>
An alternative proposal was that 15% of privatized companies should be distributed
free to employees, but the draft legislation was thrown out by the constitutional
court last year. However, one source at the privatization ministry hints
that, because of union pressure, the aborted law might be enacted for KGHM
only. In central Europe, bankers will have to learn to live with what Stephen
Fries, economist at the EBRD, calls the &quot;social dimension&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;KGHM is a very large and successful company and a major export earner,&quot;
says David Clark, director of corporate finance at BZW. &quot;Its flotation
will be a very important development for the Warsaw Stock Exchange and will
lead to a significant increase in interest for Polish equities by international
investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Australia's Western Mining and the US's Asarco both tried to make strategic
investments in KGHM in 1992 and were forced to back off after popular demonstrations
demanded &quot;hands off Polish copper&quot;. Privatization in Poland will
continue to be a sensitive topic, challenging the easy assumptions and sanguine
faith of EBRD model-makers and investment bankers pursuing the latest IPO
mandate.

<H4>RUSSIA </H4>
<H2>Stet stand-off </H2>
It should have been the Russian Privatization Centre's (RPC) finest hour:
an above-board $1.4 billion deal with a well-known international company
completed in time to fulfil the state's 1995 budget target for privatization
receipts. <BR>
<BR>
After a year in which Russian privatizations had become synonymous with
sleaze, the sale of a 25% stake in telephone operator Svyazinvest to state-controlled
Italian telecoms group Stet was intended to breathe new life into the country's
struggling disposal programme. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. And ever since Maxim Boycko,
head of the centre, cancelled the deal at the end of December, people have
been asking why. Was the cancellation, as president Boris Yeltsin's economic
adviser Alexander Livshitz suggested, triggered by the strong showing of
the Communists in December's parliamentary elections? Livshitz implied that
Stet had effectively withdrawn, frightened by Communist pledges to revoke
&quot;unfair&quot; privatizations. Other observers said that it was the
Russian government itself that had lost its nerve, cowed by Communist and
nationalist taunts about selling off the family silver to foreigners. <BR>
<BR>
The sale of Svyazinvest probably broke down for more prosaic reasons. The
RPC had been pressing for a more &quot;professional&quot; approach to privatizations
and Svyazinvest was its chance to prove that open auctions of large assets
could work. But clearly this required the deal to be closed on time and
at the $1.4 billion headline price. Unfortunately, the Russians' determination
to achieve this caused the breach with Stet. For, although the Italian company
wanted to do the deal, it couldn't meet the Russians' timetable because
of fears that a botched acquisition would sour its own $7 billion privatization
later this year. <BR>
<BR>
Svyazinvest, established in 1994, the second telecoms utility after Rostelekom,
is little more than a shell owning 51% stakes in 85 regional telephone companies
and a recently granted licence to develop an as yet unbuilt long-distance
and international telephone network. A Moscow-based investment banker calls
it &quot;a derivative: an instrument holding a basket of shares in companies
which have assets but need to be restructured&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, when the auction was held last November, only two bidders emerged:
Stet and a consortium consisting of US West, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com
and Deutsche Telekom. Stet was widely seen as the most logical partner.
The company has an ambitious international strategy involving expansion
in eastern Europe but had been outbid in two previous auctions in the region
- the 1993 sale of the Hungarian telephone utility Matav and last year's
Czech offering. Therefore, few were surprised when it emerged as the winner,
having outbid the rival consortium by some $200 million. <BR>
<BR>
At this point the RPC's hopes for a clean deal seemed likely to be realized.
Stet had offered a good price and seemed keen to complete the deal quickly.
Stet's Moscow representative, Carlo del Bo, talked confidently of how the
stake in Svyazinvest would lead to a series of projects to develop Russia's
telecommunications. <BR>
<BR>
But then the Italians woke up to the complexity of the deal. Most other
potential bidders had been put off by the uncertainties surrounding Svyazinvest.
How much influence, for instance, would it have over the 85 local operators
it &quot;controlled&quot;? And what regulations would oblige Rostelekom
to make its long-distance network accessible to Svyazinvest until it could
create its own fibre-optic and satellite links to join up the pieces in
its telecoms jigsaw? Encouraged by the fact that theirs was now the only
show in town, Stet's executives settled down for some hard-nosed negotiation.
<BR>
<BR>
This was not on the Russian agenda at all. Already alarmed by Stet's increasing
unwillingness to meet their December 22 deadline for completion, the Russians
found the Italians getting tough on the price. One investment banker who
advised the government says angrily that, having bid high in the auction,
Stet was trying quite openly to chip away at the price in the belief that
the Russians were committed to a sale. <BR>
<BR>
If that's what they thought, their strategy didn't work. Pressed by the
Russians to close the deal, Stet listed its concerns - including tariffs
and the access it would get to the Rostelekom network. Stet said that, until
these were satisfied, it would pay money for Svyazinvest shares only into
an escrow account. This was a deal-breaker. The Russians felt they had been
ambushed. According to Elena Shalneva, a spokeswoman for the RPC, although
Stet had listed similar concerns before, these had always been presented
&quot;in a very much more minor way&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen whether the stand-off has wider political consequences.
But for now, everyone has egg on his face. The RPC has failed to launch
its showcase deal, strengthening the hand of those who argue that privatizations
should be cosy domestic affairs, with the country's banking cartel lending
the government money in return for shares in state corporations. Stet has
been told that whatever happens to Svyazinvest in future, it won't be involved
- although the Russians may be softening. &quot;We don't exclude entirely
the possibility that Stet will be involved in a second auction, although
it remains unlikely that they will be allowed to participate,&quot; says
Shalneva of the RPC. <BR>
<BR>
And what of the international investment banks which handled the sale -
the first that Russia has hired to conduct an auction. NM Rothschild, Barings
and MC Securities are silent about the deal, but one banker says that they
are &quot;pretty cut up&quot;, largely because their fees were &quot;highly
success-oriented&quot;. There's no guarantee they'll get a second chance.
When asked if the same team would be appointed for the next auction, a Russian
official says tersely: &quot;No comment.&quot;

<H4>THAILAND </H4>
<H2>Telecoms double act </H2>
Thailand's privatization programme is moving about as fast as the capital's
infamous traffic jams. But the end of the road is in sight for the sell-off
of two state-owned telephone companies, the Telephone Organization of Thailand
(TOT) and Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT), with the government
setting a five-year deadline and advisers being shortlisted for asset valuations.
<BR>
<BR>
The question now is whether Thailand's mobile-phone-wielding investors will
stump up enough cash to absorb the share issues being talked about. <BR>
<BR>
A year ago the stock market looked invincible, but an election last July
and fears about inflation put the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index
into a spin for much of 1995, resulting in a drop of 5.4% over the year.
<BR>
<BR>
Salomon Brothers' telecoms analyst in Bangkok, David Riedel, says a &quot;back
of the envelope&quot; calculation values TOT at around $4 billion. Meanwhile,
any privatization of CAT is hampered by the loss-making, overstaffed postal
services attached to it. <BR>
<BR>
The key lies in the structure of the privatizations and a controlled overall
strategy. A Coopers &amp; Lybrand-led consortium recommended in late 1994
that 49% of TOT should be retained by the government, 5% issued to staff,
25% sold to a strategic partner and the remaining 21% floated by the end
of 1996. Realistically, TOT is likely to be floated by 1997 at the earliest
and CAT by 1998, say analysts. <BR>
<BR>
The government's telecom master plan, recently approved by the cabinet,
requires both TOT, which covers domestic calls, directories and public telephones,
and CAT, which handles the postal service, international telephone calls,
data services, and domestic mobile and paging services, to be privatized
within five years. They must also be split, with the network remaining in
government hands and only the service elements of the companies being sold
off. <BR>
<BR>
TOT has shortlisted around 20 foreign and local investment banks to carry
out an asset valuation, which will be separate from any contract for commercial
valuation. Hot contenders for the asset valuation are Merrill Lynch, JP
Morgan and local finance and securities companies. <BR>
<BR>
Once the valuations are complete, a strategic partner will be brought in,
taking a 20% to 25% stake in TOT and working with the organization to restructure
the business. British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom, Nynex, AT&amp;T, Cable
&amp; Wireless, and Motorola are being touted as obvious candidates for
a stake. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The drift is that TOT is not going to survive in the long term unless
it has a foreign strategic partner,&quot; says Paul Ngo, an analyst at Barings
in Bangkok. <BR>
<BR>
Riedel's valuation would mean around $1 billion of shares being offered
to the public. He is confident the market can stand it, given that almost
inevitably there would be an international tranche. &quot;It's not going
to swamp the market like an Indonesian Telkom or Singtel [Singapore Telecom],&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
The amount is only one sixth of the market capitalization of Telecom Asia,
Thailand's second-largest listed company by market capitalization at Bt177
billion ($7 billion), he points out. Telecom Asia's IPO in 1993 was the
largest single offering to date and raised Bt12.265 billion ($500 million)
through the sale of 10% of the company. The Thai stock market's total capitalization
is currently around Bt3,840 billion ($154 billion). <BR>
<BR>
Despite a loss of confidence small investors haven't forgotten the privatization
bonanza a year ago when Thai punters trebled their money on the debut of
the newly privatized Electricity Generating Company (Egcomp). <BR>
<BR>
Egcomp's 51% issue raised Bt4.5 billion ($180 million), with about 28% sold
internationally. The shares almost trebled in value on their first day of
trading, rising from Bt22 to Bt60. A year on, they are trading at around
Bt86. <BR>
<BR>
Many government sell-offs are born out of a pressing need to raise cash.
With an eighth consecutive year of budget surplus and a growing economy,
the Thai government has been in no hurry to offload its state enterprises.
&quot;There's no rationale for rushing into a fire sale,&quot; said a 1994
World Bank report.

<H3>EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION</H3>


<H2> <B>From Orange County to Belgium </B> </H2> <H4> <B>Bernard Connolly, whose
critical book <I>The Rotten Heart of Europe</I> lost him his job at the European
Commission, continues to write unwelcome truths about the Maastricht Treaty and
"Euroland" after January 1999. Here, he looks at the future of
no-longer-sovereign government bond markets. Good news for Italy, bad news for
Belgium. </B> </H4> 

<P> Anyone tempted to take the Maastricht treaty at face
value as a guide to what might happen to bond markets in Euroland is being
extremely gullible. The treaty was not written by people possessing a great deal
of understanding or sympathy for financial markets. Many ends were left untied.
Some of those omissions will be put right in secondary legislation, perhaps to be
drafted in consultation with financial market participants. More on the working
of Euroland debt markets will be gleaned from the monetary management blueprints
that the European Monetary Institute (EMI) will offer before the end of this
year. But the future is fraught with uncertainty.

<P> The system created by Maastricht is a one-off. Maastricht sets up a monetary
system by fiat but leaves it far from clear who, if anyone, is supposed to say
"fiat"!

<P> In the financial field, the essence of sovereignty is the ability to create
money. A government that can get its own money used needs neither tax revenues
nor the proceeds of debt sales to cover its expenditures. Instead it can be
argued (with many historical examples, such as that of the Southern Confederacy)
that the reason for taxation is to create an incentive for the subject to use the
sovereign's money. In the absence of money-creating power, taxes have to be
levied to fund both current spending and the interest on government debt. So,
unsurprisingly, public entities without the power to issue money typically have
tight limits on spending more than they tax. In the US, for instance, 48 states
(or 49, depending on interpretation) are bound by balanced budget laws: their
issue of new debt is subject to very strict limits. Quite literally, they are not
sovereign borrowers.

<P> Non-sovereign public borrowers are, like corporate borrowers, subject to
insolvency  risk. When Orange County found itself faced with a sudden drop in tax
revenues, it also faced bond market exclusion. Draconian fiscal austerity had to
be imposed. But at least the starting debt position of Orange County was
manageable. The same is true of US states: none of them has a debt-to-income
ratio of more than 20%. The position of the European governments which are
planning to deprive themselves of sovereign borrower status is very different.
Luxembourg apart (and Luxembourg is already part of a monetary union), all of
these countries will have a deficit close to, or perhaps significantly above, 3%
of GDP when they enter European monetary union (Emu). The best of them (again,
excluding Luxembourg) will have a debt ratio close to 60%, and the worst of them
will have a ratio of almost 140% and debt service costs of close to 10% of GDP.
Only the experience of Israel during the period of dollarization appears to offer
anything close to an historical comparison with this foolhardy experiment.

<P> <B>Financial traps</B>

<P> The implications for European bond markets are potentially so serious that
the Maastricht framework cannot possibly survive as designed. A degree of
stumbling and confused recognition that there is some sort of problem are seen in
the efforts of German finance minister Theo Waigel to rewrite the treaty without
rewriting it. His proposed stability pact is intended to address the so-called
"free-rider" problem in Emu. With a single monetary policy, the interest-rate
implications of an irresponsible fiscal policy in an individual member state
would be diffused over the whole area. To deal with these perverse incentives,
tight rules have to be imposed on fiscal behaviour.

<P> Unfortunately, the stability pact idea comes a generation too late for Emu.
The 1% limit on budget deficits favoured by Waigel is politically over-ambitious,
but financially it isn't ambitious enough. Existing debt burdens mean that a 1%
limit on the overall deficit implies a substantial primary surplus over a very
long period. There are no historical examples of democracies being able to
sustain such surpluses. In Belgium, which has run a large primary surplus for
several years (yet still has an overall deficit clearly above the proposed Waigel
limit), parliamentary democracy in financial affairs has already been suspended.
Yet Belgium is the only OECD country (apart from Norway, which is in a much
happier fiscal situation) in which the structural deficit is planned to rise this
year.

<P> This degree of fiscal austerity has been forced down the Belgians' throats by
arguing: "We need it to get into Emu, but once we're in, all our problems will be
over." The imposition of the Waigel stability pact on Belgium after 1999 would,
without compensation, create huge political and popular disillusionment. Belgian
citizens would gag. The strain would rip the two halves of the country apart:
would Flemish bond-holders or Walloon welfare-recipients have priority?

<P> Yet even the immediate imposition of the Waigel pact would not rescue
Belgium's government bond market from the impact of Emu. A non-sovereign borrower
with a debt ratio of close to 130% would be likely to see a dramatic downgrading
of its debt. So Emu could mean financial collapse and political disintegration in
Belgium, with other Emu members suffering problems that differed only in degree.
If a stability pact had been in operation a generation ago, Europe's public debt
problems would not have existed and the loss of sovereign-borrower status through
Emu could have been contemplated with some equanimity. But a generation ago there
was no need for a stability pact: because governments apparently expected to
remain sovereign borrowers, the issue of debt was a monetary policy operation, a
reserve drain &#173; not a fiscal operation, financing the deficit.

<P> Are European politicians just kamikaze pilots? Or will they find an Emu
structure that works?

<P> One way for governments to get out of the financial trap might be to shift
their borrowing to the short end of the curve. The German government has already
beaten down Bundesbank opposition to the introduction of short-term instruments
(the official line is that this is to help Frankfurt as a financial centre, but
the steepness of the German yield curve and Bonn's budgetary difficulties are
other compelling reasons). Such tactics on a massive scale are one possibility
for Emu. At present, banks tend to regard short-term government debt as almost as
good as cash, because it is repo-able. But a general switch to short-term
borrowing would vastly increase the stock of cash-like assets in the economy. The
European Central Bank (ECB), if it guaranteed to maintain the interchangeability
of cash and short-term government paper, would be presiding over an extremely
inflationary situation.

<P> You could argue that this is nothing new: governments can issue long bonds
more cheaply than the private sector, because markets know that <I>in
extremis</I> the government <I>can</I> sell short-term paper to the commercial
banks which the central bank will convert into cash. That will still be true in
Emu. Or will it?

<P> There are two important differences. In a national monetary system, the issue
of short-term debt by a government is effectively interest-free if it is taken
up, via repos or whatever other means, by the central bank: it's like printing
money. The government has to pay interest to banks on the short-term debt it
sells, but if the banks offer that paper in repos the central bank expands the
size of its balance sheet. Its (interest-free) monetary liabilities increase, as
do its (interest-earning) claims. The central bank's profits, and its
profit-transfer to the government, increase &#173; the government is robbing
Peter to pay Paul. In Germany, the Bundesbank's profit-transfer to the government
has always been treated by the central bank as monetary financing of the
government deficit. But the same degree of openness is not evident in the
Bundesbank's accounting treatment of repos; when the repo system was first
instituted the bank showed repos against government paper as credit to the
government; as the stock of repos expanded this became the sin that dare not
speak its name, and the bank drew a veil over the question by reclassifying the
whole stock of repos as credit to the banking sector.

<P> In Emu, the right of money creation will no longer be the privilege of the
central bank (and ultimately the government) of the country issuing short-term
debt. Instead, the total money creation in the Emu system will be shared out
among national governments according to a weighting scheme based on GDP and
population. A government issuing short-term debt will still have to pay Paul (the
banks) but will get very little from Peter (the ECB) in return. Governments would
have to agree among themselves that they would all issue short-term debt and
divvy out the ill-gotten gains. In other words, they would have to behave, in
this respect, as though they were a single government. In the absence of
collusion, the bigger countries would have an advantage relative to the smaller
ones. One can see this intuitively: if Ireland formed a Maastricht monetary union
with Germany, the latter country's debt status would hardly be affected at all,
while the former's would be radically altered for the worse, even if the Irish
and German representatives on the ECB followed national instructions and had
equally-weighted votes.

<P> <B>Credit downgrade</B>

<P> It is not the independence of the ECB that will be so financially damaging
(many countries with independent central banks have triple-A rated government
debt). The danger comes instead from the fact that no individual government owns
the central bank. Maastricht tries to separate absolutely the fiscal function
from the monetary function &#173; something that is doomed to failure.

<P> The Bundesbank has apparently already been telling certain hedge funds that
it &#173; er, sorry, the ECB &#173; will impose its own debt-management rules on
Emu governments by refusing to repo the paper of all governments on equal terms.
This is perfectly consistent with Maastricht philosophy, according to which the
public sector is treated, in financial terms, exactly as if it were the private
sector. A government which was not behaving financially in the way the Bundesbank
&#173; er, sorry, the ECB &#173; thought appropriate would not get its short-term
paper repo'd any more than a financially wobbly private company would. This may
be consistent with Maastricht, but it is politically explosive, perhaps most of
all for France. It amounts to a takeover-bid by the ECB &#173; or Bundesbank
&#173; for fiscal control in Emu. It is one that cannot possibly succeed.

<P> The credit-standing of governments must deteriorate in Emu: that of big
Germany and thrifty Luxembourg least; that of small high-deficit countries most.
The position of Belgium would rapidly become extremely precarious.

<P> Yet Belgian politicians are desperate for Emu. The only plausible explanation
for this is one readily accepted by most Belgians: Emu is seen as inevitably
leading to a takeover of the country's debt by the Emu area as a whole. Former
European Commission president Jacques Delors was very blunt about this once he
had left office. He told a committee of the European parliament: "Emu means, for
instance, that the [European] Union acknowledges the debts of all those countries
that are in Emu." Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger implicitly expressed
the same view when he told a Brussels audience in January 1993 that the
Maastricht debt criterion did not matter, for Belgium at least.

<P> What would be the practicalities of a takeover? One can imagine a post-Emu
financial crisis coming to a head in Belgium. The Belgian government would tell
its partners the game was up &#173; there's no way it could do an Orange County.

<P> The way out through money creation is not feasible: Emu money supply would
have to expand massively for Belgium's share of the additional seignorage to make
any difference to its problems (and there would be fatal delays in the process).
Instead, the ECB would have to go out and buy Belgian bonds at prices the market
was unwilling to pay. If it wanted to sterilize the monetary impact of these
purchases it would have to issue its own paper. It would become the sovereign
borrower in the system, acting as a sort of European Monetary Fund or
Euro-treasury. And it would, like the IMF, issue instructions about future
government behaviour in fiscal and no doubt other areas, insisting on the strict
application of a Waigel 1% limit on deficits as a bare minimum.

<P> The ECB is, of course, completely unaccountable. The politicians would then
seize this opportunity to ram through an emergency amendment to the treaty that
would supposedly eliminate the democratic deficit by setting up a single Euroland
economic government.

<P> <B>A European economic government</B>

<P> The central bankers, the Bundesbank in particular, congratulated themselves
that in the Maastricht treaty they had fragmented the opposition (governments).
But they overplayed their hand. The risk of financial collapse inherent in the
treaty will lead either to the collapse of Emu or the creation of the
French-designed "European economic government" of which the Bundesbank, for all
its calls for political and economic parallelism in European integration, has
always lived in dread.

<P> Emu implies a communal debt takeover. That may or may not prove politically
acceptable if the only real debt outlier is Belgium. Belgium's debt, though huge
relative to its GDP, is small relative to the GDP of the country's likely Emu
partners.

<P> Taking on the Belgian debt might be viewed as a price worth paying by
Germany, which has always seen Belgium as part of its natural economic and
political zone. It might be similarly viewed by France if it led to the sort of
inter-governmental control over European economic and monetary policies that
French politicians and bureaucrats have always wanted.

<P> These arguments definitely do not apply to Italy. No-one in "hard core"
Europe, with the possible &#173; and admittedly weighty &#173; exception of
German chancellor Helmut Kohl is likely to view sharing the burden of Italy's
mountainous debt as a price worth paying. That need not be a disaster for Italy,
even in purely financial terms. Outside Emu, it would retain its monetary
sovereignty. There would be no need for the further fiscal austerity that
participation in Emu would imply. Italy could, in all financial respectability
and with no more risk of inflation than it bears at present, cock a snook at the
stability pact.

<P> It is ironic that the long-awaited installation of a government in Rome
&#173; which the markets, at least, are prepared to view as stable &#173; might
encourage the addition of Italy to a European political and economic system that
will exhibit, in aggravated form, all the structural faults of the old Italy. But
no-one has ever claimed that politics &#173; especially Europolitics &#173; is
easy to understand.

<H3> <B>Annington, Stagecoach to join securitisation bonanza</B>
</H3> 

 <P> 

<H4><B>ANNINGTON HOMES and Stagecoach plc will next week launch asset-backed bond issues totalling around &#163;1.3bn, underlining the rapidly growing importance of securitisation in Europe.</B></H4>

<P>
The two jumbo bond issues follows last week's plan announced by NatWest Markets to securitise $5bn of its corporate loan portfolio.

<P>
The Annington Homes issue will come first, perhaps as early as Tuesday. Launched via special purpose vehicle Annington Securities, the &#163;863m bond will partly finance the &#163;1.66bn purchase of 58,000 homes from the UK's ministry of defence by Annington, a Nomura-led consortium. 

<P>
The balance of debt is provided by loan facilities arranged by Abbey National Treasury Services and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

<P>
The bond will be backed by the rental stream of homes occupied by service personnel; the ultimate credit is that of the UK government. Largely as a result, the issue should be rated triple-A by Duff &amp; Phelps and Moody's and carry a 20% risk weighting for capital adequacy purposes.

<P>
Precise details have not been decided and joint leads HSBC and Nomura would not comment, but the Annington issue looks set to be divided into three tranches. 

<P>
The floating-rate element of around &#163;330m five-year average life notes will be sold at a margin of around Libor plus 6.25bp. Two fixed-rate bonds will be sold: &#163;173m of 15-year bonds with amortisation from year 10; and &#163;360m of 25-year bonds that amortise from year 15. 

<P>
Both bonds will carry margins in the low 30s over the 9% 2008 Gilt and 8.3% 2017 Gilt respectively. 

<P>
The UBS-led Stagecoach issue will follow later in the week and is notable for financing the purchase of rolling stock company Porterbrook by the acquisitive Stagecoach. 

<P>
Like Annington, it is supported by the UK government's credit. The secretary of state for transport undertakes to pay 80% of the rental income due from 16 train operating companies.

<P>
This cashflow will back between &#163;435m and &#163;445m of bonds issued by the first special purpose vehicle. Final modelling is not complete, but the issue is likely to be divided into around five tranches. 

<P>
The bonds are expected to be rated triple-A, again by Moody's and Duff &amp; Phelps, and will carry a 20% risk weighting. 

<P>
A second special purpose vehicle will sell around &#163;100m of bonds backed by the unguaranteed portion of the cashflow. That will be divided into two tranches, one rated triple-A with a triple-B subordinated tranche.

<P>
Pricing details are not available, but margins will start at a few basis points over Libor for the shortest-dated tranche of around one-year average life.

<P>
* <B>AT&amp;T Capital</B> will also add to the international securitisation bonanza next week with a $3.1bn bond issue backed by equipment leases. Goldman Sachs and Nomura are to jointly lead manage the global offering, which will <BR>
be issued by Capita Equipment Receivables Trust 1996-1 and will be divided into around five tranches -- one floating, the others fixed. &#009;*

<P>

Tim Goode, group treasurer and director, Treasury and Capital Markets at the Royal Bank of Scotland is leaving to become treasurer at <B>Halifax</B>, the building society that will shortly become a bank.

<H3>Doubts surface as German states prepare jumbo bond </H3>
<BR>
<H4>A GROUP of up to seven German states will shortly issue a DM4bn bond
to increase liquidity in their debt, attract international investors and
lower funding costs.</H4>


A host of domestic and foreign banks are manoeuvring to land the prestigious
mandate, which could mark an important step forward in German state financing.
<BR>
<BR>
But a number of institutions already privately express doubts about the
concept. In particular, they cite potential problems over perceptions of
credit of the different states involved in the transaction, together with
uncertainties over the nature of the bidding process. <BR>
<BR>
These problems may be aggravated by the relatively tight timetable involved.
The participating states are meeting on Monday (August 5) to discuss the
bids and aim to award the mandate by Tuesday or Wednesday. The bond will
be launched the following week (beginning August 12). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The market is friendly and we want to take advantage of that,&quot;
said Georg Schwarz, head of debt management at Rheinland-Pfalz, one of the
states involved. <BR>
<BR>
He says the issue, known as Landesschatzanweisungen no 1, is a sensible
step forward and will be the first of a series. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If every state makes its own issue the volume involved is too small
to get liquidity,&quot; says Schwarz. &quot;With this we hope to make it
more attractive to buy our bonds, especially for foreign investors. It's
a simple idea.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
According to its proponents, the grouped bond issue should be seen in the
light of market globalisation, and increasing competition for capital, especially
after the imminent introduction of the Euro. <BR>
<BR>
The recent, highly public, launch of the jumbo Pfandbrief market in Germany
provides a close template for meeting such challenges, said observers. The
seven states involved in the jumbo state bond project are Berlin, Hamburg,
Hessen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Sachsen-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein.
<BR>
<BR>
Each of the states will subscribe for a portion of the bonds, with Nordrhein-Westfalen
likely taking DM1bn and the other six DM500m each. <BR>
<BR>
The bond is not a joint and several liability; instead each state assumes
<I>pro-rata</I> liability for debt. If one of the states were to default
then the principal and interest returned to the investor would be reduced
by the percentage attributable to that state. <BR>
<BR>
Frankfurt observers said that structure might lead to investors focusing
on the weakest credit in the group of seven states. <BR>
<BR>
That argument is superficial, claims Rheinland-Pfalz's Schwarz, as it ignores
the workings of the federal financial system. <BR>
<BR>
The <I>Ausgleich</I> mechanism ensures that tax revenues are distributed
from richer to poorer states -- so effectively that the states' per capita
revenue ranged from 95% of the federal average to 103.5% during 1995. That
compared to a pre-redistribution band stretching from 43.7% to 118.7%. <BR>
<BR>
Further protection was offered by additional provisions which allowed the
federal government to make special grants to states which face exceptional
burdens. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There should be no differences concerning the creditworthiness of
the various states,&quot; argued Schwarz. <BR>
<BR>
That view is not shared by everyone. Rating agencies and at least some investors
have differentiated between the credit of different states. <BR>
<BR>
Standard &amp; Poor's has rated the long-term debt of four states, and while
three are at AAA, that of Nordrhein-Westfalen is rated AA+. <BR>
<BR>
Moody's Investors Service has not directly rated any states, but the varying
levels of ratings it has given to state-owned Landesbanks implies that it
also believes that the creditworthiness of one state can be distinguished
from its neighbour. <BR>
<BR>
Sponsors of the new issue are not seeking a rating, but observers believe
that at least one unsolicited rating is a strong possibility. <BR>
<BR>
Differing signals of credit standings are also given off by the bond markets
where issues from certain issuers command premiums. (The most sought-after
states, Bayern and Baden W&uuml;rttemberg, are noticeably absent, preferring
to borrow in their own names.) <BR>
<BR>
Bankers believe differing perceptions of credit quality may cloud the pricing
process. Schwarz said the states wanted to slim down spreads of up to 25bp
over Bunds currently paid on their debt. <BR>
<BR>
Spread talk in Frankfurt on Thursday was vague, but one banker said an appropriate
level for the issue was at between 10bp and 12bp over Bunds at the seven-year
mark and 15bp over at the 10-year level. <BR>
<BR>
A DM500 10-year bond for Bayern was launched at a margin of 17bp this week.
<BR>
<BR>
At least some of the states are believed to prefer 10-year paper, although
banks may push them towards issuing at seven years (critics claim banks
are attempting to earmark the 10-year slot for the imminent arrival of triple-A
rated French social security refinancing agency Cades, a market debutant).
<BR>
<BR>
Some argue that the way the deal has emerged has compounded confusion over
the shape and price of the issue, and counsel delay. <BR>
<BR>
In the absence of a central co-ordinator, banks have established contact
with one or more of the states, lending them only a partial view of the
whole process. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers are also unsure as to how the individual preferences of the states
will be accommodated. <BR>
<BR>
Rheinland-Pfalz's Schwarz stresses that the process will be &quot;rational,
and based on competition,&quot; but regional links may prove hard to cast
aside. In particular, it would be hard to ignore the claims of Landesbanks
and banks with particularly strong links to state governments. <BR>
<BR>
By last night (Thursday), it was unclear whether bidding banks would form
themselves into competing groups for the bidding process or would instead
be marshalled into a consortium shaped by the preferences of the states.
<BR>
<BR>
What looks probable is that the issue, when it emerges, will be led by at
least four -- maybe as many as six -- bookrunners. <BR>
<BR>
What no one doubts is the importance of the exercise. Said one banker: &quot;This
issue needs to be successful as a failure could have a negative implication
on the market reception and the funding opportunities of all the German
states, regardless of whether they are included in the project or not. <BR>

<BR>
INTERNATIONAL markets largely continued to languish in holiday torpor this
week with new issuance and placement activity down to a minimum in virtually
all sectors. <BR>
<BR>
Against such a background a $6bn FRN/loan financing for Mexico, led by JP
Morgan and SBC Warburg, naturally shone all the brighter. <BR>
<BR>
The deal looked a success for the borrower, restoring market credibility
and saving some $125m in funding costs, but it attracted some controversy,
principally in relation to small allocations. <BR>
<BR>
Asian markets threw up a crop of the most interesting deals with Morgan
Stanley launching a $200m revenue bond for Zhuhai Highway. <BR>
<BR>
The deal was certainly the first non-recourse project financing in China,
probably in the whole of Asia, but others will likely follow. <BR>
<BR>
Securitisation, a linked discipline, took another step forward with the
launch of a $250 car loan-backed financing for Thai Cars. <BR>
<BR>
The issue was the first from Thailand and will be followed shortly by a
$220m car loan-backed debut for Indonesia's PT Astra. <BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere, Reliance's 50-year, put 30-year bond represented the longest
money an Indian corporate had yet achieved in the Yankee or any international
market. <BR>
<BR>
Although the DM market remained quiet in terms of new issuance, an unusually
interesting pipeline began to build with deals for Cades, South Africa and
a grouping of up to seven German states in the offing. <BR>
<BR>
The latter bond, of up to DM4bn in size, is a bold step to generate liquidity
and, possibly, international interest, but has already generated a degree
of scepticism as to its prospects. <BR>

<H3>
Italy floats to perfection 
</H3>

SPECULATION on the refinancing of Italy's recently called $2bn 1998 FRN
ended this week with the launch of a new $2bn five-year global floater for
the republic. <BR>
<BR>
The issue, led jointly by Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, was a lesson
in how to execute the perfect floater. The $2bn issue was oversubscribed
and fully distributed in 24 hours at the re-offer spread to a wide range
of accounts in all three centres. <BR>
<BR>
Another example of the textbook FRN was the NationsBank $500m six-year bond
led by Merrill Lynch. Increased from its initially indicated size of $400m,
the deal sold easily at the re-offer spread, tightening to a basis point
inside by the close of the week. <BR>
<BR>
Next week's calendar for the sector includes a $200m five-year FRN for the
French finance company Compagnie Parisienne de R&eacute;escompte at a spread
in the high teens over Libor. <BR>
<BR>
Taking advantage of the dearth of FRN supply in sterling, Bankers Trust
made its first appearance in the sector with a &#163;200m five-year FRN
at 14.2bp over Libor. Next on the agenda is a five-year FRN for CCCI at
13bp to 14bp over. BZW is said to have the mandate. <BR>
<BR>
Bidding is in progress for a straight sterling bond for JFM in 10 years
and the Halifax is rumoured to be seeking &#163;200m to &#163;500m of 10-year
subordinated funds. <BR>
<BR>
Demand in the Deutschmark market remains very quiet, providing a nervous
background for the launch of the jumbo global Pfandbrief for Rheinhyp and
a debut Eurobond for Bankgesellschaft Berlin (BGB). <BR>
<BR>
Both issuers are said to favour the five-year area. Rheinhyp is expected
to pay in the region of 25bp to 28bp over for its DM2bn funding and BGB
a couple of basis points in excess of that. <BR>
<BR>
Spread tightening in five-year straight dollars encouraged L-Bank to launch
a $500m benchmark transaction at 16bp over. More supply can be expected
in this maturity. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile ABN AMRO is rumoured to be considering a $750m global 10-year
subordinated bond via ABN AMRO and Salomon Brothers.<B> <BR>

<H3>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER </H3>
<H4>Boom-bang-a-bang - the great Euro contest Jean-Claude Komarovsky
watches in horror as a severe lapse of taste seizes the Euromarket. There's
singing, there's dancing, there's also a bottom line </H4>
JJ Ingersoll, our head of global focus, has just had a wonderful idea. Our
chairman came down and made him a huge bet that he couldn't think of a trade
that would return the firm to profitability in the second quarter. What
a bet! <BR>
<BR>
He chose the right person. JJ is no shoeshine-boy from the Midwest. The
great JJ spat on his shoe, twanged a brace, then got out his dick and swung
it. <BR>
<BR>
Eighteen, maybe 19 seconds later, JJ said, &quot;Heh, maybe we should sponsor
a contest.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even I thought this a bit wild. But JJ continued as if thinking on the spot
and not knowing what would come out next. &quot;... Yes, a Eurovision Bond
Contest. All the nations of Europe will put forward their best Eurobonds,
singing on air.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The floor eagerly listened to what 24 years of global focus could bring
to bear on an insoluble problem like the firm's second quarter profits.
The younger traders went crazy. YEHHH, A CONTEST they were shouting. BUT
WHAT'S THE PRIZE MAN? MAN, LIKE, YEHHH, WHAT'S THE WINNER'S REMUNERATION?
<BR>
<BR>
JJ looked into the eye of the needle - the trading floor. &quot;The
winner,&quot; he began, &quot;will effortlessly qualify for European monetary
union even if its budget deficit exceeds 3% of GDP.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When I point out France can't lose, Jacques Chirac (no relation) our global
head of bond couture, scowls at me. We begin faxing national treasuries
to send us the best Euro they have. <BR>
<BR>
So here we are in Dublin. Seventy television channels are tuned in live.
The bonds are resting in their specially prepared pods ready for launching
out of nearby windows. And our host, the ever-affable Ren&eacute; Karkrazy,
is getting ready for his big entrance, in a huge blue Cadillac convertible
with a random circle of 12 or so yellow stars on the bonnet, and a spare
Ecu convertible in the boot in case he breaks down. <BR>
<BR>
Then he's out, tightening - despite the advice of his lead-managers
- his trousers. &quot;Dames et Herren, basis points und fixed price
re-offers, welcome to this the first Eurovision Bond Contest. Our contestants
have travelled far. Some have issued wide. But all will be judged on their
aftermarket performance by a selection of banks, all of which have committed
to make markets in each of the issues for at least a month after they are
free to trade.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
APPLAUSE. Rapture. No one can believe the banks will make markets for at
least a month! Then, silence, because behind Ren&eacute; a huge scoreboard
descends, displaying a map of Europe and a graph ranging from three to 60,
with many countries, especially Belgium and Italy going off the scale. <BR>
<BR>
As is customary, France goes first, with its latest hearthrob, Jean-Luc
Cades, who wanders onto the stage bristling with designer stubble, looking
like he's on more welfare than the country can afford. The music begins,
a doleful number, &quot;Je t'adore le Cr&eacute;dit Foncier. C'est triste,
c'est triste. Mais je deteste le Moody's and aussi le Standard &amp; Poor's.
Downgradez votre mothers ...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The audience love it. There's even a young girl in the front row holding
a sign saying, &quot;I'll participate in your syndicated loan too&quot;,
and throwing her commitment fee onto the stage. Ren&eacute; rushes on before
there's a teen riot. <BR>
<BR>
He's followed by Italy. And that means Vincenzo La Doria emerging stage
east, and singing the House of the Rising Sun, flanked by two dancing sumo
wrestlers, and paper which is yen denominated falling over the audience
like confetti, seasoned with sake just as the Nippon postal fund likes it.
 <BR>
<BR>
Next, the ever popular Swedish entry gets into its swing with its riveting
and catchy chorus, &quot;More, more, more&quot;, followed by a verse which
goes, &quot;More, more, more&quot;, and then repeats the chorus twice until
the arbitrage and the league-table position just isn't there anymore. For
their finale a viking longship sails across the stage and a Japanese securities
house is ceremonially raped and pillaged in the name of sub-Libor funding.
<BR>
<BR>
The ever plucky Belgians are next with a rasping number called Launched
in Luxembourg Time. &quot;Double taxation treaties - I've seen a few...But
over here, who really needs them...&quot; and as the audience starts to
sway the crescendo rolls in to great acclaim, &quot;I Dentist My Way.&quot;
<br>
<b>
Blowout. <BR>
</b>
<BR>
Finland's representative Kari Kantilau sings a touching love song, &quot;Morag
Stanley&quot;, about an investment bank lead-managing an issue amid a chaos
of fjords and ice maidens somewhere near Canary Wharf. <BR>
<BR>
The Hellenic Republic then breaks a few plates - in frustrated desperation
- hopelessly aware that even a bank as unprincipled as ours couldn't
allow them into the first stage of monetary union, even if they won the
contest with their innovative Nana Mouskouri bonds. <BR>
<BR>
Seventeen acts later the Swiss in the audience are getting bored and ask
when they can buy GECC... <BR>
<BR>
The final two competitors don't help. The Germans field the least inspired
entry of the evening, &quot;Der Jumbo Pfandbrief&quot;, a number beginning,
&quot;I left my heart on a 10b5 to San Francisco&quot;. Strangely they rejected
the more alluring song cycle, &quot;Die sch&ouml;ne Gabriele M&uuml;llerin&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile the UK doesn't care either way and enters a floating rate note
singing an Elizabethan ditty, &quot;O! for the Beef of Old England&quot;.
The audience whistles for more as a guilty repo with zero principals strips
before their eyes. <BR>
<BR>
Then Ren&eacute; is back, ready to adjudicate the scores. During the contest
he's launched 14 deals in 16 currencies, all through swap arbitrage windows
located near the rear of the building. &quot;Monsieurs et Signoritas, negotiated
and competitive bids, it is now time to call each of our regional sales
centres... Bonjour, guten Tag, hello Luxembourg...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A series of political syndicates later, the deciding vote is due to come
in. &quot;Hello, Frankfurt. What is the vote of the Finanzplatz, danke,
bitte.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hello, Dublin,&quot; says Hilmar Koppout. &quot;The German Geleitzug
has made its decision: Michael Dobson.&quot; Down the telephone line the
audience can hear the German panel laugh at their piercing humour. &quot;Sorry,
ve could not resist... Our votes are as follows. Un point, Turkey. Trois
points, Belgium. F&uuml;nf points Ireland, seven for Iceland and dix points
... Norvege.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It's all over. Norway has won the inaugural Palme de Maastricht. The applause
of the audience is muted because Norway isn't in the EU anyway so it can't
qualify for Emu. The best it can do is asset-swap the award with Belgium.
A lucrative trade, I think, and JJ is already on the phone to Hoomf van
Wallonnia, probably realizing as I do that this could return the firm to
profitability.<p>

<P>

A successful appearance in the 10-year sector by the World Bank endorsed bankers'
positive bias toward the longer end of the market and generated further rumours
about potential 10-year supply.

<P>

Oversubscription for the World Bank's 13th global bond enabled joint leads
Merrill Lynch and SBC Warburg to price the issue at 18 over, the tight end of the
18bp-20bp range, and secure spread tightening to 16.5bp over bid at Thursday's
close.

<P>

Canada could soon launch a $1bn 10-year global bond. A mandate should be awarded
imminently with the launch as early as next Tuesday, following the FOMC meeting
in the US. Price talk on a 2006 Canada is 28bp-30bp over Treasuries. Fannie Mae
is also a likely candidate for a $500m-$1bn global 10 year.

<P>

Kansai International Airport is expected shortly with a $210m 10 year at 28bp to
29bp over with either IBJ or Tokyo-Mitsubishi to have the mandate. Other Japanese
government-guaranteed issuers looking to tap the 10-year area include City of
Yokohama ($250m), JFM (could possibly tap the Sfr market), MetroTokyo and Japan
Finance Corp for Small Businesses, which could make its dollar debut in September
with a $200m transaction.

<P>

Bankgesellschaft Berlin finally kicked off its EMTN programme with a $500m
five-year bond; elsewhere, demand for higher-yielding DM paper was again
demonstrated this week, first by the resounding if surprising success of
Commerz's DM500m four-year issue for Turkey, and by Mexico's follow-up to its
well-received $6bn floater, a DM1bn five year led by Dresdner KB. Argentina may
take advantage of this sentiment, with a 10-year plus transaction possible, and
CSFB or Deutsche likely to contest the bookrunner's slot.

<P>

Elsewhere the Republic of Tunisia is considering tapping either the Yankee or
Samurai bond markets.

<H3> <B>Opinions split as German states jumbo causes storm</B>
</H3> 
<P>

<H4><B>SEVEN GERMAN states duly launched a new type of grouped borrowing this week --
one they hope will be the first of a series of similar jumbo transactions. The
DM4bn 10-year issue was, however, controversial right up to its launch with
bankers claiming the issue had got the states off to a false start and had
antagonised large sections of the banking community.</B></H4>

"It was pretty messy," was the response of one Frankfurt banker. "No bookrunner
made money on this issue." Criticisms centred around the handling of the deal,
with banks involved in the transaction at all levels claiming a lack of
information from inception right up to pricing.

<P> "There was a real communication problem," said one syndicate official. "Every
two days we had to go back to our customers with revised information."

<P> "It was not a good start to the process of the <I>L&auml;nder </I>issuing
collectively," said another banker. "We will have to go back to the issuers and
explain where they went wrong."

<P> Other bankers, although critical of the deal's handling, highlighted some of
the positive results of the debut issue, pointing out that the states had been
proven right in judging that there was demand for the concept of a grouped
borrowing.

<P> "There was more than enough interest, there has been turnover in the bond and
the spread was OK," said one.

<P> "We sold our position very easily," said another. "It was a good product, the
size helped and it was exactly the right part of the curve."

<P> For their part, the states proclaimed themselves happy with the exercise.
"The conditions were fair and we had positive feedback, especially from
foreigners," said Georg Schwarz, head of debt management at the finance ministry
of Rheinland-Pfalz.

<P> The issue, known as <I>L&auml;nderschatzanweisung</I> no 1, grouped
borrowings from seven states to create an instrument aiming to guarantee
liquidity to investors (see EW464 and EW465 for background).

<P> The syndicate structure of 10 bookrunners and nine co-lead managers was
finalised on Thursday evening (August 8), with pricing the following Monday
(August 12). The confusion and controversy that had surrounded the project since
its start continued right to the end.

<P> The bonds were priced at 17bp over, having been whittled down from talk of
16bp-19bp in the preceding week. That was slightly too tight for investors
looking at the bonds on a spread-to-Bunds basis, said bankers, but only by 1bp or
so.

<P> The states had always made attracting international investors one of their
priorities in fashioning the jumbo issue -- and bankers reported this objective
was at least achieved.

<P> Critics argued, however, that the structure which was eventually adopted
highlighted the tensions between domestic and international new issue procedures.

<P> Pricing on a spread to Bunds made it easier to sell to international
investors in theory, but could have made price comparisons difficult for domestic
investors used to valuing deals in relation to <I>Schuldschein</I> levels.

<P> According to one banker, the jumbo was eventually priced at
<I>Schuldscheine</I> less 8bp, or <I>Pfandbriefe </I>minus 10bp or 11bp.

<P> Banks' domestic debt desks reported that German investors saw value at
<I>Schuldscheine</I> minus 3bp or 4bp, which was approximately the level a spread
of 17bp over Bunds had equated to in the previous week. (The relationship was
skewed in the meantime by a shift of around 5bp in the Bund/ <I>Pfandbriefe
</I>differential.)

<P> "That was a difficulty," said one banker. "I would guess that nobody made
domestic sales at that level." Bankers said German investors proved willing to
bite only when the spread moved out to 18bp or 19bp. The spread continues to
wobble, but late Thursday was trading at 17bp over.

<P> The <I>Schuldschein</I> comparison was not the only one that proved
problematical. Banks allocated bonds to international accounts on the ISMA yield
basis only to find, shortly before pricing, that the states insisted on using the
domestic form of yield calculation and benchmark fixing, rather than using the
Euromarket convention.

<P> "We owned the bonds at 99.723," said one banker, "But investors were calling
us and insisting that they got bonds at 99.68 (which would give 17bp over Bunds
on an ISMA basis). We lost money straight away."

<P> As part of their bookrunner status, banks had to guarantee to make a market
for blocks of DM25m at a 10bp spread. Some had expressed worries that this would
translate into a requirement to guarantee liquidity for other market makers,
rather than clients. That fear was at least partially realised.

<P> Although there was no general wave of selling -- even from the co-lead
manager group --  a number of bankers pointed to one large seller from among the
ranks of domestic bookrunners. "We were hit twice on our bid for DM25m within a
minute of launch," said one syndicate official.

<P> Critics said that behaviour was an inevitable result of the lack of
sponsorship associated with having 10 bookrunners. Rheinland-Pfalz's Schwarz said
the bookrunner structure was necessary to accommodate relationship banks in the
debut structure.

<H3> SLOVENIA </H3>


<H2> <B>Self-starter is falling behind</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Slovenia was in economic
pole position in eastern Europe when communism collapsed in 1990. But it has now
fallen behind its neighbours, held back by lack of investment and political
uncertainty in the former Yugoslavia. Many companies are 60% owned by management
and employees, and often do not welcome outside investors. The investment
companies formed to buy into privatization have disappointed, with few taking a
positive approach. This could be starving Slovenia of much-needed funds. Gavin
Gray reports</B> </H4> 

<P> Slovenia is the most developed economy in eastern Europe, and provides
perhaps the most interesting test of whether the region's industry can reorganize
to survive the rigours of the free market. Unlike the rest of eastern Europe,
Slovenia rejected the notion that multinational investment was a prerequisite for
restructuring. Instead, employees and management were allowed to decide how their
companies were privatized, and were allocated shares at big discounts. The
government believed that restructuring and recapitalization should take place in
the secondary market &#173; with the employees and other domestic shareholders
playing the leading role.

<P> Yet the scheme remains incomplete, two and a half years after its formal
launch. Evidence is growing that it was over-ambitious and that the after-effects
could stifle growth, which fell from 5% in 1994 to 3.5% in 1995.

<P> The decision to put employees at the centre of privatization reflects
Slovenia's inheritance. The 1,500 factories being sold were not state-owned under
communism; they operated instead under the Yugoslav system of self-management,
which gave employees and management free rein in deciding how they were run. Many
Slovenian companies obtained western technology through licensing agreements in
the 1970s and 1980s, and by the end of the 1980s the EU was already the Slovenian
republic's main export market. Most companies had marketing departments and a
finance function &#173; notions unheard of in the rest of eastern Europe. All
this engendered a spirit of free enterprise and understanding of consumer needs
that was wholly absent in the rest of eastern Europe at the fall of communism. It
meant that Slovenian companies were in theory the best placed of all in the
region to survive without foreign partners.

<P> These advantages were eroded during the first half of the 1990s because most
companies ceased investing: partly because of the uncertainties created by the
break-up of Yugoslavia and partly because of the sudden loss of markets at
independence in 1991. Past success bred complacency among Slovenian companies
while rapid restructuring in the rest of eastern Europe &#173; pinning its future
on exporting a similar range of products to the EU &#173; eroded their
competitive position. The terms of trade worsened between 1993 and 1995 when the
tolar appreciated nearly 30% in real terms against the dollar. Slovenia's average
wage of just under $535 per month (nearly double Hungary's or the Czech
Republic's), combined with employer social security contributions of 100%, made
life particularly difficult for labour-intensive industries.

<P> In the first half of the 1990s there was also a confusing debate about the
best way to conduct privatization. Managers and employees lobbied for total
control, but the privatization law that resulted from two years of bitter
argument was a compromise that gave all Slovenians a chance to buy shares. The
scheme relied on vouchers given free of charge to everyone, including children,
with face value indexed to age. Employees and their families could use them to
buy into companies where they worked. Vouchers could also be invested in voucher
investment funds or used to purchase shares in the 100-plus companies that opted
for public share issues as part of their privatization programmes. Implementation
was delayed several times, but by mid-1996 virtually all companies had either
completed the process or had nearly done so.

<P> A handful of companies have pressed ahead with modernization. Leading the way
is Krka, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer with sales of $300 million in 1995.
According to deputy chief executive Joze Colaric, Krka maintained its investment
programme despite the distractions of the first half of the 1990s. Its aim was to
cement its position in its core market &#173; the former USSR and other eastern
European markets &#173; by restructuring and developing its sales force in those
areas. It is planning to move a step further by opening production facilities in
countries where it has big export sales. Next year it will open a greenfield
production and packaging plant in Poland costing $10 million, to be followed by
similar investments in the Czech Republic and Croatia.

<P> Krka's share structure post-privatization is typical of larger Slovenian
companies. Management and employees own 23.6%, while other individual investors
bought 33.4% through a public share issue. Investment funds were allotted 40.25%
and the remaining shares are controlled by suppliers. There is already
grey-market trading in Krka shares, which should be listed on the Ljubljana Stock
Exchange later this year or in early 1997.

<P> Krka is one of more than 100 large companies that completed public share
issues as part of privatization &#173; and which will eventually be listed on the
stock exchange or be traded over the counter. Kolinska, a food processor, was the
first to be listed and another 10 companies followed its lead. These companies
seem to have continued to operate as they did under socialism, with management
remaining uneasy about outside shareholders.

<P> Typical of this approach is Mercator, Slovenia's leading supermarket chain,
which has a group turnover of more than $1 billion. It sold 60% of its stock
through a public offering in exchange for vouchers and had just over 60,000
shareholders at privatization. Its shares are exchange-traded and have risen from
Tr900 ($7.50) to over Tr5,000. "They have to be considered by any international
investor looking at Slovenia. It is a big company and retail trade is important
here," says Gregor Kastelic, analyst at Banka Creditanstalt in Ljubljana.

<P> But Mercator has problems. Its stores are dowdy and its goods predominantly
domestically produced &#173; many by its subsidiaries. It needs to invest heavily
to fend off competition from the large number of private shops that have opened
in the past five years &#173; or indeed to win back the custom of Slovenians who
drive to Austria or Italy to buy their groceries. This year, Mercator has
improved efficiency by rationalizing its trading divisions, but how it intends to
modernize is not publicly known. "It is very hard to get information &#173;
management do not like talking about their strategic plans," says Kastelic. "This
is quite typical of Slovenian companies, although things are better than they
were a year ago."

<P> <B>Deterrents</B>

<P> The reluctance to reveal information is one of several features of Slovenian
companies that have deterred foreign portfolio investors. Observers warn that
since domestic investors are likely to be net sellers of stock over the coming
years, industry could be starved of capital. "Some Slovenian companies have been
paying extremely high dividends instead of investing, and they could run into
liquidity problems," says Leonardo Peklar, general manager of consultancy company
Socius. "Their dividend policy should not jeopardize the future of the company.
Dividends should be within the margins of free cashflow: the difference between
net income of the company and necessary investments."

<P> Another turn-off for foreign investors is gaps in Slovenian legislation.
There are no rules on mergers and takeovers; a law on this was promised in 1994
but has been continually delayed. Some companies, such as pharmaceuticals maker
Lek, have reacted by amending their statutes to place a cap on the maximum vote
of any one shareholder.

<P> Worst of all, it is not even clear whether foreign portfolio investors can
repatriate earnings: Slovenia's foreign investment legislation dates to 1988 and
was drawn up with direct investors in mind. This issue is the responsibility of
the central bank &#173; in public it praises free markets but in private it
brands foreign portfolio investment as a threat to sovereignty.

<P> In the seven years since the stock exchange opened, there has been only one
attempt to attract foreign portfolio investment and only one rights issue. In
late 1994, SKB Banka, Slovenia's largest private bank, raised new capital through
a share issue that brought in the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and western portfolio investors. The shares trade offshore in the
form of depositary receipts issued by Merrill Lynch.

<P> Although analysts expect larger companies to become more investor-friendly
when they realize they can raise new capital on the stock exchange, most are
likely to rely on debt finance for immediate needs. Many companies entered the
private sector with no debt at all or low gearing. With inflation below 10%,
domestic bank loans are much cheaper than they were two years ago, while
Slovenia's single-A long-term debt rating means the largest corporates can borrow
abroad at less than 100 basis points over Libor. Mercator and Petrol, the
Slovenian oil distribution company, have held talks about issuing bonds.

<P> There are much bigger problems for the small and medium-sized companies which
make up most of Slovenian industry. Most have had no public share issue and
management and employees control 60% of the stock, which they paid for partly
with vouchers and partly with cash (they were allowed to buy shares at a 50%
discount to face value by instalments over five years). Most companies have
shareholder agreements whereby management and employees elect a proxy before the
general meeting and vote their combined 60% stake as one block. In practice, this
makes management power near absolute. Of the remaining stock in any particular
company, 10% is held by a state restitution fund, 10% by the state pension fund
and 20% by private investment funds, which collected vouchers. These passive
investors are natural sellers of stock. The restitution fund needs to service
bonds issued to the owners of properties nationalized after World War II. The
pension fund has said it intends to reduce its portfolio from over 1,500
companies to hundreds. The private voucher funds inherited abnormally diverse
portfolios they want to slim down, and they need cash to pay their costs and earn
their fees.

<P> According to Socius's Peklar, these companies' greatest immediate need is
simply basic administrative know-how: "They need to have an appropriate structure
for their supervisory boards, with experts who would complement the knowledge and
experience available within the company. Such a supervisory board could put
reasonable pressure on management, rather than friends of the general manager."

<P> In theory, private investment funds should do part of this. But they
constitute the most controversial aspect of privatization and are a
disappointment for government and ordinary Slovenians alike. Some 1.2 million
people &#173; 60% of the population &#173; opted to entrust all or part of their
certificates to funds run by 20-plus management companies with a combined book
value of Tr250 billion. Two years after the first marketing campaigns, the funds
still have teething problems. They were due to be allocated shares through
auctions, but these were botched and most funds are still capitalized mainly by
vouchers rather than equity.

<P> <B>Voucher funds short-changed</B>

<P> This problem will not go away, because bankruptcies over the past three years
have wiped out $1 billion of equity that was due to be allocated to vouchers. The
funds have lobbied to be allocated the government's stakes in the two largest
banks, Nova Ljubljanska Banka and Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor, and in public
utilities such as telecoms. The government, however, would prefer to sell these
shares for cash. Most funds now expect that they will be exchange-listed in late
1997 or 1998 at the earliest. Analysts are predicting that they will open for
trading at big discounts to book value, while the original investors &#173;
dominated by pensioners, the unemployed and the poor &#173; are furious that the
process is taking so long.

<P> "The funds in Slovenia are not like those in the west, because they have a
huge number of securities that are not listed anywhere," says Peklar. "The funds
which restructure their portfolios and start to act as consulting companies and
provide know-how will be much more successful than those that push for high
dividends or launch lawsuits."

<P> The funds have liquidity problems and managements think they hinder rather
than help restructuring. The law requires 75% of shareholders to be in favour of
a capital increase, and investment, pension and restitution funds have
successfully blocked attempts to carry out rights issues.

<P> One of the few management companies to have restructured its portfolio is
Aktiva Avant, which was established by a local trading company and Vienna-based
investment bank EPIC. Aktiva set up three funds with a combined book value of
Dm140 million ($95 million). Aktiva director Ales Okorn says these funds acquired
stakes in 35 companies: three have been sold for cash; the stakes in four
companies have been consolidated; and four have been sold by swapping equity with
the state pension fund or other private investment funds. Aktiva has also
initiated the restructuring of a smaller company in its portfolio, a
Ljubljana-based firm that trades optical equipment. "We increased our stake from
20% to 51% by buying out the other funds and acquiring some shares from the
employees," says Okorn. "We changed the management and the company has been
reorganized. Since then, sales have risen 70% and profits are up 300%. We hope to
repeat this at one of the larger companies in which we have a stake."

<H3> Activity remains high as Russia debut steals show </H3> 


<P> THE hectic pace of new
issuance continued in the international markets this week as, despite fears in
Europe especially that the market has reached its top, borrowers continued to
come to the markets in droves. Almost $13bn was issued in just four days, across
a broad range of currencies.

<P> One deal stood out above all others -- Russia's first overseas financing
since 1917. Bankers had been expecting a blow-out deal following the
unprecedented level of interest shown in the roadshow, but most were still taken
aback by the scale of demand which allowed lead managers JP Morgan and SBC
Warburg to bring $1bn of five-year paper to the market.

<P> The achievement was greater still for the 345bp over Treasuries level at
which Russia was able to fund, under the 350bp threshold that many bankers
thought would be the minimum necessary to guarantee the deal's successful
placement.

<P> Russia's was not the only stand-out emerging market deal this week. The
Republic of Turkey launched a universally-praised DM750m five-year offering via
Commerzbank and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. In just two days after launch, the
bonds tightened by around 13bp from their 280bp over Bunds launch spread.

<P> Deal of the week in the dollar sector was the $300m five-year deal for
Japan's NTT, lead managed by ABN AMRO and JP Morgan. Issued at 11bp over
Treasuries, the spread quickly tightened in to just 5bp over as the bonds found a
widespread distribution among institutional and retail investors. And the
combination of a rare sovereign name and 10-year dollars meant OKB's $500m
offering via Goldman was well placed.

<P> The $100m perpetual floating-rate note for Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay via JP
Morgan was notable for the fact that it was the first-ever upper tier 2 public
capital raising for a Portuguese bank.

<P> Pricing for the Japan Development Bank's return to the Euroyen sector for the
first time since 1992 via Nomura was said by syndicate members to be spot on.

<P> The borrower had turned down funding proposals in both Deutschmarks and
dollars due to the recent dearth of jumbo Euroyen supply and because of a desire
to set a new benchmark in its home currency. The bonds were sold to a broad and
international group of investors.

<P> With the French franc market at high levels NordLB's Ffr1.5bn deal struggled,
but L-Bank and the EIB showed again the demand for the new Tec-10 linked product
with their respective Ffr1bn and Ffr1.5bn offerings.

<P> In Deutschmarks, the market breathed a sigh of relief on the news of the
jumbo L&auml;nder postponement, but lead managers ABN AMRO, CSFB and WestLB and
rival bankers could not agree on the merits or otherwise of the IADB's DM500m
five-year offering.

<P> Expect more retail-targeted dollar deals in the coming weeks as redemption
flows remain high into December. ICO completes the roadshow for its $500m debut
via Goldman Sachs in London and Europe next week, with a five-year deal at
14bp-16bp over likely to emerge shortly afterwards.

<P> Three emerging market lira deals -- YPF with a Lit300bn five year, Argentina
with a Lit500bn 10 year, both via Chase, and BNDES with $200m equivalent over
five years via Credito Italiano, Merrill and Paribas -- are due in the market
shortly.

<P> In Deutschmarks, Hokkaido Gas is set to become the latest Japanese utility to
come to the market on Monday with a DM300m offering at around 45bp over Bunds via
Yamaichi. Next week could also see the launch of a DM300m five-year offering for
Korea's Samsung via Deutsche Bank at 85bp-95bp over Bunds.

<P>

<H3> <B>Rapturous reception for Russia's $1bn debut Euro</B> </H3>

<P> 

<B><H4>THE RUSSIAN Federation's long-awaited debut Eurobond this week proved a
storming success with international investors keen to gain first-time Euromarket
exposure to the country's improving economic fundamentals.</H4> </B>The $1bn
transaction was widely hailed as the most important fixed-income transaction yet
to emerge from central and eastern Europe in the region's post-Communist era.

<P> The success of the deal paves the way for other Russian entities to tap the
international bond markets, and for a string of successor republics to the USSR
to make their own Euromarket debuts in the coming months.

<P> The launch size of $1bn for the Russian Federation's Euro/144A offering
represented the largest-ever debut issue from an emerging market sovereign
credit.

<P> The amount was far in excess of the $300m-$500m that had been expected by the
market as late as last week.

<P> At five years the maturity of the deal was also at the more aggressive end of
the anticipated three to five-year tenor.

<P> However, as syndicate officials from joint lead managers JP Morgan and SBC
Warburg pointed out, the level of demand had mounted during the exhaustive
roadshow in three continents and the response from international fixed-income
accounts had built up the  momentum necessary for a jumbo-sized, longer-dated
transaction.

<P> With a 9.25% coupon at a fixed/re-offer price of 99.561 the Ba2/BB- rated
deal came at a spread of 345bp over the 5.875% November 30, 2001 US Treasury -- a
level  generally acknowledged as representing a very competitive level of funding
for the Russian government.

<P> With the support of a high level delegation of senior finance officials from
Russia the lead managers succeeded in putting across the country's improving
credit story to over 1,500 investors throughout Asia, Europe and the US.

<P> By Tuesday evening, before the final investor presentations on Wednesday, the
leads were indicating that the deal would emerge for at least $750m.

<P> Following a near-record level of attendance for a debt roadshow in New York,
SBCW and JPM felt confident that a $1bn launch figure was a realistic reflection
of the level of appetite in the market.

<P> The initial investor response has certainly borne such confidence out, with
lead managers reporting broad-based global distribution of the deal to
predominantly institutional accounts.

<P> "The quality of the order book we've put together is incredible -- it reads
like the <I>Who's Who</I> of the international investment community," claimed a
syndicate official at SBC Warburg in London.

<P> "Not only have we succeeded in attracting the expected audience of emerging
market and high-yield fund specialists from around the globe, but we have also
managed to convince more mainstream, institutional funds of the relative value,
merits and importance of the transaction," added a spokesman for JP Morgan.

<P> The strength of investor appetite for fixed-income exposure to  the Russian
economy via a user-friendly instrument documented under English law and with
clearance and settlement through Euroclear, Cedel and DTC meant that the deal was
being greeted as an undoubted success on Thursday evening.

<P> "At the pre-launch spread talk of 350bp over, ourselves and JP Morgan had
aggregate demand for around $2.6bn. Even when we priced the deal below the
psychologically important 350bp threshold we still had in excess of $2bn of firm
orders," reported an SBC Warburg official.

<P> The two lead managers took $398m each and were supported by a geographically
diverse syndicate of six co-lead managers on books of $19m each and 10
co-managers taking $9m apiece.

<P> Syndicate officials at all the selling banks reported a healthy level of
oversubscription on their allocations. They said that the success of the
sovereign issue boded well for forthcoming Russian Eurobond deals from municipal
credits like Moscow and St Petersburg as well as corporate credits like Lukoil
and Gazprom.

<P> Commenting on the underlying rationale behind the deal, Russian deputy
finance minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, told <I>Euroweek: </I>"This issue marks an
important step forward in Russia's planned re-introduction to the international
capital markets and we are pleased with the cost of funding the transaction has
delivered.

<P> "Naturally, like any other borrower we would have liked an even tighter
launch spread but we recognise that 345bp over was a fair level given the current
state of the Russian economic reform process, and that the pricing was broadly in
line with investors' expectations."

<P> He added: "Looking ahead, there is a clear intention on the part of the
Russian government to be a frequent borrower in the international fixed-income
markets -- we will probably issue two or three deals a year over the next few
years -- and we hope that our positive experience will encourage other Russian
borrowers to tap the international bond markets."

<P> Some analysts have speculated that Russia could issue as much as $5bn in
various foreign debt markets next year, a far higher figure than that suggested
by Kasyanov's comments.

<P> An official from JP Morgan pointed out that the success of the Russian
Federation's debut Eurobond marked the culmination of the Russian authorities'
attempts to convince an international audience of the government's commitment to
a free-market ideology.

<P> "The success of this deal is a reflection of the economic progress the
Russians have made in a very short period of time and provides them with a solid
borrowing platform for the future, which will enable them to use the
international bond markets as an alternative source of debt funding.

<P> "It has already had a positive knock-on effect on the local debt market in
Russia, with both MinFins and Vnesh loans rallying strongly," the official said.

<P> MinFin III bonds traded up 75bp on Thursday to a level of 84, while Vnesh
loans traded up 50bp to 78-5/8, 78-7/8.

<P> Meanwhile, a number of former Soviet Union member states are set to follow
Russia into the international fixed-income market arena. The two-stage roadshow
for Kazakstan's planned Eurobond debut via ABN AMRO -- likely to emerge for
between $100m and $200m over an expected two to three-year tenor -- is due to
start next week.

<P> Investor presentations will begin in Seoul on November 29, before moving to
London and Geneva then San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and New York in the
following week.

<P> Moldova is also poised to tap the Euromarkets in the coming weeks with a
$20m-$25m private placement that will serve as the precursor to a maiden Eurobond
offering for up to $50m in the first of 1997.

<P> Both issues will be lead managed by Merrill Lynch. And Ukraine has already
announced plans for a first-ever Eurobond, possibly up to $250m in size, to be
launched next year.

<H3>Vogue status confirmed as eastern European deals fly </H3>
<BR>
<H4>EASTERN Europe underlined its status as the year's hottest fixed-income
investment this week with the launch of a wildly successful debut Eurobond
for a new sovereign credit and the emergence of a new Eurocurrency sector.<BR>
</H4><BR>
The Republic of Slovenia's first international bond issue since its
secession from Yugoslavia proved such a hit with investors that lead manager
JP Morgan was able to increase the deal half an hour after launch from $250m
to $325m. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the relatively large size, demand was so overwhelming that the five-year
bond for single-A rated Slovenia was priced at just 58bp over US Treasuries
-- the lowest spread yet for any issuer from central and eastern Europe.
<BR>
<BR>
Bankers said the scarcity value of Slovenia's debt, coupled with the fact
that the country has the highest sovereign ratings in the region, had sent
investors scurrying to buy bonds -- even those, like UK fund management
firms, that are not usually buyers of emerging market debt. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The deal has gone very, very well indeed -- mainly on the back of
the good feeling that surrounds central and eastern Europe at the moment,&quot;
said one member of the syndicate. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I just wish we'd had the whole $325m to ourselves,&quot; commented
another banker. &quot;It has been an absolute blow-out and was trading up
even before launch as people were hunting around for more bonds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Investors' enthusiasm to gain exposure to the economic growth story and
growing value in central and eastern European countries has fuelled an increasingly
frenzied reaction to new international bond issues from the region in recent
weeks -- largely because of their relative rarity compared to Latin America.
<BR>
<BR>
The same has also been true of the region's domestic bond markets, where
international investment banks and portfolio managers are becoming increasingly
active participants in these high-yielding currency sectors. <BR>
<BR>
Following the successful emergence of a Czech koruna Eurobond market in
recent months, the pace of activity stepped up a gear this week with the
birth of a new Euro-currency sector in Slovak korunas. <BR>
<BR>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was first off the mark,
launching a Sk750m one-year deal via Bayerische Vereinsbank that offered
investors an exchange rate-driven play on the Slovak Republic. <BR>
<BR>
Within 15 minutes of the EBRD's launch, the International Finance Corporation
confirmed the sector's arrival with a larger and longer Sk1.2bn three-year
financing via ING Barings and the WoodCommerz joint venture. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers said the longer maturity of the IFC deal represented more of a play
on the Slovak Republic's improving credit story -- in particular the country's
economic reform process. <BR>
<BR>
Although much of the demand came from continental European accounts, especially
in Germany, the lead managers said they had also seen interest from Asian
investors and from offshore US funds -- underlining the global appeal of
the region's potential. <BR>

<H3>TRADING PLACES </H3>
<H2>West MB raids CSFB's Eurobond trading team <BR>
<BR>
</H2>
WEST Merchant Bank yesterday served notice of its intention to build a broad
international fixed-income business with the hiring of a six-strong Eurobond
trading team. <BR>
<BR>
Led by Tony Maude, who will head Eurobond trading at West Merchant Bank,
the other team members comprise Dena Merson, Ronnie Lawrence, Peter Noll,
Adrian Kidd and David Hayes. They will join on September 1. <BR>
<BR>
The new team will trade the major Eurobond currencies -- with the exception
of Deutschmarks, which is handled by the bank's parent in Dusseldorf, West
LB -- and report to Tim von Halle, managing director in charge of fixed-income
trading and sales. <BR>
<BR>
Von Halle said the addition of a Eurobond trading team was part of the London-based
firm's plan to develop a fixed-income capability in tandem to complement
the Deutschmark strengths of WestLB. <BR>
<BR>
Until now, West Merchant Bank's fixed-income activities had been confined
to emerging markets -- primarily in Latin America, but also in newer sectors
like the South African rand. <BR>
<BR>
But the addition of a top-rated mainstream Eurobond trading team -- at a
cost that cannot have been cheap -- underlines the bank's determination
to broaden its fixed-income product base for the group's issuing and investing
clients. <BR>
<BR>
West Merchant Bank already has bond arbitrage and repo teams in place and
expects to announce several hirings on the government bond trading side
in the coming weeks. <BR>
<BR>
After that the firm will turn its recruitment attention to fixed-income
sales and building a new issues and syndicate function -- although the latter
will not stay until next year. <BR>
<BR>
Von Halle expressed delight at his firm's success in recruiting such an
experienced Eurobond trading team. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are starting more or less from scratch here,&quot; he said. &quot;I
think one of the attractions was the ability for these people to create
their own environment and there are very few places where you can do that
these days.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rivals expressed astonishment at the team defection from CS First Boston,
which leaves the firm's Eurobond trading capability severally depleted.
<BR>
<BR>
Martin Egan, a member of the new issues desk at CS First Boston, will take
over responsibility for Eurobond trading until replacements are found. 
<H2></H2>
<B>BZW</B> has announced the appointment of Mark Dearlove as director and
head of JGB short-end and repo trading in Tokyo. He joins from CS First
Boston where he has worked in both London and Tokyo most recently as a director
and co-head of repo trading. <BR>
<BR>
Separately at the firm, Ian Kennedy has been appointed as a director and
head of emerging markets, European equities, representing the first step
in the development of an emerging markets sales, trading and research capability
in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
He will report to John Standen, chief executive of BZW's emerging markets
division and Steve Harker, chief executive, European equities. Kennedy joins
from Nomura, where he was head of sales, emerging markets equities. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Lehman Brothers</B> has named Julia Ward as CP &amp; MTN product manager
within the firm's fixed income division, with effect from Monday (July 29).
In this role she will report Martin Goldberg, executive director and head
of CP &amp; MTN product management. Ward has been with Lehman Brothers for
the past three years. <BR>
<BR>
Alessandro Maria Cremona has been made co-president of <B>Nomura Italia
</B>and becomes a member of the Nomura Italia SIMpA. Cremona has been with
Nomura since 1987 and he will continues his responsibility for the Italian
desk within Nomura's European investment banking division. However, he will
also take on responsibility alongside Mitsuru Matsuura, president, for the
general management of all Nomura's activities in Italy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>AMP Asset Management</B> has appointed Ann Scurfield as marketing manager
to assist in the development of the firm's new business activities in the
UK, She will report to John Nestor, business development director. <BR>
<BR>
Scurfield joins the firm from Bankers Trust Company where she was vice president
working in the sales and marketing department of the global custody division
of the bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Liechtenstein Global Trust</B>, the parent company of GT Global and LGT
Asset Management, has signed an agreement to purchase Chancellor Capital
Management, an acquisition that will increase LGT's investment management
and private banking assets to nearly $80bn. <BR>
<BR>
Chancellor is the 15th largest independent manager in the US with $33bn
in assets under management specialising in public and private US equity
and bond portfolio management for over 300 US institutional clients <BR>
<BR>
The total cost for Chancellor could run to $300m, depending on the level
of growth in the businesses over the next five years. Long-term incentives
will be included to retain key employees. <BR>
<BR>
In North America, the investment adviser will be known as Chancellor LGT
Asset Management but will still be known as LGT Asset Management elsewhere.
<BR>
<BR>
Simon Briscoe has been promoted to a director of <B>Nikko Europe</B>, taking
responsibility for Nikko's fixed income economic research. Brian Berry,
managing director of fixed income, said of the promotion: &quot;He will
be in a position to guide the future development of Nikko Europe's economic
research and enhance our competitive position.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Neil Brown is to take up a position as director of <B>Apax Partners &amp;
Co</B>, one of the UK's leading private equity firms, to invest in larger
buy-outs. He was previously partner for the corporate finance team at Coopers
&amp; Lybrand. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Standard &amp; Poor's</B> has established a global asset-backed securities
unit to cover the growing markets for Latin America, Asia and Europe, while
strengthening existing coverage of new assets and assets originating in
North America. <BR>
<BR>
Standard &amp; Poor's managing director Patrice Jordan will head the new
unit, reporting to executive managing director Vickie Tillman. The new unit
is designed to help investors ascertain an issue's true credit risk given
the rising volume and complexity of today's asset-backed transactions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Goldman Sachs Asset Management </B>has purchased CIN Management Limited
(CINMan) after completing negotiations with British Coal, who agreed to
sell the firm. <BR>
<BR>
CINMan manages some &#163;15bn of marketable securities assets for British
Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme and the mineworkers pension scheme and
is one of the UK's leading in-house pension fund managers. The enlarged
fund management activities of Goldman Sachs Asset Management will have some
$85bn of funds. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Santander Investment </B>has made two new appointments to strengthen
its Portuguese equity team. <BR>
<BR>
Mari Vargas joins Santander as vice president heading the sales and research
team for Portuguese equities and Vasco Moreno becomes an analyst in the
Portuguese research department. They have both joined the firm from Dillon
Read and will be based in London. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Lehman Brothers</B> has appointed two co-heads of the telecommunications
and media group within the firm's European investment banking division.
Paul Dailey and Woody Young will take responsibility for the group, sharing
the firm's European based clients as well as a number of global clients
with a European focus. Dailey is a senior banker in the European telecommunications
and media group while Young is a senior member of the firm's New York media
and telecommunications group. <BR>
<BR>
<B>UBS</B> has announced the appointment of Simon Thorpe as head of a new
European smaller and mid-cap companies sales and research team. He was previously
head of UBS' UK smaller companies team for three years. <BR>
<BR>
The new unit has been formed in response to a growing need as more leading
international investment institutions are establishing dedicated smaller
and mid-cap company funds. It will also allow the firm to respond to an
anticipated growth in the number of initial public offerings in Europe.
<BR>
<BR>
Separately at <B>UBS</B>, Peter von Maydell has become a senior currency
economist, reporting to Paul Chertkow, managing director, global head of
currency research. Maydell joins the firm from First National Bank of Chicago
where he was a senior international economist. <BR>
<BR>
Also in UBS' equities division, George Dowdye has been hired as a Japanese
convertible product specialist, leaving a similar role at SBC Warburg. <BR>
<BR>
Charlotte Burley also joins the sales trading team at UBS, specialising
in European stocks with the bank's leading institutional clients. She joins
from James Capel and will report to the head of sales trading, Charles Atkinson.

ISSUANCE in the mainstream Eurobond markets came to a holiday-driven halt
this week -- to the delight of many bankers who welcomed the opportunity
to place the hefty inventories accumulated during the past few busy weeks.
<BR>
<BR>
The emerging markets took centre stage with the Republic of Slovenia making
its debut in the international arena. <BR>
<BR>
A two-week roadshow built up strong momentum for the issue such that at
58bp over Treasuries the borrower was able to achieve the tightest spread
ever attained by an issuer from eastern Europe. Lead manager JP Morgan reported
a heavy oversubscription for its own book, increasing the issue from $250m
to &#163;325m within half an hour of launch. <BR>
<BR>
The Slovak koruna sector opened for business, offering retail investors
another high-yielding currency. The EBRD became the first borrower to tap
this new market, beating the IFC by some 15 minutes. Both transactions saw
healthy demand. <BR>
<BR>
Strong demand for Mexico's floating-rate note issue has driven the deal
up to $6bn from the $3bn sought, with ministry of finance officials reporting
participation from over 200 financial institutions. <BR>
<BR>
But conservative UK fund managers caused Argentina's debut in sterling to
stumble. Rumours on Thursday that economy minister Domingo Cavallo had resigned
did little to improve its performance. <BR>
<BR>
In the Eurodollar sector, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com has postponed its
debut issue, probably until September and most other major transactions
seem to have been put on ice until then. <BR>
<BR>
One issue believed to be in the wings, however, is an Ecu deal for the World
Bank. Market participants believe this issue will not emerge until the one
Ecu for one Euro conversion question is clarified, a topic which was the
subject for discussion at a meeting of the IPMA/ISDA working committee held
on Thursday. <BR>
<BR>
No firm conclusions were reached at the meeting, however, and another session
is scheduled for next week. <BR>

<H4> NatWest hires four from Morgan Stanley in bid to expand equity derivatives </H4>

<P>NATWEST Markets has served notice of its ambition to become a major player in the global equity derivatives business with the hiring of four top professionals from Morgan Stanley.

<P> Ralph Reynolds, Richard Goldsmith and Scott Prince join the firm in New York to head its expansion in the US markets, while Steve Yamane joins as head of Asian equity trading and derivatives in Tokyo.

<P> All four were previously managing directors at Morgan Stanley. At NatWest they will report to another former Morgan Stanley executive -- Tom Whelan, who was recruited earlier this year as global head of equities.

<P> Whelan is leading NatWest's drive to build a top-tier equity business as part of the UK bank's broader development of its global investment banking activities.

<P> While NatWest has a strong equity derivatives business in the UK and continental Europe, it has been virtually absent from the futures and options markets in the US and Asia.

<P> Whelan hopes the arrival of a leading Wall Street equity derivatives team will complement NatWest's existing strengths in the US market -- where it is one of the top foreign banks in equities and convertible bonds.

<P> "They have been running one of the best equity derivatives franchises on Wall Street," said Whelan. "We have great expectations for what they can do for NatWest."

<P> Besides giving the bank an equity futures and options capability in the US, the new team's derivatives expertise should give NatWest a foothold in the areas of programme trading and portfolio restructuring.

<P> In Tokyo the recruitment of Yamane will give the firm a springboard into the lucrative Asian equity derivatives business. It also heralds the return of NatWest to the Japanese stockmarket, which it quit a few years ago when it gave up its seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

<P> "If you are going to be a global firm, you have to be active in Tokyo," said Whelan. "Across a range of NatWest Markets' activities there is a renewed focus on Japan."

<P> On the equity side, the renewed emphasis on Japanese business will likely take place through Wheelock NatWest, the bank's fast-growing investment banking joint venture in Asia.

<P> As a sign of the bank's increased commitment to the Asian markets, NatWest Markets recently despatched John Howland Jackson, its deputy chief executive, to Hong Kong as chairman of its Asia-Pacific operations.

<P> "Asia is a critical part of NatWest Markets' global ambitions," said Howland Jackson. "The development of our investment banking business in the region has reached the stage where we need to focus on broadening our client base and the range of products we provide."

<P> Whelan believes the strengthening of the firm's global equity derivatives business is a key step in developing a board-based equity capability spanning primary market activity, secondary trading and distribution and derivatives.

<P> "The derivatives and cash equity businesses are very different activities with different cycles, but you need to be able to provide all aspects of the equity business for clients," said Whelan.

<P> "Almost all the innovation in the equity area comes from derivatives and we want to be a leading product developer in the market. We already have a very good derivatives franchise in the UK and in Europe generally and we believe there are significant cross-border synergies that we can exploit from having a global business."

<P> Whelan said the recruitment of the Morgan Stanley derivatives team was indicative of the wider changes taking place at the UK bank as it strives to build up its presence in the global equity and debt capital markets.

<P> The firm recently acquired boutique investment bank Gleacher &amp; Co and fixed-income specialists Greenwich Capital in the US, in addition to buying the UK investment firm Gartmore from Banque Indosuez.

<P> "NatWest Markets today is a different business from what it was 12 months ago," he said. "The acquisitions of Gleacher, Gartmore and Greenwich have given us critical mass across a wide range of areas."

<H3> <B>Argentina targets Germany again as funding need grows</B> </H3>

<P>

<H4><B>THE REPUBLIC of Argentina is planning to return to the Deutschmark bond market for yet another jumbo offering, with a DM1bn issue due for launch within the next few days.</B> </H4> <P> Market sources believe SBC Warburg is the frontrunner to lead the transaction, which is rumoured to have a maturity of five or eight years, although it is understood that no final decision has been made.

<P> News of the planned financing came as an economics ministry official confirmed that Argentina would need to raise about another $4bn in the international and domestic capital markets this year to cover a $6.6bn widening of its budget deficit.

<P> Federico Molina, one of the senior members of the republic's capital-raising team, said the ministry was determining how best to raise the $4bn of funding, which is substantially larger than previous official estimates.

<P> He added that informal discussions included the possibility of issuing longer-dated domestic bonds and using the domestic and international loan syndication market, in addition to the republic's usual strategy of tapping whichever international bond sector offered the best rates.

<P> Bankers in Frankfurt suggested yesterday (Thursday) that SBC Warburg was the leading candidate to run the Deutschmark deal, although the firm would not comment.

<P> The lead managers for Argentina's previous jumbo bond issues in the sector, which have established a yield curve stretching from three to 15 years, have been CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

<P> Although the republic has already raised more than $2.3bn in Deutschmarks this year, bankers believe that German and Swiss retail investors are still prepared to take up paper -- provided the coupon is sufficiently attractive.

<P> "It will go quite well, because of the tax treaty which is why Germans buy this paper in the first place," said a banker in London. "This is evidenced by the fact that Argentina's yield curve is through Mexico in only one currency and that's Deutschmarks."

<P> Argentina's previous issues in the Deutschmark sector this year have all performed well. Market talk suggest that a five-year deal would be launched at around 300bp over Bunds, while an eight-year deal would require a spread of around 400bp.

<P> The timing of a new jumbo Deutschmark would be good, given the Bundesbank's recent modest cut in the repo rate and the market expectations of further rate cuts in the coming months.

<P> In addition the recent political turbulence in Argentina -- sparked by the forced resignation of former economics minister Domingo Cavallo last month -- appears to have blown over.

<P> Cavallo's replacement, Roque Fernandez, and his new team are highly regarded in international markets.

<P> This week Fernandez's political credibility was lifted by his success in getting a tax package through the first stages of congressional approval.

<P> Although the package was watered down and will only cut this year's expected $6.6bn budget deficit to around $5.4bn, market sentiment was cheered by signs of progress.

<P> Molina could not confirm that a new jumbo Deutschmark bond issue was in the works. He and other members of the capital-raising team are determining the exact amount of funding required before year-end, which he estimates to be around $4bn.

<P> The republic is hoping to lean as much as it can on the domestic market where banks, scared off by the $8bn outflow of deposits in 1995 after the Mexico peso crisis, are now flush with funds.

<P> Their willingness to lend could be boosted by the fact that the central bank is currently negotiating a $3bn to $6bn backstop facility with international banks.

<P> This would provide the country with emergency lines of credit to give the local banks should a new crisis erupt and cause another exodus of funds from the country.

<P> The government is seeking approval to raise its debt ceiling by another $4bn to give it freedom to raise that amount from domestic and international markets by the end of the year.

<P> "We expect that we will get approval by the end of September," said Molina. "If we get the authorisation from congress the amount we raise in the local market will probably be increased, but not in [short-dated] Letes. We might issue debt with longer tenors, although this is still undecided."

<P> The government revamped its fledgling local Treasury bond market in April in anticipation <BR> of huge annual debt amortisation burdens over the next few <BR> years. So far it has issued $1.3bn of short-dated Letes Treasury bills.

<P> Internationally, Argentina is looking at any market it can to raise funds. Despite having raised $2.3bn in Germany already this year, the Deutschmark sector is still a favoured target. "It seems that there is still appetite for Argentina paper in Deutschmarks," said Molina.

<P> Apart from the backstop bank facility -- which is not a capital-raising venture and so not under his jurisdiction -- Molina said the republic was also keen to examine the possibilities offered by the syndicated loan market.

<P> "Yes, we are looking at the loan syndication market," he said. "We are looking at some alternatives, but we don't have a clear picture yet. We have only had talks. We have not asked formally for proposals, nor have we received any. But yes, it is an alternative."

<P> The backstop facility will not be drawn upon unless there is a massive liquidity crisis in the country and therefore does not affect banks' credit limits for taking on Argentine debt.

<P> Molina said a Brady bond exchange offer -- similar to Mexico's highly successful tender earlier this year -- was not being considered as part of its $4bn capital-raising need for the rest of this year.

<P> "We are not considering this," he said. "That's because it's a complex matter and we are at this point looking at how we will do the financing for the treasury for the rest of the year."

<P> Before the announcement of Cavallo's resignation and the huge blow-out of its budget deficit, the republic was planning to tap the Samurai market in September or October.

<P> However, Molina was equivocal on the subject. "It depends on how we see the market. We will not do a Samurai in September, that's for sure. We will see how the markets are looking in September."

<H4> Focus turns to Japan </H4> <P> NEW ISSUE activity picked up in pace this week as the holiday period started to recede, with the Japanese equity-linked, Deutschmark and sterling sectors showing most vigour.

<P> Participants were at a loss to explain the strength of the new issue flow in the equity-linked market, although the recent robustness of Tokyo's Nikkei index has helped to underpin sentiment.

<P> Two Japanese issuers made debuts in European currency sectors: JFS with a DM350m issue via Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Deutsche; and Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) with a Ffr4bn issue led by Paribas.

<P> The JFS deal went well on novelty value, but although the freshness of the Tepco name was also widely welcomed, many thought Ffr4bn too much for a languid market to digest.

<P> A planned DM350m issue for Chugoku Electric looks to have been shelved but other Japanese names are expected next week. They include Kansai Electric Power with a $500m 10-year offering via Merrill and Paribas, talked of at 31bp-32bp over Treasuries, and Kansai International Airport, with IBJ leading a $200m 10-year at 27-28 over.

<P> Further down the line, City of Yokohama is considering a $300m issue, also at 10 years, via Tokyo-Mitsubishi for late September/ early October. Chubu Electric, Kyushu Electric and Metropolis of Tokyo are also tipped as possible Japanese issuers.

<P> Renewed desire for non-yen assets from Japanese investors provided the motive behind a Yamaichi-led, retail-targeted $1bn issue for the World Bank, reported to have yielded the borrower cost of funds in the region of 45bp under Libor.

<P> The World Bank could follow with a debut Ecu transaction if the constituent currencies' convertibility in the event of EMU is formalised at the ISMA council meeting on September 4.

<H3>LIECHTENSTEIN</H3>
<H2>
So far but no further </H2>
<H4>Liechtenstein's ruler, Prince Hans-Adam, was so sure of the benefits
of closer economic ties with the rest of western Europe that he threatened
to abdicate if his subjects rejected EEA membership. The principality's
bankers and lawyers are more sceptical. Their concern is that limited changes
to secrecy laws may deter the high-net-world</h4>
After decades of luxuriating in low-profile affluence, Liechtenstein's banking
industry faces a shake-up that raises doubts about its future as a haven
for the wealthy. The tiny Alpine principality sent out the first signals
that it was on the verge of a new era after a referendum in December 1992.
Its 30,000 inhabitants confounded pollsters by voting to join Iceland, Norway
and the EU as a member of the the European Economic Area (EEA), thus ending
a cherished tradition of independence from foreign regulators. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the referendum raised eyebrows in Europe's financial community,
since it came only two weeks after Switzerland, with which Liechtenstein
maintains customs and currency treaties, had voted to remain outside the
EEA. Because of Liechtenstein's formal ties with Switzerland, the referendum
raised legal complications that required months of debate and compromise
to resolve before Liechtenstein could go it alone. It also meant that Liechtensteiners
would once more have to ratify their decision under the new arrangements
by going to the polls. This they did in March last year, once again stubbornly
voting yes to EEA membership. <BR>
<BR>
The driving force behind Liechtenstein's move toward greater integration
with the rest of Europe is the principality's ruler, His Serene Highness
Prince Hans-Adam II von und zu Liechtenstein. The 50-year-old prince, who
rules from a fairy-tale hilltop castle above the capital, Vaduz, had threatened
to abdicate in 1992 if EEA membership was rejected. <BR>
<BR>
Only three months ago, in a speech to the legislature, Prince Hans-Adam
once again held out the threat that he would step down if his subjects were
unhappy with his reformist policies. He suggested that if that happened
Liechtenstein could formally join one of its neighbours, Switzerland or
Austria, as an alternative to declaring a republic. But the prince, whose
approval is required to validate any law, made it clear he had no intention
of being a &quot;ribbon-cutting figurehead or a plaything of the mass media&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The country's 25 legislators were suitably impressed and no more has been
heard about slowing the advance toward European integration. Indeed, reformist
zeal has even penetrated the country's social-security provisions. This
month the government is debating a proposal to set the retirement age for
both sexes at 65. It is now 64 for men and 62 for women. &quot;We will offer
women some incentives to accept the later retirement age,&quot; says Liechtenstein's
prime minister, Mario Frick. &quot;We also plan to introduce a fairer system
for acquiring Liechtenstein citizenship. This will be dealt with after next
year's elections, as we do not want this to become a political issue.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
At present a Liechtenstein man married to a foreigner can automatically
pass on his citizenship to his children, but this does not apply to women
born in the principality with foreign husbands. Foreigners resident in Liechtenstein
for 20 years may apply for citizenship. However, this has to be approved
by referendum in the person's local community. &quot;I have seen cases where
an applicant has lost a referendum and spends the rest of his life wondering
which of his neighbours voted against him,&quot; says Frick. &quot;All these
laws need to be changed and will be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Since the first EEA referendum Liechtenstein has passed liberalized banking
legislation as well as new insurance and investment codes. Attention is
now focused on crucial and controversial legislation that comes into force
on January 1. This lays down stringent EU-friendly due-diligence requirements
for accepting trust or foundation money from wealthy individuals, the lifeblood
of Liechtenstein's financial success. <BR>
<BR>
Disclosure is the buzzword these days in Vaduz banking circles. Only last
month the government published its first official figures on trusts and
foundations. The total came to 73,000 - nearly 2.5 registered companies
per inhabitant. The trust/foundation system is what sets Liechtenstein apart
from other private-banking centres such as Switzerland and Luxembourg. <BR>
<BR>
The trust, or Anstalt, can be a commercial or non-commercial arrangement
set up between one of Liechtenstein's 300 or so trustee lawyers and a corporate
person for trading with a structure like a limited company. Instead of shareholders
the Anstalt's owners are the beneficiaries. The foundation, on the other
hand, is a registered company generally holding the assets of a wealthy
family. It is required to submit accounts and is a vehicle for investment
rather than trading. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The new Banking Act was a step in the right direction, since it simplifies
the rules for obtaining a banking licence,&quot; says Rolf Ehlers, head
of private banking at Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank (VP Bank), the third-largest
of the five domestic banks operating in Liechtenstein. &quot;In the past
you had to make a convincing case that another bank was justified. Now all
you need is Swfr10 million ($7.9 million) in capital and an approved board
of directors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Ehlers says the insurance law which came into force last year provides the
legal framework for a captive insurance industry, while the investment fund
law, which replaces an informal three-paragraph 1960 ruling, conforms to
EU regulations. Both are perceived as being beneficial to Liechtenstein's
financial services industry since they will enable the principality to compete
more efficiently with other offshore centres such as Dublin and Luxembourg.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Competitive edge</B> <BR>
<BR>
A clear attraction of Liechtenstein as a haven for serious wealth is the
absence of a withholding tax, compared, for example, with the 35% rate levied
by Switzerland. The principality's tax structure has been left unaffected
by EEA membership, but Liechtenstein's trustee lawyers and bankers consider
that their competitive edge springs as much from a level of secrecy that
no other banking centre, not even Switzerland, can offer. Tightening up
procedures on Anstalts and foundations will, they argue, be a potentially
disastrous consequence of EEA membership. <BR>
<BR>
As things stand, once the money behind an Anstalt or foundation is deemed
to be clean and above-board by a trustee lawyer, he refers his client to
one of the principality's five banks. The Liechtenstein banker is not required
to know the identity of the account's ultimate beneficiary, as he would
have to under Swiss or EU legislation. <BR>
<BR>
However, the new due-diligence agreement which becomes law next year stipulates
that if a lawyer has any suspicions about the source of money he is handling
on behalf of a client, he is required to report this to the Banking Commission,
at which point all operations are immediately frozen. Current regulations
only state that in such cases the lawyer has the right, not the obligation,
to take action against his client. Companies formed under the new law will
also be obliged to undergo an annual independent audit. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The new legislation poses a direct threat to Liechtenstein's basic
competitiveness,&quot; says a banker in Vaduz. &quot;What it means, in effect,
is that all Anstalts and foundations will be scrutinized by an extra pair
of eyes. In theory the client's anonymity is preserved, since the auditor
is required to file only the name of the company and not the beneficiary,
but it is obvious that this creates a greater scope for leaks. All it requires
is one office boy passing by a desk, intentionally or not, where an auditor
has left his books open and you can imagine the potential risks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bankers say they have not yet detected any loss of business because of concern
over the new system, which becomes effective next year. &quot;It could have
an impact, but in the end it should be positive as it helps us to achieve
our target of transparency and to preserve our clean reputation,&quot; says
VP Bank's Ehlers. &quot;Most people would admit they haven't yet felt any
disadvantages from EEA membership, but it is too early to say that we have
benefited from the advantages.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A Swiss banking analyst in Zurich says some requirements, such as the adoption
of international accounting standards and the filing of fully consolidated
accounts, will significantly change Liechtenstein's banking industry. &quot;They've
got to break down their top-line income; items such as staff expenses need
to be explained; and we still don't know what unrealized gains they are
holding in the form of hidden reserves, which are treated as other liabilities,&quot;
he says. &quot;Under the EEA agreement European banks can now set up representative
offices in Liechtenstein. This is bound to have an impact on their business.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Liechtenstein bankers are taking a typically sanguine view of the threat
of foreign encroachment. &quot;There is a possibility that some foreign
banks might want to come in, but I don't envisage this as a threat,&quot;
says Josef Fehr, head of the dealing division at Liechtensteinische Landesbank
(LLB), the principality's oldest bank. &quot;On the one hand they would
need qualified staff and there is a shortage of people as well as premises.
There is also the question of how many foreigners we are prepared to allow
into the country. More than a third of our people are now foreign residents
and under the terms of our EEA agreement we have the right to limit these
numbers. If it were to go above 50% the question would arise of what is
a Liechtensteiner.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Diversification</B> <BR>
<BR>
Fehr says a much more likely prospect would be the formation of joint ventures
or partnerships, such as the investment fund partnership LLB has with Union
Bank of Switzerland (UBS). &quot;We might consider setting up another one
with a German or EEA bank, for instance,&quot; he says. &quot;For me this
is the way to participate in the EEA market. In any case, if a German bank
sets up an office in Vaduz, it is still restricted by German law. So it
wouldn't make sense for anybody to go to a German bank in Liechtenstein.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In order to continue to prosper in the new environment, analysts believe
Liechtenstein's banks will have to diversify from their traditional business
of taking deposits and placing them in the interbank market. &quot;In the
past Liechtenstein banks could go into the Lombard market and squeeze 200
basis points out of their deposit funds,&quot; says this Swiss analyst.
&quot;This is no longer the case, so now they need to diversify and become
full-service private banks in the true sense of the term.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fehr agrees on the need for LLB, which is also the principality's leading
domestic retail bank, to diversify. &quot;It is true that the returns offered
by the interbank market are not as high as in the past, but they will come
back,&quot; he says. &quot;One thing is certain: we will not engage in higher-risk
business only for the sake of enhanced returns. We always deal with AAA
minus or AA rated banks, and not with single-A banks we hardly know anything
about. We are contemplating expansion abroad, but so far it does not go
beyond the contemplation stage.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Centrum Bank, the youngest of the principality's five banks, ruled out retail
activities when it started operations in 1993 under the new Banking Act.
It restricts itself to the traditional Liechtenstein business of private
banking, and portfolio and asset management. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our target is the high-net-worth individual with at least a million
Swiss francs to invest,&quot; says deputy manager portfolio management Aribert
Schurte. But he recognizes the need to cater for a new breed of investor
who is more demanding than the traditional client, who tends to be Swiss,
German or Austrian &quot;old money&quot; seeking little more than a safe
haven for his millions. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Clients today tend to be better informed about the market and want
to get more out of their money,&quot; says Matthias Tr&ouml;sch, Centrum's
deputy manager, trading. &quot;We've got to support this client and we can
cope with the demand for risk. But we do not offer a standard menu nor are
we selling anything. Our goal remains that of a private bank seeking a long-term
relationship.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The bank that has set the benchmark for international expansion and diversification
is LGT Bank in Liechtenstein, part of the Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT),
which is controlled by Prince Hans-Adam's family. Since its &#163;91.5 million
($140 million) acquisition in 1989 of Britain's GT Management, the bank
has built up a portfolio of Swfr55 billion under management in 18 countries.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Positive attitude</B> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our target is to grow to Swfr100 billion by 1998 and I am confident
we shall achieve this,&quot; says the bank's chief executive, Heinz Nipp.
He says an acquisition will be needed to reach that goal, and LGT is looking
for a private bank or asset-management firm, possibly in the US domestic
market or in continental Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Nipp thinks there is nothing to fear in Liechtenstein's move toward closer
European integration, although he echoes the sentiment of other bankers
and the government in ruling out EU membership. &quot;This is as far as
it should go,&quot; he says. &quot;It would be impossible to retain our
present structure if we were a one-vote member of the EU, and we would have
nothing to contribute. On the other hand, EEA membership is positive because,
as a little country, it helps us to make our presence felt.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nipp considers the spate of new legislation as positive for Liechtenstein's
banking industry. &quot;This opens the possibility of competing in the offshore
funds market,&quot; he says. &quot;We've been very successful in structuring
funds and this will diversify our product mix. The due-diligence law clears
up a lot of uncertainty, and it will also help us to shake off the old clich&eacute;s
about money laundering.&quot; <HR>
<H3>Confidentiality and competition </H3>
<B>Mario Frick, Liechtenstein's prime minister, talks about the implications
of membership of the European Economic Area for his country's financial
services industry.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>It is now a year since Liechtenstein took its first major step toward
integration with Europe by joining the European Economic Area (EEA). What
impact has this had on your country?</B> <BR>
<BR>
On balance I would say it was a positive move for Liechtenstein. True, it
has brought some pressure on us to bring our banking system and other aspects
of our economy in line with European Union standards. It is important to
ensure this is not taken too far, certainly not to the point where it might
jeopardize our unique system. For now, EEA membership has been advantageous
in that it gives us entry into the European market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are there any concerns about the regulatory implications EEA membership
will have for your banking system, which is the heart of Liechtenstein's
prosperity?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The EEA does not require any changes in banking confidentiality, although
our banks have to comply with international accounting standards in the
next two years. It should be noted that we have already taken the initiative
in tightening up the regulatory environment. Parliament has just passed
a law, which takes effect on January 1, on supervising the origin of funds
used to open trusts. Basically we have enshrined in written law traditional
safeguards against money laundering that have always been in practice in
Liechtenstein. The rules governing trustee lawyers have been clearly defined.
They now have a legal obligation to inform the authorities if there are
any doubts about the source of the funds they are handling for a client.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Doesn't this pose the risk of deterring people who do business with your
banks precisely because of the high level of confidentiality they offer?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If it acts as a deterrent to money launderers then we have accomplished
our purpose. We spent two years working on this law, which is a very long
time for our legislature. I am confident that we have come up with a compromise
solution that gives us a reliable framework of control and at the same time
safeguards our banks' competitive edge. <BR>
<BR>
<B>EEA membership requires you to open your banking system to foreign competitors.
Do you think many banks will take advantage of this to set up operations
in Liechtenstein?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We are currently reviewing this issue to see if it could pose a significant
problem. Personally, I don't see a lot of foreign banks opening up offices
in Liechtenstein. On the one hand, the domestic market is too small to make
it a lucrative proposition. If they want to come in to use Liechtenstein
as a base of operations, they will encounter several problems. One is finding
premises and qualified staff, as both are in short supply. We are also very
restrictive about allowing foreigners into our country. Nearly 40% of the
residents of Liechtenstein are foreigners; this is not seen as a problem
now, but our people don't want to become a minority in their own country.
Liechtenstein is not a cheap place to do business and start-up costs could
be seen as prohibitive. On the other hand, I do see the possibility of foreign
banks setting up partnerships with Liechtenstein banks or trust companies.
We have very low taxes and very little red tape; we know the local business
and have the contacts. So it makes sense for a bank looking to broaden its
European investment base to use Liechtenstein as a springboard. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The question of Liechtenstein's future sovereignty arose last March when
Prince Hans-Adam mooted the possibility of a referendum on becoming part
of Switzerland or Austria. Do you see any advantages in Liechtenstein giving
up its independence?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The prince is a firm believer in public debate on all issues. I personally
do not believe it is a good idea even to consider the possibility of becoming
a Swiss canton or Austrian bundesland. Liechtenstein owes its prosperity
to its status as an independent country. We enjoy a unique position in that
as a member state of both the EEA and World Trade Organization (WTO) we
have access to the European and international markets. So why should we
give this up to become part of another country? If we look at our financial
situation, Liechtenstein has always had a budget surplus. The system works
well and I do not foresee any economic problems now or in the near future.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>There has been speculation that Liechtenstein may have to raise taxes
to meet the country's revenue requirements. Is this under consideration?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps I shouldn't say this, but at the moment we have more money than
we need. We have introduced a 6.5% value-added tax, along with Switzerland,
and this gives us an added source of independent income. Previously we received
a proportion of Switzerland's Wust tax on services. Barring unforeseen events,
I could not imagine any increase in the tax burden for the next 10 years
or more. As a small country we always have to rely to an extent on more
powerful partners for some areas of activity. But in terms of public finances,
smallness is our key advantage as we can keep a tight control on items such
as government spending. <BR>
<BR>
<B>In the past two years the financial services sector has overtaken manufacturing
as the country's main source of income. Are you happy with this?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I am not unduly concerned about the current diversity. It is more or less
in line with the trend in other countries, where in some cases financial
services play an even greater role in the economy. I would like to keep
the ratio more or less at its present level as I believe that balanced diversification
provides a cushion against future economic downturns. <BR>

<H3>POLAND</H3>


<H2> <B>Learning to love restructuring</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Over the past seven
years Polish companies have had to restructure to survive. New accounting rules
have helped improve the quality of management. And Polish workers have begun to
understand that foreign investment brings with it security and new technology. By
Graham Field</B> </H4> 

<P> Poland has emerged as the <I>Wunderkind</I> of the
central European economies. The drastic reforms launched in January 1990 turned
it into the fastest-growing economy in Europe by 1995. At the micro-level,
enterprises were subjected to competition from the start. The lesson of Poland is
that the restructuring process is affected more by market conditions than by the
form of ownership.

<P> "The discipline of the market has been exerted from day one," says Mark
Schaffer, a British economist who studies eastern Europe. From early on employees
and managers &#173; whether in state, private or employee-owned companies &#173;
have known that their future depends on the performance of their enterprises and
that there will be no state-funded bail-out. In Poland's free-market environment,
companies which do not pay their bills find that suppliers quickly refuse to do
business with them. The word "bankruptcy" may not technically apply, but the
consequences are just as harsh.

<P> The private sector has mushroomed in this environment and now accounts for
around 60% of GDP (compared with 31.4% in 1990). It has been growing at more than
20% each year and private companies are likely to remain the motor of growth for
the economy.

<P> Polish enterprises have been forced into what the EBRD calls the "reactive"
phase of restructuring: learning to live with budgetary constraints and market
prices. But the spread of what the bank calls the "strategic aspects" of
restructuring &#173; adopting an export orientation, fashioning a more suitable
product mix and instituting management changes &#173; has been more a function of
sectoral conditions.

<P> Maciej Radziwill, an analyst with UBS in Warsaw, points to the dairy industry
as a good example of how a sector can respond positively to market conditions.
The opening up of the Polish market meant that local products were quickly
displaced by French milk, Finnish butter and a variety of other western European
goods. But the Polish industry reorganized, started producing milk that "didn't
taste of soap" and won back market share.

<P> This was possible, says Radziwill, because the dairy industry is not capital
intensive, and because most companies were not highly leveraged and were able to
borrow where they needed to. Despite nominal interest rates of 21% to 23%,
inflation has been high enough to ensure that the cost of borrowing has not been
prohibitively high. Stephen Pettyfer, an emerging European markets analyst with
Merrill Lynch, singles out the cable sector as another successful restructuring
story, with companies now able to compete on quality as well as price in export
markets.

<P> In other sectors, however, market conditions have not imposed such stark
pressures on companies. The garment industry, for instance, was able to avoid a
painful and far-reaching restructuring in the early 1990s because it filled the
gap created by the disruption of what had been the Yugoslavian garment industry.
Without restructuring and investment the sector was vulnerable to buyers shifting
their purchases to other, cheaper sources.

<P> The extent to which firms have restructured varies among firms in the same
sector. Where companies have undergone management buy-outs (MBOs), the cost of
the debt taken on has tended to lead to tough financial controls and a more
radical approach to restructuring.

<P> But capital raised from IPOs has not always been used for restructuring. Some
companies have embarked on spending sprees and built up large, rambling corporate
empires. Some analysts now believe it is time to take a second look at companies
such as Elektrim and Rolimpex. Elektrim has moved logically from a trading role
into other areas of the power industry and into telecommunications equipment.

<P> Legal and workforce obstacles are not generally the reasons for limited
restructuring. "Polish company law is based strongly on German company law and a
51% stake means investors have control," explains Stephen Denyer, a partner in
Allen &amp; Overy's Warsaw office. There are a few exceptions where the support
of 80% of shareholders is needed &#173; as in the waiving of pre-emption rights
on share issues &#173; and where the government has retained a 25% stake in
privatized companies it can block such moves. But investors have a "pretty free
hand" once they have secured 51% control, concludes Denyer.

<P> <B>Productivity</B>

<P> In other cases, says Tadeusz Komosa, a partner in the Polish law firm,
Consultor, shareholders' agreements give foreign minority shareholders very
extensive control. This is usually where Polish shareholders recognize that
ceding control is an acceptable price to pay for the foreign technology which is
brought in.

<P> Workers' rights do not, in reality, present a serious hindrance to foreign
investors. State companies cut more than 10% of their industrial workforce in the
first 12 months after reforms were initiated in 1990. Partly as a result, labour
productivity is now higher than it was before the transition process began,
putting Poland well ahead of, for instance, Russia.

<P> Moreover, labour costs are only a small percentage of overall costs &#173;
typically between 10% and 12% &#173; so even where it is impossible to reduce the
number of employees, the costs of not doing so are relatively light.

<P> Agreements which put a freeze on redundancies when a company is acquired last
a maximum of three years. Companies can reduce employee numbers once this
deadline has passed, as can be seen in those sectors where the government sold
off bundles of companies two to three years ago. As agreements expire, so
employees are being laid off. Changes to labour law introduced in June 1996 will
also, on balance, reduce legal obligations on redundancy.

<P> The stakes that workers hold in companies tend to be relatively small and are
seldom voted as a block that presents a serious obstacle to management. In
addition, a rapidly growing economy means that workers have more opportunities to
leave their existing companies and move on to jobs elsewhere, which reduces
worker shareholdings.

<P> Radziwill argues that workers have learnt a lot from their seven years of
life in a market economy. They no longer regard the arrival of foreign capital as
the worst thing that could happen to them. Instead, he says, there have been
cases where workers have even been on strike to demand that companies should be
bought by foreign investors in preference to local firms.

<P> <B>Long-term planning</B>

<P> When the Polish chemicals trading company, Chie, bought two local
manufacturing companies to build up its production base, the workers favoured the
rival bid from French giant Rhone-Poulenc. The reason, Radziwill argues, is that
"they see a local bidder would mean that things would be easy for two years, but
they know their position wouldn't necessarily be safe in five years' time".

<P> Consequently, investors see that the future of restructuring and corporate
performance in Poland rests more on changes in management practices than on
changes to the legal environment or the position of the workforce. The biggest
weaknesses identified in Polish companies are widely agreed to be in the area of
financial management and cost accounting. "Poland needs a whole lot of new
finance directors," declares Pettyfer.

<P> Up until now, many companies have muddled through by appointing their old
bookkeepers as "chief financial executives". Most of these executives are
ill-equipped to take on the role of treasurer or chief financial officer, and to
assume responsibility for dealing with banks and investors, and thinking about
the cost of capital. Nor are they familiar with hedging techniques or
derivatives. "Financial management is the weakest part of the management," states
UBS's Radziwill.

<P> But changes are afoot. Marketing is adapting already. International
advertising agencies are picking up their first Polish clients. There has been
progress in management accounting. Inventory management has improved: the average
inventory turnover of the companies in the National Investment Funds (NIFs)
&#173; Poland's mass voucher privatization scheme &#173;  came down from 54.7
days in 1993 to 50.8 days in 1994, reflecting changes at large in industry.

<P> From the point of view of investors, analysis of the position of Polish
companies has become easier since the adoption of new accounting rules in January
1995. "These go a long way towards meeting international accounting standards,"
says John-Paul Warszewski, head of the Polish team at Hambros. A few issues
remain to be tidied up, such as the treatment of contingent liabilities.

<P> The changes have not been enough to prevent one or two nasty shocks from
listed Polish companies, such as Rafako and Espebepe. Both companies produced
poor results when they had previously appeared in good shape. The lesson for
Martin Gollner, eastern Europe analyst at Nomura, is that the days of "just
buying the market" are over and that stock selection is now imperative.

<P> Analysts have had good access to company officers, although the signs are
that companies are becoming rather less open. The reasons do not, however, lie in
a secretive mentality. Rather, they are the result of, first, foreign investors
taking stakes in companies. With investment under their belts and new management
coming in there is less need to be open in order to attract investment. Second,
Poland is becoming overbroked and management is less willing to spend time
talking to analysts.

<P> The outlook for company performance is good. "Underlying profitability is
very good," says Merrill's Pettyfer. Although depreciation is increasing and
costs are being taken, cash generation is good. As a legacy of the high-interest
rate regime of the early 1990s, companies are not burdened with large debts.
Although the bad winter in 1995&#173;96 and the onset of greater competition will
eat into profits this year, the health of the economy helps a lot. Poland is
expected to record growth of 5% to 7% a year between now and  2000.

<P> All 27.4 million adult Poles are entitled to buy privatization vouchers by a
deadline of November 20. This will give them a stake in each of the 15 NIFs,
which are themselves expected to list in 1997.

<P> Unlike in the Czech Republic, the voucher exercise is only one part of
Poland's "multi-track" privatization route. It has been a complicated and
expensive operation, which has led to disputes between the western fund managers
brought in to run the 15 funds and their supervisory boards, representing the
great and the good of Polish society. Given the different perspectives of the
board and the managers, "conflicts were inevitable", says Denyer of Allen &amp;
Overy.

<P> Investors, however, are sanguine about problems involving international fund
management groups, such as Wasserstein Perella and Yamaichi Regent. "It makes no
difference to me," says investment manager Richard Fairgrieve of Hermes
Investment Management. "It doesn't affect the value of what's there and, in any
case, the problems seem to have been smoothed over a bit." Action by
privatization minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek to rein in the supervisory boards has
further reassured investors. As a result, says Hambros' Warszewski, the fund
managers have "settled down to doing their business".

<P> The 513 manufacturing, construction and trading companies placed in the funds
are not the source of investors' immediate excitement. The companies themselves
are dismissed by one broker as "rather small-sized, medium-quality, boring".
Those selected had no alternative plans for privatization &#173; whether in the
form of a sale to foreign investors or an MBO.

<P> But the pricing of the vouchers undervalues these assets and that is why
investors are getting excited. The funds have already disposed successfully of
four of the seven cement companies included in the programme and accumulated
significant cash holdings. They have also shown that it is possible to dispose
even of loss-making companies.

<P> Around 23 million Poles are expected to take up the vouchers, which means
that supply will be less than the theoretical 27.4 million maximum. All this adds
up to the potential for substantial appreciation in the price of vouchers after
November 20.

<H3>KOREA</H3> 
<H2>Issuer talking long-distance </H2>
<H4>The Korean government is eager to sell off a large chunk of Korea Telecom,
not least because it needs the money to help balance its budget. But with
an issue of up to $2 billion likely, there's no way the local market can
cope, especially when it's beset by scandal. So is it time for the finance
ministry to call up some international investment bankers to discuss a foreign
listing? Tony Shale reports. </H4>
Asia's biggest international equity deal of the year will come from its
most closed and parochial market. State-owned telecommunications company
Korea Telecom, which has annual revenue of w5.71 trillion ($7.2 billion)
and assets of W11.6 trillion, wants to raise up to $2 billion. With the
Korean stock market suffering from political instability and restrictive
practices, the government may have no choice but to make its first-ever
foray into international capital markets when undertaking a privatization.
<BR>
<BR>
Speculation about the deal has thrown an unaccustomed spotlight on a market
often overlooked in favour of more racy Asian bourses. &quot;This could
easily be the single-biggest transaction of the year,&quot; says Andrew
Harrington, regional telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong
Kong. &quot;With [the stock market's] free float of shares estimated to
be worth around $20 billion, it would account for around 10% of total market
capitalization,&quot; says Namuh Rhee, a director of Dongbang Peregrine
Securities in Seoul. &quot;And this would make it the second-largest company
on the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE).&quot; Adds Adrian Cowell, chief representative
of Kleinwort Benson in Seoul: &quot;It is undoubtedly the deal everyone
is awaiting.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government is keen to accelerate what has been a much-delayed privatization
programme. And, although officials are cagy about the details of the expected
offering, they acknowledge that a foreign offering is now being seriously
considered. &quot;Originally we wanted to sell down more of Korea Telecom's
shares to the public during 1995,&quot; says a senior department head of
the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE), &quot;but the poor performance
of the stock market made this impossible. Now we are actively exploring
the possibility of selling shares overseas and we are in discussions with
foreign banks concerning how best to do this.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Foreign investment bankers have taken this as their cue - notwithstanding
the absence of hard financial data from Korea Telecom - to talk up the deal.
&quot;Working on the rule-of-thumb basis that telecommunications companies
worldwide are worth approximately $2,000 for every subscribed access line,
Korea Telecom - with 17.6 million - should have a total value of around
$35 billion,&quot; says the telecommunications specialist at a US investment
bank based in Singapore. &quot;Given that the government wants to get the
maximum possible mileage out of the exercise and appears willing to take
seriously the <I>modus operandi</I> of the international capital markets,
a foreign deal in the $1 billion to $2 billion range will be in order. Even
that would not represent a large proportion of total equity while anything
smaller - say $200 million to $500 million - would be inconsequential.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Others point to macroeconomic signals from the MOFE when doing their calculations.
&quot;The ministry announced in mid-January that GDP growth would slow to
around 7% for 1996 and that an additional W1.6 trillion would be required
to ensure a balanced budget. It is difficult in the current climate to imagine
this coming from anything other than a large sale of Korea Telecom stock
to foreign investors,&quot; says the director of one international investment
bank based in Seoul. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Scepticism begins at home</B> <BR>
<BR>
The enthusiasm is by no means universal. Long used to the Korean authorities'
tendency to produce whimpers rather than bangs in capital market developments,
older hands in Seoul are more sceptical about Korea Telecom. &quot;The deal
simply has not produced the same amount of hype among Korean brokerage houses,&quot;
says Milton Kim, president and chief executive officer of Ssangyong Securities.
&quot;Among these, there is much more cynicism that the deal will come about
and be the one-off bonanza that the foreign houses seem to expect.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Much will certainly have to be done to fulfil foreigners' aspirations. Korea
Telecom's shares, for example, are currently bought and sold almost surreptitiously
on a ramshackle over-the-counter (OTC) market. &quot;The shares can be traded
through local brokers which are neither accepted nor well known,&quot; says
Paul Do Kim, a securities analyst at Goldman Sachs (Asia) in Hong Kong.
&quot;These tend to advertise in local newspapers if they have Korea Telecom
shares to sell and more usually broke real estate and golf club memberships.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Adds Herman Chung, branch manager of James Capel in Seoul: &quot;There is
an official OTC market which was sanctioned by the government in 1992 and
is managed through the Korea Securities Dealers Association. But it is to
a large extent highly illiquid and Korea Telecom shares are not officially
listed on it or available for purchase. It is difficult to get a price for
the stock.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The fact that shares in what will be the country's second-largest listed
company are currently available only through classified ads seems to reflect
the somewhat desultory approach the Korean government has so far taken towards
privatization. &quot;There is technically a large programme to dispose of
state assets and the intention to do so is clearly there,&quot; says Cowell
of Kleinwort Benson, &quot;but the incapacity of the market to take in new
structures has slowed the pace of the programme. Privatizations here are
conceived differently to the west. Rather like in Japan, the authorities
seem to prefer to trickle stock out in dribs and drabs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Korea Telecom has made its inelegant entry to the market in just that way.
It was first established as a corporate entity under the 1981 Korea Telecom
Act, and the legislation was amended in 1989 to permit privatization. But
it was not until 1993 that shares were offered to the public. This was done
through a public auction restricted to individual investors who were asked
to submit postal offers and were awarded stock according to the value of
their bids over a government-established minimum price. Through this and
two subsequent auctions in 1994, 20% of Korea Telecom was sold to local
investors. At present, the government owns 80% of the shares, the public
10%, the Korea Pension Management Board 6% and Korea Telecom employees 4%.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was an unwieldy and decidedly unscientific process,&quot; says
the head of research at a foreign securities house in Seoul. &quot;The logistics
were handled by local brokerage companies with little attention paid to
a proper valuation of the company. The whole exercise seemed politically
inspired to give windfall profits to individuals on the electoral roll.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It was at least successful in this sense. By increasing the minimum bid
price before each new tranche on offer, the government inflated the value
of shares from W25,000 after the first auction to W30,000 and finally to
W47,000. Salesmen at local brokerage companies say that prices have changed
little since 1994, with W48,500 the going price in the secondary market
as of early January. <BR>
<BR>
Analysts say the company itself was given little input on the sale price
of the shares or its overall valuation. &quot;The Korean initial public
offering (IPO) process is best described as weird,&quot; says the head of
corporate finance at a foreign house in Seoul. &quot;The prices of shares
in all IPOs are calculated according to a largely meaningless securities
and exchange commission formula which ultimately means that all listing
prices are artificially low. The overriding ethos is to give the public
an additional incentive to participate in the stock market with the result
that everyone is happy at IPO time apart from the company involved.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Holland, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul, agrees. &quot;IPOs
do not tend to be valued on the basis of looking at comparative companies
and their price-earnings ratios,&quot; he says. &quot;Rather, they are just
done on a simplistic net asset value average. As a result of this, the average
first-day premium for subscriptions in Korea is about 65%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government had scheduled Korea Telecom for an IPO in 1995. But a combination
of factors conspired to prevent both this and the expected boost for the
company's existing shareholders. Buffeted by a series of external events
- including the Mexico crisis, the Barings collapse and the Sampoong department
store disaster which resulted in over 1,000 deaths - the KSE had a languorous
year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Though corporate earnings rose by an average 35% to 40%, the economy
grew by 9% and interest rates fell, the market index fell by 14% during
1995,&quot; says Holland of BZW. &quot;Average daily turnover fell by 35%
as individual investors continued a two-year trend as net sellers of equities
to the tune of w2 trilllion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Korea's growing reputation for political instability has also taken its
toll on Korea Telecom's listing plans. The autumn indictment, arrest and
trial of two former presidents - Chun Doo-hwan for alleged mutiny and Roh
Tae-woo for alleged bribery using a $575 million political slush fund -
diverted attention from privatization. Persistent rumours about incumbent
president Kim Young-sam's alleged use of the slush fund also forced the
government to focus more on politics than economics. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stagnant stock market</B> <BR>
<BR>
The subsequent arrest of eight top <I>chaebol</I> (conglomerate) leaders
and the implication of 35 of them in the slush-fund scandal have cast a
shadow over the image of Korea's business and financial community. &quot;Issues
like the corruption of politicians and the over-concentration of power in
the hands of the chaebols have become deeply rooted,&quot; says Kim of Ssangyong.
&quot;Together with the fact that certain institutions are perceived as
being manipulators of the stock market, this has produced a widespread anti-stock
market mood among investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hopes of a domestic listing of Korea Telecom in the first quarter of 1996
have faded in the persistent political fallout. Gone with them is the government's
private desire to placate the company's shareholders with an IPO before
National Assembly elections in April. &quot;The single-biggest constraint
on the progress of the privatization programme remains the fact that the
stock market is in the doldrums,&quot; says Steven Marvin, head of research
at Ssangyong. &quot;There is still very little demand, transaction volume
is low and there are major worries about the ability of the market to absorb
new issues.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Adding to the pressure on the government to list Korea Telecom is a backlog
of new issues from 1995 also thwarted by the market's travails. Analysts
say that over $3 billion of IPOs and rights issues are queuing up, including
large transactions for LG Semicon, Han Jung Heavy Industries, Hyundai Electronics
and Hyundai Heavy Industries. <BR>
<BR>
Time is running out for Korea Telecom for other reasons. By committing itself
to joining both the OECD and the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end
of the year, president Kim's self-avowed &quot;internationalizing and liberalizing&quot;
administration is forcing the company out of its protective cocoon. &quot;A
key prerequisite for membership of the WTO is the opening of the telecommunications
sector,&quot; says Kim of Goldman Sachs. &quot;Korea is now committed to
complete liberalization by the start of 1998, and the privatization of Korea
Telecom is seen as vital to its increased competitiveness and efficiency
before the entry of the likes of Nynex and US West in two years' time.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
There has also been increasing domestic competition. Korea Telecom's monopoly
of international phone services, worth W1 trillion, was broken in 1991 when
a former subsidiary, Dacom, was given access on favourable terms (with international
tariffs set 5% lower than its former parent's). Dacom's subsequent privatization
and listing on the KSE in 1993 has resulted in increased private-sector
involvement and management (Samsung Electronics is its largest shareholder
with a 6.2% stake) and a 26% share of the international market. From January,
it was also licensed to compete with Korea Telecom in the W2.4 trillion
domestic long-distance market. <BR>
<BR>
Korea Telecom is also being forced by the information and communications
ministry to divest its 20% stake in the highly profitable Korea Mobile Telecom
(KMT) during 1996. Established in 1984, KMT has an exclusive hold on cellular
services which will expire in June. Now firmly in the hands of the Sunkyong
Group, which owns a 16.8% stake via oil refiner Yukong, it offers a serious
challenge to Korea Telecom in the market's fastest-growing sector. This
will be augmented by Posco and the Kolon Group which have joint controlling
stakes in Shinsegi, the second cellular carrier, which will initiate services
later this year. <BR>
<BR>
Korea Telecom's revenue growth slowed to 3.5% (at W5.7 trillion) last year,
compared with compound annual growth of 11.2% for the five years between
1990 and 1994. &quot;There is a growing urgency to complete the privatization
of Korea Telecom,&quot; says Cowell. &quot;Its industry is now in a period
of rapid transition and it needs to raise money quickly to keep pace with
both its domestic and, in the near future, international competitors.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The exigency of Korea Telecom's listing, coupled with the continued stagnation
of the domestic market, serves to intensify conjecture in foreign financial
circles that a sizeable foreign tranche will be the only way to achieve
a successful IPO. &quot;It now looks entirely feasible that no new shares
will be offered when it lists in the domestic market and that a large international
offering will be required to meet the government's capital-raising needs,&quot;
says a director of corporate finance at a foreign securities house in Seoul.
<BR>
<BR>
With fees for Korean international equity deals offering 3% to the successful
global coordinator, there is no shortage of foreign houses eager to offer
their credentials. &quot;The mandate could be worth up to $60 million to
the winner,&quot; says the branch manager of a foreign investment bank in
Seoul. &quot;And though no beauty contest has yet been announced, already
we have seen a number of bankers beating a path to the MOFE in search of
the action.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch is thought to be an early favourite. It is the only bulge-bracket
house with full-branch status in Seoul and has already worked as an official
adviser to Korea Telecom. &quot;We have been committed to Korea for the
long term,&quot; says Julian Summer, head of the firm's equity corporate
finance in Hong Kong. &quot;And our telecoms achievements in Asia are well
documented.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Among other deals, Merrill was global coordinator for Indosat's $1.16 billion
privatization in 1994 and joint-lead for PT Telkom's $1.6 billion international
offering last year. &quot;We also have Korean telecoms experience,&quot;
says Summer, &quot;having led a very successful $150 million depositary
receipt issue for KMT last April.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreign line-up</B> <BR>
<BR>
Other US houses are keen to play on a perceived Korean predilection for
brand-name American advisers. Salomon Brothers points out that it lead-managed
Korea Telecom's $100 million yankee bond issue in 1993 - its only foray
into international capital markets to date - and also notes that it has
recently established a joint-venture securities house in Seoul with Anam
Industrial. With a team of nine analysts, Hannuri Salomon became conspicuous
in mid-January when chief executive officer Robert Denham hosted an opening
party at the Grand Hyatt Seoul that boasted KSE chairman Hong In-kie and
Youn Young-kyu, chairman of the Korea Securities Dealers Association, among
its guests. <BR>
<BR>
The longer-established Asian houses will not be giving up without a fight.
Remarking somewhat coyly that &quot;Jardine Fleming is always interested
in assisting Korean companies to maximize their value&quot;, its branch
manager and managing director Philip Smiley adds: &quot;We are the top-ranked
foreign house in Korea with post-tax profits of W4 billion last year. We
also managed to increase commission income by 30% in a year when turnover
was down by 35%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But before the foreign houses get too excited about their role in the potential
deal, several obstacles will need to be overcome. Not least is the MOFE's
conservatism. Its attempts to exert influence over the daily movements of
the KSE still mean, for example, that foreign buying limits of 15% are imposed
on almost all Korean stocks. Its use of a W5 trillion stock market stabilization
fund last May in an effort to boost the sagging market was accompanied by
a requirement that domestic institutional investors maintain daily net buying
positions. A W2 billion ceiling on all new equity issues to limit supply
is also technically still in place. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;To date the government and the MOFE have best been characterized by
their desire to retain control over all aspects of financial services,&quot;
says Smiley. &quot;A cautious, step-by-step approach to all things has been
the order of the day, together with a suspicion of foreign influence and
participation. The concept of foreign advisers and investment bankers remains
unfamiliar in Korea.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Given that a blanket ban on the foreign purchase of &quot;strategic&quot;
telecommunications companies is currently in place, this may put foreign
aspirations for a lucrative role in the privatization of Korea Telecom somewhat
in the shade. Local analysts also note that there is a restriction forbidding
the simultaneous listing of Korean companies on domestic and foreign stock
exchanges. Ssangyong's Marvin offers some words of comfort: &quot;The Korean
government has consistently shown great willingness to abruptly change plans
and rules whenever economic conditions demand.&quot; <p>

<H2>Custody battle</H2>
<B>How can investors square their desire to invest in the
newest emerging markets with the need to follow the legal requirements for
prudential custody arrangements?</B> <BR>
<I><B>By Christopher Stoakes</B></I><BR><BR> 
One emerging market specialist recalls how he helped to raise $1 million
by way of a capital increase for a Romanian company. &quot;Taking delivery
of the allotted securities,&quot; he recalls, &quot;meant standing at the
factory gates, holding a bag to put them in, with a couple of heavies for
protection, and bringing the securities back on the plane.&quot; In transactions
such as these there is a form of custody called broker custody which means
that the broker will deposit the securities in a local bank. But whether
such arrangements qualify as good custody is questionable since the securities
cannot be easily accessed. In some cases the securities are held by the
issuing company itself - hardly a prudential arrangement by western standards.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>C</B>ustody requirements emanate from the US. The Investment Company
Act 1940 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) 1974 each
provide a set of rules. The 1940 Act applies to mutual funds; ERISA to corporate
pension plans. The two sets of rules say, broadly, that custodians of these
funds' assets must be of high calibre, good conduct and adequate capitalization.
These requirements are referred to collquially as &quot;17(f)5&quot; after
the particular rule in the 1940 Act. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The base issue is whether, in the country in which you want to invest,
there is a custodian able to secure and hold the assets, who is blessed
by the regulations,&quot; says Albert Francke, a funds specialist and partner
in New York law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle. The more
obscure the market, the more likely that a fund's master custodian will
have a sub-custodian arrangement with a local bank, as opposed to a branch
of its own or the branch of another major bank. But that sub-custodian must
also meet the rules. The stumbling block is usually one of capitalization:
the local bank is likely to be insufficiently capitalized to qualify. Equally,
the local branch of an international bank may have the necessary capitalization
but lack sufficient custody expertise to qualify. <BR>
<BR>
In the UK, there is no equivalent legislation to the 1940 or 1974 Acts.
However, the Maxwell case - in which pension assets were moved around at
the whim of the sponsoring company - has prompted the Treasury and the Securities
and Investments Board to look afresh at the need for regulation. That review
is ongoing. &quot;Custody implies knowledge of where the assets are, the
ability to obtain accurate information and report it back to your client,&quot;
says Tim Cornick, financial services specialist and partner at London law
firm MacFarlanes. It follows that a custodian or sub-custodian that is unable
to report the status of a stock transaction may be failing in its duty,
a problem exacerbated in some emerging markets where, as Cornick notes,
&quot;settlement seems to take place on the pavements&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
With every emerging market there is delay before adequate sub-custodian
arrangements become available. Some North African markets, for example,
have recently been caught in this trap. &quot;The only solution is to send
a man across the desert, Lawrence of Arabia-style, to collect the securities
and bring them back on a motorbike,&quot; says Francke, who is on the board
of a number of investment companies. &quot;In other words to take physical
delivery and possession, and return the securities to an approved custodian.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>G</B>lobal custodians will put in place sub-custodian arrangements -
a time-consuming and expensive project in an emerging market - if the investment
is likely to pay off. &quot;We did that in Russia where we could see there
would be a great deal of demand. We worked closely both with local registrars
and with US mutual funds,&quot; says Peter Cameron, a risk manager in Global
Investment Services at Chase. &quot;However, there can be delays while you
obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, and the lack of local law - for
instance on the ring-fencing of customers' assets - can be a real drawback.
You need to be in a position where customers' assets cannot be seized by
the liquidator of the sub-custodian, or the customer acknowledges and takes
the market risks involved.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Apart from this impact of 17(f)5, there are three other considerations that
Cameron has to take into account. The first is government prohibition against
trade with certain countries such as Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Iraq -
the very countries which may be the next pre-emerging markets to attract
investor interest. &quot;It took a long time for the US ban against Vietnam
to be removed,&quot; says Cameron. &quot;The UK doesn't have as many and
tends to lift them more quickly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The second is boycott action at fund level. For example, some funds maintained
a boycott against anyone doing business with South Africa - a difficulty
for investment managers which might have inadvertently invested in a company
which was doing business there, even if the investment was not made on that
fund's behalf. <BR>
<BR>
<B>F</B>inally, the third consideration is the straightforward application
of country and credit risk. &quot;If a country's infrastructure is weak,
the chances are that its banking structure is too,&quot; says Cameron. &quot;The
credit rating of local banks offering sub-custody to global banks may be
in question, even though they may have a dematerialized settlement system
and adequate custody. We may have large balances washing across our nostro
account [the custodian's account with the sub-custodian] from settlement
cash we have sent out, plus proceeds from settlement of sales and income
that has still to be repatriated.&quot; In that context, credit risk is
critical. <BR>
<BR>
The same credit risk concerns can present what the emerging market specialist
sees as obstacles to pursuing the most attractive deals. &quot;That is where
fundamental analysis, a real knowledge of the local market and an ability
to put your case is crucial,&quot; says Guy Czartoryski, an analyst who
covers eastern European markets at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.<p>

<H3> <B>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER </B> </H3> <H3> <B>Only you
can save us from the killer derivatives </b></h3><br><b> Komarovsky falls helplessly into a
sinister web of deadly intrigue and in-flight food</B>
<P> The bank is on a cost-cutting drive so myself and JJ Ingersoll, the firm's
head of global focus, travel to New York first class for an important routine
meeting on whether we should use postage stamps or just fax everything. Alas, our
Coststream 2000 jet, recently re-christened "Give us a cut Greenspan", remains in
Broadgate. Times are that hard.

<p> We are sitting next to a quiet contemplative Swiss, when a
British Airstrikes hostess bends over and asks whether he is a fan of Vietnamese
cinema, dubbed in French. He replies Ja and is handed a small digital cassette.

<P> A miniature television lights up as he inserts the cassette and puts on his
headphones. Curious, I lean over. I can just hear a stern militaristic voice
&#173; if I slip my right leg over JJ's shoulder and lean my cheek on my food
tray. "Good morning, Mr Doerag," says the voice.

<P> "You have been selected from 600 elite branch managers for a mission on which
the fate of the Swiss-German speaking world rests. The mission is delicate and
will only be successful should you put into practice all the subtlety and
diligence gained in your peerless career opening savings accounts via lawyers in
Grand Caveman. LISTEN CAREFULLY.

<P> "The man you see before you is Allan Chaff, our COC (Chief Operating Cost).
Codename Shaft, he is the complex financial derivatives baron that threatens our
plans to turn CS First Barstool into a well-trained division of Imperial Swiss
Holdings. At present it is a mercenary guerrilla force, run by Chaff as a state
within a state. Our informants first became worried last year when he earned more
than the GDP of Ghana. We suspect he might be using these funds to set up a
powerful hedge fund equipped with enough ground-to-air interest rate product to
sink our formidable credit rating off the coast of Jutland. This is banned under
the 1979 BIS Treaty on delta co-efficient proliferation.

<P> "Your ultimate boss, Mr Big in Zurich, better known as Rainer Pauer Shower,
has decided to launch an all-out offensive from his base in the Cuckoo Lair where
he spends his days listening to the dulcet vocals of Marlene Dietrich and his
nights watching Mickey Mouse cartoons. As you may have heard, his recent
masterplan, codename 1812, to subjugate Union Bank of Ebner was prematurely
aborted when supply lines along the Bahnhofstrasse were cut by Nikolas Sinn
putting down his phone in a pincer movement. Sinn's scorched-earth initiative at
the annual general meeting saw our siege repelled by a cross-fire action with
snipers gossiping in newspapers. All was lost.

<P> "Mr Big needs a victory to re-affirm the borders of his empire. Building a
long wall will not be enough this time and he has brought in Luke M&uuml;llerice
whose previous experience includes disaster insurance, which makes his
credentials impeccable.

<P> "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to go in there as
chief executive and restructure the company, turning Chaff into an ordinary
highly-paid executive, properly motivated by a compensation scheme linked to the
performance of the Swiss stock exchange.

<P> "Your mission will be made more difficult by Chaff, who will doubtless leave
a number of high-octane derivatives in your way. Be particularly aware of the
inverse flipper-kickers he calls his secretaries, codenames Bambi and Flipper,
who have been known to strangle men to death at the first sign of a value-at-risk
audit. Approach his office with caution. Whatever you do, do not let him press
the red button on his desk which begins liquidating the firm's in-the-money
contracts and simultaneously activates a secret passageway to his triple-A
submarine, collateralized on the Hudson and fuelled with enough leverage to get
him to Panama. Should he do so, your licence to call an emergency board meeting
will activate immediately.

<P> "Your communications will be handled by your secretary Frau Beart, codename
Emmanuelle, who will be based in Zurich just next to your office, where she
always sits. We have provided you with a digital point-of-contact voice
communication device, also known as a mobile phone, to be found under your seat.
This is particularly useful if your car breaks down on the way from JFK airport,
in restaurants if you are expecting a call or, equally, if someone is trying to
throw you off the top of a skyscraper in protest at their bonus. Mr Chaff is
known to have eight such phones strategically located throughout the building. Be
warned.

<P> "Your pointman, should you need to activate him, is MC Rudloff, codename Alf,
a veteran of the firm who knows his way around the inner tracts of the
air-conditioning units like he knows the inner regions of Soho. However, Alf
should only be let loose in a grade one catastrophe situation. His
thermo-ballistic need to settle old scores, using his virtuoso syndication skills
and a potent Swiss-German, are highly dangerous. Exercise extreme caution. Should
you need an assassin you can re-activate our sleeper, Diamond R Furever, codename
Bob, now based in London and an expert with small-bore treasury instruments.

<P> "The other man you see on the screen is Daved Mulberry. Born: the White
Horse, Washington. Age: classified. Previous jobs: running Saudi Arabia; writing
pen-pal letters to Latin American debt-defaulters; and doing spell checks at the
US treasury. He recently shaved off his moustache during covert trips to Hungary

<H3>EMERGING MARKETS</H3
 <B>Edited by Ben Edwards</B> 
<H4>RUSSIA </H4>
<H2>Stability at last? </H2>
The last time Sergei Dubinin figured in the Russian government's roll call,
he had the dubious accolade of serving as temporary acting finance minister.
<BR>
<BR>
His tenure proved as shaky as his title. Just eight months into the job,
president Boris Yeltsin summarily sacked Dubinin for crimes against the
rouble in the wake of the currency's collapse in October 1994. This time
around, he will be hoping for something a little more permanent. <BR>
<BR>
Last month, Dubinin became Yeltsin's latest choice to fill the chairman's
hot-seat at the Central Bank of Russia. He replaces outgoing acting chairman
Tatiana Paramonova, whose candidature was twice rejected by the Duma, the
lower house of parliament. <BR>
<BR>
His choice appears to be a happy one. On November 21, the Duma cleared Dubinin's
appointment, after a half-hour debate, by the extraordinary margin of 338
to 1. &quot;This is a little odd, considering Dubinin is more reformist-minded
than Paramonova,&quot; says one Moscow-based economist. <BR>
<BR>
Even Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant leader of the extreme nationalist
Liberal Democratic Party, was in a magnanimous mood. &quot;We need stability,&quot;
he told assembled deputies before casting his vote. Should the prevailing
political winds prove equally favourable, the 44-year-old former economics
lecturer has a four-year term ahead of him. <BR>
<BR>
Will he last the distance? Much will depend on the fate of the rouble, which
has obediently traded within the R4,300 to R4,900 band established by Paramonova
this summer. The central bank has since promised to maintain the rouble
corridor at least until December 31. <BR>
<BR>
But the situation Dubinin inherits is not entirely benign. Although inflation
has fallen from a monthly 17.8% in January to 4.7% in October (up marginally
from 4.5% in September), it is still high. With the nominal exchange rate
stable for much of the year, the rouble has therefore appreciated considerably
against the dollar in real terms - by 73% between January 1 and October
31, according to the finance ministry. In turn, this is squeezing margins
in the vocal and politically-powerful export sector. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many of Russia's commodity exporters are now facing a double squeeze,&quot;
says P&auml;r Mellstr&ouml;m, head of research at Moscow-based brokers Brunswick.
&quot;World prices for pulp, base metals and steel are all falling. At the
same time, rouble costs for the exporters are inflating while dollar earnings
are flat.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At first glance, the high inflation rate is a puzzle. Both the finance ministry
and the central bank have kept scrupulously within monetary targets agreed
with the IMF this April. At the time, the belief was that inflation would
fall to 1% per month by the year end. <BR>
<BR>
The culprit has been the rapid growth in Russia's foreign exchange reserves,
which, including gold, stood at $13.3 billion by the end of September, according
to the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance. The
central bank has continued to buy these dollars using printed roubles. In
turn, these are swelling money supply growth. Unless the population is willing
to hold these additional rouble assets, such growth is demonstrably inflationary.
<BR>
<BR>
Which is where the IMF has gone wrong, says one Russian government source.
&quot;The IMF's assumptions about the population's willingness to hold roubles
given a stable exchange rate have proved over-optimistic,&quot; he says.
&quot;The fund did not believe that the continued accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves would be inflationary. It was wrong.&quot; The real level
of rouble bank deposits, for example, has continued to decline slightly
since the new exchange rate regime was introduced. <BR>
<BR>
Unless inflation falls further, Dubinin will face mounting resistance from
exporters to any prolonged maintenance of the rouble corridor. A minority
question his integrity and independence for this task. In his 13 months
out of government office, Dubinin took up jobs at Gazprom, the massive gas
monopoly which accounts for one fourth of Russia's exports, and at Gazprom's
pet bank, Bank Imperial. He thus becomes the third key member of Russia's
economic administration - after prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
and first deputy finance minister Andrei Vavilov - to have taken an
official wage from Gazprom. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, the gossip among government circles is that Dubinin did cave
in to pressure to relax monetary policy in the run-up to the rouble crisis
last October, when Sergei Shakrai, a deputy prime minister, demanded more
roubles for Russia's cash-strapped northern provinces. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This may be true,&quot; says one former colleague at the finance ministry,
&quot;but he finally gave in to pressure because he had not been formally
appointed as finance minister. His authority was circumscribed. But his
confirmation [as chairman of the central bank] by the Duma is a milestone
for economic reform in Russia.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;He is a very good, solid organizer,&quot; says the former colleague.
&quot;And he will maintain an independent, reformist line at the central
bank.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Clearly, Dubinin will need to keep his wits razor-sharp. It is not a quality
he is renowned for. In keeping with the reputation of his former profession,
the absent-minded professor once forgot to sign a major debt agreement at
a ceremony specifically devoted to this purpose. <B>Ben Edwards and Craig

<H4>PERU </H4>
<H2>Trouble ahead? </H2>
Latin American finance ministers must be getting a little tired of explaining
to foreign investors just why their current account deficits are no cause
for alarm. Jorge Camet of Peru has more talking to do than most. <BR>
<BR>
Peru will end 1995 with the dubious distinction of having the largest current
account deficit - as a percentage of GDP - in all of Latin America.
Forecasts for the deficit range from 6.1% at ING Barings to 7.4% at Chemical
Bank. <BR>
<BR>
The Peruvian administration is playing down analysts' concerns, saying that
foreign financing of the current account deficit remains readily available
and that imports are needed for capital-intensive projects. Heavy investment
in the mining sector will lead to an export boom between now and the end
of the decade, so their argument goes, and will resolve the imbalance. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our deficit is financed in a healthy way,&quot; says Camet, who was
in London last month to meet foreign investors. &quot;We receive mainly
direct investment - in the mining, tourism, fisheries and agro-industrial
sectors - rather than short-term capital inflows. You must not forget
that Korea, for example, lived for many years with a current account deficit.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But some analysts suggest there are worrying echoes of Mexico's external
position prior to the peso crisis last December. Should foreign investors
be concerned? According to Lars Schonander, head of research at ING Barings
in Lima: &quot;The vulnerability to a financially-induced external shock
is fairly limited.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Schonander points out that Peru has foreign reserves of $6 billion -
equivalent to about 10 months' worth of imports - whereas in November
of last year, Mexico's reserves were $17 billion, which was coverage for
only about two and a half months of imports. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, foreign portfolio investment in Peru, which is mostly concentrated
in the stock market rather than in fixed income instruments, remains tiny
compared to the $80 billion of portfolio investment that had been amassed
in Mexico by the time the crisis struck. &quot;It only took a relatively
small shift in portfolio investment [in Mexico] and reserves were gone.
In Peru, investment in the fixed income market is virtually nil and the
total in the stock market is about $1.8 billion, so if everybody wanted
to leave at once, there would still be a lot of reserves left,&quot; Schonander
says. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, there is a perceptible shift away from long-term direct investment
into more volatile short-term portfolio flows. Michael Hart at Salomon Brothers
in New York notes that direct investment peaked at $2.3 billion in 1994
but is likely to fade as the privatization programme comes to an end. During
the first six months of 1995, short-term flows stood at $1.3 billion, while
direct investment was only $500 million. According to Hart, these numbers
point to &quot;a significant shift in the financing structure of the current
account&quot; and &quot;increased reliance on this type of financing will
increase the vulnerability of the economy to adverse shocks within the next
12 to 18 months&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Not so, says Camet. He estimates that the government's privatization efforts
will raise an additional $6 billion in long-term foreign capital over the
next 12 to 24 months that the programme has to run. In addition, he says,
he is expecting a further $4.2 billion in associated foreign investment
commitments over the same period. It remains to be seen how realistic these
numbers will prove. <BR>
<BR>
With these difficulties in mind, foreign investors are applauding the efforts
being made by the government to dampen the economy with a highly austere
fiscal policy. Government expenditure has been cut back sharply in the wake
of the re-election of president Alberto Fujimori in April. Fujimori is now
well-positioned - as he begins a new term - to take some unpopular
decisions. <BR>
<BR>
Ironically, the current account numbers will be adversely affected during
1996 by the recent success of the Fujimori administration in agreeing, in
principle, a Brady debt restructuring which should be completed by next
summer. As a result of the accounting methodology used by the Peruvian authorities,
the resumption of payments on foreign bank debt will add somewhere between
$200 million and $250 million a year - almost 10% of the 1995 deficit
figure - to the current account deficit. <BR>
<BR>
Those numbers will help keep the pressure on the government next year, for
despite the differences between itself and Mexico, foreign investors are
going to be highly reluctant to help finance a large current account deficit.
&quot;The market is going to exert more discipline over Peru than it ever
did over Mexico,&quot; says Schonander at ING Barings. <B>Michael Marray</B>

<H4>ARGENTINA </H4>
<H2>Still scrambling </H2>
Argentina will finish 1995 much as it began it - scrambling for funds.
Yet, a mixture of luck, skill, and IMF flexibility has kept the country's
rigid monetary policy alive, defying hoards of Cassandras who predicted
that Buenos Aires would have to abandon its currency board system and follow
Mexico down the devaluation path. <BR>
<BR>
The country's latest lucky break has been the unexpected resuscitation of
the privatization process which was barely alive for most of the year. It
came with November's purchase by a Dow Chemical-led consortium of stakes
in two petrochemical companies for $357.5 million - about $100 million
more than most analysts had been expecting. <BR>
<BR>
Dow's purchase of 51% of Petroquimica Bahia Blanca, an ethylene plant, and
38% of Indupa, a polyethylene producer, took the markets by surprise. It
should not have done, since direct investments into Argentina - as
opposed to portfolio flows - have continued to be strong this year,
with multinationals betting on the country's ability to ride out the storm
in the medium term. <BR>
<BR>
Encouraged by this sale and by a two-week bull-run on the stock market -
prompted by president Carlos Menem's pursuit of emergency powers to cut
1996 expenditure - the government brought forward to December a series
of privatizations that had been mothballed earlier. These include 39% stakes
in two electricity utilities, Edesur and Edenor, which will be auctioned
off in blocks in mid-December. The operation is expected to raise $700 million
to $800 million. <BR>
<BR>
The treasury also hopes to garner $750 million through issuing a further
tranche of BONEX 89 bonds. A four-year bond, $500 million of which will
be offered by public auction, will be priced at Libor, with six-monthly
payments, and will be fungible with existing BONEX 89. The remaining $250
million will be swapped for government-bond coupons held by the central
bank. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, the treasury is counting on $1.2 billion from a tax moratorium:
a generous - some say desperate - package that pardons evaders
for past sins if they regularize their tax situation. It has already secured
an $800 million bridge loan from domestic banks on the basis of expected
results. <BR>
<BR>
In all, these funds should satisfy the IMF that Argentina has done enough
to meet 1995 fiscal targets. The Fund, not wishing to see another star pupil
go the way of Mexico, has taken a relaxed attitude to Argentina's fiscal
situation this year, scaling down its original demand for a $4.4 billion
surplus to a request for a merely balanced budget. <BR>
<BR>
Only weeks after the launch in March of a $7 billion IMF-led rescue package,
it became evident that Argentina could not generate a surplus. Its currency
board system - which demands that for every peso in circulation, there
be a dollar in the central bank - plunged the country into recession
much faster than anyone had expected. <BR>
<BR>
As confidence evaporated after Mexico, $8 billion in bank deposits fled
the country, shrinking the money supply and forcing down growth into negative
territory from a positive 7.2% in 1994. By shutting off demand and diverting
production into exports, Argentina reversed its trade deficit without having
to devalue, but the by-product was an alarming drop in tax receipts. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue fell by around 6%, in spite of a three point rise in VAT -
from 18% to 21% - and efforts to clamp down on tax evaders. The IMF,
having to elect between retracting its support for Buenos Aires or lowering
its expectations, chose the latter course. &quot;The IMF needs its success
stories too,&quot; says one debt trader. <BR>
<BR>
Even those revised targets will probably prove too tough and Argentina may
well fall short of equilibrium in 1995 by a few hundred million dollars.
Nicolas Carlisle, vice-president at JP Morgan in Buenos Aires, says this
is a creditable performance and believes Argentina is unlikely to issue
new debt until 1996. <BR>
<BR>
Carlisle is full of praise for the treasury's handling of international
issues this year, which saw Argentina return to the Euro debt markets far
more swiftly than anyone had predicted. In August, Buenos Aires switched
its attention from the US to Europe, launching a five-year Deutschmark-denominated
Eurobond, raising around $670 million. The yield of 344 basis points over
five-year Bunds was considered excellent by most analysts, given the searching
questions still being asked about the viability of Argentina's economic
plan. <BR>
<BR>
That Deutschmark issue was followed by other forays into - for Argentina
- unusual territory, with issues in yen, Swiss francs, Italian lira,
and in November, a $250 million extension of the Deutschmark bond. Yields
have generally been higher than those being paid in 1994, but below what
could have been expected. <BR>
<BR>
Explaining Argentina's success, Carlisle says: &quot;I think they've been
fairly opportunistic in seeking out pockets of demand in countries that
are willing to take on debt at lower spreads. It's been a very well thought-out
strategy.&quot; He singles out finance under-secretary Joaquin Cottani who,
he says, &quot;has done a terrific job&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
None of this means Argentina can breathe easily. Next year will again see
economy minister Domingo Cavallo playing the role of the Dutch boy with
his finger in the dyke, desperately trying to plug up the fiscal leaks gushing
out around him. <BR>
<BR>
Cavallo's 1996 budget is calculated on the basis of 5% GDP growth, an estimate
most independent analysts believe to be wildly optimistic. Fully aware of
this, president Menem, who has for the moment patched up a highly public
squabble with Cavallo, is seeking emergency powers to scrap state entities,
modify taxes and decree privatizations. <BR>
<BR>
In spite of domestic difficulties, which have seen unemployment rise to
a record 18.6% and many near-bankrupt provinces falling months behind in
wage payments to state employees, some investors remain surprisingly optimistic.
&quot;This year, they have survived a test of fire and proved their commitment
to sound monetary policy,&quot; says one New York-based analyst. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;All recessions end and so will Argentina's - well before the
masses get restless,&quot; according to a recent report from UBS Global
Research. &quot;Once recovered, Argentina will be the beneficiary of investor
confidence, reinforced by the nation's policy consistency during the current
period of distress.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It seems a safe bet that in 1996 Argentina will be testing that &quot;investor
confidence&quot;, in the form of a willingness to subscribe to new debt
issues. As in 1995, fiscal calculations for the coming year leave many unanswered
questions. The pursuit of answers is likely to see Argentina as an active
participant in the international debt markets next year. <B>David Pilling</B>

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS </H4>
<H2>IDB's private sector putsch </H2>
This month, two power projects, one in Honduras and one in Mexico, will
receive funds from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Both projects
are private ventures and, as such, will be the first to receive direct funding
from the IDB. <BR>
<BR>
The IDB has agreed to lend $75 million to a private consortium led by General
Electric and Bechtel to build and lease the second stage of the Samalayuca
power project in Mexico, and $10 million to Electricidad de Cortes to expand
its El Cosa power project in Honduras. <BR>
<BR>
Although the IDB's charter provides for direct lending to the private sector
without government guarantees, this will be the first time the regional
development bank has been authorized to do so. Up to 5% of the IDB's annual
lending programme, or roughly $350 million per year, will be available for
private sector projects which would previously have been managed by governments
or their agencies. The board of directors' decision was taken in April 1994
during capital replenishment discussions in Guadalajara, Mexico and came
as one of the conditions of the eighth replenishment, which increased the
IDB's capital base by almost two thirds, from $60.4 billion to $101 billion.
<BR>
<BR>
The IDB aims to act as a catalyst for further private sector funding for
Latin American infrastructure projects which have estimated funding needs
of between $50 and $60 billion annually. By partially guaranteeing commercial
bank loans and directly lending to infrastructure projects, the IDB intends
to bring funding to many projects for which commercial bank loans might
not otherwise be available. <BR>
<BR>
As long as private sector loans remain less than 5% of the IDB's loan portfolio,
says one London-based investment banker, there is little risk to its AAA
credit rating. For the moment, there is plenty of capital to support the
IDB's loan portfolio, which stood at $30.5 billion at the end of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Only if private sector lending were increased - to say 10% or 15% of
IDB lending - could there be cause for concern, says the banker. But
as one consultant to the IDB points out, it would be possible to ring-fence
private sector loans from the sovereign portfolio, thus avoiding all risk
of contamination. For the moment, however, the IDB is just going to dip
its toe in the water. <BR>
<BR>
This step into private sector lending raises important questions for all
development banks. One is how to structure existing private sector operations
to avoid an overlap of responsibilities. <BR>
<BR>
This issue has already surfaced at the World Bank, where incoming president
Jim Wolfensohn is wrestling with the problem of what to do with the Bank's
three private sector divisions, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Bank's private
sector development department. Suggestions so far have included the expansion
of the IFC's role and the merger of the IFC with the World Bank. <BR>
<BR>
The rumour in Washington is that Wolfensohn intends to place the three departments
under the direct control of one manager. One candidate for the job could
be Richard Frank, who recently moved from the IFC to become one of the three
managing directors at the World Bank. <BR>
<BR>
Plans for the future role of the IDB's private sector investment arm, the
Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC), have been temporarily put on
hold. The IIC will continue to provide smaller scale equity investment in
Latin America, while the IDB moves into larger scale infrastructure funding,
chiefly through loans made in conjunction with private sector banks. <B>Charles

<H3>
<B>Japan: the path of glacial change</B>
</H3>
<P>
<B>by David Roche</B>

<P>
I recently visited Japan again. Like a Charlie Chaplin movie, the action in Japan should jerk forward between time-frames. But it doesn't. Instead, it's a game of spot-the-difference, so little have the images shifted. Sure, there are more discount stores around. But the cab ride from the airport still costs $260, a club sandwich in the coffee shop of the Four Seasons is $25 and an orange juice $15. None of these prices would hold in a deregulated economy.

<P>
Last month's general election will change little either. The Liberal Democrats have reconsolidated their power. But vital reform of the tax system, the ministry of finance, Bank of Japan and the supply-side of the economy are likely to take at least another two or three elections. Many intelligent Japanese see this as the only way of maintaining stability. I see it as the key to mediocre economic performance.

<P>
It's true that Japan has changed the image it holds of itself. Instead of being the Land of the Rising Sun, it now sees itself as the Sunset Economy of Asia. Everyone talks of decline, of an ageing and disappearing workforce adjusting to lower growth, of becoming an Asian economic underperformer. For a country that could double its potential output simply by stopping discrimination against women, it's all a bit odd.

<P>
<B>Glacial change</B>

<P>
But therein lies the conundrum. To change Japan's new mediocre self-image means altering its culture radically. And Japan's culture is all about glacial change, except for moments of real crisis, and the moment of crisis has passed. Now the economy is gradually raising itself from recession. Employment is on the up. And the new government will rule out radical reform.

<P>
Japan's model is a top-down one. It's the only big first-world economy like that. It works like this: employment is a constant. Even during the worst recession since the war employment never fell and neither did real wages. This was achieved at the expense of a stinking return on capital and falling profit-share in national income. 

<P>
Japan is a corporate welfare state where companies are run to make nice products and employ nice people. Shareholders don't count. In most Japanese corporations I visited this time, I never got the sense that more than lip service was being paid to corporate governance for shareholders. That is better than a few years ago. Then, there was no lip service at all!

<P>
There's very little sign of radical change. The big companies are rationalizing by natural attrition at a snail's pace. Sony told me that real wages would have to rise even though they have too many people chasing too few jobs because "the government might be angry if they didn't"! An old and trusted Japanese friend, who is a senior portfolio manager, told me he won't invest in smaller, entrepreneurial corporations because talented Japanese only want to work for big prestigious companies.

<P>
When an economy recovers after a long recession you expect corporations to make big productivity gains to the benefit of profits. But in Japan, the current recovery is marked by falling productivity growth. So profits in Japan will grow much less than the consensus expects. Return on capital will remain paltry compared with the OECD average.

<P>
As corporations look after unemployment on their profit and loss accounts, the Japanese government doesn't have to take it on its books. So government in Japan is about 15% of GDP smaller than in Europe. However, in return, the government has to keep the economy ticking over by launching massive stimulus packages whenever an overvalued yen and lack of economic reform stops growth in its tracks. 

<P>
On paper, Japan's public sector budget deficit looks manageable at 4.5% of GDP for this fiscal year. But, if you exclude the social security surplus (which is needed to pay future unfunded pensions), Japan's budget deficit is nearer 8% of GDP. That can't last.

<P>
While the new government may announce a supplementary budget this month to provide some fiscal stimulus, Japan's finance ministry made it clear to me that it wants to balance the budget next fiscal year. To be more exact, the ministry wants to run a deficit no greater than its capital investment expenditure &#173; the so-called "golden rule" for public finances. That would ensure that public sector net worth stays a constant, and that current expenditures are matched by revenues. The ministry will do this by implementing measures already passed by the Diet &#173; namely, a hike in social security contributions by 85 basis points, an increase in sales tax from 3% to 5% in April 1997 to net &#165;4 trillion, and abolishing the income tax rebate introduced at the height of the recession (&#165;2 trillion). The bureaucrats will have their way, and these measures will not be reversed by the new government. I estimate that this will cut 1.5% off consumer purchasing power next year.

<P>
<B>Loose money</B>

<P>
The ministry also told me that an even weaker yen was essential to sustained recovery. That's hardly surprising, as the ministry recognizes the deflationary effect of the fiscal squeeze on domestic demand next year. It will have no hesitation in accelerating the deregulation of foreign exchange markets and forcing interest rates even lower to get capital moving offshore to stop the yen strengthening. 

<P>
And if I am right, and fiscal policy tightens, the Bank of Japan won't. So loose money will also keep the yen weak.

<P>
Nevertheless, I think the yen will eventually strengthen during 1997. To understand why, you have to look at the Japanese external payments figures. Japan's current account surplus has shrunk as the merchandise trade surplus has fallen and the deficit on services trade (mainly due to rising tourism) has risen. 

<P>
But these negative effects have been partly counteracted by the steady rise in income from Japan's ballooning stock of net external assets. That means any change in the trend on merchandise trade or tourism will quickly stop the fall in the current account surplus. And the weak yen will eventually do that.

<P>
Japan's import growth from Asia, although still very high, is now tapering off, while Japanese export growth to the US is now rising fast. So <I>overall</I> Japanese export growth is picking up. And the Japanese authorities possess a reduced arsenal to hold the exchange rate down. Interest rates can't fall that much more because they're already around zero in real terms. The tourism deficit will decline, while the factor income surplus from overseas assets will continue to rise. Thus, the overall services deficit will narrow.

<P>
Now the &#165;/$ rate is highly correlated with the relative current account balances of the US and Japan. My forecasts for these balances suggest that the yen will strengthen to &#165;95-100/$ by the end of next year.

<P>
In sum, it would be churlish to say that Japan is not a-changin'. But it's the sort of movie you'd go and see for plot and character rather than pace and thrill. One consequence is that reform and restructuring don't throw up any major investment themes. Those who think they do, like advocates of a big shift in corporate governance and super profitability stemming from overseas expansion, are simply mistaken.

<P>
So the arguments for investing in Japan are reduced to the cyclical. And they're not exciting. A cheap yen is already in the price of equities. Money will be made being long the yen, short Japanese government bonds and short equities when the cycle flips. But it could be some time coming.

<H3>ASIAN HOTELS</H3> 
<H2>Superlatives east of Suez </H2>
<H4>Many business travellers favour the international style, seeking certainty
and consistency in alien worlds. But comfort and modern conveniences need
not imply characterlessness. Gary Marchant reports on Asian hotels that
are proud of their past </H4>
Many of the finest hotels in east Asia date from the steamship and railway
era, and have retained their original character while adapting to the jet
age. Their spaciousness, old-world tranquillity, elegance and architecture
recall the age of leisurely journeys to faraway places. In those unhurried
days, genteel voyagers were accompanied by servants bearing massive trunks
- unlike today's travellers who frantically rush through airports clutching
carry-on bags. Most Asian capitals have one outstanding hotel which is a
legacy of its colonial days. Many have been restored in recent years and
now provide their city's best - and almost certainly most interesting -
hotel address. <BR>
<BR>
Hong Kong's sumptuous <B>Peninsula Hotel</B> opened on Fragrant Harbour
in 1928, in the early days of leisure travel when guests stayed for weeks.
Each room was a suite with dressing room, bathroom, sitting room, bedroom
and a boxroom for the storage of suitcases and trunks. The hotel's extensive
refrigeration facilities included storage for guests' furs. <BR>
<BR>
When Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and his entourage took over the
entire sixth-floor west wing, the hotel had to replace European toilets
with the Oriental squat-style. Hong Kongers remarked that the Peninsula
had gone &quot;native&quot;. The hotel boasted that its top dining room,
Gaddi's, was &quot;the finest restaurant east of Suez&quot;. (Suez was the
standard east/west demarcation line at that time). <BR>
<BR>
Noel Coward wrote part of his play <I>Private Lives</I> at the &quot;Pen&quot;,
as well as his famous song <I>Mad Dogs and Englishmen</I> which refers to
Hong Kong's noon-day gun. In the 1960s, James Clavell started his Asian
trilogy - <I>Noble House</I>, <I>Taipan</I> and <I>Shogun -</I> while staying
in the hotel. Movie-makers have long used the building as a setting. In
the 1970s, Roger Moore, as James Bond in <I>The Man With the Golden Gun,</I>
arrived at the hotel entrance in one of the Pen's green Rolls-Royces. <BR>
<BR>
The Lobby - Hong Kong's favourite meeting place since the Pen opened - remains
as much a symbol of Hong Kong as the squat green-and-white Star Ferries
that leave from the pier a few blocks away. The hotel opened a 30-storey,
132-room tower in 1994, and soon guests will be able to reach the Pen via
two rooftop helicopter pads when the new Chek Lap Kok airport opens. <BR>
<BR>
Across the Pearl River estuary from Hong Kong is Macau's <B>Bela Vista Hotel</B>
which overlooks the Praia Grande Bay. Built as a traditional colonial Portuguese
mansion in about 1870, it served as a hospital, sailors' home, school, military
headquarters and budget hotel before being declared an official monument
in 1979. Now it is perhaps the most romantic hotel on the South China coast.
<BR>
<BR>
After extensive refurbishment, the hotal reopened in 1992 as one of Asia's
few &quot;boutique&quot; hotels. With only eight suites, it offers the finest
rooms in Macau. Each suite has its own individual layout and decor: five
of these have private balconies and three (on the second floor) face the
bay. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sino-Lusitanian style</B> <BR>
<BR>
East meets west in the Bela Vista's blending of traditional Portuguese and
Oriental decor. The furniture includes hardwood headboards and wardrobes
from Portugal, and Chinese tables. The tiles used in the blue mosaic floors
of the lavish bathrooms were imported from Lisbon. The hotel's wrap-around
verandah is a spectacular place to relax and is rivalled only by the Bangkok
Oriental Hotel's riverside terrace. Although the Bela Vista's service doesn't
match the elegance, of the Oriental, in this relaxing setting it doesn't
seem to matter. Even those who can't afford the pricey suites can while
away the tropical afternoons here over drinks or a meal. <BR>
<BR>
In a city with numerous de luxe hotels, business travellers still regularly
vote the legendary <B>Bangkok Oriental </B>on the Chao Phrya (River of Kings)
the world's best. The Oriental - where Conrad, Coward, Kipling and other
spinners of tales-of-the-East have all stayed - is also the city's oldest
hotel. The original white, airy building is highly evocative of early Thailand
and, though two wings have been built since the hotel opened 120 years ago,
these additions do not intrude. <BR>
<BR>
The colonial-style lobby of the original building is now the Authors' Lounge
- an airy, genteel room with gleaming white walls hung with photographs
of old Bangkok, and full of luxuriant tropical plants, hand-crafted white
rattan furniture and a shelf of books donated by former authors-in-residence.
The coffee shop has special appeal to those whose fascination with the East
has come from books. <BR>
<BR>
The outdoor riverside terrace is one of Bangkok's most tempting settings
for eating and drinking. In 1922, while recuperating from malaria, Somerset
Maugham lounged there on a planter's chair, watching the river traffic.
He recalled the experience vividly in <I>A Gentleman in the Parlour</I>,
an account of his overland trip from Burma. The old-fashioned planters'
chairs are long gone, replaced by tables set along the balustrade whose
green ceramic pickets are draped with brilliant pink flowers of bougainvillaea.
As well as its history and riverside setting (many rooms have balconies
with river views), the Oriental's style, comfort and exquisite service ensure
its worldwide reputation. <BR>
<BR>
The Philippines' <B>Manila Hotel</B> - opened in 1912 when the country was
still a US territory - is also situated on a bay. Much of the history of
the young nation was enacted in the Manila Hotel - until recently the official
government guest house. From 1935 to 1941, US general Douglas MacArthur
lived there in the spacious penthouse suite, that several Japanese generals
- as well as premier Tojo - occupied during World War II. MacArthur claimed
to have &quot;liberated&quot; the suite personally by <BR>
by evicting the Japanese occupiers. The white stuccoed hotel, built in the
&quot;California missionary&quot; style, was renovated in 1976 using local
materials such as narra wood (a light Philippine mahogany), marble and local
stone, seashells and mother-of-pearl to create a distinctly Filipino atmosphere.
<BR>
<BR>
Certainly, the Manila has a different feel from the other historic Asian
hotels. The spacious rooms, which offer views of Manila Bay, the Walled
City of Intramuros and Rizal Park, have a distinct Filipino-Spanish flavour.
<BR>
<BR>
The hotel's vast 125-foot by 25-foot lobby is especially suited to people-watching.
Paunchy politicians in loose fitting <I>barongs</I> (shirts) waddle by and
haughty young Filipinas strut the length of the lobby like fashion models,
their high heels click-clicking along the marble floor. A popular sport
among some male guests is trying to sneak &quot;lady friends&quot; up to
their rooms. Idlers who observe the game from the lobby lounge sometimes
lay bets on the outcome. Many have made the long march from the front entrance,
past the reception desk, only to be met by the discreet floor manager at
the elevator. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The old man and the bar</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Manila Hotel's bars have refreshed a multitude of famous customers and
many admirers. In the late 1940s, author Ernest Hemingway, a learned barfly,
remarked in an enthusiastic letter to a friend: &quot;What a splendid home
the Manila is. I am reminded of my first honeymoon and oh ... how I wish
it would never end.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Asia's most venerable and gracious hotels include four operated by Armenian
entrepreneurs the Sarkies brothers at the turn of the century. Some have
stood the test of time better than others. <BR>
<BR>
When the Sarkies opened <B>The Strand</B> in 1901 in Rangoon, Burma (now
known as Yangon, Myanmar), it was touted, inevitably, as &quot;the finest
hostelry east of Suez&quot;. The British-built, neo-Palladian-style hotel
with its grand, columned portico was damaged by a bomb in World War II.
In later years, when travel to Burma was restricted, the hotel deteriorated
into a miserable state and was euphemistically described as &quot;a fine
example of crumbled colonialism&quot;. By the 1980s, the hotel was little
more than a shell, with waiters' footsteps echoing down the ghostly halls.
<BR>
<BR>
Now restored to its original splendour, The Strand reopened in 1993 as an
exclusive hotel with just 32 rooms, plus the Strand Suite. Furnished in
teak and cane, the hotel features the Strand Grill; a caf&eacute; serving
Burmese cuisine; a wood-panelled bar; marble-tiled and polished teak floors;
and the Lobby Lounge. The rooms have modern amenities such as satellite
TV. Guest rooms at the front of the hotel overlook the busy Yangon River.
<BR>
<BR>
In February this year, one of the Sarkies' lesser-known luxury lodgings
reopened as the <B>Hotel Majapahit</B> in Surabaya - Indonesia's second
largest city. The historic two-storey building, designed in the traditional
Dutch style, opened in 1910 as the Oranje Hotel. During the Japanese occupation
of Indonesia it became the Yamoto Hotel. Just after World War II, the building
was the site of a major clash between returning Dutch colonialists and fighters
for Indonesian independence. <BR>
<BR>
The hotel now looks part fort, part palace, with towers and open verandahs
overlooking landscaped gardens. Designers retained many of the original
features, such as the stained-glass windows, terazzo floors and colonial-style
balconies. The medium-sized hotel includes 150 deluxe guest rooms and suites,
including the 800 square metre presidential suite, the largest hotel suite
in Indonesia. <BR>
<BR>
Penang's <B>E&amp;O</B>, the only unreconstructed Sarkies hotel, was formed
by joining the Eastern and Oriental together in 1885. The 30-room E&amp;O
lodging house grew over the decades, until by 1927, guidebooks were giving
it the familiar accolade &quot;premier hotel east of Suez&quot;. Rudyard
Kipling, Herman Hesse and Noel Coward slept there, as well as the actors,
Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. In the early 1920s, proprietor Arshak
Sarkies was notorious for waltzing around the opulent ballroom balancing
a tumbler full of whisky on his bald head. <BR>
<BR>
Although it is now too run-down for most international business travellers,
the E&amp;O retains a faded elegance and is worth visiting for a drink or
dinner in the Anchor (Author's) Bar or on the Anchor Terrace overlooking
the Indian Ocean. In 1922, the E&amp;O boasted that, at 842 feet, it had
the &quot;longest seafront of any hotel in the world&quot;. The view across
the Straits, the palm trees, the ancient cannons from Penang Fort and the
cool sea breezes, haven't changed since the planters' era. <BR>
<BR>
Until recently, Singapore's <B>Raffles</B> - the most famous of the Sarkies
hotels - was a decaying but charming historic relic. The white colonial
building built in 1886 was still redolent of the 19th century. Planters,
traders, ship captains, military officers, remittance men and adventurers
all called the Raffles &quot;home&quot;. Conrad was inspired to write <I>Lord
Jim</I> at Raffles when he read a newspaper account of a British crew abandoning
a ship with 200 Mecca-bound passengers. Somerset Maugham wrote <I>Of Human
Bondage</I>, <I>The Moon and Sixpence</I> and <I>Rain</I> while a guest
here. Later, Noel Coward offended locals by describing Singapore as a &quot;first-rate
place for second-rate people&quot;. The hotel has always been an obligatory
stop for tourists who visit the historic Writers' Bar to sample Singapore
slings, the sweet frothy pink concoction invented here. <BR>
<BR>
But modernization and expansion has destroyed the Raffles. Although meticulous
attention supposedly was paid to historical and architectural detail, and
many of the original furnishings and artifacts remain, the result is disappointing.
The new Raffles, which reopened in 1991, feels more like an oversized, upmarket
tour-group hotel, with all the intimacy of a bus station. One American journalist
grumbled: &quot;They tried to give the Raffles a face-lift but they performed
a lobotomy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The once-spirited Long Bar is still there, and the tradition of customers
throwing peanut shells on the floor continues. But in a city where littering
is now a serious crime, the practice seems contrived. &quot;It's full of
confused tourists, terrified of dropping a matchstick on the ground in Singapore.
And yet they're standing in this fake bar, ankle-deep in peanut shells,&quot;
grumbles an old Singapore hand. &quot;They turned the Raffles into an adjunct
of the shopping arcade. It's not a hotel now, it's a theme park.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Business travellers who know Asia well prefer Singapore's lesser-known <B>Goodwood
Park</B>. Set on a small hill within a beautiful 27-hectare garden, the
gracious colonial hotel started life in 1899 as the German community's Teutonia
Club, but became a hotel after World War I. Despite its park-like setting,
the three-storey Goodwood Park is just off Orchard Road - Singapore's prime
residential and shopping district. Each of the 235 spacious rooms overlooks
the swimming pool or the gardens. Admirers wax lyrical about the opulent,
tower-top Brunei Suite, complete with private elevator, sauna, roof garden
and gold bathroom fixtures. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Queen slept here</B> <BR>
<BR>
Kuala Lumpur's finest hotel, the <B>Carcosa Seri Negara</B>,<B> </B>home
to Asian and European royalty, started out as two mansions - the Carcosa
and the Seri Negara - and was built at the turn of the century for the governor
of the Malay states and his guests. Following Queen Elizabeth II's stay
at the Carcosa in October 1989, the mansions were opened as an exclusive
hotel. Despite its secluded hilltop setting in the 99-hectare public Lakeside
Gardens, the hotel is just five minutes from Kuala Lumpur city centre. <BR>
<BR>
The eight suites in the Carcosa and the six in the Seri Negara are named
after Malaysian states. They are exceptionally spacious and feature huge
four-poster beds; massive bathrooms with Jacuzzi bathtubs big enough for
four; gold fixtures and showers the size of maids' bedrooms. Guests sitting
on the large verandah overlooking the park feel as if they are in a Malay
jungle. <BR>
<BR>
The <B>Titiwangsa</B> in Carcosa, the former British governor's house, is
perhaps the city's smallest, least-known but most congenial bar. The elegant,
comfortable chamber is furnished in its original colonial style, with panelled
walls and bar of local mahogany, cane chairs and a giant chequerboard floor
of white Italian and green local marble. At one end of the room, photographs
of the many heads of state who have stayed at the hotel (the unofficial
state guest house) hang on a &quot;wall of fame&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Grand hotels in Vietnam have a distinctly Gallic flavour. Hanoi's downtown
<B>Hotel Sofitel Metropole</B>, the capital's best, reflects the legacy
of the long-departed French colonists in architecture, music, wine and especially
ambience. Le Club bar is the most elegant gathering place in north Vietnam.
Low tables line the windows and tall French doors open on to the courtyard
with its swimming pool and adjacent Bamboo Bar, a popular summertime gathering
place. Only the violin and piano players' traditional attire - fitted silk
dress worn over trousers - indicates that this is Vietnam. <BR>
<BR>
The white four-storey hotel, constructed in 1911, is one of the grandest
buildings in Hanoi, a city of imposing (though mainly decaying) structures.
Several years ago, the Metropole was refurbished in the original 1920s style.
An additional 135-room wing opened this year, increasing room capacity to
244. <BR>
<BR>
New upmarket hotels have opened in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), in recent
years. For character, as well as location, the locally operated French-colonial-style
<B>Continental</B> is the preferred choice. The hotel (where an opening
scene of Graham Greene's 1955 novel <I>The Quiet American</I> was set) was
a favourite meeting place of the expatriate community in both the French
and American colonial eras. Greene whiled away many hours on the open-air
terrace (then known as the Continental Shelf), looking out on the broad
street at delicate young Vietnamese ladies in conical straw hats pedalling
their bicycles. <BR>
<BR>
The verandah, closed in several years ago, is now Chez Guido, a good Italian
restaurant, but the view of the street, and the two-wheeled traffic, remains
- with motorcycles rapidly replacing bicycles. Vietnam's famous rich, dark
coffee - as well as meals - is served in La Dolce Vita, an ice-cream bar
and caf&eacute; in the courtyard garden, an outdoor setting shielded from
Saigon's clamorous streets. Although the Continental is no longer de luxe,
every guest room is unique. Many feature tiled floors and ornately carved,
dark-wood headboards. <BR>
<BR>
Since it was never occupied by European powers, north-east Asia lacks colonial-style
hotels. Still, the capitals have places to stay that reflect a sense of
history and place. Although Seoul was devastated in the Korean War of 1950-53,
one of its de luxe hotels gives a distinct sense of &quot;Korean-ness&quot;
in its architecture and interior design. Guests arriving at the <B>Hotel
Shilla</B>, rated the country's best, enter the 57-hectare landscaped grounds
through a massive, ornate Korean gate with tiled roof and heavy wood doors
decorated in traditional geometric patterns. <BR>
<BR>
Next to the hotel tower, the attractive tiled-roof Yeong Bin Gwan annex,
built in 1967 as the official state guesthouse, resembles the many ancient
temples and palace buildings still found around the city. The Shilla purchased
the traditional Korean-style structure from the government in 1973 to use
as a banqueting hall and welcoming house for prominent guests. <BR>
<BR>
The hotel, which takes its name from the Shilla Dynasty (57BC to AD935),
Korea's golden age of art and culture, incorporates ancient decorations
and antiques in its rooms and restaurants. Young ladies dressed in traditional
<I>chima-chogori</I> (Korean-style dresses) greet arriving guests. <BR>
<BR>
Although most of Tokyo's hotels are relatively new, the <B>Imperial</B>
has a long history. When the government established the original Imperial
Hotel in 1890 in central Tokyo, it was one of Japan's first three-storey,
western-style buildings. American architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed
its replacement, which opened in 1923 and it was the only large building
in Tokyo to survive that year's earthquake. But the hotel was allowed to
deteriorate to the point where it was too difficult to maintain and too
small to operate profitably. Economics overrode sentiment, and the building
was demolished in 1967, with a new Imperial rising in its place in 1970.
In 1983, a 31-storey tower was opened near the main building. <BR>
<BR>
The new Imperial is the oldest of Tokyo's hotels, at least in terms of its
location. Because it was the first hotel built for foreign travellers, it
has a prime location, overlooking the Imperial Palace in spacious Hibiya
Park, and within walking distance of Tokyo rail station and the Ginza, a
commercial and shopping area well- known for its nightlife. <BR>
<BR>
The Imperial is popular with business travellers because of its choice of
restaurants (13) and bars (four), spacious rooms, by Japanese standards,
and views of Tokyo Bay, the Palace Gardens and Hibiya Park. The Old Imperial
Bar reflects the style of Frank Lloyd Wright and incorporates some bricks
from his original building. It is, without doubt, the finest Frank Lloyd
Wright-inspired bar east of Suez. <BR>

<H3>BACKSEAT </H3>
<H4>Charles Darwent is found stranded on the moon with Elvis Presley and
John F Kennedy </H4>
At last, the truth can be told. Among the showier <I>coups presidentielles</I>
already known to history fi the Bay of Pigs, the committing of ground
forces to Vietnam, that speech in Berlin fi one of the farthest-reaching
legacies of the late President Kennedy has remained hidden from the public
gaze for three decades and more. <BR>
<BR>
Picture the scene. Summer, 1962: a young woman and her prodigiously beautiful
and intelligent infant are staying in a London hotel, sent from the Caribbean
lest JFK's Cuban adventure unleash local nuclear holocaust. Unused to attending
to her children's toilettes herself, in those balmy days of domestic help,
the mother absent-mindedly plunges the aforementioned prodigy into his bath
without observing the first rule of bathtime etiquette, viz. the removal
of his clothes. At a stroke, President Kennedy's global drama becomes my
own: for yes, reader, I was that child. The die is cast. <BR>
<BR>
I draw this episode to your attention only because it places me uncannily
close to events that were shortly to become the <I>Ur</I>-source of perhaps
the most late-20th-century of all late 20th century political phenomena:
the conspiracy theory. Indeed, some might say too close. Even now, professional
conspiracists will be mulling over the part my bathtime trauma may have
played in those subsequent Dallas dark days. <BR>
<BR>
Feeble protests that I have never so much as met a grassy knoll or that,
aged four, my eye had not yet found that aquiline acuity it was to acquire
later in life will merely stiffen the finger of suspicion. That is the thing
about the true conspiracy theorist: the more watertight the insistence of
innocence, the more he will be convinced that the wool is being pulled over
his eyes. <BR>
<BR>
What was it about the Kennedy assassination that marked this blurring of
the watershed between what were once laughingly referred to as &quot;fact&quot;
and &quot;fiction&quot;? When Marcus Iunius Brutus took political backstabbing
to its logical conclusion in the Roman forum, no fellow senator set up a
commission to find out whether he had been acting as a cat's paw for the
Ostrogoths. Nor, so far as I know, has anyone ever suggested that Abraham
Lincoln had been the target of six further assassins skulking in the orchestra
pit at the Ford Theatre. <BR>
<BR>
Perversely enough, the culprit would appear to have been the revelatory
nature of the modern media. In the old eastern bloc, a sullen citizenry
filled the vacuum left by a lack of information with rumour and intrigue.
In what used to be known as the Free World a superfluity of public knowledge
would seem, oddly enough, to have had exactly the same effect. <BR>
<BR>
The fact that a home movie of JFK's assassination could be beamed fi
in glorious technicolor via the good offices of television fi into every
drawing-room in the US somehow induced a sense of communal guilt. Far from
revealing (as was doubtless intended) the truth about who did precisely
what and to whom in Dallas, television performed the ultimate in democratic
sleight-of-hand. Before, it had been said that any American child could
grow up to be president. Now, it seemed, he might also grow up to be the
presidential assassin. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the ins and outs of the matter, the most alarming thing about the
post-Dallas conspiracy bug was its virulence. Within a decade, the contagion
had spread around the world. By the time ex-Australian prime minister Harold
Holt disappeared in 1969 while swimming at a beach notorious for its treacherous
currents, only a small minority of his countrymen would leap to the tediously
obvious conclusion that their one-time leader had been swept off and drowned.
A rather larger constituency preferred to believe that the socialist ex-premier
had been spirited away by Chinese submarine to Beijing, there to plot the
final downfall of western capitalism. When, some years after his disappearance,
one Lindy Chamberlain claimed that her baby daughter had been consumed as
a form of <I>entr&eacute;e </I>by a passing wild dog at Australia's Ayer's
Rock, wags in Canberra joshed that federal police had decided to reopen
the Holt case and were actively searching for a dingo with a snorkel. <BR>
<BR>
The worrying thing about this jest is that there was doubtless a small but
vocal caucus of readers who believed it to be true. Afficionados of America's
yellow press will be familiar with the outpourings of the <I>National Enquirer</I>,
an admirable journal that dishes up a weekly menu of conspiracy theories
of the sort that suggest that Adolf Hitler and Elvis Presley have been found
living in uranistic bliss on the moon. The <I>Enquirer</I>'s readers would
appear to have taken TS Eliot's dictum about the willing suspension of disbelief
to heart: the more disbelievable the paper's story, the more willing their
suspension. Plausibility is for wimps. <BR>
<BR>
And this, too, is a quintessential part of the late 20th century conspiracy
theory. Suggest that Pierre B&eacute;r&eacute;gevoy lost the French presidential
election to Jacques Chirac because of his rather lacklustre manner in television
debates and your bar-room interlocutor will yawn in your face. Suggest instead
that unnamed Hidden Forces could not allow him to win because he and the
then British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, were in fact one and the same
person (the resemblance between the two was uncanny, after all, right down
to an unfortunate taste for loden) and he will ply you with strong drink.
Reason timorously that Margaret Thatcher merely died by the same political
sword by which she lived and fellow diners will consult their watches ostentatiously.
Observe that you have it on Good Authority that fi thanks to hormone
replacement therapy and an over-cordiale piece of entente at the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e
Palace one Sunday afternoon fi a frisky Mrs Thatcher had found herself
carrying Mr Mitterand's love child, and you will hold the table in thrall.
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, this is all good clean fun but it may also be more than that.
The (Groucho) Marxist corollary of conspiracism is that when everything
is believable, nothing is. One may believe no good of politicians, but one
may in the end also come to believe no ill of them. And that, gentle reader,
would be no fun at all. <p>

<H3> <B>FRONT END</B> </H3> 

<P> <B>Edited by Steven Irvine </B>

<H3> <B>Waiter serves Turkey</B> </H3> 

<P> The first step Necmettin Erbakan,
Turkey's Islamist prime minister, took was to give a 50% pay rise to civil
servants and pensioners. With the public sector borrowing requirement already
raised from 8.5% of GDP to 10%, the shocked market wanted to know where the money
would come from. "Allah will give us, we will give to them," soothed Erbakan. He
went on to promise to double the minimum wage and exempt it from tax, and erase
the interest payment on farmers' debts.

<P> Under him, he announced, Turkey would become a "waiter state", putting food
on the table of the low-income masses who voted for his Welfare Party (Refah).
But the doubting Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), lacking faith that spiritual
aid would be forthcoming in the form of hard cash, sent a circular to clients
advising them to sell Turkish stock. The visionless Sakura Bank of Japan decided
to stop taking Turkish risk until the situation clarified.

<P> Before coming to power Erbakan had conjured up the shining image of an
Islamic common market which he would establish, and promised to replace
currencies in all Islamic countries with the Islamic dinar.

<P> But perhaps Erbakan's words should not be taken at face value. B&uuml;lent
Ecevit, ex-prime minister and chairman of the Democratic Left Party recently told
parliament that, when he and Erbakan were in coalition in 1974, one morning he
opened the newspaper to see that his partner had declared that Turkey would build
100,000 planes and tanks.

<P> "How are we going to build 100,000 planes and tanks? What do we need 100,000
planes and tanks for?" he asked Erbakan. "In politics," replied Erbakan, "such
declarations should be taken not literally but as declarations of
intent."&#009;<B>Metin Munir</B>

<H3> <B>Dial Brussels for the euro-hotline</B> </H3> 

<P> They take European
monetary union very seriously in Brussels, now the site of the world's first
euro-hotline, set up in July by Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL).

<P> The telephone service is advertised at the bottom of every customer's
statement. "EMU will happen soon," says Eric Tashman, who created the service.
"We have less than 900 days to go."

<P> BBL reports it has received 1,500 calls, and tells inquisitive callers that
Benelux and Austria will join in the first stage with France and Germany. It
gives Ireland and Denmark a 75% chance of joining. Spain is given 40%, the UK
30%, and Italy 20%. Greece has a chance of "1% or something like that".

<P> The BBL team are commonly asked whether monetary union is just a sly repeat
of the Gutt operation, named after Camille Gutt, who as minister of finance after
World War II recalled the money supply to catch people who had profiteered during
the war. Belgians are now concerned that their hidden tax-free fortunes in
Luxembourg will be exposed.<B>Steven Irvine</B>

<H3> <B>Too few natty dressers at NatWest</B> </H3> 

<P> "It has been the biggest
talking point at the bank since the takeover," says a director of NatWest
Markets, following the acquisition of Greenwich Capital on June 11. He is, of
course, talking about dressing down. "It is symbolic of a culture change," adds
the director, "but there are some die-hards who are determined to resist it."

<P> Chaos, confusion and colour-clashes followed the bank's liberalizing dress
measure as traders went long Ralph Lauren and short Thomas Pink. On Tuesday, the
day of the acquisition, a memo anounced the new dress code (casual on Friday); by
Thursday it emerged that the FX and treasury division chiefs had not confirmed
the deal.

<P> Blame television. When NatWest economists are being interviewed, producers
like to place them in front of the bank's photogenic FX dealing room with its
tiers of concentric rings. The bosses were worried that pictures of traders in
jeans and T-shirts might tarnish the bank's image.

<P> Others believe their objections were more a case of a fear of a
cross-Atlantic cultural invasion.

<P> But Stephen Colton, a manager in the bank's public relations department,
strongly denies that the two events were connected. "That the two announcements
were made on the same day was purely coincidental," he says. As to what the dress
ruling is now, he hints that a compromise solution has been reached between the
warring factions. "The decision about informal dress will be decided on a
case-by-case basis at a department's discretion. For instance, my boss will let
us wear smart casuals, unless we meet clients, in which case we should wear
normal business attire. As for me, I'll continue to wear a suit anyway. It puts
me in the right frame of mind for work."
<B>Rupert Gordon-Walker </B>

<H3> <B>Poor Korea moves</B> </H3> 

<P> "Let me appeal to you not to miss this
chance to finally grab at a superb investment opportunity," begged Kim Jong U,
North Korea's new economic supremo, during a 12-day, four-city tour of Japan.

<P> The audience of stony-faced cadres of the pro-Pyongyang association of Korean
residents in Japan sat politely through a promotional video for a zone of 300
square miles (775 square kilometres) in north-east Rajin-Sonbong, close to the
borders with China and Russia.

<P> Foreign investment would of course not be welcome anywhere else, but within
this area capitalist viruses would be given free rein to flourish. <I>"</I>You
can rest assured that the state will not interfere in legitimate economic
activities," Kim said. "Even offshore banking business is open to potential
investors."

<P> A hard sell was certainly needed. The entire zone has a population of only
140,000, and virtually nil infrastructure. The trip from Pyongyang takes 22
hours. Another expert, Kim Su Yong, professor of economics at Kim Il Sung
University, told the meeting coolly that "$4 billion" would have to be spent on
infrastructure.

<P> Professor Kim piled on the pressure. ING, he declared, had spent "$30 million
on a headquarters in Rajin-Sonbong and an office in Pyongyang". Keith Chiddy, the
new general manager for ING's joint venture North East Asia Bank in North Korea,
was startled to hear this. ING has only risked capital of Dm3 million ($2
million), which it keeps banked in Europe, and none of its staff have ever
visited Rajin-Sonbong, where an ING presence does not exist.

<P> The Unido (UN Industrial Development Organization) brochure boasts that
"Boeing, Chrysler, GM, Siemens, Alcatel and Erikson have all looked at
opportunities within the zone". Good try, that: unfortunately, not one of these
has put in any money.

<P> The advertised transport links to Russia were another surprise, as passenger
services were ended about 10 years ago.

<P> One wonders what the late Great Leader would think of Unido's main pitch for
the zone &#173; cheap labour. "Wages are less than a third of those in southern
China's coastal zone ... The minimum wage is just $80 per month," enthused the
brochure. "You also get more for your money. The working week is still six
days."<B>Peter McGill</B>

<H3> <B>Heavyweight denials</B> </H3> 

<P> Doth Inkombank protest too much?
Russia's fifth largest bank, and its president Vladimir Vinogradov spent an
otherwise jubilant July complaining of the "mudslinging" of unnamed competitors
who asserted that it may have liquidity problems.

<P> Heavyweight support followed. Russian Bank Association head Sergei Yegorov
stood by Vinogradov at a July 11 press conference, and promised that the whisper
campaign would be scrutinized by the association's ethics committee. Central Bank
deputy director Alexander Khandruyev further decried it as a "mean trick", while
Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov implored depositors to ignore the "mendacious articles
in the media".

<P> In fact, the concern about Inkombank was not entirely scurrilous. A draft of
a central bank audit leaked to the press found "a real threat that the bank will
not fulfill its obligations to clients, depositors and creditors". But this
conclusion was overruled at central bank headquarters.

<P> This difference of interpretation can only be explained by a disagreement
over the value of Inkombank's fixed assets, particularly real estate, which under
Russian accounting rules count as capital.

<P> But &#173; typically for Russia &#173; <BR> the affair has a juicier
political underpinning. Inkombank chairman Vladimir Groshev has apparently caught
the ear of General Alexander Lebed, and is openly angling for appointment as the
security council chief's economic deputy. In the midst of the rumour fracas,
Inkombank found time to announce that it would create a $5 million fund to fight
organized crime and corruption, Lebed's famous pet peeves.

<P> "This is a political battle," commented Valery Mironov, chief of research at
the Moscow brokerage C&amp;A. "Competitors who want to stop Groshev are behind
the talk."

<P> A still murkier interpretation gaining an uncomfortable level of credence
around town is that Vinogradov, an ethnic Russian, came under attack from a cabal
of Jewish bankers led by Mikhail Khodorkovsky of arch-rival Menatep. This kind of
rumour helps nobody.<B>Craig Mellow</B>

<H3> <B>Trading the floor's use</B> </H3> 

<P> The buildings that house Europe's
stock exchanges have always been rather more grand than the volumes of business
transacted there. Oslo boasts a mock-Grecian temple, while the Milan bourse
rattles around inside a neo-Stalinist fortress. (Visitors have to go through a
sinister ritual of handing in their passports.) But now that electronic trading
is installed in many European bourses, stock exchanges are facing the ticklish
problem of how to occupy their empty trading floors.

<P> Brussels has come up with an ingenious solution &#173; it's allowing one of
its larger members, the Belgo-Dutch Fortis group, to host concerts in the
building. "They seem convinced that the acoustics are right," says Anne
Vleminckx, one of the managing directors at the bourse. Vleminckx is also
negotiating a deal with a Belgian chamber ensemble, I Fiamminghi, which would
like to hold 10 concerts there every year. "It's a service to our members and a
way to get people in and tell them that the stock exchange still exists," she
explains.

<P> The Stockholm Stock Exchange is also using its space to provide
entertainment. Bourse chairman Bengt Ryd&eacute;n allows a well-known Swedish
opera singer to rehearse on the redundant floor. In return he gives occasional
free concerts to members and their guests.

<P> Frankfurt, on the other hand, can't bear to abandon the past. Once physical
trading ceases in a couple of years, it's thinking of converting its large
trading floor into a museum of open outcry.

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<H2>German reform: promise out of pain </H2>
<B>by David Roche</B> <BR>
<BR>
Germany is facing a decisive political shift as dramatic as the fall of
the Berlin Wall, but much healthier for its economy and financial assets.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Jobs and Growth plan aims to cut 2% of gdp off
the budget deficit, shrink government, free up small-company labour practices
and reduce anti-work social security benefits. Other measures are being
taken to liberalize, such as opening up the energy markets and extending
shopping hours. And I think that the bulk of these reforms are likely to
be implemented. <BR>
<BR>
In Chancellor Kohl, Germany has the west's only living political leader
whose name will be remembered in 20 years. He is the antithesis of an economic
animal, but his political skill, vision and control of his party are remarkable.
And now he's started leading Germany in the right economic direction. Combined
with the extension of the German economic machine into eastern Europe, this
will produce a powerful Germany that surpasses the dreams of many (and the
nightmares of the French authors of Maastricht) within 10 years. The consensual
model of <I>Mitbestimmung</I> by which Germany has been ruled since World
War II, with power split evenly between the Bonn political machine, the
corporate sector, the Bundesbank and labour unions, is dead. <BR>
<BR>
Kohl-the-uneconomic has undergone a Pauline conversion on the road to Maastricht.
He clearly now believes that Germany has a major competitiveness problem;
that the state can't solve it by using macro measures and traditional job-boosting
pacts; and that the German consumer/employee will vote him out of office
unless he delivers higher living standards and a feel-good <I>Faktor. </I>Kohl
now knows that he can achieve this only by supply-side reform and by shrinking
government. He's tried everything else, including the world's biggest Keynesian
boost after the fall of the Wall. <BR>
<BR>
The impetus for change is coming not only from the top in Bonn; it stems
from the corporate sector, too. The employers have scrapped the Alliance
for Jobs. They want to put an end to collective national bargaining for
everything beyond basic pay and hours. Wage deals are increasingly being
struck locally, in return for productivity gains. And Germany's demographic
time-bomb is on its way to producing an Anglo-Saxon-style world of funded
pension funds and sharp shareholder investors. Not unnaturally, more and
more German companies are changing philosophy to maximize shareholder wealth
and walking away from the consensual model of running their businesses in
partnership with trade unions. <BR>
<BR>
Most remarkable is the fact that the entire programme contains no reference
to European monetary union (emu) or to the Maastricht criteria for entering
it. Kohl is in the business of providing German business and German jobs
for German people. Meeting the Maastricht criteria may be the happy fallout,
but they are not one of the chancellor's targets in this programme. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Radical reform package</B> <BR>
<BR>
Kohl's conversion to radical reform came with the trouncing of the opposition
Social Democrats (spd) in three L&auml;nder elections in March. This coincided
with the collapse of the Alliance for Jobs between government, unions and
the corporate sector. That chunk of economic irrationality sought to create
jobs in return for stable wages. It ignored the fact that Germany's problems
are not the rate of wage increases but absolute<I> </I>labour costs (German
car workers cost dm60 an hour, French ones half as much). And the problem
of labour markets is not the absence of agreements, but the existence of
too many sclerotic ones that stop people working. The Alliance for Jobs
was destined to be Kohl's last attempt to work with the labour unions to
produce the jobs that Kohl needs in order to keep his own job and his Christian
Democrats (cdu) in power. <BR>
<BR>
The L&auml;nder elections in March showed Kohl that Germans still consider
the spd too economically irresponsible to be in office. It was tantamount
to granting Kohl a licence for economic change. He grabbed it and emerged
like a man awakening from a long sleep. He promptly introduced a legislative
programme that is so far-reaching and complex that it is being criticized
by all and sundry as incoherent. It is anything but. Of course, the programme
makes difficult and boring reading - but then many great legislative
departures do. <BR>
<BR>
What the package seeks to achieve is change so radical (and initially painful)
that only a German government could inflict it. A French or Italian government
could never dream of shaking its citizens up like this. Expect the German
unions to protest, but don't expect riots and reversals. <BR>
<BR>
Kohl's programme can be split into six parts: <BR>
<BR>
1) <I>Balancing the budget</I> The package will eventually chop 1.5% of
gdp off the budget deficit. All the measures are expenditure cuts -
there are no tax increases! According to our sums, that means Germany will
hit the Maastricht criteria even if it maintains only 2% annual real gdp
growth between now and 1998. <BR>
<BR>
2) <I>Reducing the size of government</I> from 50% to 46% of gdp by 2000.
<BR>
<BR>
3) <I>Comprehensive tax reform</I> which will simplify tax structure to
three simple bands, slash marginal rates and reward high-fliers and risk-takers,
as well as reduce tax avoidance and fraud. The wealth tax will be abolished.
And the cost to employers of home-helps will be tax-deductible, to create
jobs. <BR>
<BR>
4) <I>Freeing up labour markets</I> for small companies employing 10 or
fewer people. Such companies account for 80% of total corporations registered
in Germany and around two-thirds of employment. <BR>
<BR>
5) <I>Reducing the burden of social security payments</I> for the corporate
sector and for the state, by cutting benefits. <BR>
<BR>
6) <I>Deregulating markets</I> The government wants to open up the energy
market and is building a consensus for longer opening hours for shops. <BR>
<BR>
Before anyone criticizes my views, I'm not saying this programme is perfect.
Labour liberalization needs to go much further. Subsidies to industry of
between dm150 billion ($98 billion) and dm180 billion (between 4% and 5%
of gdp) have not been cut and should be, though there is a proposal in the
50-point Action Programme for Jobs and Investment to reduce coal subsidies,
with effect from 1999. And a lot of these measures, such as tax reform,
are slow-burners whose beneficial effects won't be felt until the next century.
But at least Germany is travelling down the right road. <BR>
<BR>
The programme is radical, but will it succeed? Kohl's strategy is to get
the package implemented in such a way that it won't get torn to shreds in
parliament (where the spd has the majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house).
It will inflict economic pain now, in return for economic gain in time for
legislative elections in 1998. Kohl has carefully timed it so that there
are no significant elections in Germany in 1996 and 1997 (only Lower Saxony
in September 1996, Hesse in March 1997 and Hamburg in autumn 1997). <BR>
<BR>
At first glance the legislative package may look like an egg splattered
against a wall. In reality, it is a clever political construct designed
to maximize the chances that it will be implemented. First, on tax reform,
the spd agrees with most of the measures because it too perceives the burden
of taxation as being unfairly distributed in Germany. The complexity of
the current system allows the rich to escape most taxes. Second, measures
to shrink government and budget deficits are designed to pass into legislation
almost without spd support. Of the total spending cuts of dm70 billion (2%
of gdp), almost dm50 billion can be implemented without agreement from the
spd. That's because the related measures either don't have to go to the
Bundesrat at all (if they don't affect L&auml;nder finances), or because
the degree of support they need in the Bundesrat means they can pass without
spd support. A further dm5 billion to dm10 billion of cuts are <I>likely</I>
to get through. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Long-term gains</B> <BR>
<BR>
There are some key implications for Germany of this major shift in its economic
model. First, Kohl and the cdu/csu/fdp alliance will run again in 1998 and
win. Second, short-term German growth will suffer, but long-term sustainable
growth will be raised. Third, the deindustrialization of Germany, through
the relocation of industry to eastern Europe and other emerging economies,
will happen more smoothly. That's because swifter job creation in the small-company
and service sector will absorb labour shed by the bigger industrial companies
as they move abroad. Fourth, Germany will remain the European economy with
the lowest inflation rate. Bunds, the Deutschmark and equities will benefit,
despite short-term margin pressure on industry from a stronger Deutschmark
and a deflationary fiscal stance. Fifth, interest rates will be ratcheted
down structurally, both because the fiscal stance will be less stimulative
and because structural inflation will be reduced. Finally, and most important,
far from strengthening the likelihood of emu happening, Germany will create
a bigger quality gap between itself and the rest of Europe. The rest will
appear to be still tinkering with big government and practices that hamper
the free market. The biggest fall guy will be France, whose financial assets
price in a successful emu, but which will now be quite incapable of getting
anywhere near German quality (fiscal or otherwise). <BR>
<BR>
Bunds and the Deutschmark will be beneficiaries of these reforms, despite
the negative impact on trade and capital accounts of globalizing the German
economy and relocating factories abroad. German equities are also likely
to be major beneficiaries. I estimate that German economic reform could
add 0.25% annually to long-term earnings-per-share growth rates and cut
0.5% off long-term interest rates. That would boost the internal rate of
return on German equities. And it would reduce the long-run risk-free rate
of return. So, in the future, investors should get paid more to hold equities
than they did in the past. <BR>
<BR>
The short-term impact of the Kohl programme is undeniably deflationary.
There may also be some hefty initial restructuring costs to be debited to
Germany gmbh's profit-and-loss. But the long-term effects are unequivocally
positive for the corporate sector. The removal of costly market distortions,
such as high taxes offset by widespread subsidies and exemptions, will raise
efficiency. The impact of this is highly dynamic. <BR>
<BR>
This is going to be one of the rare high-quality restructuring surprises
in the world. In the short term, German equities may well get cheaper as
short-term interest rates rise and if doubts grow about the viability of
emu. That would be the ideal buying opportunity. <bR><BR><BR>

<H4>INTERNATIONAL BONDS </H4>
<H2>Testing the global bond market </H2>
Sitting together in one medium-sized meeting room at <I>Euromoney</I>'s
international borrowers and investors conference in London last month were
two women and four men who between them, for the year to date, represented
56% of new investment grade bond issues in the US. <BR>
<BR>
The six main government sponsored entities (GSEs), Freddie Mac, Federal
Home Loan Bank System, Fannie Mae, Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp,
Tennessee Valley Authority and Sallie Mae, contrive to churn out mind-boggling
statistics. As David Smith, chief financial officer of TVA joked, the best
thing about sitting on such a panel is that only among these peers can he
talk about having total debt outstanding of <I>only</I> $27 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Take Federal Home Loan Bank, which funds the non-conventional mortgage lending
of 5,800 member depository institutions. Last year in the US, it raised
$116 billion, through 2,216 separate issues with an average size of $59
million. That works out at between 10 and 11 deals each business day from
a single borrower: surely, an origination officer's dream. In the first
quarter of this year, it was borrowing at such a rate that it was on track
to raise $172 billion by the end of 1996. But its borrowing team has calmed
down a little since then, as expectations of interest rate rises have pushed
its callable debt (78% of total out-standing<B> </B>term debt) out of the
money. <BR>
<BR>
Freddie Mac sold $31 billion of long-term debt last year and will raise
between $30 billion and $35 billion in 1996. It also rolled over $800 billion
of (short-term) discount notes last year with $50 billion outstanding at
the end of 1995. Since January, these notes have been offered for sale continuously
around the world in local markets, at local time. <BR>
<BR>
Fannie Mae plans to raise between $60 billion and $70 billion this year.
Sallie Mae's requirement is a more paltry $15 billion to $20 billion of
long-term debt. <BR>
<BR>
It's only in comparison with such huge sums that the agencies' activities
in the international markets look modest. In the year since <I>Euromoney</I>'s
1995 conference, they have together raised $20 billion in 39 international
deals. The scale of their domestic borrowing is a reminder to bankers and
investors that the agencies together might create a huge splash in the international
bond markets. Most are weighing up the benefits of broadening their investor
base against the possible higher costs outside their home market. <BR>
<BR>
So far their experiences have been mixed. Federal Farm Credit has yet to
borrow outside the US, but intends to this autumn, according to executive
vice-president, Lee Nash. It will be the last agency to take that leap.
Fannie Mae, by contrast hopes to raise between 10% and 15% of its funds
from global markets. So far, it has sold 17 deals, including callable, bullet
deals and even three non-dollar global bonds, all together raising $12.2
billion. Five of these were for over $1 billion. It has also rolled over
$28 billion of short-term discount notes on which it has posted levels during
London hours since February 1995. <BR>
<BR>
David Levine, director of debt marketing strategy at Fannie Mae, is enthusiastic
about the benefits. He points out that a recent domestic issue of five-year
bonds launched at 16 basis points (bp) over treasuries saw its spread tighten
following a strong performance for its global bonds. <BR>
<BR>
Others are not so sure. Federal Home Loan Bank wasn't taking half measures
when it first entered the international markets in 1995. It set up a $20
billion borrowing facility and issued $5.5 billion last year. But in the
first six months of 1996, it has raised just $750 million from international
markets through one callable and one step-up deal. Wallace describes it
as &quot;the single largest source of frustration for us. We seem uniquely
un-suited for a market that expects issuers to sell $500 million to $1 billion
at a time.&quot; In the US, its average deal size remains between $55 million
and $60 million, and it prides itself on responding with great flexibility
to the funding requirements of its members. <BR>
<BR>
But Wallace is not entirely dis-couraged. &quot;We will be trying to bring
our MTN tool-box to the international markets and we are considering the
establishment of an international discount note programme within a couple
of months.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, he sees a real chance to develop a callable debt market
in Europe. The agencies, except for TVA, face considerable prepayment risk
on their asset side and need to build matching flexibility into their portfolios
of liabilities. International investors remain suspicious of callable bonds.
One questioner at the conference asked how, when conventional bullet bonds
of an agency might yield 12bp over treasuries, callable deals for the same
credit could be sold on an option-adjusted spread of 6bp over treasuries
or even less. The implication: investors are not receiving adequate return
for granting call options. <BR>
<BR>
How to assess the right compensation to investors for taking convexity risk
is a subject of some debate among market participants. Even calculating
the option-adjusted spread on a new issue is not straightforward: it requires
assumptions about volatilities and yield curves. <BR>
<BR>
More broadly, the agencies argue that, if American investors are prepared
to buy them, international investors may eventually accept callable bonds.
When a bubble of new issues arose in the American mortgage-backed securities
market in 1993, built on exotic structures and insupportable options pricing,
it quickly burst and a $350 billion a year primary market disappeared almost
overnight. Investors cannot be hoodwinked for long. <BR>
<BR>
Wallace takes a long optimistic view based on the advent of the single European
currency. &quot;That will dramatically change the way the fund management
community in Europe operates. Today currency risk dominates the return on
their portfolios. That will disappear. And their value-added will come from
taking sector risk, credit risk and convexity risk.&quot; Levine at Fannie
Mae is also optimistic: &quot;I understand that it will take time to develop
international liquidity for callables. We have to work with underwriters
to create more tradeability.&quot;<B> <BR>

<H4>COMMODITIES </H4>
<H2>Commodity comeback </H2>
For those who haven't been whipsawed in the copper market, commodity derivatives
still offer manageable opportunities, particularly in the oil market. <BR>
<BR>
Last year oil companies pursued a policy of running down inventories as
a cost-cutting measure. This meant stocks were unable to absorb the demands
of an unexpectedly cold December, and crude oil prices rose around 6% in
December alone. Though the price dropped in January, by April it had jumped
again and was up more than 21% on the year. Forward prices, though, reflect
the market's assumption that the short squeeze will not last long and that
prices will fall significantly when Iraqi oil is available. This has created
an extremely steeply inverted forward curve that has been exploited by investors
who have simply bought the front month futures contract and rolled it over
as it nears expiration. This strategy has earned returns of around 50% from
a spot price change of 21% since December 1. <BR>
<BR>
Similar directional punts have been profitable in the grain market. A world
production weighted basket of corn, wheat and soya beans rose 21% between
March and April and is up 78% year-on-year. In April a rolling futures investment
in wheat rose almost 27%. <BR>
<BR>
Some funds have gone further than simple directional plays. A recent favourite
in the base metals market combined spread and volatility trading. Mark Kirkland,
global head of commodity finance at Merrill Lynch in New York, explains:
&quot;The historical volatilities of copper and aluminium are generally
similar. However, there was a point where that spread had diverged: aluminium
was in the region of 24% and copper in the region of 16%. Some funds took
the view that these spreads would fall back in line and so went short aluminium
volatility and long copper volatility.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The providers of commodity derivatives like to stress not just the speculative
end of the market but the more down to earth hedging uses of the instruments.
These have increased as prices have risen - again the energy market
has been the most active. Here, one clear trend has been an increase in
the number of refiners looking to lock in rising refinery margins (or crack
spreads, as they are called). This is the margin between the price of the
crude oil the refinery buys and the distillates - gasoil, gasoline,
naphtha and so on - that it sells. A glut in global refining capacity
has kept refining margins low for the past two years, too low for refiners
to be interested in locking them in. Now, unexpectedly high demand for oil
for heating and for gasoline plus low inventories have pushed up the margin.
In addition, there is always a lag between rises in crude oil prices and
rises in the price of distillates, because the refiners keep stocks of crude
purchased at pre-rise prices. They can pass on crude price rises to consumers
immediately, before they incur the rise themselves, pushing margins up further.
<BR>
<BR>
By using a crack spread swap refiners can lock in a budgeted margin on a
mix of distillates that mimics the basket of petroleum compounds their refinery
produces. &quot;For a long time the numbers from the refiners' point of
view were dismal and they were just price takers,&quot; says David Sobotka,
vice-president at Lehman Brothers in London. &quot;Now they can lock in
the fact that the curve has risen and they are happier.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This crack spread - on which there are also options - is a popular
play with the hedge funds, because it can be thought of as a highly specific
proxy for shares in a refinery company. <BR>
<BR>
Hedging activity has also been driven higher by banks' insistence on incorporating
price protection into loans, particularly project financings. &quot;In the
corporate sector we have seen a huge increase in hedging activity, driven
largely by the banks which lend them money. Increasingly, lenders such as
us are telling them that if we are to lend them money then they must get
price protection at some reasonable break-even level.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch has been at the forefront of this sector, bringing private
deals for Slovnaft, the Slovenian oil company, Lot, the Polish national
airline and TAP the Portuguese carrier. In some cases commodity derivatives
have been used to create highly-leveraged acquisition financings. One recent
deal structured by Bankers Trust in the gold sector involved a company one-third
the size of its target being able to raise the funds to complete an LBO
only because of the hedges in place in the financing. Ultimately the target
found a white knight twice its size but, as a banker on the deal comments:
&quot;This was a company no-one would have believed could have financed
this kind of takeover. But with the help of commodity hedges we put together
leveraged financing that would have enabled them to do it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Derivatives-linked financings have also become more popular with the major
mining and energy companies as the size of new project financings in these
sectors has been growing. &quot;Big is beautiful in production. Big projects
require big money, big investments. And that in turn entails big risks,&quot;
says Kevin Heffron, vice-president, Bankers Trust in London. &quot;Because
of the economies of scale achievable in these large projects, companies
are looking for ways to do them. They may not want to finance them as they
did more traditional ventures - from cashflow. They may want to enter
into project specific alliances or to take them entirely off-balance sheet.
<BR>
<BR>
The most flexible structure is the hedged volumetric production payment.
A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is set up to which a commodity producer
grants an interest in a set amount of the commodity being produced. The
SPV enters into derivatives contracts that fix the value of the commodity
flows so that cashflows to it are predictable. The SPV then issues debt
against the cashflows - and usually there is an element of over-collateralization:
the debt represents only, say, 90% of the cashflow predicted. The proceeds
from the debt issues then pass to the commodity producer. <BR>
<BR>
The producing company has no obligation to the SPV or its creditors other
than to deliver the revenue from the agreed volume of the commodity. On
maturity the economic interest in the commodity disappears and all rights
to the underlying property's output and cashflow revert to the commodity
producer. All the hedging is done with the SPV, which has the contractual
right to the cashflow from the underlying production. The producer simply
sells the production at market prices. <BR>
<BR>
This enables the producer to acount for the transaction as a sale of asset
and as a debt, for tax purposes - it appears as a tax-free sales of
reserves. The debt is off-balance sheet and non-recourse, and because of
the over-collateralization is highly rated and so low cost. And the producer
keeps all the upside potential associated with the underlying assets: it
sells at market prices; the SPV deals with ensuring sufficient cash flow
to service the debt. <BR>
<BR>
There is one other benefit: the producer uses debt rather than valuable
equity to finance the production. This is particularly attractive to oil
companies which, faced with large development projects, often resort to
what are known as farm-ins - joint ventures. An outside partner is
brought in to reduce risks and provide fund. <BR>

<H4>FOREIGN EXCHANGE </H4>
<H2>White markets </H2>
If you don't sometimes share the suspicion that the global foreign exchange
markets are too big and too volatile to serve the world economy, read no
further. <BR>
<BR>
However, if you do feel there might be a better model for the biggest market
in the world, consider the proposal of Mark White, a financial markets consultant
in Mexico City. <BR>
<BR>
White argues that instead of abandoning our future to massive speculative
capital flows, central banks should, bilaterally, set up alternative commission-free
electronic currency auction markets for what he calls fundamental primary
market transactions. These include direct investments, foreign exchange
receivables and interest payments. <BR>
<BR>
Before your hackles rise, don't confuse this with previous attempts at dual
or managed exchange rates. <BR>
<BR>
The auctions White envisages would be used for price discovery, not price
manipulation or stabilization. Where there is fundamental demand for currency,
a periodic call auction, held as frequently as every minute if necessary,
would establish a single price at which bids, offers and market orders would
be transacted. Users would pay no bid/offer spread. <BR>
<BR>
In the parallel interbank market, open to all traders, two central banks
or a consortium of central banks would be prepared to use their international
reserves and domestic money supply to absorb any speculative demand at the
auction price, maintaining a single price until the next auction starts
taking orders. <BR>
<BR>
The effect, argues White, would be to reduce volatility and make foreign
exchange markets less attractive to speculative, short-term position-takers.
It is this speculation, he believes, which makes today's markets overshoot
and renders their price discovery process inefficient and damaging. Particularly
for a country such as Mexico, which has made many attempts to stem speculation
with exchange rate management, the White market, with its auction system,
could reduce volumes to more fundamental levels and pare down volatility.
<BR>
<BR>
The argument that volatility declines with higher trading volume doesn't
hold, he says. As an example he compares the volatile behaviour of closed-end
investment funds and open-end investment funds. Closed funds are prone to
speculative bubbles because trading volume directly drives the price. With
their flexible size, open-end funds use quantity adjustments to dampen price
volatility until it matches precisely the changes in net asset value. Likewise,
in the new market, changes in the size of central bank reserves and money
supply will dampen pressures on exchange rate volatility. <BR>
<BR>
The proposed commission-free, central bank-sponsored market will not appeal
to commercial banks and brokers, says White, since they thrive on volatility
and volume. But that should not lead central bankers to reject the proposal.
In fact the more boring and uninteresting the speculators find the new market,
the more it will fulfil central bankers' requirements, he argues. <BR>
<BR>
White would like to test the market's guiding principle in controlled laboratory
market experiments. Vernon Smith at the University of Arizona, or Charles
Plott at California Institute of Technology, leaders in the field of experimental
markets (see <I>Euromoney</I>, January 1996, page 30), would be ideal candidates,
he says. But a larger-scale experiment could be conducted on the Internet,
where real auctions might be held. <BR>
<BR>
By sponsoring such experiments, central banks could be on the road to saving
themselves the much greater expense of research into the dynamics of existing
exchange markets and the huge settlement and other systemic risks involved,
White argues. <BR>
<BR>
Four questions spring to mind, and White has some answers ready: <BR>
<BR>
1) <I>How would central banks restrict the auction to so-called fundamental
participants?</I> <BR>
<BR>
They monitor foreign portfolio investment to ensure that it flows through
the interbank market. <BR>
<BR>
2) <I>How would futures markets function?</I> <BR>
<BR>
Just as they do today - current exchange and interest rates determine the
forward price, and if the forward price diverges, arbitrage brings it back
into line. <BR>
<BR>
3) <I>Would fundamental participants hedge their future foreign exchange
needs in the auction market or would they have to use the parallel interbank
market?</I> <BR>
<BR>
Hedging would go on in the parallel interbank market prior to contract signing
for the fundamental transaction; once the contract is signed the user can
exchange currencies in the auction and finance the position - this gives
exactly the forward rate as long as no arbitrage opportunities exist, and
they rarely do. <BR>
<BR>
4) <I>Wouldn't concerted position-taking in the speculative (interbank)
market drive the price-discovery process in the auction market?</I> <BR>
<BR>
It could, if the central banks lost their commitment or capability. However,
working in tandem they could defeat any speculative threat - one central
bank's international reserves is the other's money supply, so speculators
could never exhaust their liquidity.

<H4>BELGIUM </H4>
<H2>Now for the equities </H2>
New stock listings don't come often in Belgium, so they are usually cause
for celebration and optimism in the country's growing equity culture. But
financiers in Brussels had mixed feelings when Lernout &amp; Hauspie (L&amp;H),
a Flemish firm which makes speech-recognition systems, went public earlier
this year. For L&amp;H bypassed the Brussels stock exchange and went straight
to Nasdaq, the computerised trading system for OTC stocks in the United
States. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nasdaq makes more sense than the Brussels bourse for a hi-tech firm
regardless of its size,&quot; comments Marcel Stappers, head of KB Securities
in Brussels. &quot;The pricing is a lot better.&quot; He points out that
the average price-earnings ratio on Nasdaq is 25 compared with 13 on the
Brussels stock exchange. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The fact that firms go to Nasdaq is not good news for the Brussels
stock exchange,&quot; concedes Olivier Lefebvre, chairman of the bourse
management committee. After just six months in office, Lefebvre is determined
to look on the bright side. &quot;But it's also quite encouraging because
it shows there's a demand for industrial technology offerings.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Belgium's equity market still plays a limited role in the nation's economy
- last year Belgian companies raised just Bfr21 billion ($700 million).
There were only two initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Brussels stock
exchange last year. The number of listed companies actually declined. <BR>
<BR>
Yet both the government and stock exchange believe there are a number of
medium-sized Belgian firms which could launch IPOs with help from the financial
community. Finance minister Philippe Maystadt has encouraged traditional
brokers, to develop into what he calls banques d'investissement, a Belgian
version of British or Dutch investment banks. <BR>
<BR>
The government hopes these banks will begin to finance mergers and acquisitions
and IPOS. Some criticize the government for not encouraging Belgium's equity
culture with tax concessions. Lefebvre disagrees. &quot;The problem is really
one of financial culture. Tax breaks are not the key to the success of this
market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Brussels stock exchange has long needed a new trading system. Known
as NTS, a price-driven electronic trading system is being introduced in
stages. First to go electronic were the smaller stocks; the Bel-20 index,
where liquidity is concentrated, will follow on July 4. <BR>
<BR>
The NTS enabled market players to develop more effective derivatives products
- and that has created enormous volatility. After a disastrously chaotic
session at close of trading on March 15 (the Belgian market was quick to
dub it Black Friday), stock exchange officials suspected price manipulation
and opened an enquiry. <BR>
<BR>
The problem arose because the growing number of mutual funds linked to Belgium's
Bel-20 stock index were too strongly dependent on the closing price on certain
days. Typically, their reference price is derived from the Bel-20 closing
price over several days, or in some cases, on a single day. During the spring,
traders spotted arbitrage opportunities on these days and began selling
gradually in advance, then buying back heavily just before the close of
trading in order to push up the closing price. <BR>
<BR>
The fault appears to lie in Brussels although professionals play down the
problem. &quot;I told Lefebvre not to call it manipulation,&quot; says Daniel
de Meeus, head of equities at Generale Bank. &quot;That exacerbated the
situation. When the bourse announced that it wanted to carry out an enquiry,
I thought that was a bit exaggerated.&quot; In turn, Brussels traders blamed
arbitrageurs in London. Ultimately, the investigation threw up no evidence
of manipulation, either in Brussels or London and the stock exchange concluded
that the market dive was a 'coincidence': several large players decided
to divest portfolios at the same time on the same day. <BR>
<BR>
Lefebvre has now recommended that fund managers get away from closing prices
altogether and use settlement prices averaged over several days.

<B>ASIAN PROJECT FINANCE</B>
</H3>

<H2>
<B>Thin pickings in a buoyant market</B></H2>

<H4>
<B>Throughout Asia, borrowers are exploring new ways of financing the region's huge infrastructure needs. But fierce competition is keeping margins down for the banks on the bandwagon. Norman Peagam reports</B>
</H4>

<P>
In a year of record international bond issues, one unusual recent offering attracted little attention. In August, the Chinese coastal city of Zhuhai raised $200 million through a private placement backed by municipal highway revenues. Modelled on a technique often used in US local government finance, it was the first Asian revenue bond and the first Chinese bond issue with a high-yield tranche, according to sole manager Morgan Stanley. The proceeds will be used to help finance infrastructure development. Hailing the transaction as a milestone, a spokesman says the firm sees "select opportunities" to use the technique elsewhere in the region.

<P>
Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank estimate that Asia needs around $1.5 trillion of power, telecommunications and transportation capacity over the next decade to cope with rapid population growth and remove bottlenecks to economic expansion. Unable to foot the bill themselves, governments are turning to the private sector for help, encouraging local and foreign investors to provide services which until recently were considered the exclusive responsibility of the state. They, in turn, are tapping the domestic and international markets for debt and equity capital to finance these projects.

<P>
Some have encountered problems getting off the ground, notably a power plant in Dhabol, India, and mass transit systems in Bangkok, Thailand, partly reflecting the highly political nature of many infrastructure developments. But these well-publicized hiccups have done nothing to curb the appetite of governments, lenders or investors for new transactions, even in countries new to international financial markets such as Burma (Myanmar), Laos and Vietnam. "There's so much demand," says Will Liley, managing director of Asian Infrastructure Fund Advisers, a Hong Kong investment management firm. "Over the next 15 to 20 years, we can build as much as we possibly can and the market will still beat a path to our door."

<P>
International banks have jumped on the bandwagon, attracted by the prospect of lush fees for advisory work and higher spreads on loans than they can achieve at home. "Ten years ago, international banks in Asia were mainly providing dollar loans for resource development; today, all the leaders are trying to advise, arrange and finance infrastructure development," says Malcolm Clark, NatWest Markets' project advisory director for Asia. However, the business appears to be increasingly dominated by perhaps a dozen major US, European and Japanese commercial banks, operating mainly from Singapore and Hong Kong, with US investment banks nibbling at the edges for related underwriting deals.

<P>
Competition is clearly driving profit margins down, judging by the squeals heard in some quarters. One project finance official at a major US bank complains that "the Japanese are trying to grab the business, going for market share by doing deals at half the price we can". It is not only the Japanese. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, ANZ and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank recently arranged $480 million of floating-rate debt financing (including a standby facility) for PT Mitra Global, one of the successful bidders for Indonesia's five regional telecom concessions, at just 135 basis points over Libor, excluding fees and the cost of the standby, despite some market nervousness about Indonesia's political future and the fact that the project has not even begun operations.

<P>
Rivals attribute the tight spread to aggressive bidding for the deal by the arranging banks. Rollo Prendergast, ANZ's regional head of global structured finance for the Asia-Pacific region, prefers to put it differently: "I'd say that the advisers [JP Morgan, acting for the winning consortium] had very good control over the process; they looked after the sponsors well." Noting that the project is robust enough to stand on its commercial merits, without any political risk cover, he adds that the business should benefit from its favourable location in central Java and the track record of the investors involved, which include Australia's Telstra and NTT of Japan.

<P>
<B>Seller's market</B>

<P>
More recently, a syndicate consisting of one German and seven Japanese banks is said to have priced a 15-year floating-rate credit for an independent power project (IPP) in Thailand at "significantly below" 100bp. The loan would help finance the construction and operation of a power plant by Unocal, Westinghouse and Thai Oil, which are thought to have won the bidding for the project in the face of competition from about 40 other consortia. Thai banks will also provide local currency financing for up to 17 years. "This was probably the most competitive IPP bidding in the world," says a banker who monitored the process.

<P>
In addition to aggressive pricing of loans by competitors, some bankers bemoan the tougher bargaining stance adopted by governments lately. Private power development has become "a seller's market", one gripes, in which "host governments now feel they can play hardball because they think the programmes they put in place recently in an effort to kick-start private power generation were too investor-friendly". China has always taken a fairly hard line over the conditions it will approve. Now Taiwan, new to private electricity development, seems to be taking an inflexible position. In negotiations over 11 possible power projects on the island, the state electricity company is offering "take it or leave it" terms, several bankers say.

<P>
Bankers themselves have played hardball at times, rewarding countries which were most accommodating. A few years ago, for example, the Philippines was so short of electricity generating capacity that the capital, Manila, was frequently subject to brownouts. Determined to solve the problem, the Philippine government embarked on a crash IPP programme and agreed to accept many of the terms demanded by lenders and investors, including an explicit government guarantee that the state electricity company would meet its obligations to pay for the power generated. In Indonesia, however, the government was not prepared to provide such a guarantee; after long delays, the Indonesians finally issued a "letter of support" instead, which foreign banks accepted. "The Philippines needed the power and were more realistic," says a European banker in Hong Kong. "Those countries which have held out for better terms have had to wait."

<P>
But mounting competition among banks has given such countries more leverage. "One or two years ago, only a few banks were prepared to look into project financing [relying on the project's cash flow for debt service and repayment] rather than the guarantee approach; now it's a few dozen banks," says Christopher Chen, director of international finance at ANZ. As a result, Indonesia has been able to arrange financing for four major power projects since it established the basic model last year, with a fifth expected to close by the end of this year and several others in advanced stages of development.

<P>
Since 1989, the Philippines has approved around a dozen IPPs, gradually developing and refining its original model. So far, all have involved the state electricity company as the buyer of the power (or "offtaker") with the full guarantee of the republic. Now, negotiations are under way to arrange the first Philippine IPP in which a privately owned company will be the offtaker (Meralco, an electricity distributor serving Manila) without any government guarantee; current plans call for several plants to be built and operated by groups of local and foreign investors in order to supply Meralco with more than 1,500MW of new power. Meanwhile, the Philippine government is looking at possible ways of limiting its own exposure in future deals, such as making its guarantee available only as long as the relevant financing is outstanding or providing for the guarantee to terminate if the state electricity company's credit rating reaches investment grade and stays there for two consecutive years.

<P>
Pakistan has also been carrying out a successful IPP programme since it invited proposals from private developers in 1994. It received many more applications than expected and has chosen enough to meet its initial target of 5,000MW in extra generating capacity. Like the Philippines, Pakistan had little choice but to offer favourable terms.

<P>
"The political and economic situation was such that they could only do it by making it investor-friendly," says a British banker who took part, adding that the government was also influenced by World Bank advice. Another important reason for the programme's success was the approach taken to pricing, he notes, using a tariff schedule rather than trying to stipulate a rate of return which the project can earn. "If the plant can produce at an average price of x, then the profit is up to you," giving investors a clear incentive to reduce costs and operate more efficiently. "And they even allowed some front-loading and fast completion bonuses."

<P>
<B>The cap didn't fit</B>

<P>
By contrast, the Chinese authorities let it be known that they thought project developers were earning too much and suggested they might impose a 12% cap on the return sponsors could achieve in future, although there has been recent speculation that 15% is acceptable. Regardless of the number, China's approach was universally scorned by foreign bankers and slowed the pace of infrastructure development there. "Nobody who's in this business does projects in China for 12% to 15%," says one veteran. "You can assume that if something goes ahead they're getting more than that." In fact, this observer maintains that the Chinese are now adopting a tariff-driven approach and have implicitly tied rates of return to operating efficiency. "They'll say you can make 15% for delivering so much power, which requires plant availability of 63%. But if you can increase plant availability to 88% to 92%, which is world-scale best practice, you can get a 21% to 22% cash return."

<P>
Despite China's enormous need for new power plants and other infrastructure, arranging projects there has been notoriously slow and difficult. The country's embryonic and unreliable legal system is a major obstacle in a business which revolves around the performance of tightly drafted contracts and the enforcement of security. All transactions must be priced in local currency, but the renminbi is not yet a freely convertible currency, exposing lenders and investors to additional currency risk. And it is often difficult to assess the credit of the offtaker or other local counterparty, because Chinese enterprises do not use western accounting methods, most are not profitable by western standards and in some cases even their ownership is murky. To complicate matters, provinces are competing fiercely to attract foreign project sponsors, in some cases even offering "ludicrous" fuel prices to entice investors, according to one banker.

<P>
Nevertheless, projects are being arranged, approved and financed in China, some of them breaking new ground. "Both the transparency and speed of final government approvals has remained an issue this year," says Joseph Casson, a project finance director at Citibank. But, he adds, "things are moving constantly in the right direction". Recently, for example, Bovis and Thames Water of the UK concluded a build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreement with Shanghai to install a water treatment plant at Da Chang and supply the city with clean water at agreed prices for 20 years, when they will hand over the plant to the city free of charge. Attracted by the prospect of lending to Shanghai and by the fact that the city will bear much of the project risk, international banks will provide 70% of the project's $75 million total cost in the form of 10-year floating-rate debt at Libor plus 190bp. Da Chang is "one of the first limited-recourse project financings in China", according to one banker involved.

<P>
In another recent transaction, Sithe Energies of the US (which is 61%-owned by Compagnie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux of France and 28%-owned by Marubeni of Japan) agreed to build a $174 million, 100MW coal-fired power plant in Tangshan, Hebei province, and to operate it for 20 years. Sithe's foreign partners in the venture are an infrastructure fund organized by American International Group and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, with the foreign partners owning 60%, while the local partner is the municipality, owning 40%. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell advised and arranged the deal, with international banks providing $128.4 million of 10-year debt at about Libor plus 200bp.

<P>
"The interesting thing about this deal is that it's probably the first to achieve a less one-sided allocation of risk," says a banker involved in the transaction. "The problem in China is finding counterparties to contractual arrangements whose credit risk is comprehensible and acceptable to the banks. Typically, if there's one creditworthy party involved, all the risks end up being parked on its doorstep." In this case, local contractors will supply the equipment and carry out construction work, so there is no export credit agency involvement. But Raytheon of the US will act as the effective prime contractor and supervisor, guaranteeing plant completion and performance, reducing performance risk with its know-how and experience and financial risk with its strong balance sheet.

<P>
Lenders also took comfort from the quality of the sponsors and their shareholders and the reputation of the offtaker, the North China Power Group, which is the ninth-largest power utility in Asia. Fuel supply is not an issue; the coalfield in and around Tangshan reportedly has more coal reserves than all of Indonesia. The lenders agreed to accept currency risk, reassured by the size of China's foreign exchange reserves and the fact that the price received for the power will be indexed.

<P>
As this example illustrates, China has not yet developed a model for IPPs. Instead, foreign and local companies have usually set up ad hoc joint ventures, negotiated agreements with provincial governments and power authorities and then sought the necessary approvals from the central government. That may be about to change. In the case of the Laibin B power project in Guangxi province, the State Planning Commission (SPC) has for the first time written guidelines specifically designed to attract international participation. It has opened up the process to competitive bidding and will even allow a foreign company to own 100% of the operating company. Moreover, although the project enjoys the SPC's strong moral support, it will not be backed by central government or state bank guarantees. "It will still be far short of classic BOT, because the risk will be local government, not true project finance, but it will be a very significant landmark," says a Hong Kong banker. "This will be a test case."

<P>
The plan is to build a $600 million, 700MW coal-fired power plant in one of China's poorer interior provinces, which has received little foreign investment to date and lags far behind the southern coastal provinces in development. Beijing wants to begin correcting that imbalance by attracting investment to the interior. Although the results of the bidding had not been officially announced as <I>Euromoney</I> went to press, it was widely believed that Electricit&eacute; de France would be chosen as the operator, with GEC-Alsthom as the equipment supplier. Bankers have expressed reservations about Guangxi's remote location and relative poverty, the tight construction schedule called for and the absence of central government or state bank guarantees. "It's extremely unlikely that banks or export credit agencies will accept the credit of the plant or even the province itself," says one. In response, Guangxi has asked for a letter of support from Beijing.

<P>
<B>Roads to revenue</B>

<P>
Zhuhai is a Chinese coastal city of just over a million people in fast-growing Guangdong province near Hong Kong. Partly bounded by the sea, it has seven main access roads which vehicles must use to enter or leave the city, paying either a toll (for non-locally registered vehicles) or an annual fee (for locally registered vehicles). Morgan Stanley recently arranged a $200 million international bond issue for the Zhuhai city government, effectively securitizing these highway revenues. Modelled on a technique commonly used in US municipal finance, it was the first revenue bond by an Asian borrower and the first bond issue from China with a high-yield tranche.

<P>
The issuer was a city-owned highway company and the offering consisted of two tranches; an $85 million senior tranche of 9.125% 10-year notes (with an average life of 7.5 years) and a $115 million subordinated tranche of 11.5% 12-year notes (with bullet repayment). The senior notes received an investment-grade rating of Baa3/BBB and were priced at 250bp over US treasury notes, while the subordinated notes were rated below investment grade at Ba1/BB and priced at 475bp over treasuries. According to Morgan Stanley, the offering was oversubscribed and achieved broad distribution among about 40 investors in the US (75%) and Asia (25%), many of them first-time buyers of Chinese debt. The proceeds will be used to help finance city infrastructure projects.

<P>
Morgan Stanley says the financing is unique in not having any central government guarantee or other implicit support, unlike all other Chinese debt financings to date. It attributes the deal's success to strong fundamental credit quality and several debt service support mechanisms. Annual vehicle registrations in Zhuhai are growing at double-digit rates and the highway tolls and fees are automatically increased every year or two. To reduce the risks surrounding debt service, a city-owned conglomerate has provided certain limited hard-currency back-up commitments and offshore debt service reserve accounts have been established. The transaction took 18 months to arrange, due to the slow approval process in China, but a Morgan Stanley spokesman describes it as "a very important benchmark for Asia".&#009;*

<H3>EMERGING MARKETS </H3>
<b>Edited by Brian Caplen</B> 
<H4>TURKEY </H4>
<H2>Municipalities disown debt </H2>
&quot;As long as I am paid, I don't care where the money comes from. But
I will have to think 10 times before I lend to another Turkish municipality
again.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This was the reaction of a European banker to a new phenomenon in the Turkish
borrowing scene: municipalities which are refusing to pay their debts to
foreign banks. <BR>
<BR>
The trend was started by mayors of the Islamist Welfare Party Refah, which
won the greatest number of votes in the December general election, and has
just formed a coalition to replace the caretaker government of Motherland
party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Refah also controls a large number of municipalities,
including Istanbul, Turkey's most populous city, and Ankara, the capital.
It was the mayors of these two cities who first told the treasury that they
would not be paying their foreign debts. <BR>
<BR>
Melih Gokcek, the Ankara mayor, first came to the nation's attention with
his comments on an abstract statue erected in the capital by one of his
predecessors. &quot;If this is art, I spit on it,&quot; he said. He seems
to have the same disdain for his predecessor's foreign debts. Ankara is
among the biggest non-payers and has already declined to pay a Dm150 million
bond arranged by Dresdner Bank, according to banking sources. (Dresdner
Bank declined to comment.) <BR>
<BR>
But so far crisis has been averted because the central government has been
prepared to take over repayments. Ankara municipal bonds valued at &#165;8.5
billion, sold on the Japanese shibosai market in private placements, matured
in June and were picked up by the treasury. A spokesman for Nomura, the
securities company involved in the placement, confirmed that the debt had
been paid on time. He would not be drawn on how possible non-payment might
affect Nomura's future involvement in Turkey, but was not overly concerned
about its other two placements with the municipality. These total &#165;54.6
billion yen, and mature in March and November 1997. <BR>
<BR>
Turkish newspapers quote Gokcek as saying that the debts were made not by
him but by his predecessor (a social democrat) and should be paid by him.
But Sureyya Oral, his spokesman, says: &quot;They don't pay us - we
don't pay them.&quot; He meant by this that funds due to Ankara municipality
were being blocked by the government to undermine the Refah municipality
so that it would be perceived by the public as an unsuccessful administration
and lose votes. <BR>
<BR>
Municipalities derive a substantial portion of their revenue from allocations
made by the central government which channels a fixed percentage of tax
revenue in their direction. It is true that the treasury is siphoning away
funds allocated to non-performing municipalities at the state-owned Iller
(provinces) Bank. According to a source close to the treasury, the treasury
started doing this after the municipalities disowned their debts, not before.
And, in any case, the sums the treasury is obliged to pay are vastly greater
than the sums it is obtaining from Iller. <BR>
<BR>
The foreign loans secured by municipalities are exclusively for infrastructure
projects. Some municipal debts are guaranteed by the treasury and others
are not, but the treasury is servicing municipal debts regardless of their
status. The government is forced to pay because default by a municipality,
even in connection with a debt unguaranteed by the state, could lead to
country default owing to cross-default clauses. Without exception, municipal
loan agreements contain clauses which, in the case of one default, trigger
off the default of all other loans. No-one from the treasury was prepared
to comment. But foreign bankers say that officials are deeply embarrassed
and view the development as something that could undermine the creditworthiness
of Turkish state institutions as a whole. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As long as the treasury pays, the market will remain open. If they
default, the market will close completely on Turkey,&quot; says an American
banker. <BR>
<BR>
But John Stanley, associate director of capital markets at Nikko Bank Europe,
believes that the reaction of investors would vary if the municipality defaults.
&quot;Japanese investors would probably tar Turkey with the same brush if
the municipalities defaulted, and not get involved at all, whereas European
investors might be more pragmatic and distinguish between the municipalities
and central government.&quot; As for the future, he says that if the treasury
made it clear that it would not cover municipal defaults, there would be
virtually no interest in investing or arranging issues. <BR>
<BR>
The source close to the treasury says that the foreign currency debts of
municipalities were between $8 billion and $10 billion. The treasury has
already repaid debts of between TL30 trillion ($370 million) and TL40 trillion
owed by the municipalities of Ankara and Istanbul and is expected to pay
back still more by the end of the year. Rusdu Saracoglu, a former cabinet
minister and central bank governor, recently told an international conference
that extra-budgetary spending this year - partly caused by the municipalities'
refusal to pay - would amount to an estimated TL800 trillion (out of
a total budget deficit of TL1,800 trillion). <BR>
<BR>
Is the behaviour of Refah municipalities a measure of what Refah will do
now it has formed a government? Could Refah consolidate the national debt?
<BR>
<BR>
Many bankers and officials believe that although Refah has little sympathy
for the west, it would not be mad enough to set in motion a chain of events
which could lead to Turkey's ostracism by the international markets. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't want to think that Refah is reckless or brainless enough to
do such a thing,&quot; says a senior Turkish official. <BR>
<BR>
The irony is that while groaning about the municipalities, the treasury
has recently given the go-ahead to the municipality of Izmit to raise Dm200
million through an international syndication. The treasury gave &quot;fully
unconditional and irrevocable guarantee&quot; for the two-year facility,
which will be arranged by Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji and Sumitomo. The Izmit
mayor belongs to the social democratic Republican People's Party. <BR>

<H4>MICROFINANCE </H4>
<H2>Small lenders count too </H2>
Lending to the working poor of the developing world is a business that few
mainstream investment banks have ever considered. But they will not overlook
it in future. Attitudes are changing as bankers see how local institutions
which specialize in small-scale lending - known as microfinance -
can turn a mass of tiny loans into a profitable business. <BR>
<BR>
Banco Solidario in Bolivia, Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and Indonesia's Bank
Dagang Bali are not known names in the financial markets. But they are all
thriving as established microfinanciers. As these institutions prosper,
they are keen to raise capital on the international money markets. <BR>
<BR>
The concept of microfinance is simple: sums between $2 and $600 are lent
to small, labour-intensive, low-technology enterprises at market rates.
Once the recipients have proved that they can pay back the money, they are
eligible for borrowing larger sums. In most cases customers must open a
savings account as part of the deal. <BR>
<BR>
In many countries, the working poor previously had to rely on moneylenders
for capital. Their interest rates were so extortionate that borrowers could
not prosper, and most got further into debt. By receiving more manageable
loans from microfinanciers, argues Marguerite Robinson, an institute fellow
at the Harvard Institute for International Development, borrowers are now
able to expand their businesses and generate profits: <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In Indonesia moneylenders charge a flat rate of interest of between
7% and 40% a month,&quot; explains Robinson. &quot;Bank Rakyat Indonesia,
however, charges just 1.5%. It is therefore the formal financial sector
and not the moneylenders which has the ability to make microfinance effective
and profitable for all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One bank which may soon enter the Eurobond market is Banco Solidario in
Bolivia. The bank was established in 1992 with the bulk of the lending portfolio
from Prodem, a non-governmental microfinance institution set up six years
earlier by the US-based non-profit organization Accion International. By
1995 the bank's loans totalled over $83 million, and its 63,000 customers
represented 37% of Bolivia's banking clientele. Banco Solidaro's non-repayment
rate is an astounding 0.2%, and it claims a return on assets of 2.2%. <BR>
<BR>
Accion International's total investment is $330 million, with an average
loan size of $594 and a repayment rate of 98%. Of 24 projects in 13 Latin
American countries and six US cities, 14 have already achieved self-sufficiency.
<BR>
<BR>
According to Accion's president, Michael Chu, it is market conditions, and
not poverty itself which act as the real hindrance to the growth of small
businesses in the developing world. <BR>
<BR>
Speaking at a microfinance conference in London in June, Chu said the key
to success was to treat the working poor as customers: &quot;It is not a
question of subsidy or benevolence. Microfinance is an economic activity
and should be run to achieve self-sufficiency. Once this has been achieved
and the costs of the project have been covered, the international financial
markets can be tapped.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Microfinance will be lent new weight when the IFC enters the market. &quot;We
will be charging market rates on all loans, enforcing market discipline
and we aim to generate a profit as well as meet all our costs,&quot; says
Farida Khambata, director of central capital markets. &quot;We are looking
at several options for financing micro enterprises, including equity investment
and securitizing the portfolios of microfinance institutions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Miles Protter, executive director of debt capital markets at SBC Warburg,
is upbeat about mainstream financial markets investing in microfinance institutions,
although he has some reservations. &quot;The main drawback is that the needs
of most of these institutions are too small for debt or equity issues,&quot;
he says. &quot;A $5 million MTN deal of one to three years would be killed
by the transaction costs, which could be as high as $300,000. Of course,
an international bank might do it pro bono, but that would miss the point
of establishing microfinance as a commercially viable entity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the long term, says Protter, the onus is on institutions which specialize
in microfinance such as Banco Solidario to become more established. This
will build up their credibility and facilitate raising capital. Chu of Accion
suggests a two-to-three-year Eurobond medium term note placement as a suitable
financing vehicle. <BR>
<BR>
No one is expecting the international capital markets to accept microfinance
quickly. First, microfinance institutions will have to become self-sustaining,
and break free of the grants and soft loans provided by development agencies.
But at last the attractions of microfinance are becoming clear to the mainstream
investment community. Now it's just a question of who takes the plunge.

<H4>PALESTINE </H4>
<H2>Need for laws and longer lending </H2>
After the recent election which brought in Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu
as Israel's prime minister, Palestinian leaders are bemoaning what they
believe to be the end of the peace process. <BR>
<BR>
But Palestinian bankers regard political uncertainty as the least of their
worries. Whether the peace process stands or falls, bankers in the West
Bank and Gaza will continue with their efforts to establish an efficient
banking sector. The lack of a central bank and of an independent currency
are difficulties, but not a deterrent. <BR>
<BR>
There has been much talk of a Palestinian currency but the scheme is unrealistic
without backing in gold or other monetary reserves. For the time being,
an independent Palestinian currency is unattainable in the West Bank and
Gaza, where the Israeli shekel and the Jordanian dinar remain legal tender.
<BR>
<BR>
Palestine does have a monetary authority, but that is a misnomer. The Palestinian
Monetary Authority (PMA) does no more than license and supervise the nation's
banking sector. <BR>
<BR>
The basic problems of the Palestinian banking sector are spelled out in
a recent report on the reform of banking law in the West Bank and Gaza.
&quot;No laws have been passed by the Palestinian authority nor has it come
up with an agenda yet,&quot; says Keith Molkner, the chief researcher of
the report, which was funded by the US Chamber of Commerce and the Swiss
government. &quot;The PMA is still going through the stage of institutionalizing
itself, formulating policy and regulations, and finding qualified supervisors.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In Molkner's view, one of the major difficulties for Palestinian banks is
the low loan-to-deposit ratio. In the absence of legal mechanisms to enforce
collateral lending agreements, only about 20% of deposits are granted as
loans. Since the enforcement of collateral lending legislation has been
very weak, the local banks' risk-adverse mentality appears to be justified.
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover the Palestinians are unwilling to cooperate with the Israeli authorities
in cases of foreclosure on real-estate loans, and the Palestinian authorities
are not organized to do the job themselves. Whatever lending was done in
the past was effected via multiple guarantors of people with high social
status. Today, Molkner says, the Palestinian population would offer a good
deal of resistance to foreclosure because of their long experience of seeing
land appropriated by the Israelis. <BR>
<BR>
While the Jordanians have a lender of last resort in the Central Bank of
Jordan, the Palestinians do not. Local bankers favour some type of legal
protection or mechanism to monitor their lending practices and thus create
a disincentive for poor loan/deposit ratios. Capital flight to Jordan and
other Arab countries is another obstacle to the development of local banking.
So far, over $1.2 billion in Palestinian-owned funds has been diverted to
banks outside the West Bank and Gaza, with only a quarter of this sum contributed
by Palestinians living or working abroad. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This has undermined solvency and liquidity in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip financial sector,&quot; says Haj Hashem Ata Shawa, chairman of the
Bank of Palestine, a local commercial bank. <BR>
<BR>
What the Palestinians need most, Molkner argues, is a unified banking law
which would enable the PMA to exert its authority and to encourage lending
which is crucial for economic development. <BR>
<BR>
Shukri Bishara, regional manager of the Arab Bank, explains that Middle
Eastern banks typically have a short-term deposit structure and prefer to
offer short-term loans. Therefore the Arab Bank has decided to focus on
long-term lending for industry, infrastructure and other projects which
require a long-term repayment schedule.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Arab Bank has also launched the Arab Palestinian Investment Bank, joining
forces with the IFC and a German overseas development agency, Deutsche Entwicklungs-gesellschaft.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This bank will focus primarily on medium to long-term lending, project
finance, infrastructure finance and large-scale project finance,&quot; says
Bishara. &quot;Although these projects will be funded by lines of credit
made available by the three major shareholders of the local banking branches,
the majority of funds will come from the Arab Bank's reserves.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Issam Abu Issa, the chairman of the International Bank of Palestine, says
his bank intends to establish special credit lines for agriculture, industry,
and services. &quot;Investors will have the choice to place their money
in certain sectors. This bank will be the only one of its kind in the Palestinian-controlled
areas to have these kinds of funds available to investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To fund its activities, the International Bank of Palestine will need capital
of $20 million, of which $4 million has been contributed already. Eventually,
25% of total capital will be offered to the public. <BR>
<BR>
One new institution is the Palestinian Construction Bank, which was established
by the Palestinian Union of Contractors and will provide loans for construction
and housing projects. <BR>
<BR>
Although the Palestinian areas still have no central bank or currency, the
governor of the PMA, Fuad Bseiso, claims to have achieved many of his objectives.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The main priority of the PMA is to keep banking services open and
accessible to the Palestinian people and organizations,&quot; says Bseiso.
&quot;The next most important objective is to support local banks so they
can improve lending activities which directly influence the development
of the economy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bsaiso aims to establish a system which makes the procedure of approving
loans easier and more effective, and abandons the counterproductive routines
which impede healthy loans. The PMA will also encourage commercial banks
to invest more in long-term development and construction projects, in which
case, &quot;we have to cover for any gaps or shortfalls. <BR>

<H4>BULGARIA </H4>
<H2>Last chance to reform </H2>
Without the support of the IMF Bulgaria would have failed to service its
debt payment of $1.2 billion this year, or so some international bankers
believe. During the EBRD annual general meeting in April, rumours flew around
Sofia that the host country was on the point of defaulting. So far the scaremongering
has come to nothing. Now, with the help of a firm shove from the IMF, Bulgaria
is making a more determined attempt to reform its economy. <BR>
<BR>
The government finally began to address the economic crisis in May this
year. Under pressure to continue debt repayments at all costs, it has worked
out a comprehensive, 20-month programme of economic reforms. This joint
effort by the Bulgarian government, the National Bank of Bulgaria and the
IMF involves harsh measures - the closure or restructuring of loss-making
companies and the liquidation or consolidation of many of the country's
50 banks. There will also be government spending cuts coupled with increases
in taxes and levies to improve public-sector revenue. <BR>
<BR>
Starting on July 1, the government will close 67 state companies -
among them coal mines, refineries, power stations and shipyards - and
restructure a second list of companies which includes Balkan Airways and
the state railway company. The companies to be closed represent 20% of GDP
and 27% of the accumulated bad debts of the banking system. Between 30,000
and 40,000 people will be made redundant from the shut-down companies and
many thousands more could lose their jobs when the restructuring of the
second group of companies begins. <BR>
<BR>
Later this month the IMF is expected to sign a 20-month standby credit of
$465 million which will support Bulgaria during this painful retrenchment.
But it will be granted only if the closures actually take place. <BR>
<BR>
The restructuring programme - which aims to limit annual inflation
to 57% - should help to halt the steep decline in the value of the
lev. Devaluation is a particularly serious problem because it drains Bulgaria's
ability to make heavy debt repayments. <BR>
<BR>
Bulgaria's foreign debt of around $9 billion is one of the highest per capita
foreign debts in the region. To make matters worse, over $2 billion is owed
in turn to Bulgaria by Iraq, Nicaragua, Egypt and Libya and is unlikely
ever to be repaid. Iraq alone owes $1.2 billion, plus interest, which it
was paying off in oil until the embargoes were imposed several years ago.
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 a reduction of 50% of the $5 billion commercial debt was achieved
with the London Club of bank creditors. Therefore, any subsequent default
would be an extreme embarrassment. <BR>
<BR>
This could be Bulgaria's last chance to find its rightful place in the economic
pecking order of post-communist eastern Europe. Bulgaria lacks the infrastructure
of 'top-tier' countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic,
but has a more advanced economy than most successor states of the former
Soviet Union. The challenge is to remain competitive - in terms of
price and infrastructure - with middle-ranking countries such as Latvia,
Lithuania and neighbouring Romania. <BR>
<BR>
The chaotic banking system is the weakest link in the economy. A sound banking
law is not being fully implemented. A long-discussed restructuring programme
designed to close or consolidate insolvent banks and strengthen supervision
has faltered as politicians fought over the details. <BR>
<BR>
As a result the banking system is still too unwieldy. After the deregulation
of the banking system in 1992, there were as many as 80 banks. Consolidation
has taken place since then: 22 banks have merged to form the United Bank
of Bulgaria and 12 institutions have joined together to make the Express
Bank in Varna. While the 80 old banks have been reduced to around 40, several
new Bulgarian banks, plus six foreign banks - Dresdner-BNP and RZB Austria
are two - have set up. This brings the new total to over 50: still too many
for the central bank to monitor and control without difficulty. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign-currency denominated government bonds are being given to old banks
to boost their capital, but this assistance does not extend to sorting out
problem loans, so the banks' fundamental problems persist. The banking sector
has a negative net worth of around $1.3 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Although a privatization scheme is in place, the sale of large state-owned
companies has been extremely slow. Two major companies - the national
telecoms company and Europe's largest soda ash plant - are selling
25% of their shares in a public offering. If transparent and fair procedures
are followed during these sales, they may serve as a model for further large-scale
privatizations and attract more foreign investors. <BR>
<BR>
The question is whether, after four years of demoralizing drift, Bulgaria
can push ahead with reforms. If the Bulgarians approach the new reforms
wholeheartedly, then Bulgaria has a chance of being re-assessed by investors
as a middle-ranking country. The next six months will be crucial. ]<BR>

<H3>FROM THE EDITOR</H3>
<H2>Realists for Peace</H2>
<H4>Some people do benefit from war: that is something we must understand
if we want to make it harder to fight <BR>
</H4>

<BR>
It is always the way: tempt fate and it sticks its tongue out at you. Just
when everyone declared there was no turning back in Northern Ireland and
the US president gave his blessing with a visit, the IRA decided it had
more to gain from a return to violence. The final outcome is still
not clear, but the large explosion heard all over London this February was
clearly the start of a new and more cynical conflict which has put
hope on the defensive as never before. <BR>
<BR>
In the Middle East, Hamas bombers have made life difficult for both
Israeli and Arab moderates. In Bosnia, peace still means death for those
Muslims left in the path of Serbs practising a &quot;slash and burn&quot;
departure and, despite progress with military implementation, there is still
no civilian cement holding together the peace process. As Balkan commentator
Misha Glenny warned at a Davos session, war could return if the troops sent
in under the Dayton agreement pull out at the end of their time before any
agreement between the politicians. <BR>
<BR>
There are also ominous rumblings registered by as yet unborn conflicts,
flickers on the radar screen, such as the partial Chinese blockade
of Taiwan, called forth by the island's experiment with democracy. If one
wants to be really pessimistic, it is worth remembering Nostradamus's prediction
that the war to end the world would start with China. <BR>
<BR>
It is not worth getting carried away by doom and gloom: conflicts are
never easy to resolve. But these setbacks are a reminder that we should
not be carried away by wishful thinking either. Peace and prosperity belong
together, the argument goes: why cannot people get on with business and
reap the peace dividend? <BR>
<BR>
The hole in this argument is that, for some people, war is also good business.
And not just for oddball terrorists profiting from illegal drug and
arms deals as the perennial debate about the morality of national arms sales
goes on. <BR>
<BR>
When the British government announced earlier this year that defence contracts
with Saudi Arabia were more important than the asylum rights of Saudi dissident
Mohammad Al Mas'ari there was not much fuss: both a Tory government and
a union-backed opposition bought the argument that the jobs at stake were
more important than constitutional principles or any long-term conception
of national interest. The issue returned again recently with the Scott Report
into arms sales to Iraq. <BR>
<BR>
The debate takes only slightly different forms in other countries but in
almost all cases it is framed as one between pragmatists versus idealists.
It takes an iconoclast like columnist Samuel Brittan, who charted the badly
mapped shores of capitalist ethics at a Davos dinner, to criticise the arms
apologists as mercantilists who fail to understand the real laws of the
market and the real choices open to them by that surprisingly flexible
mechanism. <BR>
<BR>
If the bottom line is not the only issue the dilemma remains, where do you
draw the line? It is an issue debated every year at Davos along with other
issues of conscience and good management, such as the potential of the &quot;socially
responsible&quot; company or the concept of stakeholder capitalism, now
taken up by Britain's Labour opposition and metamorphosed into a party political
issue. <BR>
<BR>
The answer will not emerge from a non-dialogue between pragmatists and moralists.
It may emerge from a dialogue with the honest realist, a very different
animal from the average short-term pragmatist who uses that pragmatism as
a shield against awkward questions. The realist is the entity or person
who is capable of recognising the interests of the different parties for
what they are, capable of identifying its own clear long-term interests
and capable of using that understanding to act, whatever the fashions or
pressures that abound. &lt;<p>

<P>

<H3> Pick 'n' mix for investors </H3> <P> IT WAS dial-a-deal week
in the Eurobond market as a host of new issues in the widest spectrum of
currencies and structures came to the market.

<P> Bankers are expecting much of the same in coming weeks although many expect a
rush of dollar transactions.

<P> Among the deals likely to emerge next week is the second Tier 3 bank capital
issue, a $500m five-year deal via ABN AMRO and Morgan Stanley for ABN AMRO which
is likely to pay around 43bp over, and a Yamaichi-led $200m four-year deal for
Swedish financial institution Venantius at 8bp-12bp over.

<P> A host of German banks - among them NordLB, WestLB, BVB and Rheinhyp - are
all said to be inviting bids for proposed Euro-French franc transactions, as is
US agency Fannie Mae.

<P> Standing out among the dollar straights was TMCC's third Euro-Asian bond, a
$500m five-year deal via CS First Boston and Nomura which tightened after launch
from its initial 11bp spread, while Lehman's self-led blow-out $250m floater
delighted all its syndicate members.

<P> The vogue for Italian retail-driven zero-coupon bonds continued, with the
structure now exported to the dollar sector for the EIB's 30-year $1bn offering
led by Salomon and to French francs for Balaba via JP Morgan. And the zeroes kept
on coming in Deutschmarks and lire.

<P> It was a busy week in lire in general, with a total of eight deals including
a new seven-year benchmark from the World Bank; in sterling, 10 issues delivered
over &#163;1.5bn to the market.

<P> Stand-out emerging market deals were Argentina's Lit500bn Eurolira
transaction via SBC Warburg, and Lebanon's Banque Audi with a $100m offering led
by Merrill Lynch.

<P> Perhaps showing the shape of Eurobonds to come, the EIB's Pta40bn 10-year
deal via Caja de Madrid was marketed through  extensive TV advertising.

<H3>DEAL INSIDER</H3> <B>STEVEN IRVINE </B>
<H2>Nomura spots Euroyen opening </H2>
<B>Issuer: Fannie Mae</B> <BR>
<B>Amount: &#165;100 billion</B> <BR>
<B>Maturity: 3 years 6 months</B> <BR>
<B>Coupon: 2%</B> <BR>
<B>Launched: May 14</B> <BR>
<B>Lead managers: Nomura, Merrill Lynch</B> <BR>
<BR>
Quite a few mouths stood agape when Federal National Mortgage Association,
better known as Fannie Mae, re-opened the international Euroyen market in
mid-May. Not least because international investors bought a bond that offered
only a 2% coupon - the lowest ever for a global issue. <BR>
<BR>
The deal was driven by technical conditions which not everyone was in a
position to spot - they combined a mixture of swap arbitrage, a subtle
shift in sentiment among international investors towards yen, the need for
existing investors to switch out of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), and
the desirability of creating a new benchmark, the last having been issued
by the World Bank in November 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura had the idea, which partly stemmed from a long position in short-dated
JGBs that it built up in February, for reasons explained below. Nomura estimates
that it controls 25-30% of secondary market trading in Euroyen, and talks
daily to a broad range of investors. Feedback from its salesforce at the
beginning of April suggested that European investors, particularly UK-based
index-funds, had started re-weighting their portfolios. They were largely
underweight in yen, and were seeking to establish a neutral position. They
wanted a bond which was liquid, possessed a current coupon - which
means that it trades close to par and therefore reflects current market
yields - and carried no credit risk. Their attitude, however, was defensive,
and they were buying only short maturies. (The week prior to the issue,
&#165;25 billion was invested at the short end of the curve.) <BR>
<BR>
Nomura began narrowing the range of issuers it could approach. It settled
on a shortlist of four which included Fannie Mae and the World Bank. However,
because of its new single currency lending programme, the World Bank's yen
borrowings have fallen drastically, and Nomura knew the swap into dollars
would not meet its target. Fannie Mae, on the other hand, was keen to promote
its name and expand its investor base. The bond promised to be a high profile
benchmark for the whole sector, and a debut global in yen. From the lead
manager's perspective it was also an issuer which carried a solid triple-A,
and the status of a surrogate government bond, backed by a US government
guarantee. <BR>
<BR>
This was vital, because it was expected that more than half the demand for
the bond would arise from switching. Indeed, one of the key technical factors
creating this issue's momentum was that it was a clever alternative to coupon-washing.
This is the process in which so-called non-designated financial institutions
sell their JGBs just prior to coupon dates to designated financial institutions
(DFIs) - ie any Japanese institution, selected central banks, or a
supranational of which Japan is a shareholder. This is to avoid paying withholding
tax on the proceeds. DFIs do not pay withholding tax, and recycle the bonds
back to the seller. <BR>
<BR>
That is why the bond was structured like a JGB. It was priced off the JGB
125 and matures, just as it does, on December 20 1999, and likewise pays
coupons on June 20 and December 20. The salesforce was able to say, why
not switch straight into this surrogate government bond, which as a Euro
has no withholding tax, and gives a 7 basis point (bp) pick-up over JGBs?
Indeed, the deal was launched in mid-May to take advantage of the coupon-washing
anticipated in June. <BR>
<BR>
Aside from those switchers, it was hoped that holders of other illiquid
Euroyen might decide to take profits. Virtually every other benchmark Euroyen
bond was trading at a premium - in many cases because they were issued
at a time of higher interest rates. For example the European Investment
Bank bond that matures in 1999 pays a coupon of 5.875% and was trading the
week before the Fannie launch at 112. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura faxed Fannie Mae on April 26, explaining: &quot;The driving force
in this transaction, which differentiates it from all other yen issues in
the past 16 months, will be institutional investors and central banks in
Europe and Asia, rather than solely Japanese investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, almost to the day, Nomura lost the mandate to lead a Fannie
Mae dollar deal, and had to settle for a position as a senior co-lead. But,
this was a first step. Nomura had not been involved in a Fannie Mae transaction
since the 1980s. <BR>
<BR>
Fannie Mae wanted to gather other opinions on the likelihood of the deal
working. It confidentially approached three of its closest relationship
banks. Only one saw no demand, and of the other two Merrill Lynch mobilised
its enthusiasm the quickest, and was brought in as a joint-lead and joint
bookrunner - the latter denoting shared league table credit. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura made it clear that the deal had to be big, if it was going to work
at all - otherwise the switch demand would not kick-in. An issue size
below &#165;100 billion (nearly $1 billion) would not be liquid enough.
To ensure liquidity the lead managers also committed to a 10 sen bid/offer
trading spread for the first six months after launch (sen is the yen equivalent
of cents). This is the tightest spread currently in the secondary Euroyen
market. <BR>
<BR>
The swap itself provided the arbitrage that made the issue acceptable to
Fannie Mae's borrowing targets. The arbitrage centred on an anomaly in the
five-year yen futures contract. <BR>
<BR>
The new five-year futures contract was created in February, and the first
rollover was due on June 1. A basket of bonds with maturities between 3.5
years and 6 years are deliverable into the contract, and initally the 'cheapest'
to buy were the shorter-dated bonds, of which there was heavy buying. But
this surge in demand in an area of the curve where the float was only $4
billion, in turn made them expensive relative to other JGBs. The normal
swap spread from fixed into floating yen was 25-30bp, but it moved out at
the 3.5 year maturity to 45bp, giving an extra 15bp of arbitrage. The Fannie
Mae bond had a maturity of 3.5 years to take advantage of this. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura had a natural swap position because it bought a large number of shorter
dated JGBs in February in anticipation of the new futures contract's impact
on the underlying. Both leads locked in the swap at 8am on Tuesday May 14,
launched at 9.30am and decided to price the issue the next morning. <BR>
<BR>
On the Wednesday morning (London time) there was some drama as the Japanese
ministry of finance held its weekly press conference, just after Tokyo closed.
A MOF official indicated interest rates would not rise in the near future,
and so the market rallied - or rather the 10-year futures contract,
which trades outside Tokyo time, did. The fear during pricing was that the
coupon might be forced below 2%, a psychological level for international
investors. A rallying market was pushing down yields. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile a morning conference call was to take place prior to pricing.
David Shasha, who jointly covers Fannie Mae for Nomura with Armando Vallini,
chaired the call which comprised: two from Merrill's London syndicate, four
from Nomura's London syndicate, one from Merrill swaps and one from Nomura
swaps in London, one from Merrill's Tokyo syndicate (where it runs its Euroyen
book), a Merrill coverage officer for Fannie Mae in New York, plus one swap
dealer each from Merrill and Nomura in New York. From Fannie Mae there were
Mehmood Nathani, David Levine and Don Simpson all of whom were taking the
calls from their beds since it was 3am Washington-time. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the market stabilized, and the issue was priced with a 2% coupon.
<BR>
<BR>
The spread tightened by 6bp in two weeks, and less than 10% of the issue
was placed in Japan. Linda Knight, Fannie Mae's treasurer, told the lead
managers at the Euromoney borrowers conference, a month later, that she
was delighted. It was the first time she had not received a single phone
call badmouthing a deal. A rare beast. <p>

<H3>ASIAN BROKERS</H3>

<H3><B>Bruising battle for Asian dominance</B> </H3> 
<H4> <B>As more and more
investment dollars flow into Asia, competition for commissions is becoming more
intense. For integrated investment banks the prospect of turning research
expertise into fat underwriting fees is enticing, but that is not the only
business strategy being pursued by the top firms in  the 1996 Asian brokers
survey. Andrew Capon reports</B> </H4> 

<P> ING Barings could scarcely have chosen
a worse time to slip down the rankings in <I>Euromoney/Global Investor'</I>s<I>
</I>seventh annual  institutional fund managers' assessments of Asian equity
research. The region is attracting more players and competition is cutthroat.

<P> The overall ranking is based on a simple question put to fund managers: Which
firm has the best analysts in the Asia Pacific region? (For the scores in
individual markets see tables.) ING Barings slipped from second position last
year to third this year, with Jardine Fleming again taking the top spot and
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia taking second.

<P> Jeremy Palmer, chief executive of ING Barings in the region, is resilient but
not complacent: "The overall pattern of this survey, and others, is that we are
still a top-tier player. Our historic position of nearly total hegemony was never
going to last indefinitely," he says.

<P> When fund managers are asked why ING Barings is falling in their estimation,
they are generally equivocal. "It is a strong firm, there's no doubt about it,"
says one. But he adds: "I just don't feel a pressing urgency to call them. I
don't think their product has evolved in the way it might." At the same time ING
Barings' competitors are getting better as they commit ever greater resources to
the region.

<P> "I suppose 10 years ago Jardine Fleming and Barings probably employed a
quarter of all the analysts in the region," says another survey respondent. "Now
other firms have a much bigger presence and can challenge these two. I think, in
a way, Barings has been stuck in what I call the waterfront approach. Their
attitude has been: we have this many analysts, in this many centres, covering
this many countries, so you must deal with us. I don't think it can continue to
rely on the strength-of-numbers argument any more."

<P> Firms that are busily bolstering their Asian presence include Merrill Lynch,
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and UBS. The pressures of running an Asian securities
business are increasing as the stakes are continually raised. Keeping the best
staff has become absolutely critical for traditionally strong players as
competitors proliferate.

<P> <B>High staff turnover</B>

<P> Some estimates put staff turnover at Asian brokers at 35% annually. That
leaves fund managers dizzy. "The trouble with this region is that as soon as you
strike up a relationship with an analyst or salesman, he ups and goes to another
firm down the road." The pool of available talent is so limited that one move can
spark a chain reaction. "Recently we lost our banking analyst, so we had to go
out and poach an analyst from somewhere else. So, in turn, does that firm, and on
and on and on. It's farcical really, but it's a fact of life out here," says a
senior executive at a major regional brokerage

<P> Different firms are pursuing different strategies to keep key people.
Christopher Rampton, managing director of Jardine Fleming Broking, the top-rated
firm this year, thinks the local nature of the business is a plus when it comes
to attracting and keeping staff. "I think that the staff feel secure that Asia is
the home of Jardine Fleming and so recognize we are committed, and will remain
so. The strings are pulled locally."

<P> Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia, placed second in this year's overall
ranking and clearly the emerging force in the region, believes it has an ace up
its sleeve. Gary Coull, chairman and chief executive, says: "Our staff turnover
is lower than our rivals' and I think that this is down to the ownership
structure of the firm. We are 35% employee-owned. Today, there are 70 staff
owners."

<P> Despite the collapse last year, most ING Barings staff have remained. The
strains are now showing. A team of eight departed ING Barings for Asset Plus
Securities in Thailand last month. Standard Chartered Securities, now owned by
Thai Military Bank, is also actively recruiting<B>. </B>Andrew Fraser, Standard
Chartered's boss, is an ex-Barings man who has been recruiting from among former
colleagues.

<P> Jeremy Palmer, ING Barings' regional chief executive, says: "Our staff
turnover is broadly comparable with our peers. The Thailand team was a particular
case because they wanted equity. This is a turbulent industry that is going
through a particularly rough time at the moment as new firms set up. It is
inevitable that we will be a target."

<P> <B>Tight margin strategies</B>

<P> However, the pressures are such that ING Barings is considering giving
employees equity participation. "I can't at this stage say much beyond that this
is at the planning stage. Clearly, equity is a tremendous binder," says Palmer.
Jardine Fleming's Rampton admits that ownership is probably the best way to tie
staff to the firm and says although there have been discussions, no decision has
been made.

<P> But even if a firm has managed to tie its best staff in, turning analytical
power into revenues is not easy. Competition inevitably means that commissions
are still under downward pressure. "Pressure on commissions is always there,
though in my experience it is a bit less savage than last year," says
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia's Coull. "Fortunately, I think fund
managers are tending to focus more of their business with a smaller number of
brokers. If you can tap into that business you can get bigger volumes."

<P> The concentration of commissions among relatively few players does seem to be
a trend. "I think we are concentrating our commissions more as we regularize and
become more disciplined about how we choose who we deal with. Now there is a core
of, say, six brokers in the region who get 75% of our commissions and we expect a
superior service from them. The rest of the commission gets spread very thinly,"
says a fund manager with a major UK life company. "We've actually been helped in
this process by the consolidation among investment banks. Whereas a year ago SG
Warburg may have got 15% and SBC 5% of our commission, the combined entity gets
15%. The scraps have tended to go to the smaller local specialists we value for
individual market input."

<P> The strategies for coping with tighter margins and concentrating commission
vary widely. ING Barings is taking the route US-integrated investment banks
favoured in Europe following the UK's Big Bang and the downward spiral of
commissions there: leverage secondary market analysts to win primary markets
business and primary markets deal flow to maintain secondary markets expertise
and trading in those securities.

<P> Palmer at ING Barings says that though agency broking remains profitable, it
is prudent to bolster other bits of the business. "Margins are under pressure.
The future profitability of this business lies in the diversification of revenues
into other areas. Top of that list is corporate finance and primary market work
in both equity and debt, and also derivatives. The delivery platform is the
agency broking network we have built up in the region. Agency broking is a core
business, but there are pressures on the profitability of this business."

<P> The distribution power that an agency broking business creates is also
emphasized by Jardine Fleming's Rampton. Jardine Fleming has been more
conspicuously successful in winning primary equity market business in the last
few years than other regional players. However, Rampton says the cart should not
be put before the horse. "Capital markets, market-making, derivatives, securities
lending, all these different pieces of the firm, are ancillary and supplementary
to the core agency broking business. The other businesses can only flourish if
the core product is making its mark across the region."

<P> Rampton adds that the interface with the fund management community can
promote deal flow for the capital markets business. "The feedback we get from
clients on companies allows us to say, to suggest, to the capital markets team
which vendors may be worth pursuing," he says.

<P> Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia is taking a different tack to its two
main regional rivals. Coull says the firm is pursuing a strategy of being a
classic British-style agency broker. "What we want to do is make money by making
our clients money." Coull is convinced that agency broking will remain
profitable. Although the firm has been involved in investment banking business,
notably in China where it has been the bookrunner in eight privatizations, it has
declared an intention of never deriving more than 50% of its revenues from
investment banking fees.

<P> <B>Smash and grab</B>

<P> "I think primary markets business is about making money while the good times
last. It's smash and grab. Agency broking is a more stable long-term business.
It's about nurturing relationships and providing clients with subtle,
thought-provoking research. If you can do that you can make money in the good
times and the bad. I think a firm like ours is a good counterweight to the
investment bank culture," says Coull.

<P> The survey result suggests that is a successful business strategy.
Inevitably, fund managers, especially UK-based ones, are suspicious of linkages
between corporate finance work and research. "We are generally antipathetic
toward the US firms and a little concerned about the direction of some of the
British ones," says a manager with more than $3 billion invested in Asia. "I
think fund managers are the third priority for US investment banks. The
number-one concern is their proprietary trading book and their second concern is
their corporate clients, real or potential."

<P> This is, of course, a well-rehearsed argument. Since it is fund managers that
have pushed down commissions for agency broking, they might be accused of trying
to have their cake and eat it. Interestingly some fund managers, used to dealing
with integrated investment banks in Europe, are becoming rather more
sophisticated in how they view these potential conflicts.

<P> A director of one of the world's largest active fund management companies,
with more than $9 billion invested in Asian markets, says: "I actually don't
think in terms of conflicts of interest at all. Firms like Merrill Lynch and
Jardine Fleming are actually rated more highly by me because of the deal flow
that they have. Firstly, by building a relationship, I want to ensure good
treatment when good deals come along. Secondly, in an IPO or secondary offering,
an investment bank can get that much closer to the top management of a company
and better understand what their plans are. If an investment bank can then
translate that into first-rate secondary market coverage, everyone wins."

<P> <B>Analyst at the apex</B>

<P> The best trick of all for an investment bank is to employ an analyst
respected by investors and by the senior management of the companies he covers.
That should ensure both primary market deal flow and secondary market commission
income. Peter Churchouse, Morgan Stanley Asia's Hong Kong property analyst,
top-rated in this survey for two years running, matches that description.

<P> Praise for Churchouse is almost boundless. "Peter Churchouse is unique in his
understanding of the Hong Kong property market," says a fund manager at a major
UK house. "There are a handful of people, including Michael Green at Nomura, who
comprehensively know and understand what is going on. But only Peter has managed
to consistently relate news to stock prices. He stands at the apex talking to the
best minds in the fund management world and the top people in the industry. He is
the only analyst that the property tycoons take seriously."

<P> Churchouse has certainly fulfilled the traditional role of a research analyst
at an agency broking firm: he has made money for his institutional clients. In
January 1995 he was telling clients to buy the major Hong Kong developers,
arguing that Hong Kong residential property prices were in a cyclical bear
market. Most commentators thought the downturn was a secular trend.

<P> Companies like Cheung Kong were then trading at HK$21 ($2.71) but have risen
as high as HK$60. In September 1995 he started recommending increased weightings
in property investment companies like Wharf Holdings, Great Eagle, Hongkong Land
and Amoy Properties. Since November the sector has outperformed the market by 9%
and Great Eagle's share price has risen from HK$13 to HK$22.

<P> But in addition to making money for his clients, Churchouse has helped make
money for Morgan Stanley Asia. There have been three major property deals in Hong
Kong this year and Morgan Stanley has been a bookrunner for each of them.

<P> In January $522 million was raised in a secondary placement by Walter Kwok's
Sun Hung Kai Properties. Morgan Stanley was the sole bookrunner. Li Ka-Shing's
Cheung Kong raised $686 million in a secondary offer in February, the largest
equity placement in Hong Kong since 1993. Morgan Stanley ran joint books with
Peregrine Capital, HSBC Investment Bank Asia and Goldman Sachs. Finally, in
March, Henderson Land successfully spun off its Chinese interests in an IPO for
which Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, HSBC Investment Bank Asia and Morgan Stanley ran
the books.

<P> Investment banks and brokers may puzzle over how best to make money, but the
main interest of fund managers remains the quality of research a firm offers.
Their needs are evolving. One reason Barings has slipped in the rankings may be
the general feeling that the firm has stood still while rivals have developed
their research product.

<P> Some of the criticism is harsh.  "ING Barings' research is a bit like vanilla
ice cream," says a senior fund manager at a major UK asset management firm.
"There's an awful lot of it about and none of it is very interesting. The
franchise seems to depend solely on numbers. The way I manage money in Asia has
evolved. Their research product hasn't." Unfortunately for ING Barings, the
results, in aggregate, supported this individual view.

<P> The picture is repeated at the individual-country level. ING Barings was
ranked top in five markets last year &#173; Indonesia, Korea, Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand. This year its only top spot is the Philippines, a
thinly-traded market.

<P> Jeremy Palmer, chief executive of ING Barings in the Asia Pacific,
acknowledges that product development may have been allowed to slip. "We do take
on board that the needs of the client base are evolving all the time and it is
probably fair to say that in 1995 we may have been distracted from the task of
product development. Since the rescue and the inevitable reorganization that
ensued, we have been very focused on upgrading what we do. It is the case that as
markets become more transparent, it is harder to add value. We are doing that in
a number of key markets, though it may take time for the perception to filter
through," says Palmer.

<P> One product that has greatly helped Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia is
its <I>Asia Morning Line</I>, an eight-page fax distributed daily to 1,200
institutional clients, covering the entire region. One Boston-based asset manager
says: "It's the best product out there. Peregrine used to have the best fax
service but it has been eclipsed by Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais. It covers all the
markets succinctly and includes information on a company visit. I come into work
and there, on my desk, I've got six good investment ideas."

<P> <B>Saturday morning read</B>

<P> The views of fund managers on the utility of regional strategy and economics
also seems to be changing. After two years at the top, ING Barings' Alan
Butler-Henderson is edged out by Jim Walker of Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais.
Butler-Henderson does not even make it into the top three, with Crosby's Manu
Bhaskaran taking second place and Jardine Fleming's Colin Bradbury third.

<P> It seems Butler-Henderson's combative style may be out of favour. "I would
say Butler-Henderson falls into the didactic school of strategy which, quite
frankly, isn't very useful. He's also a bit esoteric for my taste," says one fund
manager. Bradbury and Bhaskaran, on the other hand, are praised for being down to
earth. "They all have their weaknesses. Butler-Henderson and Walker are too
opinionated, whereas with Bhaskaran it is sometimes hard to tease an investment
conclusion from what he is saying."

<P> Says one fund manager: "Butler-Henderson is a Saturday morning read.
Thought-provoking, enjoyable, but not always tremendously useful." Another adds:
"Nobody would accuse Jim Walker of being equivocal in his views. But I do feel
there is a difference in tone. I don't feel I am sitting in a church congregation
listening to a sermon. I feel there is a dialogue going on."

<P> Sectoral approaches to research are also being re-evaluated by fund managers.
For the first time this year, the responses from fund managers asked to rank
brokers by their sectoral work are markedly different from the overall best
analysts table. This suggests fund managers are beginning to draw distinctions
between the overall research product and sectoral work. Merrill Lynch takes the
top spot and is praised by fund managers for having developed the most
comprehensive sector-based regional research.

<P> <B>Sectoral research</B>

<P> For those looking to cover Asia on the cheap, sectoral analysis has an
obvious appeal. But fund managers are wise to this. "A lot of firms doing
sectoral research are doing it to hide their deficiencies in regional coverage.
It's a good deal cheaper to have six heads of sectoral research in Hong Kong
covering the region, than analysts in 10 different markets doing fundamental
company work," says one.

<P> What differentiates Merrill Lynch, says head of regional research Michael
Unsworth, is that it combines the two. "The background to this product is the
acquisition of Smith New Court by Merrill Lynch last year. Smith New Court had a
good on-the-ground presence in Asian markets. We sat down and decided how best to
combine the two firms, and work out a framework for the research product
regionally and globally. We have tried to combine the fundamental work of local
analysts with a regional sectoral product that links in with the global sectoral
work that Merrill Lynch is able to do," says Unsworth.

<P> Fund managers are divided on the usefulness of sectoral work. Simon
Nicholson, in charge of Asian investment at London-based Gartmore, one of the
UK's largest money management firms with $72 billion under management, is not
convinced. "Sectoral research has a curiosity value, but I don't act on it. It is
still the case that different markets have different valuations. Understanding
that is more important."

<P> UK rival, Mercury Asset Management, the largest UK fund manager with $120
billion under management, takes a different view. "Sectoral research is
definitely something we pay increasing attention to, particularly when assessing
valuation risk. In many markets fund managers end up holding very similar stocks,
most notably due to liquidity constraints. That makes spotting market-specific
pricing anomalies difficult. But pan-regionally, both within sectors and between
sectors, anomalies may emerge," says Asian fund manager Ewe Cameron Watt.

<P> The big question for brokers catering for firms like Mercury is whether
commissions will be directed on the basis of sectoral work. This is something
fund managers are loathe to discuss. The answer for brokers, as it is for any
intermediary, is know your client.<P>

<H3> <B>CSFB swipes Nomura staff for principal finance drive</B> </H3>

 <P> <B>FIVE KEY members of Nomura's high-profile principal finance group are leaving to form a new unit at CS First
Boston in London, <I>Euroweek</I> has learnt, in a move that dramatically
underlines the growing emphasis placed on the business by European banks. 

</B><P>
A number of other European-based institutions are known to be considering the
creation of similar operations, impressed by the amount of transactions completed
by Nomura's outfit in the first two years of its life and by lessons learnt
across the Atlantic.

<P> "We have made a substantial amount of money in the US on principal
activities," said Andy Stone, managing director and head of the principal
transaction group at CS First Boston in New York.

<P> "We feel that the non-US market is ready for the same type of experience.
There are huge profit opportunities."

<P> Principal finance involves the use of a bank's own capital to buy pools of
capital, as well as the deployment of the techniques of securitisation to channel
some of that exposure to capital market investors.

<P> The technique has been employed with great success in recent years in the US,
especially with illiquid and complex assets, and banks have begun to wake up to
its application outside the US.

<P> Nomura has been particularly prominent in the US, with a big-hitting
unit under the colourful leadership of Ethan Penner cutting swathes through a US
commercial real estate market kick-started by the flood of assets released from
the savings and loan industry by the Resolution Trust Corp.

<P> Nomura was the first bank to identify principal finance's wider applications
by committing substantial chunks of capital outside the US. So far, at least, its
boldness has paid off.

<P> Since appointing Goldman Sachs veteran Guy Hands as managing director and
head of the principal finance group in December 1994 Nomura has completed over
&#163;10bn of transactions, including headline-grabbers such as the &#163;1.6bn
sale of Ministry of Defence housing, a $3bn securitisation spun off an    MBO of
AT&amp;T Capital, and a &#163;700m securitisation of train leases.

<P> Other assets securitised include public houses and non-conforming residential
mortgages. Success on this scale made Nomura an obvious target for banks looking
to build a principal financing operation, and talk of likely defections has
circulated the market in recent weeks.

<P> Final details are unclear, but five staff seem set to join CSFB: Kim Duncan;
Garry Lawrence; Jeff Nash; Chris Patrick and Lorna Shearin.

<P> Rivals identify these bankers as some of the key professionals behind
Nomura's string of transactions, but Hands proclaimed himself unfazed by the
defections.

<P> "I have tremendous respect for all of these people, who are absolutely top
class professionals," he told <I>Euroweek. </I>"But with regard to the business
it is not a concern."

<P> Hands pointed out that the group still has 40 professionals, plus a network
of contacts with staff in the rest of Nomura as well as external professionals.

<P> He said the group would hire new people, but not necessarily directly as
replacements for the departing members. Hands said he had already decided to
focus on hiring more experienced members of staff with different skills,
reflecting a switch in the direction of the group as it focused less on putting
on new business and more on managing exposures to existing deals.

<P> Although Nomura makes money from the underwriting of securitisations, its
main returns come from warrants and the subsequent sell-down of subordinated debt
positions.

<P> Hands said Nomura had put on a larger-than-expected amount of deals against a
benign economic background, and it was important that the principal finance group
now concentrated on managing asset quality, especially in the face of a recession
he expects to arrive in the next two or three years.

<P> Those imperatives may have helped drive the group of five from Nomura.
Because the bank saw its capital committed over the long term, it wanted
compensation packages to reflect the lives of the transactions rather than the
more immediate profit-linked bonuses common in the rest of Nomura and the
investment banking industry.

<P> "We are trying to pay people over a three to seven-year period, and not a one
to two-year horizon," said Hands. "We were not willing to compromise on that.

<P> "I can only assume the departees were offered compensation packages that we
were not willing to pay."

<P> Sources close to the group said that the compensation package for the
principal finance group members must have rankled especially hard after such a
successful period, and when other thriving parts of Nomura were seen to be
enjoying more immediate fruits of their labours.

<P> Garry Lawrence, one of the departing group, declined to comment on the issue
of bonuses, saying that he and his colleagues were excited by the opportunity
that setting up a new group at a bank such as CS First Boston offered.

<P> CSFB's Stone said the new group would aim to marry the balance sheet and
contact list of Credit Suisse with the structuring and distribution skills of
First Boston.

<H2> Surprising Italy signs off as emerging supply continues </H2> 

<P> MOST eyes were turned to the prospects for
issuance in 1997 as the penultimate week in the 1996 issuing calendar drew to a
close.

<P> The price of the 30-year Treasury bond plummeted by more than a point on the
back of fears that Japanese investors were beginning to divest their dollar
holdings, giving a slightly nervous tone to the market as the year draws to a
close.

<P> One issuer which still had its eye firmly on the Eurobond 1996 ball, however,
was the Republic of Italy, which took the market by surprise with the
announcement that it had raised $1.5bn via a private placement in the German
Schuldschein market.

<P> The placement, managed by JP Morgan, had a duration of 16 years and a put
option at the eighth year. The deal allowed the Italian treasury to lock in funds
at a rate of 5.985% for the first eight years and 6.189% for the entire duration.

<P> Other frequent issuers are putting together plans for next year's funding.
The European Investment Bank, which has raised Ecu18bn this year, expects its
borrowing requirement to rise <BR> to in excess of Ecu20bn next year.

<P> The World Bank has around $4.2bn of its medium and long-term funding to
complete before the end of its fiscal year in June. DePfa estimates that it will
need to raise around $15bn equivalent in 1997, and KfW expects its borrowing
requirement to be at least DM20bn.

<P> Fittingly this week, perhaps the major trend of 1996 in the international
bond markets stood out -- the rise in issuance from the emerging markets.

<P> Latin American deals were once again in abundance. Anyone who had thought
that Argentina's remarkable 1996 funding spree had come to an end with its
Samurai and lira transactions last week were sorely mistaken, as the republic
came back to the market for a further DM1bn. Meanwhile Kazakstan followed up the
runaway success of Russia's first Eurobond and met a similar <BR> reception for
its own $200m three-year debut via ABN AMRO.

<P> A number of Latin banks and corporates braved the volatility in the US market
to launch deals before the year end, with Brazil's Globopar and Globex scoring
successes.

<P> Napocor rounded off a stellar year for issuers from the Philippines with its
$360m 10 and 20-year Yankee via Salomon. And IEC raised $125m of 100-year debt as
part of its $600m, three-tranche Yankee via Lehman.

<P> Two Asian sovereigns already appear to have advanced plans for major
financings early in 1997. The Republic of the Philippines has mandated CS First
Boston and JP Morgan to lead a $500m-plus 30-year Yankee, and Pakistan is mulling
a possible debut in the Samurai market.

<P> The most successful syndicated issue of the week was a UBS &#163;250m
subordinated 10-year bond which came at 39bp over and tightened rapidly to 34/35
over. It was the first subordinated sterling issue for UBS.

<P> Bankers expect the year to start with heavy issuance in the 10-year DM sector
following a new 10-year Bund auction in the first week of January. The normal
German names -- KfW, DePfa and DSL -- are likely to apply.

<P> Prospective dollar issuers are said to include Ontario, Quebec ($500m for 10
years), Italy and possibly Finland.

<P> Among Japanese issuers is EPDC, looking to do $250m for 10 years early in the
year. JFM will do a $200m equivalent in guilders over 10 years, with lead
managers believed to be ABN AMRO and DKB International.&#009;*

<P><B>This is the last issue that <I>Euroweek</I> will publish this year. Our
next edition will appear on Friday, January 10. In the meantime we would like to
take this opportunity to wish all our readers and advertisers a very happy
Christmas and a prosperous New Year. </B>

SOUTH AFRICA
</H3>
<p> 
<H2>No time for business as usual </H2>

<H4>The abolition of exchange controls and the start of privatization should
do wonders for the illiquid Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but fuller representation
of black businesses on the equity market is a vital change that's not so
easily accomplished. Mark Ashurst reports from Johannesburg </H4>
<p>
<font size=3>
&quot;To move forward with purpose requires that we extricate the public
and private sectors from the current comfort zones,&quot; president Nelson
Mandela told the South African parliament at the opening of its 1996 session
in Cape Town early last month. <BR>
<BR>
The sentiment is keenly endorsed by the burgeoning black business sector.
What is more, the vast majority of brokers on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
(JSE) appreciate the importance of the radical shake-up it demands. Yet
beneath this apparent consensus, the legacy of apartheid is writ large across
South African business. Nowhere is it more conspicuous than on the JSE's
listings board. <BR>
<BR>
Twelve black-owned companies are listed but, as of January 31, their combined
market value was R7 billion ($1.92 billion), slightly less than 0.6% of
the total market capitalization of R1.2 trillion. This is easily explained,
says Jonty Sandler, CEO of New Africa Investments, by far the largest black-owned
conglomerate and, in August 1994, the first to be listed: &quot;It is very
difficult for black business to raise capital.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Much of South Africa's political transition has been exemplary, but the
real test of liberation will be played out on the stock exchange. Without
a more equitable distribution of economic power, the process could still
come off the rails. As the principal mechanism for raising risk capital
in sub-Saharan Africa, the JSE will play a critical role in the development
of the new nation. As Mandela put it: &quot;We cannot build or heal if we
continue with business as usual.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Economic empowerment</B> <BR>
<BR>
It's a tall order for an exchange whose brokers are white, but it's one
that has long preoccupied the JSE's governing committee. In last year's
annual report, JSE president, Roy Anderson, noted that the exchange &quot;is
now being used as a vehicle for widening economic empowerment&quot;. His
optimism may be premature, given that black-owned business is characterized
by the same types of tightly controlled corporate structure that were developed
by white-owned big business before liberation, and were, for decades, the
butt of the criticism from exiled liberation movements. Nevertheless, a
number of recent initiatives at the 108-year-old bourse testify to its attempts
to attract more black-owned business. <BR>
<BR>
Particular attention has been paid to junior markets. The development capital
market, the oldest of these, plummeted during the global stock market crash
of 1987 and has not recovered. Its fundamental problem is size. With only
nine listings, it is thinly traded and it is poorly understood. Improved
research would revive interest, but would require investment that brokers
will avoid as long as returns in bigger and more complex equity markets
are buoyant. <BR>
<BR>
The JSE's second attempt to find a new vehicle for development funds was
the venture capital market, which was founded in 1992 to raise capital on
a project-by-project basis. Although fundamentally different in purpose,
the new market's design is an improvement on the company-based older board.
Companies seeking a listing on the development capital market are, for example,
required to submit a two-year profit history and command at least R1 million
in subscribed capital. Less stringent conditions were attached to the venture
capital market. These were further relaxed last year to attract businesses
with capital needs beyond the R500,000 ceiling of the government's Small
Business Development Corporation. The profit-history requirement can be
waived altogether at the discretion of the board. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, what is known as a redevelopment sector has been launched on
the JSE for companies whose objective, says the listings guide, is to provide
&quot;assistance to socioeconomic development&quot;. The sector is listed
with other financial stocks on the JSE's main board, but some of the listing
requirements may be waived by the listings committee which has &quot;sole,
unfettered discretion&quot; over the admission of new applicants. By contrast,
other sectors on the main board have a minimum listing requirement of R2
million in subscribed capital and a three-year profit history. <BR>
<BR>
Notwithstanding the good intentions of the JSE committee, the junior boards
have failed to capture the imagination of managers with no experience of
the stock market. The redevelopment sector boasts only three listings, all
for Umbono, a private-sector funding and management agency which went to
the market this January. The most successful of the juniors has been the
venture capital market, with 10 listings including M-Cell, the cellular-telephone
venture of the Multichoice pay-television group, and several other technology
stocks. <BR>
<BR>
JSE operations director Neil Carter is aware that the creation of junior
boards with relaxed entry criteria does not address the latent divisions
between the JSE and black business. &quot;We are still saddled with the
image that the stock exchange is a casino for rich whites,&quot; he says.
&quot;We have not gone out in a systematic way to identify black entrepreneurs&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The JSE has launched a new marketing drive targeting black leaders of medium-sized
businesses. But these are thin on the ground despite the rapid growth of
this sector - which is perhaps why the JSE's search for a black marketing
specialist to spearhead its campaign has so far proved fruitless. <BR>
<BR>
There may also be more profound reasons for the JSE's scant appeal among
black entrepreneurs. The legacy of exchange controls, designed to prevent
capital outflows during the sanctions era, is a labyrinthine network of
cross-holdings among local companies forced to invest their profits at home.
More than 70% of the JSE is controlled by four corporations: mining and
industrial group Anglo American, insurance group Sanlam, tobacco and luxury
goods group Rembrandt, and insurance and financial services group SA Mutual.
All are tightly controlled empires built on multi-tier pyramid structures
that vest ultimate control in their founding families. The Oppenheimers
of Anglo American and Rembrandt's Rupert family are the best-known examples.
<BR>
<BR>
Such concentration of economic power has long been a grievance for those
outside the inner sanctum and continues to attract fierce criticism from
the African National Congress (ANC). It is an indication of the low esteem
in which the new government's majority party holds these structures that
justice Richard Goldstone, the country's most eminent judge, has been appointed
to head a new committee charged with reviewing corporate governance and
reforming company law. (Goldstone spearheaded inquiries into the so-called
&quot;third force&quot; activities of apartheid's security forces during
the 1980s.) <BR>
<BR>
The creation of new multi-tiered pyramids has for decades been banned on
the JSE, unless they are the &quot;demonstrably fortuitous&quot; out-come
of mergers or acquisitions approved by shareholders in all operating companies.
That issue, and the concomitant question of &quot;unbundling&quot; the existing
corporates in the interests of diversifying economic control, has gained
a new lease of life from South Africa's return to the global economy. <BR>
<BR>
Ironically, black empowerment has revived pyramid structures, whose staunchest
defenders are none other than the black business leaders formerly involved
in the anti-apartheid struggle. The best known of these is Nthato Motlana,
chairman of New Africa Investments, who was once Mandela's personal physician
and who was frequently detained by police during the 1980s state of emergency.
<BR>
<BR>
Through Corporate Africa, a first-tier holding company, Motlana, and several
other prominent black business leaders, control New Africa Investments,
an empire that counts at least 20,000 individual shareholders and trade
unions representing more than 500,000 people. Similarly, Real Africa Holdings,
the JSE's second-biggest black-owned listing, is controlled by a first-tier
parent, Real Africa Investments. Its founder, Don Ncube, learned about the
workings of pyramid structures during a 20-year career at Anglo American.
He eventually earned directorships on the boards of several Anglo American
group companies. <BR>
<BR>
Both conglomerates derive their moral standing from the hundreds of thousands
of blacks who have direct or indirect stakes in their operating companies.
However, at holding company level, control is vested in a much narrower
array of shareholders. <BR>
<BR>
The standard justification for the new pyramids is that they help to balance
the concentration of power in white-owned business. Without them, it is
argued, black investors would still be at the starting blocks in the race
to wrest meaningful economic control from the hands of established conglomerates.
By contrast, though, with the white families that have dominated South African
business and once enjoyed the freedom to create multi-tiered pyramids, the
ultimate influence of Motlana and Ncube is curtailed by the Companies Act,
which forbids new pyramid structures of more than one tier. <BR>
<BR>
In pursuit of similar goals, the JSE has allowed black investors to list
so-called N shares which carry diminished voting rights. Thus African Life
is controlled by Real Africa Holdings, whose shareholding is 47%, via weighted
shares. Critics of weighted shares argue that the loss of voting rights
defeats the essential principle of share ownership, undermining the principle
of &quot;one share, one vote&quot;. To date, the market has taken little
note: N shares generally trade at the same price, or only fractionally lower,
than ordinary voting shares. Pragmatists point out that while the principle
of N shares is deplored by stockbrokers everywhere, N shares listed in London,
for example, are traded in a similar way. <BR>
<BR>
The consequences of intervention have so far deterred the overloaded new
government from tackling the issue. Ministers are mindful that New Africa
Investments was floated after Sanlam responded to political pressures by
unbundling Metropolitan Life to New Africa Investments, and that Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments, the R7 billion holding company owned by Anglo
American, is also up for sale this year. In the long term, it is unlikely
that these voluntary disposals will avert pressure to reform the oldest
of the multi-tier pyramids. The disposals may, however, be sufficient to
deter forced restructuring - a policy which the government knows could interrupt
the influx of foreign capital to the JSE. <BR>
<BR>
As the volume of black-owned capital increases, the influence of those who
oppose pyramids and N shares on principle could find an unlikely ally in
the rank-and-file members of the former liberation movements. Community
leaders have already expressed concern that the banner of black empowerment
has been something that a new economic elite could shelter behind. The partial
privatization of state-owned assets later this year will further fan the
flames of controversy, as a substantial portion of the sales will be to
black interests. <BR>
<BR>
Telecommunications operator Telkom, electricity generator Eskom and South
African Airways are among the state assets earmarked for &quot;restructuring&quot;.
If, as predicted, the initial phases of privatization win political acceptance,
the subsequent sale of larger stakes will drastically alter the profile
of the JSE. <BR>
<BR>
The biggest-market-cap companies on the JSE have been insulated from the
pressures of the global economy by exchange controls. Once restrictions
on the outflow of domestic capital are lifted, the dominant conglomerates
will invest heavily overseas in a bid to export long-contained expertise
into new markets. An improvement in liquidity is inevitable, clearing the
way for an unprecedented level of trading on the JSE and heralding a new
era of opportunity for black investors currently frustrated by the scarcity
of saleable stock. <BR>
<BR>
President Mandela's speech to parliament left no doubt that the next phase
of South Africa's revolution will be played out on the JSE's trading screens.
Commenting on the prospects for abolition of exchange controls, Mandela
prompted a spate of gambling among stockbrokers eager to predict the decline
of controls. &quot;For us,&quot; he said, &quot;it is not a matter of whether,
but of when these controls will be phased out.&quot; n 
<H3>Thirsty for liquidity </H3>
Brokers on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) are prepared to give up
everything, including their city-centre offices, to satisfy the international
institutions whose capital inflows have propelled the market to record highs.
In the first five weeks of 1996, market capitalization increased by 15%
to R1.2 billion ($330 million). As recently as last December, analysts had
forecast that it would take a whole year to achieve that level. <BR>
<BR>
This month, the JSE will get its first taste of electronic trading, which
is intended to make the exchange more attractive to international players.
Although life on the trading floor has survived the shift to screen-based
trading in other countries, local firms are considering leaving the city
in favour of suburban office parks. &quot;We will have more of a banking
culture - more electronic, more international, a lot of faceless people
behind screens,&quot; says Neil Carter, JSE's head of operations. <BR>
<BR>
If the introduction of electronic trading is on schedule, the Diagonal Street
tower block that houses his office in downtown Johannesburg could be up
for sale by the end of the year. Chemicals sector listings are expected
to be screen-traded on March 8, with other sectors due to follow by June.
<BR>
<BR>
Roy Anderson, executive president of the JSE and architect of the changes,
has a straightforward ambition: &quot;To create the best medium-sized stock
exchange in the world.&quot; His vision won the support of more than 75%
of brokers when the proposals were put to a vote last year. Technological
change was backed up by deregulation last November, when the JSE opened
its doors to banks and other institutions, allowing them to operate on their
own account for the first time. The next steps are designed to create a
market more efficient, transparent and secure than its predecessor. <BR>
<BR>
There are three key aspects of the reforms. Automated trading on the JET
(Johannesburg equities trading) system will replace open outcry, continuous
auction on the trading floor. Buyers and sellers will enter orders from
their computer workstations, JET will match the orders and complete the
transactions automatically. <BR>
<BR>
Second, brokers will be allowed to take on a dual role after electronic
listing, trading as agents on behalf of clients, or as principals on their
own account. They will, however, be obliged to disclose the capacity in
which they want to trade. <BR>
<BR>
Third, banks and other institutions may join the exchange as full members
where previously they had been confined to a maximum 30% stake in existing
firms. Some banks, such as BOE NatWest Securities and Baring ING, have chosen
to launch new operations, while others, such as Rand Merchant Bank, have
entered the market on their own account. Brokerage fees are now fully negotiable;
competition could bring them down by as much as 45%. <BR>
<BR>
Amid the general enthusiasm for change, fears have been expressed that,
under a more liberal regime, the most lucrative trade could shift to London.
Of the 641 companies listed on the JSE, 154 are also listed on overseas
exchanges, 81 of them in London. Although orders will be processed chronologically
on the automated system - it won't be possible for bigger orders to receive
preferential treatment from brokers - Carter says there has been &quot;no
real sign&quot; of a shift of business to London. <BR>
<BR>
Before considering the possibility of shifting business, institutions are
probably waiting to see how the JSE adapts to the abolition of exchange
controls, widely expected later this year. Initial steps towards abolition
could come as early as the March 13 government budget statement. When completed,
they will precipitate a huge rise in trade volumes as local conglomerates
rationalize their assets and begin to invest and expand overseas. The success
of such a move, which has been widely touted by business as a panacea for
the JSE, will be measured by its effect on the exchange's stubbornly low
liquidity. <BR>
<BR>
Illiquidity, rather than political risk, is now the biggest deterrent to
international investors considering South Africa. While analysts admit the
wider world is waiting to see how South Africa's democratic transition fares
under a successor to 77-year-old president Nelson Mandela, there is widespread
agreement in financial circles that Johannesburg is a relatively secure
market, lying somewhere between Asia, with its higher P/E ratios, and the
debt-laden Latin American bourses. &quot;This is the least emerging of the
emerging markets,&quot; says Nicholas Banszky, head of corporate finance
at Smith New Court. <BR>
<BR>
Liquidity, based on annual turnover as a proportion of market capitalization,
has remained flat this year at 7% - on a par with the annualized 1995 figure,
but down 0.6% on 1994. For as long as exchange controls survive, the 60%
to 70% annual liquidity ratio of London or New York will remain a brokers'
dream. <BR>
<BR>
Other obstacles to improved liquidity include the marketable securities
tax and stamp duty, both pegged at 1%. These are earmarked for review and
most brokers are confident they will be brought down to 0.5%, in line with
London, at the next budget. &quot;This is an issue of revenue, not of principle,&quot;
says Carter. &quot;Everyone knows it's a bad tax.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Reforms to capital gains tax, currently collected at the discretion of the
tax receiver, would also be welcomed. The knowledge that share deals are
liable for full taxation encourages players to sit on stock that would otherwise
be saleable. <BR>
<BR>
The controversy of the moment is the recommendation by the government-appointed
Katz Commission that, as part of a broader overhaul of the tax system, interest
on pension funds should be taxed at 30%. Last month, finance minister Chris
Liebenberg reaffirmed his support for the proposal in the face of angry
protests from pension fund managers reluctant to invest in the tightly held
equities market. Joss Gerson, a director at brokers Smith Borkum Hare, speaks
for most brokers when he brands the tax an anathema: &quot;The big local
institutions are up to their eyeballs in equities,&quot; he says, &quot;which
leaves little room for anyone else.&quot; <B><I>- MA</I></B>

<H3>A EUROMONEY SURVEY - APRIL 1996 </H3>
<H2>
Brighter prospects for Turkey? </H2>
<H4>
Economic policy: a casualty of party politics? 
The ideological, personal and political battles between Turkey's new
government coalition partners could damage economic management. Metin Munir
reports </H4>
Turkey's new government coalition is a shotgun wedding between two right-of-centre
parties which are ideological twins. However, its success will depend not
on ideology, but the personal chemistry between the leaders. <BR>
<BR>
The history of rivalry and antagonism between the True Party Party's (DYP)
Tansu Ciller and the Motherland Party's (ANAP) Mesut Yilmaz is not a good
omen for the coalition's durability. Although at grassroots level it is
generally expected that the two parties will sooner or later merge, there
is no indication that this is about to happen. On the contrary, the coalition
kicked off with a major disagreement: who should fill the top three bureaucratic
posts in the treasury, central bank and privatization office? All three
posts have been vacant since last December when Ciller recruited the incumbent
directors and sent them to parliament. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was agreed that no one who left the bureaucracy during Ciller's
term in office or was caused to leave should be appointed,&quot; said one
of Yilmaz's aides. This narrowed the field to such an extent that for weeks
the posts had to remain vacant. And Ciller is not easy to please. During
her three years in office she worked with three central bank governors and
as many secretary generals of the treasury. <BR>
<BR>
Yilmaz will rule until the end of the year when Ciller will take over for
two years. Then it will be Yilmaz's turn again for another year. During
the last year, 2000, a deputy from the DYP (not Ciller) will lead the country
to elections. Ciller has not taken a seat in the Yilmaz's cabinet, but is
firmly in command. <BR>
<BR>
The reason for the government's rise to power was a general election in
December last year when Ciller's 1993 coalition with the left-of-centre
Republican People's Party (CHP) collapsed. As widely predicted (and even
more widely feared) first place was won by professor Necmettin Erbakan's
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP). RP got some 21% of the vote and won 158
seats in the 550-member parliament. Ciller's DYP and Yilmaz's ANAP each
got roughly 19%, with the latter winning a slighly higher percentage. The
remaining 25% went to two left-wing parties, ex-prime minister Bulent Ecevit's
Democratic Left (DSP) and the CHP of outgoing deputy prime minister Deniz
Baykal. <BR>
<BR>
For a while it looked as if Yilmaz would join with Erbakan, but pressure
from business circles, the media and the military was so intense that he
had to drop the idea. This must have come as a particular relief to President
Demirel whose personal coalition experiment with Erbakan must count among
his unhappiest. The coalition was cut short when the army intervened in
1980, casting Demirel into political exile for six years. [Demirel later
recalled that at cabinet meetings Erbakan was given to long monologues which
were impossible to interrupt. One one occasion, Demirel told a Turkish journalist,
Erbakan spoke for six hours. &quot;By this time I had little hair left,&quot;
the president was quoted as saying. &quot;After Erbakan's speech, what hair
I did have turned white.&quot;] <BR>
<BR>
The elections came at a bad time for the economy which was recovering swiftly
from the currency crisis of the previous year. In 1995 Ciller's savage austerity
programme, supported by the IMF, successfully reduced the balance-of-payments
pressures and rebuilt foreign exchange reserves. From a contraction of 6%
in 1994 the economy recorded growth of some 7%. But the spending spree in
the pre-election period upset all balances and cast fiscal and monetary
discipline out of the window. Planned reforms were dropped. In January 1996
inflation reached 10% as the money spent during the campaign started sweeping
into the market. <BR>
<BR>
The government must now introduce another austerity programme and enact
a series of laws to enable structural reforms like privatization to proceed
smoothly. But the coalition does not have a majority in parliament. It won
a vote of confidence - thanks to Ecevit - so that a government could be
formed which excluded Erbakan. But Ecevit has no further commitment to the
coalition which, for all intents and purposes, remains a minority government.
It is unlikely that Ecevit will support privatization, social security and
agricutural reform or wage restraint which are pivotal to the economy's
long-term health. <BR>
<BR>
Another weakness of the coalition is that the conduct of economic policy
has been distributed among a team four ministers of state, three belonging
to Ciller's and one to Yilmaz's party. No one knows who, if anyone, is in
charge. <BR>
<BR>
Yilmaz's man is Rusdu Saracoglu, ex-governor of the central bank, who is
widely respected in Turkey and abroad. Saracoglu<B> </B>was lured to Turkey
from the IMF in Washington in 1984 by Turgut Ozal, the late Turkish leader,
who liked giving top jobs to foreign-trained young Turks. Saracoglu, whose
great grandfather was one of the top lieutenants of Ataturk (the revered
founder of modern Turkey) became arguably the most successful appointee.
After three three years of apprenticeship he became governor of the central
bank in 1987. During his six-year tenure he established the interbank money
markets and was the author of many other fiscal reforms. <BR>
<BR>
When Ciller became prime minister in 1993 Saracoglu was forced to quit because
he came into conflict with her on the conduct of monetary policy. Not seeing
eye-to-eye with Ciller can be dangerous, as Saracoglu's successor found
when the prime minister threw an ashtray at his head when he didn't do what
he was told. Although Saracoglu escaped without bodily harm Ciller dragged
him through the courts for allegedly misusing central bank funds. Saracoglu,
who is a keen amateur flier, was accused, among other things, of using the
bank's money to charter planes for his personal pleasure. He rejected the
charges and continues to fight a protracted legal battle. <BR>
<BR>
One of the main question marks hanging over the coalition is how Saracoglu
and Ciller will get on when Ciller succeeds Yilmaz. Saracoglu is clearly
Yilmaz's top financial lieutenant. He is in charge of privatization and
the state banks and will act as a sort of foreign minister for the economy.
He is also a member of the supreme planning board and the money and credit
coordination council which make economic policy. <BR>
<BR>
The Ciller-Saracoglu question can be shelved for nine months until the change
of guard at the prime minister's office takes place. The more immediate
question is the relationship between Saracoglu and the three DYP ministers
of state who Ciller fielded in the new cabinet as her economic team. Particularly
important is how Saracoglu will get on with Yaman Toruner, who succeeded
the ashtray victim as central bank governor in 1994. The antagonism between
the two goes back to Saracoglu's days as governor when Toruner was one of
his directors. It was through Toruner that Ciller brought the lawsuit against
Saracoglu. <BR>
<BR>
Toruner worked in the central bank for 18 years until 1990 when he was appointed
director of the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). In 1994, at the height of
the currency crisis, Ciller sent him back to the central bank where he won
praise from international bankers for his deft handling of the situation.
He has a reputation for being a tough, pragmatic central banker, a man who
is not afraid of taking risks. Toruner's reputation has been blemished by
press charges that he became rich by taking commissions during the construction
of the new ISE building and passing on information to favoured banks. He
denied the charges but could not give a satisfactory explanation about the
origins of his wealth. Toruner recently returned to the headlines when his
wife established a company allegedly to advise exporters. The question is
why she waited until her husband became minister of state in charge of Turkey's
Eximbank and undersecretariat for foreign trade before opening shop. <BR>
<BR>
Ufuk Soylemez is seemingly the top man in Ciller's economic team. His rise
has been little short of meteoric. In less than two years he went from being
branch manager of a middle-sized bank in Ankara to head of the privatization
office when he came to the notice of Ozer Ciller, the ex-prime minister's
husband. Today, He will look after the state planning organization, the
treasury, and the capital markets board and has a seat in economic policy-making
bodies. Those who know him well say that he is energetic and hardworking
but lacks experience. <BR>
<BR>
Ayfer Yilmaz (no relation to the prime minister) is the only woman on the
economic team and the most junior. She has spent her entire career at the
treasury where she became secretary general in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Not many people give the coalition more than two years. There are some who
believe that when Ciller assumes the premiership at the end of this year
and goes to parliament for a fresh vote of confidence Ecevit will withdraw
his support. But Ciller has an ace up her sleeve in the form of the Republican
People's Party (CHP), her ex-coalition partner which wants to join the coalition.
The CHP is not in the present coalition because Yilmaz did not want to appear
as a mere appendage to the pre-election government. In all likelihood Ecevit
will turn against the coalition even before the year is out, giving Ciller
the chance to re-shape the coalition. With the CHP, the government would
have solid backing and could well have a longer lifespan than its critics
currently predict. <BR>

<H3>The transition from casino to bourse </H3>
<H4>The Istanbul Stock Exchange is predominantly driven by local retail
and foreign institutional investors. But more and more private-sector companies
are <BR>
recognizing the potential of the exchange as a means of raising funds </H4>
On weekdays Mustafa Bayraktar's routine rarely changes. At eight o'clock
every morning, he leaves his flat in Kuzguncuk, a district of Istanbul,
and makes his way down to the Dilim patisserie for breakfast: two steamy
<I>poaca</I> - a cheesy Turkish savoury pastry - and a cup of tea fetched
by a teaboy from the tiny tea house across the road. By this time the road
in front of the patisserie is a solid mass of cars inching their way towards
the nearby bridge across the Bosphorus Straits to Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Before he became a full-time player on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE),
Bayraktar worked for seven years as a taxi driver in Kuzguncuk and knows
the frustration of sitting in traffic jams. After breakfast Bayraktar crosses
the road to catch the 8.45 am ferry to Eminonu on the European side for
which there is never a traffic jam. There he catches a taxi to Deha, the
stockbrokers. The rest of the day is spent in Deha's spacious <I>seans odasi</I>,
the public dealing room where customers buy and sell, and follow the market
on large screens. <BR>
<BR>
In the way that others go to an office every day, Bayraktar goes to Deha's
to manage his portfolio for which he is investor, broker and market analyst.
There are many individual investors like him in Turkey - although few, like
Bayraktar, make it their full-time business. <BR>
<BR>
There are very few domestic institutional investors in Turkey. ING-Baring's
country manager, Atif Cezayirli, estimates that 90% of domestic buying is
generated by individuals. &quot;If you discount foreign institutional buying,
the market is primarily driven by individual investors,&quot; he says. &quot;The
market is predominantly retail.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The chain of events which transformed Bayraktar into an investor started
at the end of 1993 when Bayraktar sold his taxi licence for TL90 million.
He had been buying shares from vendors in front of the old stock exchange
in Karakoy since 1989 and decided to put all of his money into shares, but
the owner of Deha advised him to buy dollars. &quot;When people give me
advice, I take it,&quot; he says. At the time of conversion, the exchange
rate was TL14,365 to the dollar. Three months later the lira collapsed,
the index plummeted and there was a huge devaluation. Bayraktar sold his
dollars for TL34,000 to the dollar and invested them in shares. &quot;The
index was 12,000 when I started,&quot; he says. &quot;The Turks had all
left the market. It was just me and the foreign institutions. When the index
hit 19,200 [a few months later] I sold. I reconverted my capital to dollars
at TL30,000 to the dollar and with the rest, I bought more shares.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
At 10:00 am, the Istanbul Stock Exchange opens for the first of its twice
daily two-hour sessions. Bayraktar perches on the arm of a leather couch
and stares at a large screen where green, yellow and red figures and arrows
chart the chaotic movement of Turkish shares. There are about a dozen other
investors in the large room overlooking the port of Istanbul. A stockbroker
takes their buy and sell orders and answers their questions after consulting
a colleague on the stockmarket floor. <BR>
<BR>
In his faded blue jeans and black leather jacket, Bayraktar looks more like
a tea-room gambler than an investor but, then, as Ali Ihsan Karacan, chairman
of the Capital Markets Board, puts it: &quot;The ISE still has a long way
to go to graduate from a casino to a bourse.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Istanbul Stock Exchange has grown by leaps and bounds since 1986 when
it first opened its doors. From very modest beginnings, market capitalization<B>
</B>grew to an equivalent of $3,840 million by January this year. The number
of shares traded in the same month was a record $4,383 million. Initially,
most companies floated shares to benefit from tax breaks but &quot;going
public is a growing trend among closely-held private-sector companies and
groups which recognize it as an efficient way of raising funds,&quot; according
to a Turkiye Ekonomi Bankasi (TEB) report. As of June last year, 103 of
the 500 largest industrial corporations, five of the largest 20 commercial
banks and six of the 20 largest insurance companies were listed on the ISE.
Market capitalization was 36% of GNP. In the beginning the exchange was
housed in a decrepit building in Karakoy, but now it occupies spacious new
premises overlooking the Bosphorus and is equipped with the most advanced
computers. <BR>
<BR>
But it still remains a market dominated by manipulators and, consequently,
turnover is rapid. According to one calculation, 90% of the daily business
volume consists of shares bought and sold on the same day. Manipulation
is possible because many shares are &quot;shallow&quot;, or so limited in
numbers that their prices can be pushed up and down by people with lots
of ready cash or &quot;dry money&quot;, in Turkish jargon. The Capital Markets
Board has imposed a legal range of 20% within which a share can rise or
fall in any given trading day. Had this not been imposed, it is impossible
to guess how much shares would have fluctuated. <BR>
<BR>
There are some 150 brokerage firms operating in the market: about one-third
of them are owned by or are part of a commercial bank. Most of them are
small - some are so small that they manage only their owners' investments.
Undercapitalizaton is the norm. A mere six houses traded over TL100,000
billion worth of shares in 1995, accounting for about one-fifth of the total
trading volume. By far the biggest was Global, a privately-owned firm with
trading volume of TL279,000 billion. Ata, owned by a construction firm,
traded shares worth TL166,000 billion and Garanti Yatirim, belonging to
a prime Turkish bank, TL158,000 billion. These were trailed by Karon, Polen
and Tacirler, each of which traded more than TL100,000 billion worth of
shares. Bayraktar's Deha traded over TL30,000 billion worth of shares. <BR>
<BR>
Many brokers undertake proprietary trading, buying and selling extensively
and aggressively on their own behalf. Many more are themselves speculators
and manipulators. This is both a strength and weakness of the Turkish system,
and is not unusual with such nascent exchanges and emerging markets. &quot;Speculation
is a factor for increased liquidity,&quot; says Cezayirli. Both the ISE
and the capital markets board cooperate to stamp out speculation by continually
introducing new regulations but they are unlikely to have significant success
until the market gains more depth. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign institutional investors are active in Turkey, but there are no figures
on overall market share. &quot;This is not a market where very big money
can make big money,&quot; says Zeki Mertcan, Deha's chief market analyst.
According to Cenk Alpsoy, a broker at Global, foreign business accounts
for 16% of the company's trade volume. ING Baring's Cezayirli estimates
that between 15% and 25% of its portfolios are held by foreign institutions.
<BR>
<BR>
Because brokerage houses indulge in proprietary trading, it can be tricky
for foreign institutions to conduct business through them. &quot;Sometimes
when you give them a buy order, they make more money than you do,&quot;
says one foreign investor. This is because the knowledge of a buy or sell
order by a foreign institution, independent of all other factors, is often
sufficient to move the market. <BR>
<BR>
When choosing a broker, it is wise to ask the following questions, says
Cezayirli: &quot;Is the company strong enough capital-wise? Is it capable
of carrying out execution smoothly? Can it support business with proper
research? Does it engage in front-running?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
ING Baring's representative office in Istanbul, which opened in February
1995, focuses on research only. Business is conducted from Baring's London
office which, according to Cezayirli, is number one in handling non-Turkish
institutional investor business. <BR>
<BR>
The only foreign brokerage firm currently active in Turkey is operated by
Citibank and opened its doors early this year. Citibank, which also went
into retail banking this year, is the most active foreign bank in Turkey
and its entry into brokerage is bound to take away a lot of foreign business
from Turkish firms. Its broking strategy is to deal only with institutions
and stay completely out of proprietary trading. The company will also offer
IPO (initial public offering) services. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want to become a dominant player in this field,&quot; says Anjum
Iqbal, Citibank's country manager. &quot;We are selling reputation and service,
transparency and reliability. I expect our volume of business to grow rapidly.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Bayraktar returns to Kuzguncuk before nightfall and stops for a final cup
of tea with his friends. In three years, he has trebled his capital and
considers himself a lucky man. But he will not be commuting to Deha forever.
&quot;What I need is $1 million. When I make that I'll buy a small freighter
and I'll be off.&quot; He waves his hand as if saying farewell to Istanbul
forever. &quot;Sooner or later I will get there.&quot; <BR>

<HR>
<H3>An uphill struggle </H3>
<H4>Despite Turkey's early adoption of the privatization model, progress
has been slow. But the new prime minister Mesut Yilmaz, aims to change all
that </H4>
Turkey's privatization experience has been one of slow progress. In more
than a decade little has been achieved. <BR>
<BR>
But why has Turkey struggled with privatization? The state companies to
be sold (KITs) are one reason. KITs were (and are) are by and large poorly-managed,
overstaffed, highly-politicized and costly to sell. The 1996 budged stipulates
TL50,000 billion for KIT support. In all likelihood actual expenditure will
be double this. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization has also been hindered by lack of legislation; and by shabby
legislation. Numerous times the constitutional court has ruled various clauses
unconstitutional. The planned privatization of Turk Telekom was the latest
casualty. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994 disagreements between the two partners in the coalition delayed
passage of the necessary legislation until the end of that year. But little
was privatized even after the legal framework was put into place. Initially
20 privatizations were envisaged for 1995, which were forecast to raise
$5 billion. By the end of the year only $500 million was raised. And in
10 years Turkey has spent more to sell than it has raised: $3.1 billion
as opposed to $2.8 billion. <BR>
<BR>
One company which benefitted from the government's pre-privatization munificence
was Karabuk, a moth-eaten iron and steel plant. The government wanted to
close it. But under pressure from local politicians it pumped in some $200
million and eventually sold it to the employees and local big-wigs for one
kurus, one hundredth of a Turkish lira. Unsurprisingly, experts say that
Karabak is too inefficient to survive and when the state grant runs out
it will probably grind to a halt. <BR>
<BR>
The same fate nearly befell the Istanbul dockyards. The privatization administration
agreed to give the dockworkers' union a 49-year lease, provided half the
workers formed a company. But all hell broke loose when workers claimed
that the union bosses had retained most of the shares. The deal was dropped
and the docks remain unprivatized. <BR>
<BR>
The privatization of Cukurova<B> </B>Elektrik, one of the largest companies
listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, was also bungled. Cukurova became
private in 1992 when state-held shares were sold to the Istanbul-based Uzan
family. After privatization the Uzans took TL7.6 trillion out of the company
and distributed little or no profit to minority shareholders. In November
1995 the government seized the control of the company and turned it over
to directors appointed by the Turkish capital markets board. For a while
it looked as if the government would chastise the Uzans and others who trampled
on minority rights, but this was not to be. In January the politicians struck
a secret deal with the Uzans (there are claims that money changed hands)
and the family re-took possession of Cukurova. The capital markets board
was not consulted and none of the problems has been dealt with. <BR>
<BR>
But privatization is back on the agenda as the cornerstone of the new government's
structural adjustment efforts. Prime minister Mesut Yilmaz has announced
that priority will be given to legislation. Indeed the first piece of legislation
to be submitted to parliament after the recent 1996 budget was the Turk
Telekom privatization bill, appeasing the constitutional court by putting
the government in control of the privatization, rather than the capital
markets board. <BR>
<BR>
This bill will be the first test of the coalition's parliamentary power.
But it is far from certain that the bill will be passed or passed intact.
The coalition has no majority and relies on the goodwill of Bulent Ecevit's
nationalist left-wing Democratic Left Party (DSP). Ecevit feels that his
obligation towards the coalition came to an end when he abstained to allow
Yilmaz to win a vote of confidence. Henceforth, he said, he will judge each
piece of legislation on its merits. And privatization is not one of Ecevit's
preferred subjects. DSP is also home to one of the most virulent and efficient
foes of privatization: Mumtaz Soysal. Twice, Soysal led anti-privatization
deputies to successfully petition the constitutional court and is likely
to continue with his campaign. <BR>
<BR>
The foes of privatization are not only in the opposition. Many deputies
from both left and right are opposed to privatization because it will dismantle
of one of the world's most efficient sources of political patronage. There
is also tremendous resistance from the management of the KITs themselves
and the workers who stand to lose their jobs. In addition, frequent changes
at the highest echelons of the privatization administration continue to
hinder the buildup of expertise. <BR>
<BR>
But Yilmaz has signalled the seriousness of his intentions by appointing
the respected Rusdu Saracoglu as minister in charge of privatization. Saracoglu's
portfolio includes the state banks which, Yilmaz said, will all come up
for auction within six months. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from Turkish Telekom, the companies under offer include some of country's
most highly-valued companies like Erdemir (iron and steel), Petkim (petro
chemicals) Tupras (petroleum refining) and Poas (petroleum refining and
marketing). <HR>
<H3>Turkish debt begins to look attractive again </H3>
<H4>Despite the continued hangover from the 1994 financial crisis, the market
<BR>
for Turkish debt looks ready to recover, driven by quality, first-tier issuers.
<BR>
But, consequently, the number of borrowers is expected to fall </H4>
Turkish borrowing is still under the influence of the 1994 crisis when the
currency collapsed and three banks went bankrupt owing nearly $200 million
to foreign banks. The following year the country came in from the cold,
but the government collapsed in September, and confidence once more faltered.
In November, Standard &amp; Poor's revised Turkey's outlook from positive
to stable, voicing &quot;uncertainty about the course of economic policy&quot;.
Borrowing was reduced to a trickle and remained so until the new government
was formed last month. <BR>
<BR>
Anjum Iqbal, country manager of Citibank Turkey, says: &quot;They [the foreign
banks] have just been holding back. I can say that for now the banks are
again comfortable with Turkey.&quot; John McCarthy, general manager of ING
Barings Turkey agrees: &quot;The window is open again. There is an adequate
supply of credit. The market is gaining more depth. There is good discipline
and good activity.&quot; He believes that this is a reflection of the general
political and economic situation which is now seen to be good for debt issuance
by investors. <BR>
<BR>
The outlook for this year is that government issuance will remain more or
less the same as last year (about $1.3 billion) and that there will be no
lengthening of maturities. Maturities last year were invariably one year
or less. This year there may be some with a final maturity of two years,
but they will be subject to a put option that can be exercised by the lenders.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Longer tenors will depend on structural reforms,&quot; says Iqbal,
referring to privatization, reform of the social security and agricutural
support systems and improved fiscal performance. &quot;For the time being
a question mark hangs over them,&quot; McCarthy says. &quot;We will not
see a lengthening of maturities. The market's preference is to stay short
term.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The market, in any case, carefully distinguishes between first-tier and
second-tier banks. First-tier banks are the prime borrowers. These include
Garanti Bank which has emerged as the heaviest borrower since July last
year syndicating three loans totalling $460 million. Garanti's last deal,
for $110 million, was a self-arranged club loan with 11 participants from
Japan, the US, UK, and France, each of whom put up $10 million. The book
runner was the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan. <BR>
<BR>
And borrowing costs for first-tier issuers are falling. Garanti's all-in
cost declined from between 1% and 1.2% over Libor in July last year, to
0.8%, according to unofficial tallies. The all-in cost of Garanti's latest
borrowing is expected to be the benchmark for first-tier banks, which includes
Is Bank<B> </B>and Turkiye Ekonomi Bankasi (TEB). Akbank, owned by the Sabanci
family, is the only institution in Turkey, public or private, which can
borrow at margins close to Libor. Akbank is in a class of its own, being
a lender rather than a borrower. The bank is by far the most profitable
and liquid; &quot;money is coming out of their ears&quot;, is how one Japanese
banker puts it. <BR>
<BR>
Barring unforeseen political events, spreads for the first-tier banks are
likely to come down even further this year, as there is intense competition
among investors for such deals. For the second-tier banks - such as Demirbank
and Finansbank - the spread is likely to be between 1.50% and 1.75% over
Libor, according to international bankers. Observers believe that spreads
will continue their downward trend, but will remain high by western European
standards. &quot;This is the market's way of extracting a price for instability,&quot;
says Iqbal. <BR>
<BR>
Turk Sakura Bank's Levent Yurukoglu, senior marketing manager, says that
banks which are considered solid will have no problem borrowing. In his
opinion even the volume borrowed could increase. &quot;We will continue
to see the number of banks becoming borrowers shrinking,&quot; he says.
&quot;The situation which existed before 1993, when all banks could borrow
will not be repeated.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sibel Sanus, foreign relations manager of the newly-established Bank Kapital,
thinks that there will be an increase in borrowing volume this year. &quot;I
can feel a lot of appetite in banks,&quot; she says. &quot;Many banks which
have not seen Turkish profits on their balance sheets in the past two years
want to return to the market-place.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In March, following aggressive bidding by international banks, there were
five trade finance deals in the $30 million to $100 million range, mainly
with one-year maturities. The most active players were banks in the US,
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East. <BR>
<BR>
Private bank borrowing was slowed last year by a 6% tax imposed by the government
to cool overheating of the economy. It was lifted for export pre-financing,
but will probably remain in place for banks which wish to build up their
open positions. This will allow the treasury to separate real borrowers
from speculators. <BR>
<BR>
On the public-sector side, the treasury is engaged in its own battle to
return to pre-crisis rates and levels of borrowing. Since the foreign exchange
crisis, Turkey has successfully reduced its balance-of-payments pressures
and rebuilt its foreign exchange reserves to $24 billion as of last month.
&quot;We have an unwritten rule to borrow as much as the principal of the
debt we have to repay in any given year,&quot; says Aydin Karaoz, general
manager of the treasury's foreign relations department. <BR>
<BR>
Karaoz says that this year Turkey plans to raise about $2.5 billion through
Eurobond issues mainly in yen, Deutschmarks and US dollars. Foreign bankers
also expect the treasury to seek about $500 million in syndications, simply
to stay in the market. For the first time, says Karaoz,<B> </B>the treasury
is also planning to tap the pound, lire, Swiss franc, and Ecu markets -
&quot;provided the borrowing conditions are good&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
According to Karaoz the present aim of Turkey's foreign financing strategy
is to diversify the borrowing sources and instruments, enlarge the investor
base, borrow less than what is due in a particular year (to be a net repayer),
and define flexible, annual, external borrowing plans in line with prevailing
market conditions. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want to keep the appetite of the market alive,&quot; says Karaoz.
&quot;We also don't want to give the appearance of being too keen. Basically,
we don't want to raise our levels of debt stock.&quot; It is also becoming
more prudent to refinance, as he calculates that average spreads have come
down from Libor plus 3.5%, to between 2.5% and 2.6%. <BR>
<BR>
In February, the treasury did a Dm500 million Eurobond issue with a maturity
of five years. This month, &#165;50 billion of five-year bonds will be marketed
bearing a 5.5% coupon. This includes a spread of 2.8% over the average available
in the Tokyo market and is expected to be a major selling point, according
to Yurukoglu at Turk Sakura. <BR>
<BR>
Upgrading Turkey's long-term foreign currency rating (lowered to BBB- by
Standard &amp; Poor's in January 1994) is crucial for borrowing, particularly
in relation to the yankee bond market and smaller sovereign issuers. But
this is not likely to happen very quickly, as Karaoz<B> </B>admits: &quot;Upgrading
is never as fast as downgrading.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But the treasury is not happy with Turkey's grades and believes that these
take into account only conventional items while disregarding &quot;Turkey's
hidden strength&quot;- the half of the Turkish economy that is in the form
of $6 billion in unrecorded exports to ex-communist countries. It was thanks
to these &quot;hidden strengths&quot; that Turkey was able to recover with
miraculous speed from the 1994 crisis without the help of foreign creditors.
<BR>
<BR>
However, such unconventional elements of economic reality do not concern
the rating agencies. Standard &amp; Poor's, country manager for Turkey,
Cem Karacadag says that the mood is one of wait and see. &quot;The government
programme is full of the right things,&quot; he notes. &quot;But we cannot
act on promises. We need concrete evidence that the structural problems
are being addressed.&quot; <BR>

Turkey's coalition government as a way of financing public-sector projects.
While the schemes offer the government access to much-needed finance, they
may not offer the best solution for the tax-payer or the consumer. </H4>
After a barren 10 years, Turkey's build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes have,
in quick succession, yielded two large-scale deals for a hydroelectric power
plant and a drinking water supply system totalling more than $2.5 billion.
International syndications for both deals are oversubscribed. <BR>
<BR>
The deals - coinciding with a period when the domestic political outlook
is forcing the Turkish treasury to retreat yet again from the international
borrowing markets - have underlined the high value of BOT projects to international
banks, suppliers and contractors. They have arrived at a time when Turkey
could, feasibly, become one of the world's richest markets for large infrastucture
projects such as electric power stations. <BR>
<BR>
Enver Guney<B>,</B> head of the treasury's foreign investment department
expects BOT to become the country's principal source of foreign investment.
And, in London, a member of the Chase Investment Bank BOT team, Becky Lancashire,
says: &quot;The Turkish government is keen to complete these projects because
they know they will open the floodgates to other schemes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
According to Aydin Karaoz, head of the treasury's foreign relations department,
there are about 30 projects, one-third of which are now close to completion.
The schemes - special financing models for infrastructure projects requiring
advanced technology and high capital investment - have been developed within
the private sector, but with treasury guarantees to secure the financing.
The government guarantees to buy BOT services and products at a certain
price over a certain period - which, under present legislation, is a maximum
of 49 years. <BR>
<BR>
The BOT model can be used to finance most infrastructure projects - bridges,
tunnels, motorways, airports - but is particularly welcome in the energy
sector where large investments are required to maintain the electricity
supply. <BR>
<BR>
The first deal, signed last November, is for a 672-megawatt hydroelectric
power plant and dam located at Birecik on the Euphrates river. Financed
to the tune of about Dm2.3 billion, it is the largest-ever single finance
package arranged for a project in Turkey, and has set a market precedent
for the country. <BR>
<BR>
The second deal, signed in December, with financing of about $942 million,
is for completion of a drinking water dam at Yuvacik and other water supply
projects on the outskirts of Izmit. <BR>
<BR>
Both of these deals have involved Chase Investment Bank of London, which
worked as financial adviser and arranged the syndication, and Gama, a large
Turkish contractor. <BR>
<BR>
The Birecik project, conceived 10 years ago, is financed with Dm1.9 billion
of senior debt, Dm300 million of equity and Dm100 million of start-up revenues.
The senior debt includes Export Credit Agency (ECA) tranches guaranteed
by Hermes of Germany, Ducroire of Belgium, OKB of Austria and COFACE of
France, and a commercial tranche of entirely Turkish debt. The debt has
been syndicated in a package of ECA and commercial Turkish debt at a ratio
of 3:1 - which made the deals attractive to commercial banks because of
the diversification of the Turkish risk. <BR>
<BR>
John McCarthy, general manager of of ING Barings Turkey, says: &quot;The
Turkish risk is not so big, particularly if you spread it among a syndicate
of 20 or more banks. And the return on the overall asset, blending in the
export credit, is very attractive. The reward is very good and the risk
is ameliorated by the export credit side.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Apart from Gama, project sponsors include Philipp Holzmann of Germany, members
of the Alcatel group in France and Belgium, Strabag of Austria, and Sulzer
Hydro of Germany. <BR>
<BR>
For the Yuvacik project, planned six years ago, the $942 million deal is
made up of about $803 million of senior debt and $139 million of equity.
The senior debt includes ECA tranches guaranteed by ECGD of the UK, COFACE
of France, MITI of Japan, with additional financing from Japan Eximbank,
and a commercial loan tranche of $167 million in Turkish risk. The ratio
of ECA to commercial Turkish debt in the Yuvacik project is 2.8:2. Project
sponsors include Thames Water of the UK, Guris<B> </B>of Turkey, the pipe
subcontractor Kl&ouml;ckner of Germany and INI of France. Mitsui and Sumitomo
and the municipality of Izmit will be equity investors in the project company.
<BR>
<BR>
Chase, and an army of lawyers, have been involved in creating a legal framework
to guide investment by foreign banks and companies. &quot;These are immensely
complicated projects,&quot; says Chase Investment's Lancashire. &quot;There
are 54 separate documents in Birecik alone. It took nine years to negotiate.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
With each BOT scheme, companies selected by the government to undertake
a project are responsible for the construction, commissioning, operation
and maintenance of the plant during the &quot;authorized period&quot; -
which, in the case of Birecik and Yuvacik is 15 years from the end of the
construction period. The treasury guarantees that the agreed amount of production
will be bought at an agreed price on a buy-or-pay basis. In the case of
default, the treasury repays the debt. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a rule of thumb, 50:50 is a good estimate of the way the spread
and other costs are divided,&quot; says one banker. &quot;Put another way,
interest and other yields are double the amounts listed in the official
documents. Since the project is profitable, the contractor is quite happy
to give some of the profit to the bankers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another banker says: &quot;These deals happen because the contractors are
prepared to gross up the yield on the commercial proportion to the amount
required by the banks. The contractors and suppliers build this into their
margin - and the deal gets done.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some bankers say that although the cost of a BOT structure is arguably high,
there are benefits all round.&quot;This is a win/win situation,&quot; says
one. &quot;The Turkish public sector is broke, so BOT is a way of making
a public-sector investment with private sector money. The public sector
likes the deal because it is the only way it can raise money at the moment.
The private sector likes the deal because the return on its investment is
excellent.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If there is any criticism it is likely to come from the public - when details
of the deals emerge. So far, it seems, virtually no information on Birecik
and Yuvacik about interest payments, payback periods and unit sale prices
of electricity and water, has been made public. Negotiations have been conducted
in secret; the Yuvacik deal was signed quietly in London a few days before
Christmas. There were no press releases and the treasury refused to comment.
All this, say critics, is presumably because had the details come to light,
there could have been a public outcry and possibly the end of the the agreement.
<BR>
<BR>
The Yuvacik dam project accounts for the second biggest loan in the republic's
history after Birecik. And there is some evidence to support the claim of
undue costliness. The dam was tendered to Gama for the equivalent of $15
million in 1987. Construction stopped because of lack of funds but only
after almost half of the work on the dam had been completed according to
the state Water Authority DSI. Under the new agreement, funds allocated
to the dam have risen $60 million which, some contractors say, &quot;is
an astronomic amount for a dam that is half completed&quot;. Gama maintains
the price is not inflated. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the first proposal for Birecik by Gama and its partners, in June
1987, called for a total investment cost of Dm1,310 million, including interest
during construction and excluding price escalation (to be based on German
inflation indices). During this time Ata, another large Turkish construction
firm, also made a bid for Birecik. Ata's bid, which was substantially lower
than Gama's, was found to be too costly and the company was asked to revise
it. Ata complied, but for reasons which are unclear, the ministry of energy
decided to reject Ata's bids and - undoubtedly with encouragement from the
late president Turgut Ozal - proceed with Gama. <BR>
<BR>
Yuksel Onaran, general manager of the Birecik consortium, attributes the
increase in the cost of financing from Dm1.3 billion to Dm2.3 billion to
the &quot;changes in the technical, legal and financial aspects (of the
project) that have taken place over the past eight years&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Informed sources in Ankara say there was strong political pressure from
former prime minister, Tansu Ciller, and her husband (who acted as her informal
adviser) to get the agreements signed before the general election on December
24. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The bureaucracy is not happy about these deals,&quot; says one ex-director
of the treasury. &quot;Prices have been dictated by the banks and the firms
- who rushed to the prime minister and other ministers as soon as anything
got stuck. Things have been resolved behind close doors and under tables
while everything should have been transparent.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But prime minister Mesut Yilmaz is keen to continue supporting BOT schemes.
He recently announced top priority for BOT financing. And, a new legal framework
will be drawn up to replace the one which was partly annulled by the constitutional
court last year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As the model becomes standardized the number of projects will increase
tremendously in the near future,&quot; says Aydin Karaoz, general director
of the treasury's foreign relations department. Of the 30 projects currently
in various stages of completion, most are in the energy sector. And 15 of
these, with total investment of $8.3 billion, have already applied to the
treasury for guaranteees. <HR>
<H4>Yilmaz on BOT </H4>
In a recent interview with <I>Euromoney,</I> prime minister Mesut Yilmaz
described his expectations of the BOT scheme:&quot;We want to make maximum
use of the BOT model in Turkey's development. I want all sectors to benefit
from this model, but particular encouragement will be given to joint investments
by Turkish and foreign capital in energy, transport and telecommunications.
We have more than 100 proposals, and I have given instructions that each
be examined individually. The coordination council has already started working
on these proposals. Those which are approved will be put into implementation
right away.&quot; <BR>

<H2>Those hidden extras </H2>
<H4>Even experienced business travellers can occasionally find themselves
targeted by gangs of local fraudsters</H4>

At the end of a long day, a foreign businessman slips out of his hotel for
a meal. As he leaves, a smartly dressed man asks for a light. He introduces
himself as the hotel manager. Where is his guest going? For a drink, a meal?
As chance would have it, the manager is also looking for a quick drink.
<BR>
<BR>
Charmed by his new friend, the visitor accompanies him up a back street.
They duck into a nightclub. Although the place seems faintly sleazy, the
hotel manager is clearly well-known. All smiles, the waiters usher the pair
to a booth and a bottle of red wine appears. At the same time two very attractive
women slip alongside. <BR>
<BR>
The stilted conversation continues, punctuated by frequent requests for
more champagne. Eventually, fatigue overcomes the visitor and he excuses
himself. His host smiles graciously. As the bill appears, the host suddenly
leans forward: we split 50-50? Well, two glasses of cheap wine and three
bottles of lemonade cannot be too expensive. TL68 million, says the manager:
TL34 million each. The visitor struggles with conversion rates, trying to
work out the cost in dollars. At TL48,000 to the $1, the bill is $680. Surely
not! <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly the truth dawns - no one pays $700 for a couple of glasses
of wine and 20 minutes conversation with a prostitute. Suddenly he realises
he is the victim of a sting operation. He has been taken. Now he is alone
in a nightclub with five large men barring the exit. <BR>
<BR>
There are many ways of robbing visitors. Unsophisticated methods include
picking pockets, mugging or snatching luggage. The problem for the thief
is that experienced travellers are instinctively aware of dangerous situations.
Much better is to turn to the confidence trick and the sleight of hand.
<BR>
<BR>
In the situation just described the location is Istanbul but the trick is
one of the oldest in the book, common across the world. Operators play on
the fear and ignorance of visitors abroad: if the victim protests at the
bill, they offer violence. Surrounded by angry men shouting in another language,
this is normally enough. But if such tactics fail, there is always the threat
of the police: time-consuming arrest, questioning and eventually a court
case. And of course there is the tricky business of explaining the prostitutes
to his wife. <BR>
<BR>
In this real case the visitor was lucky: he managed to bluster his way out
for just $100. Others are less fortunate, however. A business traveller
in India who was charmed into buying a drink for a stranger woke up two
days later in a cheap dockside hotel. Needless to say, his wallet, credit
cards and watch had vanished, along with his clothes. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Don't drink the water </B><BR>
<BR>
Three years ago a similar trick was played on two Italian businessmen in
the Czech Republic. They were lured into drinking the local brew by prostitutes
in Karlovy Vary. The drink was spiked and once unconscious, the pair were
stripped, robbed and dumped in the street: unfortunately the criminals miscalculated
and one victim died from an overdose of the drugged drink. <BR>
<BR>
The threat of official involvement can be one of the most effective weapons
in the trickster's armoury. In Kenya, for example, with its notoriously
corrupt police, bandits deliberately ram hire cars and demand money not
to report the incident. The foreigner pays up, fearing investigators will
demand an even higher fee to keep them out of jail. <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, a development worker in Tanzania reports being tricked by sleight
of hand and a uniform. Needing to change money, she met a black-marketeer
who offered double the official rate. She was careful and held on to the
cash, but just as they swapped bills, a policeman arrived. A split second
later, her $100 was returned and the dealer disappeared. Forced to answer
some awkward questions, it was some time before she realised that her bill
had been swapped for a forgery. Needless to say the policeman was a fake
too; his timing had been just too good to be accidental. <BR>
<BR>
Of course these are the more extreme forms of traveller exploitation. Across
much of the world it is the petty rip-offs which mar the enjoyment of doing
business. Taxis are a perennial problem; the business is notorious for attracting
the criminal classes. Although the amounts involved are relatively small,
the frequency with which the traveller is forced to pay well above the odds
can add significantly to business expenses. <BR>
<BR>
In east-central Europe, for instance, locals recognise two types of taxi
- legitimate and mafia - although that term name is so commonly
and casually misused that the real <I>cosa nostra</I> will soon be following
French champagne makers to the courts to protect their trademark. In Warsaw,
for example, the taxi ranks outside most big hotels and office buildings
are run by crooks who charge three times the normal rate. Usually, however,
there is an alternative rank around the corner where passengers are charged
the real price. <BR>
<BR>
The same rule applies to Sofia, but here the picture is further clouded
by the rampant inflation which struck after the collapse of communism.
As a result, the meter (calibrated in the old currency) bears no clear relationship
to the fare. Instead the driver uses a calculator to produce the final
tally. The arithmetic used depends on the time of day and the driver's honesty.
<BR>
<BR>
In Prague meters display a number from one to four which corresponds to
the rate for daytime, night-time, city or suburb. Knowing most foreigners
have no idea what this means, dishonest taxis have their dial set perpetually
at the most expensive level. Others have taken the term highway robbery
to its logical extreme and held up disgruntled customer at gunpoint if he
has the nerve to question the grossly inflated fare. <BR>
<BR>
The problem for the traveller is how to tackle such exploitation. Remonstrating
has its dangers and prevention is better than cure according to locals.
Never hail a taxi in the street, is the advice of the Nick Thorpe, the BBC's
Hungary correspondent. There are reputable firms you can ring and any
decent guide or receptionist will know such telephone numbers. <BR>
<BR>
Such wise words prove useless at many airports, however, where criminals
prey on tired and uncertain travellers laden with baggage and a strange
currency. Drivers realise most visitors have no idea of the distance between
airport and hotel, still less of the correct fare. One solution is to request
a hotel car or take the bus, but there can be problems. For example, St
Petersburg mafia taxi drivers are so violent that the airport has no
bus service and honest cabbies dare not make pick-ups. Instead visitors
find themselves with the unenviable choice of paying $50 or walking.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>It may only appear an irritant </B><BR>
<BR>
This catalogue of petty crime might appear little more than an irritant.
After all, the victim usually adds it to the expense account or puts it
down to experience. As a result, the authorities ignore the problem, particularly
when the victims are foreigners. While it is common to crack down on muggers,
a blind eye is turned dodgy drivers or the bar with two pricelists. <BR>
<BR>
Such an approach is shortsighted. Countries which become notorious for preying
on visitors find their reputation for business honesty tarred with
the same brush. That was the view of the Prague taxi driver who remonstrated
with a colleague for treating a tourist badly, saying he would ruin it for
everyone. It proved ill-judged - he was kicked to death. The incident
might yet have a silver lining, however. A few days after the incident,
the city's honest drivers took to the streets to demand action against the
taxi mafia. This could be the first step to tackling a serious
problem. After all, everyone's judgement, from backpacker to executive,
is moulded by experience. Just one extortionate fare could form a lifetime
of prejudice against a whole nation. <p>

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<H2>It depends what you mean by privatization </H2>
<B>by David Roche</B> <BR>
<BR>
Privatization has been one of the strongest oars rowing the boat of global
economic liberalization. <BR>
<BR>
In the last two years alone, the privatization sale of assets reached $53
billion in Europe, over $5 billion in the Americas and nearly $9 billion
in Asia. In eastern Europe privatization helped push the transition from
communism to capitalism. As output from the non-state sector soared to 55%
of GDP, assets with an estimated economic value of $200 billion were returned
to the people. <BR>
<BR>
Worldwide, in most countries where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) had played
a significant role, selling them off added between 0.5% and 3% to equity
market capitalization, on average amounting to 0.7% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
In restructuring and emerging economies such as Hungary, Indonesia and Poland,
as well as in developed European countries such as Denmark, France and Italy,
where the state had been a big producer, the ratios were even higher. But
these figures don't convey the real economic significance of privatization.
That lies in its role as a catalyst for greater economic efficiency. And,
as I'll argue, it is greater economic efficiency that is the long-term argument
for creating investor wealth too. <BR>
<BR>
But to understand that, first let's analyze the economic role of SOEs before
privatization. Anybody who has visited a supermarket, a post office and
a railway station must draw one conclusion: bureaucrats and politicians
are not cut out to run corporations, while supermarket managers are. The
more of an economy the state owns, the less productive that economy will
be. Transferring ownership to the private sector of most of the things you
and I can invest in can only be a good thing if done properly. <BR>
<BR>
Two things stand out. The first is that the regions of the world where SOEs
are biggest in terms of their share of total output are those with the poorest
track record of economic success. In Africa, SOEs account for 18% of output
compared with 5% in industrialized countries. In low-income developing countries,
the ratio is 13% and in Asia (including non-Tiger economies like India and
Pakistan) it's 10%. Low growth and big state ownership tend to go together.
<BR>
<BR>
The second message is that SOEs don't only have an impact on the markets
they supply, where they are undoubtedly poor performers, but also on the
markets which supply them. In Africa, for example, SOEs account for 28%
of all capital formation and use 17% of the total credit available in the
economy to do it. They also employ 16% of the labour force. In middle-income
developing economies, which include the Asian Tigers, SOEs still play an
important investment role, accounting for 21% of total investment. But they
use only 10% of national credit and 3% of the labour force to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Economic distortions</B> <BR>
<BR>
In China, SOEs are even more dominant in their use of national savings and
labour, respectively 60% and 70%. Worse, we estimate that the SOEs' marginal
output is less than half that of foreign direct investment and the TVEs
(profit motive-based township and village enterprises). In other words,
as China wastes its own resources, it is overly dependent on those of others
to maintain growth. And the distortions that SOEs cause are at the epicentre
of the country's structural economic problems, jerky economic cycles and
growing regional wealth differentials. It is this too more than anything
else that is responsible for the awful returns investors have made on their
China B and H shares. China would do much better to privatize its SOEs and
increase the efficiency with which it uses domestic labour and capital.
<BR>
<BR>
The interesting point here is that despite all this there is a role for
SOEs to play in successfully emerging economies. The proportion of investment
and output they represent in many east Asian Tigers is twice that of rich
industrialized countries. But the efficiency of east Asian SOEs sets them
apart from those in industrialized countries and in less-successful developing
countries. SOEs in low-income countries, particularly in Africa, use proportionately
much more of the national savings rate and available labour to do the job
of economic development. In the main, the rule still holds that as economies
get richer, SOEs should be privatized if economic growth is to be maintained.
<BR>
<BR>
Privatization is a means to gain economic productivity, but it is not a
palliative. Above all, it doesn't work in isolation. Five conditions have
to be fulfilled. On a micro-scale, the enterprise has to be sold off, and
management control and ownership have to be firmly rooted in the private
sector. Privatization works best if it is carried out in a competitive environment
so that the SOE has to cope with liberalized markets - where barriers to
entry are minimized - for its products. State subsidies and policy loans
should be eliminated. SOE monopoly prices have to be regulated with a clear
pricing formula that keeps pressure on management to improve efficiency.
<BR>
<BR>
The markets that surround SOEs on the output and input sides must be liberalized
at the same time. That means deregulating banks so that the SOE has to compete
for capital at market prices. It means freeing up labour so that SOEs compete
for talent and no longer provide jobs for the boys. The same goes for markets
- no more cushy contracts with the government and, yes please, lots of competition
from imports and new domestic entrants to the marketplace where possible.
<BR>
<BR>
If privatization is to produce the economic benefits synonymous with creating
investor wealth in the long term, it's no easy option. I believe that the
motivation that drives governments to privatize tells us if the conditions
for success will be met. <BR>
<BR>
So, let's look at the state's motives for privatizing. There are three types.
<BR>
<BR>
The first type is that of the former communist countries. They want to return
what was stolen from the people to the people. In doing so, they hit a number
of goals. One is to create a property-owning middle class (real estate is
privatized too). That rolls back communism forever, though not ex-communist
parties when it comes to politics. In microeconomic and macroeconomic terms,
the benefits are to increase the efficiency of corporate management and
thus raise the productive potential of the economy. <BR>
<BR>
The second type is exemplified by Margaret Thatcher's UK. As in eastern
Europe, Mrs Thatcher wanted to change irreversibly the <I>political </I>system<I>
</I>as much as the economic system. Hers was a moral vision. Privatization
was, as in eastern Europe, a step towards greater social equity. It was
a part of the process of &quot;responsibilizing&quot; the individual, be
he or she a manager of a (previously) state-owned enterprise or the buyer
of a council flat. None of this was disinterested - outside the tales of
the martyrs, few great historical acts are. It worked nicely in favour of
her own and her party's fortune by shifting the UK political spectrum to
the right. <BR>
<BR>
The third type of privatization is that of what I call the Southern Comfort
Countries (SCC). These are the highly indebted European states. They share
few of the Thatcherite tenets of economic liberalization. They have a simpler
motive: they are bankrupt. Privatization is a means of grappling with the
problem of empty state coffers, no more and no less. When the SCCs privatize,
they are doing something close to what Harold Macmillan thought Mrs Thatcher
was doing, namely selling off the &quot;family silver&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
And there are privatizations that fall somewhere between the moral vision
of the UK or eastern Europe and the opportunistic motives of SCCs. Latin
America went for privatization because it went bust. But because it went
bust it wished to change its economic model. In Argentina and Chile, privatization
was part and parcel of a profound commitment to market liberalization on
a broad front. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Market liberalization</B> <BR>
<BR>
The closer a country is to the &quot;moral&quot; vision of eastern Europe
or Thatcherite Britain, the more likely it is that the five major conditions
for successful privatization will be satisfied. Argentina, Chile and the
UK all created the market conditions for privatizations to work because
they were matched by a firm commitment to enact broader measures to liberalize
markets and the economy. <BR>
<BR>
In eastern Europe this is true too. But the process has not been good to
shareholders for two reasons: the financial markets and local participants
are unseasoned and the process of mass privatization has impeded the concentrated
share ownership that would force proper management of companies. This is
particularly important given the need to restructure them. In my view, this
is about to change in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia. So
I would invest selectively there. <BR>
<BR>
In the SCCs, the deep commitment to market liberalization upon which successful
privatization depends is simply lacking. It is far more likely in these
markets than elsewhere that the investor will be screwed by the powerful
combination of state interest and mendacious investment banks. <BR>
<BR>
Much of continental Europe is close to this model. So too, alas, is much
of Asia, where one mentality applies when it comes to the economy and another
when it comes to selling state assets and then letting them operate as private-sector
corporations. <BR>
<BR>
The performance of privatized shares bears this out. UK privatizations have
outperformed those of Italy and France. The reason, I believe, is clear.
UK privatization was part of a broad thrust of economic liberalization,
continental Europe's was not. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, many investors are cynical about the notion that what's good
for the economy is good for the investor. They believe that buying into
a privatized utility that preserves its natural monopoly and has no price
formula may make them more money than buying into a privatized company which
is being opened up to competition. The former corporation, so they argue,
will continue to earn monopoly profits. This is true - particularly if the
utility is priced cheaply at the outset. But it's a dangerous game to follow
this investment instinct and not one that I recommend. <BR>
<BR>
Rather, I strongly believe that over the longer haul truly competitive and
dynamic corporations do better for investors than monopolists. There are
several reasons for this. A monopolist is normally inefficient and may just
turn excess prices into excess costs and kickbacks rather than shareholder
returns. I'd prefer to own something that earns an honest and competitive
return on capital. <BR>
<BR>
Also, a privatized corporation with which the state maintains a close and
influential relationship will be asked to &quot;pay&quot; for any benefits
it gets. Furthermore, in an economy that is globalizing everything from
electricity to telecoms equipment, the cosseted privatized producer will
lag in terms of technology and efficiency. Eventually markets will be prised
open and profitability will collapse. So the conditions that make privatization
an economic success are the same as those that make them successful investments.

<H3>COUNTRY RISK: THREE YEARS OF GROWTH </H3>
<H2>The past three years </H2>
<H4><I>Euromoney </I>took a good look at the past three years' country risk
<BR>
rankings to see how the world has changed. Lebanon is <BR>
the most improved country and transition Europe is rising fast. <BR>
Charles Piggott and Felix Salmon report </H4>
The world is doing well. <I>Euromoney</I>'s rankings show that the risk
score of the average country has climbed rapidily: from 43.56 in March 1993
to 50.72 in March 1996. Of all our subdivisions, only North America (which
excludes Mexico) has gone down. <BR>
<BR>
The big winner is transition Europe &shyp; its average has jumped from 25.27
to 41.48 in the past three years. Much of this can be put down to increased
reporting to the IMF and World Bank, but the developing world also looks
like it's having an extremely good run. <BR>
<BR>
As the charts on page 116 show, there is a close correlation between <I>Euromoney</I>'s
ratings and capital flows. The IMF recently concluded that &quot;country
credit ratings... have influenced both the flow of capital to developing
countries and the risk premiums associated with the flows&quot;. As private
lending and investment to developing countries increase, country creditworthiness
will play a larger part in determining capital flows. The IMF paper, published
in January 1996, goes as far as suggesting that developing countries adopt
policies that help to restore their credit ratings as part of their economic
stabilization programmes. <BR>
<BR>
The best improvements in Euromoney's country risk rankings in the past three
years have been in central and eastern Europe, which account for 12 of the
top 20 climbers. The big name here is Russia. In March 1993 Russia ranked
at 149, with a score of 18.13 &shyp; below Uganda, Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Libya. In March 1996 Russia ranked at 100, with a score of 40.60. Although
it still ranks below Burkina Faso, Russia is obviously moving towards becoming
a major economic player. <BR>
<BR>
The other large country in the top 20 climbers is India. Its gain of 19
points and 10 places in three years puts it just five places behind China,
which gained 10 points and two places. <BR>
<BR>
Lebanon is the most improved country in the past three years. It gained
63 places and 29 points. Vietnam and Estonia follow closely behind. Other
high performers are Sudan and Uganda, giving the lie to those who dismiss
sub-Saharan Africa. The region as a whole averages an improvement of 6.12
points, just one point behind the world average. <BR>
<BR>
The big surprise is the resilience of Latin America, which seems barely
tainted by 1994's peso crisis. There was something of a correction in 1995,
but overall the region is second only to eastern Europe. The outstanding
performer is Peru, which jumps 25 points and 49 places over the three years.
By far Latin America's strongest economy is Chile, ranked 29 overall in
March 1996 &shyp; ahead of Greece, United Arab Emirates and Israel. <BR>
<BR>
Where there are winners, there have to be losers. Western Europe struggles
to stand still. Without Luxembourg's rise to the top from 11th place, and
Portugal's gain of 3.5 points, Western Europe would not have risen at all
over three years. Japan falls from the top to rank at four, having ranked
as low as at six in September 1995. The USA drops from second to fifth place.
France drops from fourth to tenth, and Saudi Arabia loses six points and
11 places. Canada's rating falls from 97.77 to 91.54, taking it from nine
to 15. This is the ninth-largest fall in the world. Even Rwanda did better.

<H2><CENTER>Methodology </CENTER>
</H2>
The <I>Euromoney</I> country risk methodology uses nine indicators: <BR>
<BR>
<B>* Economic performance</B> and <B>political risk</B> are based on a poll
of economists and political analysts. <BR>
<B>* Debt indicators</B>, <B>debt in default or rescheduled</B> and <B>access
to bank finance</B> are based on figures taken from the World Bank's Debt
Tables. <BR>
<B>*</B> <B>Access to short-term finance</B> is based on OECD consensus
groups and coverage from US Exim Bank and NCM UK. <BR>
<B>* Access to international bond and syndicated loan markets</B> is scored
by Euromoney. <BR>
<B>* Access to discount on forfaiting</B> is calculated from market data.
<BR>
<B>* Credit ratings</B> are based on ratings given by S&amp;P, Moody's and
Ibca. <BR>
<BR>
For <I>Euromoney</I>'s full country risk methodology see the March 1996
issue (page 165). Please note the following corrections. In the explanation
of Debt indicators it states &quot;that the lower the score the better&quot;.
Here the &quot;score&quot; refers to the underlying data: countries with
the lowest score gain the highest rating out of 10. Also, in the Debt in
default category it states that &quot;Zero equals no non-payments: 10, all
in default or rescheduled&quot;. This is incorrect. A score of ten indicates
no non-payments: 0, all in default or rescheduled. <BR>
<BR>
Please note that the scores used in charts showing political risk and economic
performance are not weighted. They show underlying data used in <I>Euromoney</I>'s
twice yearly country risk surveys. <BR>

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<p>
<H2>The real winner in Europe: the UK </H2>
<B>by David Roche</B> <BR>
<BR>
<font size=3>
The beacon of European integration can never be turned off by a nation with
Germany's history, as Herr Kohl has made clear in recent comments. But there
is a dimmer switch - delaying the start of European economic and monetary
union (Emu). Once that happens, the whole thing will unravel, and markets
will return to looking at each country's individual economic merits. <BR>
<BR>
Which brings me to the UK. There are two judgements central to portfolio
investment in the UK. The first is whether UK financial assets benefit more
from Britain being inside or outside the Emu system. The second is whether
future UK economic policy will break from the mediocrity of the past and
provide a disinflationary platform for gilts and strong corporate profits.
<BR>
<BR>
At present, European countries are judged by financial markets largely on
the assumption that the third stage of Emu will happen, and whether or not
a particular country is included. Ironically, the UK is one of only three
countries<I> </I>likely to meet the Maastricht criteria for monetary union
by the cut-off date of 1997. But markets assume that the UK will invoke
its Emu opt-out, just as it has done with the social chapter. So it will
be left out in the European cold to fend for itself against a strengthening
family of continental European states, and so will be forced to devalue
sterling to compete. <BR>
<BR>
<B>B</B>ut a postponed Emu could sing a different tune. Then markets will
start to judge the UK economy on its own merits, rather than on the risk
of its being left out of the single-currency project. And markets will realize
that the current risk premium built into the price of gilts and sterling
is excessive. <BR>
<BR>
Also, I think that the power of the markets to curb irresponsible and politically
expedient policy means that the ugly days of boom and bust in the UK are
over. While the rest of Europe remains caught in a straitjacket of deficit
reduction, rising joblessness and growing social tension, the UK is quietly
turning its old reputation on its head. Unlike the UK, <I>dirigiste</I>
France does not enjoy a supply-side, liberalized economy. <BR>
<BR>
So when Emu is postponed, and France opts for growth and jobs by devaluing
the franc, that will feed directly into French inflation and at least double
the risk premium on French bonds. <BR>
<BR>
By contrast, I think UK gilts are one of the few cheap bond markets in Europe,
and yield spreads over German Bunds should narrow from 150 basis points
(bp) today to between 70bp and 80bp. And if I am right about faster growth
in Germany than the consensus expects and a reversal of the easing of interest
rates by the Bundesbank, that would hit countries with high debt, as their
servicing costs grow in line with rapidly rising interest rates. The UK,
with forecast public debt below 55% of GDP in 1997, would look relatively
good. The markets are still worried that increased UK growth could eventually
feed into rising domestic inflation. But in the disinflationary environment
of the 1990s, it's very hard to pass on cost increases to the con-sumer.
And UK wages remain under control, with average earnings growing in line
with prices, while the speculative housing market is still subdued. Moreover,
the Conservative government appears to have resisted the temptation to go
for unfinanced tax cuts that could mess up plans to cut the budget deficit.
The 1996 budget errs, if anything, on the side of caution. And even with
a change of government, I don't believe that &quot;New&quot; Labour would
be fiscally irresponsible under the discipline of global markets. So a &quot;cut-and-run&quot;
policy is what I expect to see only on the other side of the Channel<I>.
</I><BR>
<BR>
There are longer-term reasons for looking favourably on the UK. These are
based on the growing shift towards corporate globalization of trade and
investment - a theme I shall return to in future pieces in this column.
In the last 20 years, US corporates have migrated to big new markets and
cheap labour areas, away from a relatively expensive domestic production
base. Where the US leads, it seems, the UK follows. In 1993, the UK's stock
of outward foreign direct investment was equivalent to 24% of GDP. That's
more than twice the level in the US, Germany or Japan. This shift toward
corporate globalization means that the UK equity market reflects more than
just the domestic economy. It makes UK companies inherently attractive as
global investments. And they're cheap. <BR>
<BR>
<B>O</B>f course, the process of de-industrialization in the domestic economy
means a lot of pain for the victims of rationalization. But the UK and the
US have already completed this process. They no longer qualify as industrialized
economies, as their domestic manufacturing sectors contribute less than
20% of GDP. Their service sectors predominate. In the UK, services are now
almost as important an influence on overall employment as in America. The
pain of de-industrialization has still to come in those countries, while
the UK has had its catharsis. <BR>
<BR>
However, what's good for the Anglo-Saxon corporate sector ain't necessarily
so for the national accounts. UK corporate globalization and the rising
share of GDP from services (traded far less than manufactures) will make
it difficult for the UK to maintain a balanced current account and thus
a strong currency. But because so much of UK corporate activity is glo-bal,
currency fluctuations need not affect corporate competitiveness - or under-
lying profit forecasts - too much. <BR>
<BR>
<B>L</B>onger-term, achieving stable sterling will need a higher domestic
savings rate. To get the savings rate higher, government must do its bit.
But, as long as the UK government keeps chiselling away at its budget deficit
over the next four to five years, the savings rate will probably rise, as
I don't expect households or corporations to save less. <BR>
<BR>
An efficient corporate sector has other benefits. As chancellor of the exchequer
Kenneth Clarke has argued, when you invest in UK business you are now investing
in a leaner machine than ever before. In gross terms, (dollar-denominated)
manufacturing labour costs in the UK are 21% below those in the US, 44%
below those in Japan, and half of those in Germany. Yet technology is on
a par. <BR>
<BR>
The UK's opt-out from the European social chapter keeps UK labour costs
low; a situation that adoption of Europe's minimum wage legislation would
undermine. So for strategic overseas investors wanting a toehold in Europe,
the UK fits the ticket. <BR>
<BR>
Staying remote from a broad-based, fully integrated Europe would have been
damaging to UK financial markets. But staying outside a Europe that maintains
a social state it can no longer afford, some say, is no bad thing. With
a postponed Emu, the risk premium on UK financial assets, based on being
outside Emu, will disappear, and gilts and sterling will fly. <BR>

<H2>No summer let-up yet</H2>
<BR>
The largest ever non-government bond and a flood of dollar-denominated bonds
made this a week to remember for most syndicate desks.<BR>
<BR>
Although few expect a repetition of this week's frenetic activity, business
looks set to remain brisk until the summer lull finally arrives. <BR>
<BR>
Lead managed by Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley,
the Ffr40bn Cyber-Val securitisation grabbed centre stage. <BR>
<BR>
A combination of high credit quality, low risk-weighting and flexible pricing
ensured that the issue was oversubscribed, despite its size. The issue was
two times larger than the previous record holder.<BR>
<BR>
Quantity, not size, was the hallmark of most of the deals in the dollar
sector where a flood of new issues was sustained by a continuing flow of
redemption-linked money as well as the emergence of spread players, alerted
by the tightening seen in previous transactions.<BR>
<BR>
Issues from Toyota, Swiss Bank Corporation and Exim-Bank of Japan stood
out, although IBM's return to the market after a four-year absence was less
successful.<BR>
<BR>
The long-awaited DM250 five-year deal from Poland received a highly enthusiastic
reception from investors starved of sovereign risk from the central and
eastern European region.<BR>
Next to brave the market looks to be an as-yet-unnamed Czech brewer.<BR>
<BR>
Cades kicked off its foreign currency bond programme with a successful Dfl
3bn issue via ABN AMRO, the largest ever bond in the sector. The guilder
sector also saw its first securitisation with a Dfl 500m UBS-led mortgage-backed
bond for the Fortis group.<BR>
<BR>
Activity was also brisk in France. Despite the arrival of the Ffr40bn Cyber-Val
issue, Spain launched a tightly priced Ffr6bn 10-year deal via SocGen which
may take some weeks to sell.<BR>
Next in line could be the Province of Quebec, which toured European investment
centres this week and may decide today (Friday) on whether to launch a Ffr2bn
10-year offering.  <BR>
<BR>
But next week looks set to be dominated by continuing flow from the dollar
sector. One deal set to join the queue is a $100m 10-year, step-up five
subordinated bond for Austria's GiroCredit. Morgan Stanley is believed to
be the lead manager.	<BR>

<H3>Jumbo CL securitisation scores hit with investors </H3>
<H4>CREDIT LYONNAIS, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley achieved a notable
triumph this week with the launch and successful placement of a Ffr40bn
asset-backed bond issue.<BR>
<BR>
</H4>The transaction, in the name of Cyber-Val 07-96, marks the largest ever
sale of non-government bonds in the international capital markets and forms
part of the restructuring of French state-owned bank Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite its size -- the equivalent of $7.74bn -- the issue attracted substantial
demand from investors around the world, with some of the tranches ending
up heavily oversubscribed. <BR>
<BR>
Even bankers not involved in the deal reported overwhelming interest from
investors. Participants said buyers found the combination of top-flight
credit quality, low risk weighting and Pibor-plus pricing too good to turn
down. <BR>
<BR>
The bonds repackaged a portion of a Ffr145bn loan from Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais
to the Etablissement Public de Finance-ment de Restructuration (EPFR), a
fund set up to manage the sell-down of a pool of bad assets that were acquired
from the troubled bank. <BR>
<BR>
The quasi-governmental nature of EPFR is a key element in the granting of
triple-A ratings from Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's.
<BR>
<BR>
The bonds were sold in four tranches, ranging in maturity from one to five
years. All three bookrunners reported a broadly similar pattern of demand,
with the tranches at either end of the maturity spectrum selling most quickly.
<BR>
<BR>
The Ffr8bn of one-year 'A1' notes played to an overwhelmingly domestic audience,
principally SICAVs, money managers and cash-rich corporates. <BR>
<BR>
The 'A4' tranche, sub-divided into Ffr8bn each of four-year and five-year
notes, had a markedly more international flavour. <BR>
<BR>
A syndicate manager at Morgan Stanley said that potential buyers naturally
focused first on those tranches that promised extra yield or worked as
substitutes
for cash. Only then did momentum build up in the intermediate 'A2' and 'A3'
classes. <BR>
<BR>
That pattern of placement had been anticipated in the structuring of the
issue; nevertheless, Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais decided to tweak the indicated
pricing to reflect the form of the demand coalescing during the week-long
marketing period. <BR>
<BR>
In particular, pricing on the two intermediate tranches was upped by 1bp
over their originally marketed spread ranges. (For full pricing details
see page 41.) <BR>
<BR>
The bonds were sold with a zero capital adequacy risk weighting in France
and Luxembourg, and a 10% weighting in the UK. A German risk weighting has
yet to be allocated, although this did not preclude sales into the country.
<BR>
<BR>
The three bookrunners each took 31% of the deal, leaving just 1% -- or Ffr400m
of bonds -- for each of the co-leads. <BR>
<BR>
Concentrating the underwriting in the hands of the three bookrunners allowed
them to shrug off the non-participation of a number of front-line French
banks. <BR>
<BR>
At least three banks turned down the deal as a protest against the small
allotments and the amount of government help received by Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais
in its bailout. <BR>
<BR>
The deal was effectively pre-placed by the time the deal appeared on the
screens late yesterday afternoon (Thursday), following a day of minor farce
involving delays in obtaining the necessary listing approval from the Paris
Bourse. <BR>
<BR>
The bonds were freed to trade almost immediately. Although the late launch
did not allow active trading to develop, a Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais syndicate
official said the bonds were quoted at -- or slightly above -- their issue
price as the day came to a close. <BR>
<BR>
Structuring the deal involved a number of sensitive issues, including ensuring
that the European Commission had no objections to the freeing up of Fr40bn
of cash that had formed part of a state-sponsored bailout of Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais. <BR>
<BR>
But the structure of the bond issue that was eventually presented to investors
is relatively simple in comparison to many other European securitisations.
<BR>
<BR>
In particular, said bankers, the central role of the quasi-state EPFR allowed
many buyers to open up credit lines swiftly, while the bullet maturities
did away with any worries over amortisation. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the sale of Ffr40bn of asset-backed securities illustrates
just how far European investors have come in accepting the techniques of
securitisation in recent years. <BR>

<H3>TRADING PLACES </H3>
<H2>Howland-Jackson takes over for NatWest Markets in Asia <BR>
</H2>
NATWEST Markets is stepping up its drive to develop its investment banking
operations in Asia with the appointment of John Howland-Jackson, the firm's
deputy chief executive, as chairman for the Asia-Pacific region. <BR>
<BR>
Howland-Jackson replaces Philip Deer, regional managing director for Asia
Pacific, who is returning to London as senior managing responsible for
international
business. <BR>
<BR>
In his new role, Deer will be responsible for overseeing non-UK activities
managed from London -- including continental Europe, the emerging markets
of central and eastern Europe, and the Middle East. <BR>
<BR>
He will remain a member of the firm's executive committee and will report
directly to Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets. <BR>
<BR>
The decision to base Howland-Jackson in Asia signals the extent of the UK
firm's commitment to building a broad investment banking and securities
operation in the region. <BR>
<BR>
Through its Wheelock NatWest joint venture in Hong Kong, the firm has expanded
rapidly in corporate finance, equities and investment banking. NatWest also
has an alliance with HDFC in Bombay. <BR>
<BR>
Howland-Jackson is no stranger to Asia, having been responsible for JP Morgan's
Asian activities during a stint with the US bank and having held a variety
of senior positions with Nomura, the leading Japanese securities firm. <BR>
<BR>
Having joined Nomura in 1998 as managing director responsible for underwriting
and corporate finance, he rose to become co-president of Nomura International
and one of the two highest ranking non-Japanese executives in Nomura worldwide.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;NatWest Markets must continue to strengthen its presence around the
world, particularly in Asia, in order to fulfil its global ambitions,&quot;
said Owen. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The next stage of development for NatWest Markets requires a particular
focus on broadening base across the breadth of advisory. financing and
investment
products we provide.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Said Howland-Jackson: &quot;The superior performance of Asia's economies
will continue to command world attention. I am delighted to be returning
to Asia to contribute personally to meeting the needs of our clients in
the region.&quot; * <BR>
<BR>
<B>Salomon Brothers</B> has appointed Iain Baillie as senior sterling fixed
income trader. Baillie returns to the bank after nine years, in which time
he has worked for Prudential Bache Securities and became a founding director
of Luthy Baillie Dowsett &amp; Pethick, a specialist dealer in Eurobonds.
<BR>
<BR>
Previously at Salomon Brothers, he was a Eurobond trader spending some time
in New York in the corporate bond department. In his new position he will
report to Ted Seeyle, managing director and head of Eurobond trading. <BR>
<BR>
<B>UBS</B> has appointed Hiroetsu Yasumoto as global head of yen bond trading,
completing its new line-up of global government bond trading management.
<BR>
<BR>
Earlier, the bank had appointed Marty Brennan as head of US government bond
trading and Emmanuel Keller as head of European government bond trading.
<BR>
<BR>
Yasumoto, who joins from CS First Boston in Tokyo, will report to Yukiko
Omura, head of fixed-income and derivatives for Japan and Bob Harding, global
head of government bonds. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Deutsche Bank </B>has made two key appointments, luring the latest in
a long line of captures from Merrill Lynch. <BR>
<BR>
James Miller joins as managing director in charge of equity capital markets
in New York. In this new position Miller will be responsible for primary
equity origination activity in the US. <BR>
<BR>
He will report to Michael Cohrs, head of equity capital markets at Deutsche.
<BR>
<BR>
Manuel Mejia joins as head of fixed-income and Eurobond trading in the emerging
markets division -- another newly created post. Mejia will report to Rick
Haller, head of emerging markets at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. <BR>
<BR>
<B>TMG Financial Products (Europe) Ltd</B> has announced several new
appointments,
increasing the number of employees in the London office. Andrew Clark is
joining the company from Citibank, where he headed the European unit of
the bank's global financial structuring operation. <BR>
<BR>
For TMG he will work on cross-border investment and funding opportunities
as a member of the structured finance team. He is expected to focus on
tax-efficient
structures for TMG clients. <BR>
<BR>
James Kowalishin joins TMG from Hambros Bank where he was head of the structured
derivatives desk. He will be in charge of marketing TMG to clients in the
professional underwriting and dealing community with an emphasis on swap-related
bond products. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Thu-Uyen Nguyen will now be trading the volatility book at TMG. She
joins the company from Chase Manhattan Bank where she was an exotic derivatives
trader. <BR>
<BR>
Dale Wilson has joined <B>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</B>
in Toronto as director responsible for marketing interest rate derivatives
to clients in Ontario and western Canada. <BR>
<BR>
Wilson has 10 years of experience in the markets, most recently holding
the position of vice president of marketing for Cr&eacute;dit Agricole in
New York. <BR>
<BR>
In his new position he will report to Gilbert Lavoie, director of treasury
sales in Montreal. This appointment comes as part of a continuing initiative
to increase Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale's Canadian operation.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Credit Lyonnais</B> has announced a joint Paris-London foreign exchange
trading team as part of its strategy to develop foreign exchange as a global
product line. <BR>
<BR>
This announcement also makes it clear that their foreign exchange trading
operations will not be relocating entirely to London as suspected, after
a fire in May destroyed most of the trading operation in Paris. <BR>
<BR>
New appointments to the foreign-exchange trading team include David Bishop,
based at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in London, who will become global head of
the forex product line. <BR>
<BR>
In Paris, Xavier Alexandre, head of forex for that centre, additionally
becomes head of forex for continental Europe. He is joined in Paris by Christian
de Laitre, who becomes head of forex and money market product sales and
J&eacute;rome Nanty who becomes de Laitre's deputy. <BR>
<BR>
Graham Whitehair, head of sales at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in London will
additionally be responsible for the co-ordination of forex sales between
London, New York and Asia. <BR>
<BR>
Peter Dow is to join the London side of <B>WestLB</B>'s asset-backed
transactions
team, leaving his position in the credit department of Rabobank. <BR>
<BR>
In his new role, his responsibilities will include credit and origination
support for the bank's range of activities in securitised products. <BR>
<BR>
Peter Kievit, head of debt syndicate at ING Barings in London, is leaving
the bank to join <B>ABN AMRO</B> in Amsterdam to head up fixed-income
origination
for Latin America. In his new position he will report to Keith Schneider,
head of investment banking, Latin America. <BR>
<BR>
The move represents a return to his roots -- Kievit started his career with
ABN AMRO before working at ING in the Netherlands and later at ING Bank
S&atilde;o Paulo where he was responsible for primary and secondary Eurobond
activity. He will join ABN AMRO on September 1. <BR>
<BR>
Two new appointments have been made to the fixed-income operation at <B>Nikko
Europe Plc</B>. Nick Davies becomes a French government bond trader, leaving
Sanwa International, where he held a similar position. He is joined later
in the month by Andrew Davis, who becomes a repo matchbook trader. He leaves
SBC Warburg where he was also a repo trader, matchbook trading Italian lira,
Ecu and Dutch guilders. <BR>
<BR>
<B>CIBC Wood Gundy</B> has hired Kelly Holloway to join its London-based
fixed-income team. He will work with the central banks, increasing the firm's
institutional activities. Holloway has over 10 years' experience and most
recently worked for Bank of Montreal on fixed-income institutional sales.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Goldman Sachs</B> has named Paul Krikler as its first director of European
product marketing, a position created to develop the marketing of the firm's
European equity research product. <BR>
<BR>
Krikler has been with Goldman Sachs for nine years working within the global
pharmaceutical and healthcare equity research team. The appointment is effective
immediately and he will report to Robert Morris. <BR>
<BR>
Two new research analysts have been appointed within <B>UBS</B>'s smaller
companies team. Sue Cox, formerly of SBC Warburg, will join the company
in August specialising in UK electronics stocks. Also joining is Guy Feld,
who has a strong track record in the smaller companies sector as an analyst
at Tether &amp; Greenwood. They will both report to Simon Thorpe, head of
smaller companies.
