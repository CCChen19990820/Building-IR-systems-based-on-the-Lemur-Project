<h5>FISSION REACTORS</h5>

<p>
<a name=0><b>UO<sub>2</sub> Core Design of a Direct-Cycle Fast Converter Reactor Cooled by Supercritical Water</b><br></a>
<i>Tatjana Jevremovic, Yoshiaki Oka, Sei-ichi Koshizuka</i>
<p>

The core design of a fast converter reactor adopting enriched
UO<sub>2</sub> fuel is studied for maximizing the power rating of the
direct-cycle, supercritical water-cooled fast reactor with the same
reactor pressure vessel as the breeder and mixed-oxide (MOX) fueled
converter. The coolant void reactivity is kept negative by placing
thin zirconium-hydride layers in the blanket fuel assemblies facing
the driver fuels, as in our fast breeder reactor design. Compared with
the fast converter adopting MOX fuel, the electric power output is
increased 11%, from 1444 to 1625 MW(electric). It is attained by the
reduced blanket fuel fraction for keeping negative reactivity at
coolant voiding. The positive reactivity at flooding the core is much
larger than that of the MOX core, but it can be managed by the control
rod system. The conversion ratio, the surviving ratio, is 0.85,
reduced 0.1 from that of the MOX converter. The enrichment of
UO<sub>2</sub> fuel reaches 16.9%. The specific fissile inventory
is the highest, compared with the MOX-fueled converter and breeder due
to the lower fission cross sections of <sup>235</sup>U. The cores of
the supercritical water-cooled reactors are radially
heterogeneous. The decoupling problem is, however, much smaller than
that of the liquid-metal fast breeder reactor due to the smaller core
diameter. The hydrogen loss from the zirconium hydrides at steady
state and accidental conditions does not impose a problem.

<p>
<a name=1><b>Response Analysis of Electromagnetic Flowmeter</b><br></a>
<i>Akira Endou</i>
<p>

In liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactors (LMFBRs), electromagnetic
flowmeters (EMFs) have been extensively used to measure the coolant
flow rate. Because the coolant flow rate is one of the most important
parameters, a high accuracy and a fast response are required for the
flow rate measurement. However, it was thought that the response might
become slower when the pipe diameter of the EMF was
increased. Therefore, a quantitative evaluation of the response was
needed.
<p>

To evaluate the response time of EMFs, an equation of the transient
response was derived based on the realistic approximation that the EMF
pipe is made of nonconductive material. The response is expressed as a
function of the reciprocal of the square of the pipe radius a and of
the length L of the external magnetic field along the pipe
axis. However, when the aspect ratio L/2a is larger than two, the
length of the external magnetic field has an almost insignificant
effect on the response, and the response time increases with
increasing a<sup>2</sup>. The transient response can be calculated
with an uncertainty of less than a few percent. A first-order
approximation of the derived equation is given by the first lag term
with the time constant of <img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif"><img
src="/graphics/symbols/sigma.gif"><i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/3.83<sup>2</sup>
with permeability <img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif"> and
conductivity <img src="/graphics/symbols/sigma.gif"> of the coolant.
<p>

Even though the EMF has a diameter as large as 30 in., the response
time is 45 ms and sufficiently fast compared with other sensors used
in LMFBRs.


<h5>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h5>

<p>
<a name=2><b>Fuel Channel Analysis for a Large-Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident in a Canada Deuterium Uranium Reactor Loaded with CANFLEX Fuel Bundles</b><br></a>
<i>Dirk J. Oh, Hong S. Lim, Myeong Y. Ohn, Kang M. Lee, Ho C. Suk</i>
<p>

The CATHENA ``slave'' channel model is used for fuel channel analysis
of a 30% reactor inlet header break in a Canada deuterium uranium
(CANDU)-6 reactor loaded with 43-element bundles of advanced CANDU
[CANDU flexible fueling (CANFLEX)] fuel. The predicted results are
compared with those for the reactor loaded with standard 37-element
bundles.
<p>

The maximum fuel centerline and sheath temperatures for the CANFLEX
bundle are lower by 388 and 128<sup>o</sup>C, respectively, than those for the
standard bundle because of the lower maximum linear power of the
CANFLEX bundle. The pressure tube (PT)/calandria tube (CT) contact for
the CANFLEX bundle occurs 2 s later than that for the standard
bundle. The PT/CT contact temperature for the CANFLEX bundle is 7<sup>o</sup>C
lower than that for the standard bundle. These provide the CANFLEX
bundle with a slightly enhanced safety margin for fuel channel
integrity in the CANDU-6 reactor, compared with the standard bundle.
<p>

The effect of bearing pad (BP)/PT contact on the PT temperature
predictions is assessed. A BP/PT contact conductance of 3
kW/m<sup>2</sup><img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif"><i>K</i> prior to
the onset of PT ballooning creates ~100 <sup>o</sup>C of a local hot
spot at the contacted PT sector. A BP/PT contact conductance of 0.5
kW/m<sup>2</sup><img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif"><i>K</i> after PT
ballooning does not create any hot spot because it gives the contacted
PT sector appoximately the same heat transfer as convective heating by
the hot coolant for the adjacent sector. The assumed BP/PT contact
conductance does not threaten the fuel channel integrity.


<h5>NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLES</h5>

<p>
<a name=3><b>Operating Experience with the Multienrichment Initial Core of the Boiling Water Reactor Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Unit 5</b><br></a>
<i>Takaaki Mochida, Mitsunari Nakamura, Jun-ichi Yamashita, Hiromi Maruyama, Sakae Muto, Shigeru Kasai</i>
<p>

The multienrichment boiling water reactor (BWR) initial core design
was first applied to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Station Unit
5 [1100-MW(electric) BWR] in Japan. This core is designed to improve
fuel discharge exposure, capacity factors, and operability. The design
study shows that three types of fuel bundles with different
enrichments are suitable to achieve the design targets. Three bundle
enrichments are selected to simulate each of the following: fresh
bundles, once-burned bundles, and twice-burned bundles in the reload
core.
<p>

Although the heterogeneity of multienrichment design increases the
complexity of the design analysis, both the initial criticality test
and the moderator temperature coefficient measurement showed good
agreement with our prediction. Subsequent full-power operation
verified the expected core performance.
<p>

Average discharge exposure for the total initial fuel is ~10% arger
than that for the conventional single-enrichment BWR initial fuel with
reinsertion of discharged fuel at the end of the first cycle. These
experiences verified the effectiveness of a multienrichment initial
core for the improvement of fuel utilization, capacity factors, and
operability


<h5>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h5>

<p>
<a name=4><b>Recent Results on the Solubility of Uranium and Plutonium in Savannah River Site Waste Supernate</b><br></a>
<i>David T. Hobbs, David G. Karraker</i>
<p>

The high-activity waste from Savannah River Site fuel reprocessing is
stored as a two-layered mixture in mild steel tanks. The solid layer
contains the hydrolyzable cations, including most of the actinides;
the supernatant liquid is a strong base-salt solution that includes
<sup>137</sup>Cs. To gain storage capacity, the supernate is evaporated
to solids, then redissolved for waste processing. The solubility of
uranium and plutonium in the supernate is low, but evaporation raises
the possibility of an accumulation in the evaporator. This study of
uranium and plutonium solubility by statistical design experiments and
under simulated evaporator conditions found that uranium solubility
decreases to 5 to 10 ppm as the supernate is evaporated; plutonium
solubility increases from 1 to ~10 ppm. The possibility of uranium
accumulation in an evaporator exists, but the possibility of plutonium
accumulation appears to be small.


<h5>RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT</h5>

<p>
<a name=5><b>The Effect of Geological Parameters on Radiation Damage in Rock Salt: Application to Rock Salt Repositories</b><br></a>
<i>Carles de las Cuevas, Lourdes Miralles, Juan Jos*e Pueyo</i>
<p>

Laboratory irradiations at a constant dose rate of 15 kGy/h at 100<sup>o</sup>C
have enabled the study of the radiation damage in several types of rock salt.
Total doses ranged from 20 kGy to 48.9 MGy. Two methods (optical absorption and
release of hydrogen by reaction with water) have been used to measure the
concentration of radiation-induced defects. Their concentration was compared
with the dose and the chemical and mineral composition of rock salt samples,
using multivariate statistical techniques. The results show a loglinear increase
in the concentration of colloidal sodium with dose, whereas the F-centers
concentration remains nearly constant. Moreover, there is a clear influence of
the mineral composition of the rock salt in the radiation damage, leading to
defect concentrations varying over one order of magnitude for the same
dose. Rock salt with small amounts of accessory minerals presents the lowest
defect concentration. Experimental data have been compared with the theoretical
predictions obtained by the Jain-Lidiard model. For doses higher than 1 MGy,
both values are of the same order of magnitude.


<h5>MATERIALS</h5>

<p>
<a name=6><b>Decontamination Flange Film Characterization for a Boiling Water Reactor Under Hydrogen Water Chemistry</b><br></a>
<i>V. F. Baston, M. F. Garbauskas, J. Bozeman</i>
<p>

Stainless steel artifacts removed from a boiling water reactor class 4
plant that operated under hydrogen water chemistry and experienced a
difficult decontamination were submitted for oxide film
characterization. The results reported for the corrosion film
composition and structure are consistent with existing theoretical
concepts for stainless steel corrosion, spinel structure site
preferences (octahedral or tetrahedral) for transition metal ions, and
potential-pH diagrams. The observed zinc effects on film stability and
lower cobalt incorporation are also consistent with these theoretical
concepts.


<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>

<p>
<a name=7><b>Pool Boiling from Downward-Facing Curved Surfaces: Effects of Radius of Curvature and Edge Angle</b><br></a>
<i>Mohamed S. El-Genk, Cheng Gao</i>
<p>

Quenching experiments were performed to investigate the effects of
radius of curvature and edge angle on pool boiling from
downward-facing surfaces in saturated water. The experiments employed
two, 20-mm-thick copper test sections that had the same diameter (75
mm) but different surface radii (148 and 218.5 mm) and vapor release
(or edge) angles (14.68 and 9.88 deg). The effect of surface area on
pool boiling was determined by comparing the present results with the
results for a copper section that was of the same thickness but had a
surface radius of 148 mm and was less than one-half the surface
area. The maximum heat flux (q<sub>MHF</sub>) was highest at the
lowermost position and decreased with increased local inclination on
the surface. Both local and surface average q<sub>MHF</sub> were
representative of quasi-steady-state critical heat flux. The high edge
angle reduced vapor accumulation, which enhanced surface coolability
and shortened its quenching time. For an edge angle of 9.88 deg,
increasing the surface area (or surface radius) insignificantly
affected the local q<sub>MHF</sub> near the edge of the copper section
but lowered it everywhere else by ~10%. For the same surface area, the
larger edge angle (or smaller surface radius) increased
q<sub>MHF</sub> by as much as 40%.


<h5>NUCLEAR CRITICALITY SAFETY</h5>

<p>
<a name=8><b>TRIGA Spent-Fuel Storage Criticality Analysis</b><br></a>
<i>Matjaz Ravnik, Bogdan Glumac</i>
<p>

A criticality safety analysis of a pool-type storage for spent TRIGA
Mark II reactor fuel is presented. Two independent computer codes are
applied: the MCNP Monte Carlo code and the WIMS lattice cell code. Two
types of fuel elements are considered: standard fuel elements with 12
wt0ranium concentration and FLIP fuel elements. A parametric study
of spent-fuel storage lattice pitch, fuel element burnup, and water
density is presented. Normal conditions and postulated accident
conditions are analyzed. A strong dependence of the multiplication
factor on the distance between the fuel elements and on the effective
water density is observed. A multiplication factor &lt;1 may be
expected for an infinite array of fuel rods at center-to-center
distances &gt;6.5 cm, regardless of the fuel element type and
burnup. At shorter distances, the subcriticality can be ensured only
by adding absorbers to the array of fuel rods even if the fuel rods
were burned to ~20% burnup. The results of both codes agree well for
normal conditions. The results show that WIMS may be used as a
complement to the Monte Carlo code in some parts of the criticality
analysis.


<h5>RADIATION PROTECTION</h5>

<p>
<a name=9><b>Monte Carlo Transport Calculations and Analysis for Reactor Pressure Vessel Neutron Fluence</b><br></a>
<i>John C. Wagner, Alireza Haghighat, Bojan G. Petrovic</i>
<p>

The application of Monte Carlo methods for reactor pressure vessel
(RPV) neutron fluence calculations is examined. As many commercial
nuclear light water reactors approach the end of their design
lifetime, it is of great consequence that reactor operators and
regulators be able to characterize the structural integrity of the RPV
accurately for financial reasons, as well as safety reasons, due to
the possibility of plant life extensions. The Monte Carlo method,
which offers explicit three-dimensional geometric representation and
continuous energy and angular simulation, is well suited for this
task. A model of the Three Mile Island unit 1 reactor is presented for
determination of RPV fluence; Monte Carlo (MCNP) and deterministic
(DORT) results are compared for this application; and numerous issues
related to performing these calculations are examined. Synthesized
three-dimensional deterministic models are observed to produce results
that are comparable to those of Monte Carlo methods, provided the
two methods utilize the same cross-section libraries. Continuous
energy Monte Carlo methods are shown to predict more (15 to 20%)
high-energy neutrons in the RPV than deterministic methods.

<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>

<p>
<a name=10><b>Experimental Investigation of Coupled Natural Circulation Loops</b><br></a>
<i>Arafah E. Ghoneimy, Richard S. Dougall</i>
<p>

Transient experiments were performed using two natural convection
loops in series. The fluid in both loops was water at a pressure of 1
to 10 atm. Measurements were made of the temperature at key points in
both loops over the duration of the tests, which were 4 to 6 h
long. By using the assumption that after several hours the loops were
operating in a quasi-steady-state condition, estimates could be made
concerning the fluid circulation rates and heat transfer rates in
various parts of the system. The flow rates were very low and in the
laminar flow range. There was essentially no time lag before the start
of flow in the second loop. The heat exchanger coupling the two loops
was of a design whose performance could not be easily predicted. The
measurement of key loop temperature as a function of time provides a
simple means of obtaining preliminary predictions in planning
extensive experimental test programs for complicated thermal systems.


<h5>RADIATION PROTECTION</h5>

<p>
<a name=11><b>Analysis of Routine Radiological Measurements in a Nuclear Power Plant</b><br></a>
<i>V. K. Gupta, Sunil Sunny</i>
<p>

A large variety and amount of data of safety significance are
routinely collected during the operation of a nuclear power plant
(NPP). The data collected in the area of radiological protection have
been analyzed to understand the behavior of activated corrosion
products and fission products in the primary heat transport system of
a pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR). A correlation between the
fuel integrity and the normalized external collective dose to
maintenance work groups is clearly established. These studies should
help in optimal work planning to keep the radiation exposure of work
forces as low as reasonably achievable. The performance indicators
introduced by the World Association of Nuclear Operators have been in
use for the assessment of the operation and safety of NPPs in the
member countries. This, however, helps only in the intercomparison of
the operating and safety parameters of the operating NPPs. It was,
therefore, felt necessary to work out a scheme that utilizes the data
routinely collected at the NPP during the operating phase and also
uses the safety analysis performed during design. With this in view, a
new concept of safety indices (SIs), for overall assessment of the
safety of the operating NPP has been evolved, including SIs in the
areas of occupational collective dose, public dose, and fuel
reliability, with a view to obtain a direct assessment of the safety
of the plant operations, in comparison to a well-defined safety regime
and/or regulatory constraints. The SIs in the aforementioned areas are
discussed for the Rajasthan Atomic Power Station, an early Canada
deuterium uranium PHWR, for the period from 1992 through 1993. The SIs
could form a basis for communication among the utilities, the
regulatory bodies, and the public, since the concept is direct and
simple.

<h4>FISSION REACTORS</h4>

<p>
<a name=0><b>Pressurized Water Reactor Design for Plutonium Incineration: Fuel Cycle Options</b><br></a>
<i>Alex Galperin, Gilad Raizes</i>
<p>

The possibility exists of utilizing pressurized water reactor (PWR)
power plants of current technology for efficient and cost-competitive
incineration of excess plutonium. Several plutonium-based fuel cycle
options were considered, i.e., pure <sup>239</sup>Pu or reactor-grade
plutonium as a fissile component and natural uranium or thorium as a
fertile component of the fuel.
<p>

A typical PWR was chosen as the base for detailed analysis and
comparison of all investigated fuel cycle options. A series of
calculations was carried out for each of the fuel cycle options
generating ``equilibrium'' cycles of equal length.
<p>

Results of the design analysis and comparison of main performance
parameters were used to compare different fuel options. Material mass
balances were calculated to evaluate the plutonium incineration
potential of the considered options. A potential of efficient
reduction of excess plutonium was demonstrated for all considered fuel
options. The thorium-based fuel cycles were found especially effective
for destruction of fissile isotopes of plutonium (&gt;1000 kg/yr). This
was partially compensated by the buildup of <sup>233</sup>U
isotope. One of the important conclusions of this work is that
significant amounts of fissile plutonium may be incinerated in
thorium-based cycles and that <sup>233</sup>U may be denatured by
addition of modest amounts of natural uranium. Preliminary economic
evaluations indicate that plutonium incineration may be carried out in
existing PWRs without economic penalty and may, therefore, present a
viable alternative to other plutonium disposition methods.


<h4>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h4>

<p>
<a name=1><b>A Parallel and Serial Applications of the RETRAN-03 Power Plant Simulation Code Using Domain Decomposition and Krylov Subspace Methods</b><br></a>
<i>Thomas J. Downar, Jen-Ying Wu, John Steill, Raghunandan Janardhan</i>
<p>

High-fidelity simulation of nuclear reactor accidents such as the
rupture of a main steam line in a pressurized water reactor (PWR)
requires three-dimensional core hydrodynamics modeling because of the
strong effect channel cross flow has on reactor kinetics.
<p>

A parallel nested Krylov linear solver was developed and implemented
in the RETRAN-03 reactor systems analysis code to make such
high-fidelity core modeling practical on engineering workstations.
<p>

Domain decomposition techniques were also applied to the RETRAN-03
solution algorithm and demonstrated using a distributed memory
parallel computer.
<p>

Applications were performed for a four-loop Westinghouse PWR
steam-line-break accident, and performance improvements of over a
factor of 30 were achieved for models with 25 flow channels in the
core. Larger models (e.g., 104-core channels), previously inaccessible
because of memory limitations, were also solved with practical
execution times.


<p>
<a name=2><b>Mechanical Efficiency of the Energy Release During a Steam Explosion</b><br></a>
<i>R. Krieg</i>
<p>

The mechanical processes during the expansion phase of a steam
explosion with intimately fragmented liquid particles is investigated
based on elementary principles and analytical solutions. During a
short load pulse, the different densities of the water and the melted
particles lead to different velocities. After the load pulse,
viscosity effects lead to a slow down of the higher velocities and to
a corresponding reconversion of the kinetic energy of the mixture into
thermal energy. It is shown that both effects are proportional to each
other. The ratio between the residual and the applied mechanical
energy is defined as the mechanical efficiency of the steam
explosion. Using data typical for a steam explosion in a pressurized
water reactor, mechanical efficiencies of &lt;50% are
estimated. Considering that the thermodynamic efficiencies are quite
limited, the very low conversion rates from thermal energy into
mechanical energy observed during steam explosion experiments can be
more easily understood.

<a name=3><b>Material Distribution in Light Water Reactor-Type Bundles Tested Under Severe Accident Conditions</b><br></a>
<i>Volker Noack, Siegfried J. L. Hagen, Peter Hofmann, Gerhard Schanz, Leo K. Sepold</i>
<p>

Severe fuel damage experiments simulating small-break loss-of-coolant
accidents have been carried out in the CORA out-of-pile test facility
at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. Rod bundles with electrically heated
fuel rod simulators containing annular UO<sub>2</sub> pellets,
UO<sub>2</sub> full pellet rods, and absorber rods of two kinds
(Ag/In/Cd to represent pressurized water reactor conditions and
B<sub>4</sub>C to represent boiling water reactor and VVER-1000 fuel
elements) were subjected to temperature transients up to 2300 K. A
special method was applied to determine the axial mass distribution of
bundle materials.
<p>

The low-temperature melt formation by various interactions between
zirconium and components of absorber and spacer grids strongly
influences the bundle degradation and material relocation. Absorber
materials can separate from the fuel by a noncoherent relocation of
the materials at different temperatures. The distributions of
solidified materials in the different test bundles show a clear
dependence on the axial temperature profile. Coolant channel blockages
are observed mainly at the lower end of the bundle, i.e., near the
lowest elevation at which an oxidation excursion resulting from the
highly exothermic zirconium-steam reaction had been experienced. This
elevation corresponds with a steep axial temperature gradient in the
maximum temperature attained. Oxide layers on Zircaloy result in
reduced melt formation.


<h4>NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLES</h4>

<p>
<a name=4><b>Transuranium Fuel Assembly for Transmutation in a Pressurized Water Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Masaaki Mori, Mitsuru Kawamura, Akio Yamamoto</i>
<p>

Results are presented of a conceptual design study of a transuranium
(TRU) fuel assembly consisting of only plutonium and minor actinide
(MA) oxides for transmutation of MAs in a pressurized water reactor
(PWR). The average plutonium content of the TRU transmutation fuel
assembly in this study is 38 wt% Pu<sup>tot</sup>, and the average MA
content is 62 wt%. The fuel rod arrangement and the plutonium content
are optimized to suppress the internal power peaking in the fuel
assembly. Core characteristics and TRU inventory change are evaluated
for an 870-MW(electric) PWR core loaded heterogeneously with a few TRU
transmutation fuel assemblies. The maximum loading of the TRU
transmutation fuel is limited to nine assemblies to maintain a
negative moderator temperature coefficient at the beginning of cycle,
while satisfying a cycle length of 15.2 GWd/tonne U. By loading nine
TRU transmutation fuel assemblies, the total MA inventory in the core
decreases by ~65 kg/cycle, which is approximately equivalent to that
produced from three UO<sub>2</sub> reactors. The heterogeneous loading
of a few fuel assemblies with highly concentrated TRU in a PWR is
found to be feasible for the effective transmutation of MAs while
maintaining reactor safety.

<a name=5><b>Boiling Water Reactor Benchmark Calculations</b><br></a>
<i>Farzad Rahnema, Dan Ilas, Shivakumar Sitaraman</i>
<p>

A typical advanced boiling water reactor (BWR) pin cell configuration
is used to develop numerical benchmarks for the effects of moderator
and fuel properties on the eigenvalue. Results are developed for pin
cell configurations with different moderator densities and
temperatures and different fuel exposures and temperatures. These
configurations (98) correspond to those typical of cold,
hot-operating, and transient conditions in BWRs. All of the
calculations were performed using the Monte Carlo code MCNP with the
continuous-energy cross sections derived from version VI of the
Evaluated Nuclear Data Files ENDF/B.


<h4>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h4>

<p>
<a name=6><b>Melting Tests for Recycling Slightly Radioactive Metallic Wastes Arising from Decommissioning</b><br></a>
<i>Hisashi Nakamura, Kazuo Fujiki</i>
<p>

To address the future recycling of metallic wastes arising from the
decommissioning of nuclear facilities, melting tests of radioactively
contaminated metals were carried out with attention to the resultant
partitioning of radionuclides. The behavior of radionuclides is
dominated by the volatility and the oxidizable tendency of each
element. For the behavior of <sup>65</sup>Zn, a different result from
the existing one is obtained; i.e., significant amounts of
<sup>65</sup>Zn remain in the ingot. Melting procedures and flux
compositions exert an effect on the transfer behavior of the volatile
radionuclides evaluated.


<h4>RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT</h4>

<p>
<a name=7><b>Evaluation of Shielding Analysis Methods in Spent-Fuel Cask Environments</b><br></a>
<i>Bryan L. Broadhead, Jabo S. Tang, Robert L. Childs, Cecil V. Parks, Hiroaki Taniuchi</i>
<p>

The three-dimensional Monte Carlo code MORSE-SGC, as implemented in
the SCALE system calculational sequence SAS4, is applied to the
analysis of a series of simple geometry benchmark experiments and
prototypic spent-fuel storage cask measurements. The simple geometry
experiments were performed in Japan and at the General Electric-Morris
Operation facility; the cask measurements were performed at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory. The quantification of uncertainties
in a typical shielding analysis process for transport/storage casks
can be accomplished by comparison of consistent trends between
calculated and measured dose rate quantities in both benchmark and
prototypic environments. Benchmark results typically measure the
validity of cross-section data and computer code adequacy; prototypic
environments, however, generally measure the overall validity of the
calculational procedure. A total of five storage cask problems and two
simple geometry problems were analyzed to determine the expected
accuracies of computational analyses using well-established
source-generation and Monte Carlo codes.
<p>

The general trends seen in this work are in agreement within 300r
better with the measurements for neutron dose rates along the cask
side, lid, and bottom. The gamma-ray dose rates with substantial
contributions from the top endfitting, plenum, and bottom endfitting
regions also are in good agreement. Based on the latest results,
gamma-ray dose rate calculations with major contributions due to the
active fuel region show a consistent factor of 1.6 overprediction of
the measured quantities for casks with iron and concrete
shields. Major uncertainties exist in the quantification of
<sup>59</sup>Co concentrations in endfitting hardware materials. The
results presented support the accuracy of source generation methods
and dose estimation methods in these regions given accurate impurity
characterizations. Thus, it is felt that the practice of using upper
bounds for <sup>59</sup>Co initial concentrations should ensure
conservative cask designs.
<p>

Fortunately, the gamma-ray dose discrepancies seen along the sides of
both the iron and concrete cask surfaces are overpredictions. The
reason for overprediction is not fully known. Even though these
overpredictions are not clearly understood, the trends observed,
combined with some degree of code and data testing using these or
similar benchmark measurements, should inspire confidence in the
shielding results for a shipping/storage package.


<p>
<a name=8><b>Radionuclide Transport in Fractured Porous Media--Analytical Solutions for a System of Parallel Fractures with a Flux-Type Boundary Condition</b><br></a>
<i>Chu-Tien Chen, Shih-Hai Li</i>
<p>

An analytical solution is developed for the problem of radionuclide
transport in a system of planar parallel fractures situated in a
porous rock matrix. The flux at the inlet boundary of a fracture is
assumed to decrease exponentially with time. The solution considers
the following processes: (a) advective transport in the fractures, (b)
mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion along the fractures, (c)
molecular diffusion from a fracture to the porous matrix, (d)
adsorption onto the fracture wall, (e) adsorption within the porous
matrix, and (f) radioactive decay. The solution is based on the
Laplace transform method. The general transient solution is in the
form of a double integral that is evaluated using composite
Gauss-Legendre quadrature. A simpler transient solution that is in the
form of a single integral is also presented for the case that assumes
negligible longitudinal dispersion along the fractures. A few examples
are given to illustrate the effect of various fracture spacings and
groundwater velocities, a 1 0x806f008enetration distance, and the effect of
neglecting the longitudinal dispersion in the fractures.


<h4>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h4>

<p>
<a name=9><b>Evaluation of Subcooled Critical Heat Flux Correlations Using the PU-BTPFL CHF Database for Vertical Upflow of Water in a Uniformly Heated Round Tube</b><br></a>
<i>David D. Hall, Issam Mudawar</i>
<p>

A simple methodology for assessing the predictive ability of critical
heat flux (CHF) correlations applicable to subcooled flow boiling in a
uniformly heated vertical tube is developed. Popular correlations
published in handbooks and review articles as well as the most recent
correlations are analyzed with the PU-BTPFL CHF database, which
contains 29,718 CHF data points. This database is the largest
collection of CHF data (vertical upflow of water in a uniformly heated
round tube) ever cited in the world literature. The parametric ranges
of the CHF database are diameters from 0.3 to 45 mm,
length-to-diameter ratios from 2 to 2484, mass velocities from 0.01
x 10<sup>3</sup> to 138 x 10<sup>3</sup>
kg/m<sup>2</sup><img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif">s, pressures from 1 to 223 bars, inlet
subcoolings from 0 to 347<sup>o</sup>C, inlet qualities from -2.63 to
0.00, outlet subcoolings from 0 to 305<sup>o</sup>C, outlet qualities from
-2.13 to 1.00, and CHFs from 0.05 x 10<sup>6</sup> to 276 x
10<sup>6</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>. The database contains 4357 data points
having a subcooled outlet condition at CHF. A correlation published
elsewhere is the most accurate in both low- and high-mass velocity
regions, having been developed with a larger database than most
correlations. In general, CHF correlations developed from data
covering a limited range of flow conditions cannot be extended to
other flow conditions without much uncertainty.


<h4>NUCLEAR CRITICALITY SAFETY</h4>

<p>
<a name=10><b>Criticality Safety Assessment of a TRIGA Reactor Spent-Fuel Pool Under Accident Conditions</b><br></a>
<i>Bogdan Glumac, Matjaz Ravnik, Marjan Logar</i>
<p>

Additional criticality safety analysis of a pool-type storage for
TRIGA spent fuel at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
is presented. Previous results have shown that subcriticality is not
guaranteed for some postulated accidents (earthquake with subsequent
fuel rack disintegration resulting in contact fuel pitch) under the
assumption that the fuel rack is loaded with fresh 12 wttandard
fuel. To mitigate this deficiency, a study was done on replacing a
certain number of fuel elements in the rack with cadmium-loaded
absorber rods. The Monte Carlo computer code MCNP4A with an ENDF/B-V
library and detailed three-dimensional geometrical model of the
spent-fuel rack was used for this purpose. First, a minimum critical
number of fuel elements was determined for contact pitch, and two
possible geometries of rack disintegration were considered. Next, it
was shown that subcriticality can be ensured when pitch is decreased
from a rack design pitch of 8 cm to contact, if a certain number of
fuel elements (8 to 20 out of 70) are replaced by absorber rods, which
are uniformly mixed into the lattice. To account for the possibility
that random mixing of fuel elements and absorber rods can occur during
rack disintegration and result in a supercritical configuration, a
probabilistic study was made to sample the probability density
functions for random absorber rod lattice loadings. Results of the
calculations show that reasonably low probabilities for
supercriticality can be achieved (down to 10<sup>-6</sup> per severe
earthquake, which would result in rack disintegration and subsequent
maximum possible pitch decrease) even in the case where fresh 12 wt%
standard TRIGA fuel would be stored in the spent-fuel pool.


<h4>RADIATION PROTECTION</h4>

<p>
<a name=11><b>Virtual Radiation Fields--MA Virtual Environment Tool for Radiological Analysis and Simulation</b><br></a>
<i>Travis W. Knight, G. Ronald Dalton, James S. Tulenko</i>
<p>

A virtual reality system was developed for computational and graphical
modeling and simulation of radiation environments. This system, called
Virtual Radiation Fields (VRF), demonstrates the usefulness of
radiological analysis in simulation-based design for predicting
radiation doses for robotic equipment and personnel working in a
radiation environment. The system was developed for use in determining
the radiation doses for robotic equipment to be used in tank-waste
retrieval operations at the Hanford National Laboratory. As a
reference case, specific application is made to simulate cleanup
operations for Hanford tank C-106. A three-dimensional model
representation of the tank and its predicted radiation levels are
presented and analyzed. Tank cleanup operations were simulated to
understand how radiation levels change during the cleanup phase and to
predict cumulative radiation doses to robotic equipment to aid in the
development of maintenance and replacement schedules.

<h4>FISSION REACTORS</h4>

<p>
<a name=0><b>Test Results of Ya-21u Thermionic Space Power System</b><br></a>
<i>Dmitry V. Paramonov, Mohamed S. El-Genk</i>
<p>

The Soviet-made TOPAZ-II space nuclear power system unit designated
Ya-21u underwent a total of 15 tests both in the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republic (USSR) (1989-1990) and in the United States (August
1993 to March 1995) for a cumulative test/operation time of 7681 h at
conditions far exceeding design limits. These tests included
steady-state operation at different power levels, fast start-ups and
power optimizations, and shock and vibration tests. Test results are
presented and analyzed. Results indicate a gradual change in the
performance parameters such as the optimum cesium pressure and optimum
load voltage. The electric power and conversion efficiency of the unit
at an input thermal power of 105 kW decreased from 3.7 kW(electric)
and 4 134672392n the test in the USSR to 2.13 kW(electric) and 2.3 134672392n the
last test in the United States. A discussion and qualitative
assessment of potential causes of the performance changes of the
Ya-21u unit are given.

<a name=1><b>Gross Xenon Stability</b><br></a>
<i>Jeffery D. Lewins, Paul P. H. Wilson</i>
<p>

The effect of xenon in thermal reactors on steady operation is
generally destabilizing. Illustrating this involves the study of
appropriate transfer functions, which may be conveniently displayed in
three ways: as Bode, Nyquist, and root-locus diagrams. The three forms
allow different aspects to be highlighted. These are illustrated for
the effect of xenon with allowance not only for the stabilizing effect
of the direct yield in fission but also to show the consequences of
neglecting the time dependence due to the thermal capacity of the
reactor. With careful interpretation, all these forms give an
interpretation of stability that is consistent with direct evaluation
and promote the understanding of the onset of gross oscillations in
power.


<p>
<a name=2><b>How the Code Analyst Can Influence the Calculation and Use Good Practices to Minimize Pitfalls</b><br></a>
<i>Louis M. Shotkin</i>
<p>

Almost 20 yr ago, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
thermal-hydraulic code development effort made the transition from a
homogeneous equilibrium formulation to a two-fluid formulation. The
objective was to introduce a more physically based model so that the
code analyst would have to make fewer choices in the input deck to
simulate expected phenomena. There were still several options left
open to the user, especially the noding for the simulation. Recent
experience with NRC analyses, as well as with International Standard
Problems, has shown that there can still be a considerable ``user
effect'' in the use of even the two-fluid codes. Two specific examples
are given.
<p>

Using the RELAP5 code as a specific prototype to focus the discussion,
examples are given of the choices currently available to the
analyst. Similar choices are available in almost all thermal-hydraulic
system codes. These example choices serve to show that even though
thermal-hydraulic system codes are reaching a certain state of
maturity, the user must still make many choices in setting up an input
deck or in running a calculation. There are several pitfalls that the
user can encounter, and there are good practices that can avoid many
of these pitfalls. Specific examples of current practices for
minimizing pitfalls and increasing good practices are discussed. They
apply to any thermal-hydraulic system code. These include the
following: training and mentoring for the code analyst; user
guidelines documentation; internal review and quality assurance of the
input deck by knowledgeable individuals; use of standard noding; and
fixed noding for each test facility and reactor system.
<p>

Guidance for the average code analyst is provided in terms of common
pitfalls typically encountered and suggestions for good practices in
choosing input deck options.


<h4>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h4>

<p>
<a name=3><b>An Assessment of Ex-Vessel Fuel/Coolant Interaction Energetics for Advanced Light Water Reactors</b><br></a>
<i>John G. Murphy, Michael L. Corradini</i>
<p>

The occurrence of an energetic fuel/coolant interaction (FCI) below
the reactor pressure vessel in the cavity of advanced light water
reactors (ALWRs) are analyzed to determine the possible hazard to
structural walls as a result of dynamic liquid phase pressures. Such
analyses are important to demonstrate that these cavity walls will
maintain their integrity so that ex-vessel core debris coolability is
possible. Past studies that have examined this or related issues are
reviewed, and a methodology is proposed to analyze the occurrence of
this physical event using the IFCI and TEXAS models for the FCI as
well as dynamic shock wave propagation estimates using hand
calculations as well as the CTH hydro model. Scenarios for the ALWRs
are reviewed, and one severe accident scenario is used as an example
to demonstrate the methodology. Such methodologies are recommended for
consideration in future safety studies. These methodologies should be
verified with direct comparison to energetic FCI data such as that
being produced in KROTOS at the Joint Research Centre, Ispra.


<p>
<a name=4><b>The Safety Concerns of Spent-Fuel Pool Reracking in Taiwan's Maanshan Nuclear Power Station</b><br></a>
<i>Hsin-Ho Lee</i>
<p>

Taiwan's Maanshan Nuclear Power Station (MNPS) consists of two
pressurized water reactors [2775 MW(thermal)]. The reracking method
has received licensing approval and has been successfully implemented
by the Taiwan Power Company for MNPS to increase the spent-fuel
storage capacity of each unit from 746 to 2160 fuel assemblies. MNPS
is the only nuclear power station in the world that can store the
accumulated spent-fuel assemblies from 40 yr of plant life in its
on-site spent-fuel pool after reracking. The safety concerns regarding
various aspects of this reracking project are presented. These safety
concerns include thermal hydraulics, criticality, structure,
radiation, and heavy loads.


<h4>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h4>

<p>
<a name=5><b>Investigations on the Partitioning of <sup>129</sup>I from Silver-Impregnated Silica in Preparation for Future Transmutation</b><br></a>
<i>Giuseppe Modolo, Reinhard Odoj</i>
<p>

According to the current state of the art in reprocessing technology,
the <SUP>129</SUP>I contained in spent fuel elements can be completely
transferred to the dissolver off-gas and efficiently adsorbed on
AgNO<sub>3</sub>-impregnated silica (AC 6120). For future
transmutation, the <SUP>129</SUP>I should again be separated
selectively and as completely as possible (&gt;99%) from the AC 6120
adsorption matrix. Experimental studies show that a quantitative
recovery of the iodine is possible by wet chemical and thermal
processes. Extraction experiments using iodine-loaded AC 6120 with
sodium sulfide solution provide recovery rates of 99<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif">1%. Reduction with hydrogen at
500<sup>o</sup>C, in which gaseous HI was liberated, provided recovery
rates of &gt;99%. After the separation of iodine, the reduced AC 6120
can be used again as an adsorbent for molecular iodine.


<h4>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h4>

<p>
<a name=6><b>A Computational Model for Thermal Fluid Design Analysis of Nuclear Thermal Rockets</b><br></a>
<i>Jeff A. Given, Samim Anghaie</i>
<p>

A computational model for simulation and design analysis of nuclear
thermal propulsion systems has been developed. The model simulates a
full-topping expander cycle engine system and the thermofluid dynamics
of the core coolant flow, accounting for the real gas properties of
the hydrogen propellant/coolant throughout the system. Core
thermofluid studies reveal that near-wall heat transfer models
currently available may not be applicable to conditions encountered
within some nuclear rocket cores. Additionally, the possibility of a
core thermal fluid instability at low mass fluxes and the effects of
the core power distribution are investigated. Results indicate that
for tubular core coolant channels, thermal fluid instability is not an
issue within the possible range of operating conditions in these
systems. Findings also show the advantages of having a nonflat
centrally peaking axial core power profile from a fluid dynamic
standpoint. The effects of rocket operating conditions on system
performance are also investigated. Results show that high temperature
and low pressure operation is limited by core structural
considerations, while low temperature and high pressure operation is
limited by system performance constraints. The utility of these
programs for finding these operational limits, optimum operating
conditions, and thermal fluid effects is demonstrated.


<p>
<a name=7><b>Posttest Calculations of Bundle Quench Test CORA-13 with ATHLET-CD</b><br></a>
<i>Josef Bestele, Klaus Trambauer, Johann-Dietrich Schubert</i>
<p>

Gesellschaft fur Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit is developing, in
cooperation with the Institut fur Kernenergetik und Energiesysteme,
Stuttgart, the system code Analysis of Thermalhydraulics of Leaks and
Transients with Core Degradation (ATHLET-CD). The code consists of
detailed models of the thermal hydraulics of the reactor coolant
system. This thermo-fluid dynamics module is coupled with modules
describing the early phase of the core degradation, like cladding
deformation, oxidation and melt relocation, and the release and
transport of fission products. The assessment of the code is being
done by the analysis of separate effect tests, integral tests, and
plant events. The code will be applied to the verification of severe
accident management procedures.
<p>

The out-of-pile test CORA-13 was conducted by Forschungszentrum
Karlsruhe in their CORA test facility. The test consisted of two
phases, a heatup phase and a quench phase. At the beginning of the
quench phase, a sharp peak in the hydrogen generation rate was
observed.
<p>

Both phases of the test have been calculated with the system code
ATHLET-CD. Special efforts have been made to simulate the heat losses
and the flow distribution in the test facility and the thermal
hydraulics during the quench phase. In addition to previous
calculations, the material relocation and the quench phase have been
modeled. The temperature increase during the heatup phase, the
starting time of the temperature escalation, and the maximum
temperatures have been calculated correctly. At the beginning of the
quench phase, an increased hydrogen generation rate has been
calculated as measured in the experiment.

<a name=0><b>Analysis of Ya-21u Thermionic Fuel Elements</b><br></a>
<i>Dmitry V. Paramonov, Mohamed S. El-Genk</i>
<p>

The Ya-21u unit of the Soviet-made TOPAZ-II power system has recently
been tested at the Thermionic Evaluation Facility in Albuquerque, New
Mexico. A change in the unit performance was measured during these
tests. In an attempt to identify the causes of this change
performance, data were examined and used to estimate surface
properties of electrodes of thermionic fuel elements (TFEs) of the
power system. The effective emissivity was estimated at ~0.03 to 0.035
higher than for as-fabricated TFE and cesiated work functions of the
electrodes, which were higher than for as-fabricated TFEs. These
changes in the effective emissivity and cesiated work functions,
caused by gaseous impurities and air incursion in the TFEs
interelectrode gap, lowered both the emitter temperature and the
output load voltage thus contributing to the measured decrease in
output power.


<h4>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h4>
<p>

<a name=1><b>Modeling of Thermophoretic Deposition of Aerosols in Nuclear Reactor Containments</b><br></a>
<i>Almir Fernandes, Sudarshan K. Loyalka</i>
<p>

Aerosol released in postulated or real nuclear reactor accidents can
deposit on containment surfaces via motion induced by temperature
gradients in addition to the motion due to diffusion and gravity. The
deposition due to temperature gradients is known as thermophoretic
deposition, and it is currently modeled in codes such as CONTAIN in
direct analogy with heat transfer, but there have been questions about
such analogies. This paper focuses on a numerical solution of the
particle continuity equation in laminar flow condition characteristics
of natural convection. First, the thermophoretic deposition rate is
calculated as a function of the Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, the
thermophoretic coefficient K, and the temperature difference between
the atmosphere and the wall. Then, the cases of diffusion alone and a
boundary-layer approximation (due to Batchelor and Shen) to the full
continuity equation are considered. It is noted that an analogy with
heat transfer does not hold, but for the circumstances considered in
this paper, the deposition rates from the diffusion solution and the
boundary-layer approximation can be added to provide reasonably good
agreement (maximum deviation 30%) with the full solution of the
particle continuity equation. Finally, correlations useful for
implementation in the reactor source term codes are provided.

<a name=2><b>Light Water Reactor Aerosol Containment Experiment LA4 Simulated by JERICHO and AEROSOLS-B2 Codes</b><br></a>
<i>Roberto Passalacqua, Didier Tarabelli, Claude Renault</i>
<p>

Large-scale experiments show that whenever a loss of coolant accident
occurs water pools are generated. Stratification of steam-saturated
gas develops above growing water pools causing a different thermal
hydraulics in the subcompartment where the water pool is
located. Hereafter, the LWR Aerosols Containment Experiment (LACE) LA4
experiment, performed at the Hanford Engineering Development
Laboratory, will be studied; this experiment exhibited a strong
stratification, at all times, above a growing water pool.
<p>

JERICHO and AEROSOLS-B2 are part of the Ensemble de Systemes de Codes
d'Analyse d'Accident des Reacteurs a Eau (ESCADRE) code system, a tool
for evaluating the response of a nuclear plant to severe
accidents. These two codes are used here to simulate respectively the
thermal hydraulics and the associated aerosol behavior.
<p>

Code results have shown that modeling large containment thermal
hydraulics without taking into account the stratification phenomenon
leads to large overpredictions of containment pressure and
temperature. If the stratification, above the water pool, is modeled
as a zone with a higher steam condensation rate and a higher thermal
resistance (that is acting as a barrier to heat exchanges with the
upper and larger compartment), ESCADRE predictions match experimental
data quite well.
<p>

The stratification region is believed to be able to affect aerosol
behavior; aerosol settling is improved by steam condensation on
particles and by diffusiophoresis and thermophoresis. In addition, the
lower aerosol concentration throughout the stratification might cause
a nonnegligible aerosol concentration gradient and consequently a
driving force for the motion of smaller particles toward the pool.
<p>


<a name=3><b>Measurement and Modeling of Iodine Volatility Above Irradiated CsI Solutions</b><br></a>
<i>Greg J. Evans</i>
<p>

Any release of radioiodine to the environment following a reactor
accident depends to a large extent on its volatility within a
containment structure. A common measure of iodine volatility is the
water-air volumetric iodine partition coefficient (IPC), defined as
the ratio of aqueous to airborne radioiodine concentrations. The
impact of pH and total iodine concentration on volatility is evaluated
through experiments and modeling to establish the relevant trends and
improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The model
consists of kinetic expressions for 125 reactions. The IPC is
evaluated experimentally by irradiating, at 0.25 kGy/h and 25 degrees
C, <sup>131</sup>I-labeled CsI solutions ranging in concentration from
10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> M and in pH from 3 to 12.
<p>

Both the experiments and the modeling indicate that under acidic
conditions, the IPC for 10<sup>-6</sup> M solutions is substantially
higher than that for 10<sup>-5</sup> M solutions. The predicted
dependence of the IPC on pH for acidic 10<sup>-5</sup> M solutions is
in good agreement with that observed experimentally. However,
substantial divergence occurred for more dilute solutions and for
basic pH conditions. It is speculated that under these conditions,
atomic iodine may contribute substantially to the overall volatility;
adding atomic iodine volatility to the model is found to greatly
improve the agreement.


<h4>NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLES</h4>
<p>

<a name=4><b>An Experimental Investigation of Natural Convection Heat Transfer Within Horizontal Spent-Fuel Assemblies</b><br></a>
<i>Robert E. Canaan, Dale E. Klein</i>
<p>

Natural convection heat transfer is experimentally investigated in an
enclosed horizontal rod bundle, which characterizes a spent-fuel
assembly during transport and some dry storage scenarios. The
objective of this experimental study is to obtain convection
correlations that can be used to easily incorporate convective effects
into analytical models of horizontal spent-fuel systems and also to
investigate the physical nature of natural convection in enclosed
horizontal rod bundles in general. The resulting data consist of
correlations of convective Nusselt number, which are defined in terms
of the maximum and average assembly temperatures. The correlations
have been corrected for radiation heat transfer using a numerical
technique. The data suggest the presence of conduction and convection
regimes, distinguished by a critical Rayleigh number. The correlation
of the convection regime suggests turbulent flow
conditions. Predictions of maximum assembly temperature using the
presented correlations are compared w ith additional experimental data
obtained in a horizontal enclosed rod bundle. Further comparisons are
made with predictions from the widely used Wooten-Epstein equation and
a recently developed theoretical approach based on an effective
thermal conductivity model. Favorable results are obtained, especially
for thermal conditions that favor natural convection, such as
relatively low enclosure temperatures and abovestandard atmospheric
pressure.


<h4>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h4>
<p>

<a name=5><b>Influence of NO<sub>x</sub> and HNO<sub>2</sub> on Iodine Quantity in Spent-Fuel Solutions</b><br></a>
<i>Tsutomu Sakurai, Akira Takahashi, Niroh Ishikawa, Yoshihide Komaki, Mamoru Ohnuki</i>
<p>

The quantity of iodine in spent-fuel solutions tends to decrease with
an increase in the dissolution rate. This phenomenon is ascribed to
the presence of nitrous acid (HNO<sub>2</sub>) generated in the
dissolution process because of the following three findings: (a) in a
hot nitric acid solution, the steady-state HNO<sub>2</sub>
concentration increases with an increase in the rate of its production
and decreases with an increase in temperature, (b) the HNO<sub>2</sub>
decreases the quantity of colloidal iodine (the main component of
residual iodine in a simulated spent-fuel solution) in proportion to
its concentration up to ~3.0 x 10<sup>-3</sup> M, and (c) a higher
dissolution rate of UO<sub>2</sub> causes a higher HNO<sub>2</sub>
production rate, hence, a higher HNO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the
solution. The HNO<sub>2</sub> did not appear (i.e., [HNO<sub>2</sub>]
&lt; 2 x 10<sup>-4</sup> M) in the dissolution of a UO<sub>2</sub>
pellet (~1 g) with a low dissolut ion rate, 0.4 g/h of UO<sub>2</sub>
at 100 degrees C. When high concentrations of I<sub>2</sub> and
NO<sub>2</sub> (263 parts per million of I<sub>2</sub> and 380f
NO<sub>2</sub>) in an N<sub>2</sub> flow were passed through a
simulated spent-fuel solution at 100 degrees C, the predicted colloid
of AgI was produced as a chemical equilibrium product of the reaction
AgI(s) + 2HNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) = 1/2 I<sub>2</sub>(aq) +
AgNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + NO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l). This
finding suggests that colloidal iodine may be produced secondarily in
the dissolver of reprocessing plants; this can be one of the reasons
why the residual iodine quantity in spent-fuel solutions is higher in
reprocessing plants than in laboratory-scale experiments.  <p>


<a name=6><b>The Reaction of Tri-n-Butyl Phosphate with Nitrates</b><br></a>
<i>M. Lee Hyder</i>
<p>

Laboratory experiments show that when tri-n-butyl phosphate is heated
with nitric acid or metal nitrates, chemical reaction generates gas
mixtures that can spontaneously ignite. In closed vessels, ignition of
these gases was observed at gas phase temperatures of 184 to 264
degrees C, corresponding to liquid-phase temperatures of 158 to 225
degrees C. Pressures of tens of megapascals were measured. Several
accidents associated with Purex processing in the nuclear industry
appear to have been caused by ignition of the products of this
reaction, either inside or outside process vessels. Safety measures
involve controlling the temperature and providing adequate vents.


<h4>REACTOR OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>

<a name=7><b>Identifying Organizational Deficiencies Through Root-Cause Analysis</b><br></a>
<i>Ram W. Tuli, George E. Apostolakis, Jya-Syin Wu</i>
<p>

All nuclear power plants incorporate root-cause analysis as an
instrument to help identify and isolate key factors judged to be of
significance following an incident or accident. Identifying the
principal deficiencies can become very difficult when the event
involves not only human and machine interaction, but possibly the
underlying safety and quality culture of the organization. The current
state of root-cause analysis is to conclude the investigation after
identifying human and/or hardware failures. In this work, root-cause
analysis is taken one step further by examining plant work processes
and organizational factors. This extension is considered significant
to the success of the analysis, especially when management deficiency
is believed to contribute to the incident. The results of root-cause
analysis can be most effectively implemented if the organization, as a
whole, wishes to improve the overall operation of the plant by
preventing similar incidents from occurring again. The study adds to
the existi ng root-cause analysis the ability to localize the causes
of undesirable events and to focus on those problems hidden deeply
within the work processes that are routinely followed in the operation
and maintenance of the facility.

<h4>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h4>
<p>

<a name=8><b>Combined Use of Nitric and Formic Acids to Reduce Hydrogen Emissions During the Treatment of High-Level Radioactive Waste</b><br></a>
<i>Chia-lin W. Hsu, James A. Ritter</i>
<p>

The combined use of nitric and formic acids, in lieu of formic acid
alone, to reduce H<sub>2</sub> emissions during the treatment of
high-level radioactive waste sludge was investigated. The
H<sub>2</sub> generation can be mitigated substantially by
substituting a fraction of formic acid with nitric acid as the
required acid source, and then using formic acid as the required
reductant source. The peak H<sub>2</sub> generation rate was reduced
by more than a factor of 2, and a more gradual rise in the
H<sub>2</sub> evolution resulted. However, the addition of mercury to
the sludge increased the evolution of H<sub>2</sub> as did increasing
the amount of nitric acid used and the rate of addition of the formic
acid source. Overall, these results provided clear insight into what
controlled the evolution of H<sub>2</sub> from high-level waste sludge
and a means of mitigating it.


<h4>MATERIALS</h4>
<p>

<a name=9><b>Evaporation and Wet Oxidation of Steam Generator Cleaning Solutions</b><br></a>
<i>Philip N. Baldwin, Jr.</i>
<p>

Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) is used in metal-cleaning
formulations. Usually the form of the EDTA used is the tetra ammonium
salt. When these powerful cleaning solutions are used in steam
generators, they attract the key metals of interest--iron and
copper. A reduction in the volume of these cleaners and EDTA
destruction is required to meet waste management and disposal
standards. One method of volume reduction is described: concentration
by evaporation.
<p>

Once volume is reduced, the liquid waste can then be further volume
reduced and treated for EDTA content through the use of wet
oxidation. The effect of this process on the total organic carbon
(TOC) in the form of EDTA contained in the copper as well as the iron
spent cleaning solutions is reviewed, including regression analysis of
selected benchmark and production data. A regressive analysis is made
of the relationship between the EDTA and the TOC analyzed in the
wet-oxidation batch residuals as well as the summary effects of
hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, and reaction time on the percentage
of TOC destroyed.


<h4>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h4>
<p>

<a name=10><b>Epithermal Neutron Beam Upgrade with a Fission Plate Converter at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Hungyuan B. Liu, Francis J. Patti</i>
<p>

Recent changes are updated for the proposed modification to use a
fission plate converter and a matching filter/moderator assembly in a
newly designed beam shutter to enhance the epithermal neutron beam for
patient irradiations during boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) at
the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, Brookhaven National
Laboratory. Engineering design of the new beam shutter system has been
completed, and design review is under way. With this upgrade, the
epithermal neutron flux could be increased up to seven times higher
than the present beam, and the fast-neutron dose per epithermal
neutron fluence could be reduced to near half. Such an enhanced
epithermal neutron beam would increase the effectiveness of clinical
BNCT by allowing increased doses to the tumor with similar or lesser
doses to normal tissues.

<i>Dietmar Behrens, Sebastian Meyer, Dieter von Ehrenstein, Richard Donderer, Otfried Schumacher, Galina Davydova, Alexander Krayushkin</i>
<p>

The Los Alamos National Laboratory Monte Carlo MCNP code is applied to
critical experiments performed at the RBMK critical facility of the
Russian Research Center ``Kurchatov Institute,'' Moscow. The
validation investigations are completed by whole-core criticality
calculations of experiments at the Smolensk Unit 3 nuclear power plant
as part of the start-up procedure. The geometric model exploits the
powerful capabilities of MCNP by precise representation of the fuel
and different types of nonfuel channels, which add up to a detailed
model of the critical facility and the RBMK core. Continuous-energy
cross-section tables are taken from the ENDF/B-IV and ENDF/B-VI
libraries. As the most important uncertainty inherent to the
experimental setup, the concentration of impurity isotopes in the
graphite moderator is identified. Within the resulting error limits,
the k<sub>eff</sub> and the void effect are well reproduced with both
cross-section libraries.

<a name="2"><b>Determination of Core Design Thermal Safety Limits for a Two-Loop Pressurized Water Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Venceslav Kostadinov</i>
<p>

Results are given of independent research of core thermal design
limits for the Nuklearna Elektrarna Krsko (NEK) nuclear power plant;
procedures for two-loop pressurized water reactor plant core design
safety limit calculation are used. Emphasis is placed on researching
the vessel exit boiling and the hot-channel exit quality limits and
their impact on the maximum available design safety operating range
and thermal operating margin of the NEK reactor core. For this
purpose, the LIMITS computer code is developed. Based on the modified,
well-tried COBRA-IV-I computer code, the departure of nuclear boiling
ratio core safety limits are calculated. The original results
complement well those of the NEK Final Safety Analysis Report.
<p>

The procedures and the methods for determining the reactor core design
thermal limits are successfully proven despite the unavailability of
proprietary data, different models, and computer codes. In addition to
the acquired capability of in-house independent checking of the
vendor's results, the bases are set for further independent analyses
of the limiting safety system settings for the NEK core.


<h5>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h5>

<a name="3"><b>Fission Product Releases at Severe Light Water Reactor Accident Conditions: ORNL/CEA Measurements Versus Calculations</b><br></a>
<i>Bernard Andre, Gerard Ducros, Jean Pierre Leveque, Morris F. Osborne, Richard A. Lorenz, Denis Maro</i>
<p>

During the 1970s, reactor safety authorities developed increasing
interest in methods for accurately predicting the extent of hazards
associated with severe accidents in light water reactors (LWRs). In
response to these concerns, out-of-pile experimental projects were
initiated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the French
Nuclear Protection and Safety Institute, at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) and the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA),
respectively. Both experimental efforts were designed for source term
characterization of the fission products (FPs) released from LWR fuel
samples under test conditions representative of severe accidents,
i.e., in oxidizing or reducing atmospheres at temperatures up to 2700
K (at ORNL) and 2570 K (at CEA).
<p>

The experimental devices, procedures, and parameters are
described. The combined database of available results is summarized
and related to experimental conditions.
<p>

Using Booth diffusion theory, diffusion coefficients of the FPs were
calculated, and their evolution with temperatures in the 1070 to 2700
K range were plotted. The results show the good agreement between the
independently determined ORNL and CEA FP diffusion coefficient
values. By plotting the data in Arrhenius fashion, it has been
possible to do the following:

<ol>
  <li> quantify the thermal activation coefficients for both volatile and low volatile FPs
  <li> identify classes of FPs whose release behavior does not follow
       a purely diffusional mechanism, but rather depends on chemical
       interactions with the environment; i.e., they exhibit mixed
       diffusional and transport-dependent mechanisms.
</ol>

A model supported by these experimental results and based on the
CORSOR-Booth code is proposed and compared with CORSOR
calculations. To facilitate the comparison, a model based on FP
diffusion mechanisms that was developed at ORNL and adapted with CEA
experimental data is proposed. This CEA model, as well as CORSOR-Booth
calculations are compared with the ORNL experimental data in a blind
test.
<p>

Additional experimental work is in progress to determine the releases
of nonvolatile FPs and transuranics at temperatures up to fuel melting
as well as FP deposition mechanisms under both oxidizing and reducing
conditions. An effort is made to quantify the dependence of the

<a name="4"><b>Analysis of Loss-of-Coolant Accidents in the High-Flux Isotope Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Mark W. Wendel, David G. Morris, Paul T. Williams</i>
<p>

Loss-of-coolant accident analyses have been completed for the
High-Flux Isotope Reactor safety analysis report. More than 100
simulations have been performed using the RELAP5/MOD2.5 computer
program. The RELAP5 input model used for the simulations is quite
detailed, including 17 parallel channels in the core region, the three
active heat exchanger cells, the pressurizing system, and the
secondary cooling system. Special models are developed to represent
the effects of shrinkage in the primary coolant pressure boundary and
cavitation of the primary coolant pumps. Six locations in the primary
coolant system are selected as pipe break sites to determine the
worst-case scenario. At each of the locations, simulations are
completed for a range of break diameters. The reactor is assumed to
survive the transient as long as the hot-spot heat flux remains below
the flow excursion limit. In addition to the baseline simulations,
extensive parametric simulations are conducted to ensure that the
modeling assumptions used are conservative. For a break diameter of
5.1 cm at any of the six locations in the system, the hot-spot heat
flux remains beneath this limit, and furthermore, no boiling occurs in
the fuel region. A summary table for all results is presented, and
results are discussed in detail for the worst-case 5.1-cm break
scenario.

<a name="5"><b>A Model of Vented Hydrogen Deflagrations in a Containment</b><br></a>
<i>Matthias Heitsch</i>
<p>

Hydrogen release and combustion during severe accident scenarios can
impose considerable loads on the containment structure and internal
components. Either random sources (electric equipment) or spark
igniters installed in the numerous containment rooms may initiate more
or less accelerated deflagrations. To avoid damaging consequences,
different concepts are available, which range from diluting or making
the containment atmosphere inert to the use of igniters and catalytic
recombiners. Spark igniters are used to burn the atmospheric hydrogen
deliberately as early as possible, which means whenever it becomes
flammable.
<p>

A hydrogen deflagration model has been developed that is meant to
estimate the combustion phenomena on a mechanistic basis as part of an
integrated containment code to calculate severe accident sequences in
the containment. It provides temperature and pressure loads resulting
from deflagrations.
<p>

The deflagration model is verified by applying it to specially
designed deflagration experiments that can describe the type of
premixed combustion to be found in nuclear power plant
containments. The results demonstrate the potential of the model to
describe the dynamics of a deflagration quite well. Due to
deficiencies in understanding the nature of flame front growth,
appropriate burning area stretching functions are derived from
available experiments.

<a name="6"><b>Protection from Radioaerosols and Volatile Radionuclides</b><br></a>
<i>Nikolai B. Mikheev, Sergei A. Kulyukhin, Alla N. Kamenskaya, Igor' A. Rumer</i>
<p>

Increasing the safety of nuclear power plants is a problem of the
utmost importance in the nuclear energy industry. Particular attention
is given to severe accidents at nuclear reactors. Although the
probability of these accidents is low (&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>), their
consequences are the most disastrous. Severe accidents result in the
release of tens of thousands of curies of radioactive products into
the area under the containment. Modern protective systems for the
localization of radioactive aerosols and volatile radionuclides are
based mainly on the filtration of gas flow, using various solid and
liquid sorbents. The main principle of these filters is based on the
precipitation of suspended particles on any surface (grids, liquid
drops, or film, fiber, and electrode surfaces). In these processes,
physical phenomena such as gravitation, inertia, diffusion,
electricity, magnetism, and supersonics are used. A disadvantage of
the available systems is that they may not trap radioaerosols
present in the vapor-gas mixture in the form of finely dispersed (much
smaller than 0.1 <img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif" align="bottom">m) hydrophobic particles.
<p>

A new concept of protection from radioaerosols and volatile
radionuclides has been suggested. A basically new method of the
localization of radioactive aerosols and volatile radionuclides is
based on the physicochemical process occurring in the gas phase. The
proposed concept of protection from radioaerosols and volatile fission
products uses unconventional approaches based not on the filtration of
vapor-gas flow but on the extraction of radioaerosols and radioiodine
from them by the formation of mixed micelles with manufactured
hydrophilic aerosols, such as MoO<sub>3</sub> and
NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, and the
cocrystallization of ionic iodine with them. The new concept may be
used for protection from radioaerosols at various types of nuclear
reactors.

<a name="7"><b>A Comparative Risk Assessment for the Russian V213 Power Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Theron D. Marshall, Robert W. Hockenbury, John A. Honey, Lee C. Cadwallader</i>
<p>

Probabilistic risk assessment methodology is applied to generate an
evaluation of the relative likelihood of safe recovery following
selected pressurized water reactor (PWR) design basis accidents for a
Russian V213 nuclear power reactor. U.S.-designed PWRs similar to the
V213 are used for reference and comparison. This V213 risk assessment
is based on comparison analyses of the following aspects: accident
progression event tree success paths for typical PWR accident
initiating events, safety aspects in reactor design, and perceived
performance of reactor safety systems. The four initiating events
considered here were taken from a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
summary report on severe accident risk: loss of offsite power with
station blackout, large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA),
medium-break LOCA, and small-break LOCA.
<p>

The success probabilities for the V213 reaching a non-core-damage
state after the onset of the selected initiating events are calculated
for two scenarios: 
<ol>
  <li type=a> using actual component reliability data from U.S. PWRs
  and
  <li> assuming common component reliability data. U.S. PWR component
       reliability data are used because of the unavailability of such
       data for the V213 at the time of the analyses.
</ol>
While the use of U.S. PWR data in this risk assessment of the V213
does strongly infer V213 comparability to U.S. plants, the risk
assessment using common component reliability does not have such a
stringent limitation and is thus a separate scoping assessment of the
V213 engineered safety systems.  <p>

The results of the analyses suggest that the V213 has certain design
features that significantly improve the reactor's safety margin for
the selected initiating events and that the V213 design has a relative
risk of core damage for selected initiating events that is at least
comparable to U.S. PWRs. It is important to realize that these
analyses are of a scoping nature and may be significantly influenced
by important risk factors such as V213 operator training, quality
control, and maintenance procedures. Additionally, the analyses make
no implications as to the effects of the selected initiating events on
the health and safety of the public.


<h5>NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLES</h5>

<a name="8"><b>Some Computations in Planning Reconstitution of a 500-MW(electric) Fast Breeder Reactor (Metallic) Fuel by Electrorefining</b><br></a>
<i>H. P. Nawada, N. P. Bhat, G. R. Balasubramanian</i>
<p>

To compare and evaluate various fuel cycle options for a
500-MW(electric) fast breeder reactor, the electrorefining process has
been examined for reprocessing spent fuel. Making use of an improved
thermochemical model, optimum process conditions for electrorefining
have been worked out. These conditions are the following: capacity of
the electrorefining cell, number of cells, batch size, feed
adjustments, sequential operations for recovery of uranium and
co-recovery of uranium and plutonium, number of cycles, and time frame
to meet the refueling schedule. The spent fuel is envisaged to undergo
reprocessing in three campaigns: 
<ol>
  <li type=a> the inner core campaign, 
  <li> the outer core campaign, and 
  <li> the blanket and the leftover campaign.
</ol>

Feed adjustments are done by mixing either the spent inner
core or the outer core fuels with the blankets. Three product streams
with required fuel composition for direct refabrication of the inner
core, the outer core, and the blanket fuel subassemblies,
respectively, are obtained by certain sequential electrorefining
operations. These calculations made for a mixed-oxide fuel core can be
easily extended to the metallic core.

to British Nuclear Fuels, Inc., is evaluated and compared with
analytical techniques. The dropped cask was a full-scale storage
cask. Targets included the International Atomic Energy Agency's
``unyielding'' surface and a specially constructed concrete pad

<h5>MATERIALS</h5>

<a name="10"><b>Radioiodine Deposition Losses from Sample Air Containing Particulate and Gaseous Iodine in Nuclear Reactor Sample Lines</b><br></a>
<i>Byung-Soo Lee, William A. Jester</i>
<p>

Mechanisms of radioiodine deposition from sample air containing both
gaseous and particulate radioiodine in reactor sample lines are
studied, and experimental methods are developed. A short half-lived
radioiodine tracer, <sup>128</sup>I (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 25 min), is used
in the chemical forms of molecular iodine and methyl iodide. An effort
is made to investigate the type of particles for particulate
iodine. Of the various types of particles tested, only tobacco smoke
particles have a sufficiently high iodination rate to be used in these
studies. The 609.6-cm (20-ft)-long sample lines of Types 316 and 304
stainless steel tube (2.29 cm i.d.) were tested for the sample flow
rates of 28.3 l/min (1 ft<sup>3</sup>/min) and 56.6
l/min (2 ft<sup>3</sup>/min). In-tube measurements using a
calibrated thin-walled Geiger tube are conducted to determine the
penetration factor and space-dependent deposition velocity profile of
radioiodine. Methyl iodide is not reactive for either the tube
surfaces or aerosol particles. The overall deposition velocity of the
mixture of the smoke particles and molecular iodine is higher than
that of molecular iodine alone for similar sampling conditions. It is
concluded that the high deposition rate of radioiodine in the sample
air mixed with smoke particles and molecular iodine is caused by the
different sample line surfaces that are contaminated with smoke
particles.


<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>

<a name="11"><b>An Analytical Approach to Transient Room Temperature Analysis</b><br></a>
<i>T. Paul Yilmaz, William B. Paschal</i>
<p>

For the past few years, nuclear utilities have been interested in the
calculation of transient room temperatures at various station
locations following loss of heating/ventilating/air conditioning
and/or following station blackout. Transient room temperature analyses
invariably involve the use of computer programs utilizing various
finite difference schemes. A manual solution method is proposed for
room heatup transients, thereby reducing the engineering time spent to
obtain the results from tens (occasionally hundreds) of hours to a few
hours in many cases.

<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>

<a name="12"><b>On the Subcooled Critical Flow Model in RELAP5/MOD3</b><br></a>
<i>W. S. Yeung, J. Shirkov</i>
<p>

An analysis of an anomaly in the subcooled critical flow model in the
RELAP5/MOD3 computer code is presented. Specifically, the code
produces a discontinuity in going from unchoked subcooled liquid flow
(i.e., subsonic flow) to subcooled choked flow (i.e., sonic flow). The
same anomaly has been reported elsewhere. The root cause for this
anomaly has been analyzed, and it is found that the user-supplied
junction loss coefficient and discharge coefficient play an important
role in the occurrence of this anomaly. The analysis is verified by
assessment against a test problem simulating single-phase liquid flow
through a convergent nozzle with a fixed upstream pressure and a
varying downstream pressure. A corrective measure to eliminate the
discontinuity is suggested.

<b><a name="1">Wind Effects on the Performance of the Reactor Vessel
Auxiliary Cooling System</a></b><br>
<i>C. P. Tzanos, A. Hunsbedt</i>
<p>

The performance of the reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system (RVACS)
of a liquid-metal reactor is a function of the pressure difference
between the cooling air inlet and outlet, of the air density variation
along the flow path, and of the pressure loss and heat transfer
characteristics of this path. The pressure difference between the air
inlet and outlet as well as the RVACS inlet temperature may be
affected by wind speed and direction. The objective of this work was
to analyze the effects of wind on the performance of the RVACS of an
advanced liquid metal reactor design based on the PRISM concept. Each
stack of the reference RVACS design had two air inlets. The analysis
showed that one particular wind direction had the most adverse impact
on the RVACS performance. For this direction, in a two-inlet stack
design, the net effect of a 27 m/s (60 mph) wind on the RVACS air flow
would be a reduction of ~15%; while in a four-inlet design, the net
effect would be nearly zero. A 15% reduction in the RVACS airflow
would increase the peak cladding temperature by ~15 <sup>o</sup>C. In
reality, however, the wind direction fluctuates around an average
direction, and the most adverse wind effect should be &lt;15 degrees
C. The temperature at the inlet of the downwind stacks is affected by
the outflow of the upwind stacks, but the effect is small. For an air
temperature change of 164 <sup>o</sup>C along the RVACS flow path, the
maximum inlet temperature rise is ~5 <sup>o</sup>C. This would increase the
peak cladding temperature by ~1 <sup>o</sup>C.  <p>


<b><a name="2">SASSYS/SAS4A-FPIN2 Liquid-Metal Reactor Transient Analysis
Code System for Mechanical Analysis of Metallic Fuel Elements</a></b><br>
<i>Tanju Sofu, John M. Kramer, James E. Cahalan</i>
<p>

The metal fuel version of the FPIN2 fuel element mechanics model has
been incorporated into the SASSYS/SAS4A code system. In this
implementation, SASSYS/SAS4A provides the fuel and cladding
temperatures, and FPIN2 performs the analysis of fuel and cladding
deformation. The FPIN2 results aid in the understanding of accident
progression by providing the estimates of the axial expansion of fuel,
time and location of cladding failure, and the condition of the fuel
at the time of failure. The validation of the integrated
SASSYS/SAS4A-FPIN2 model has been performed using the data from
in-reactor TREAT tests for the prototypic binary and ternary fuels of
the Integral Fast Reactor concept. The integrated model calculations
are compared with available experimental data for the six fuel
elements in these tests, and good agreement is obtained for the key
parameters related to transient behavior of the metallic fast reactor
fuel elements.


<h5>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h5>

<b><a name="3">Use of the Chinshan Plant Analyzer for Analysis of a
Main-Steam-Isolation-Valve-Closure Anticipated Transient Without
Scram</a></b><br>
<i>Shih-Jen Wang, Shih-Hsiin Chang, Ling-Yao Chou</i>
<p>

An anticipated transient without scram induced by main steam isolation
valve closure (AMSIV) could subject a nuclear power plant to the most
severe of accident conditions. The Chinshan plant analyzer contains a
complete boiling water reactor system model and can be revised easily
for the user's purpose. These features make the Chinshan plant
analyzer suitable for AMSIV analysis. The capability of the Chinshan
plant analyzer to analyze an AMSIV is illustrated. An AMSIV is
simulated, and the simulation results are similar to the results of
other research. Furthermore, the AMSIV response of reducing reactor
power by decreasing reactor coolant inventory is simulated, and the
results of the simulation are similar to those of other
research. During this transient, the reactor power is
decreased. However, the margin to core uncovery is also decreased. In
addition, a method of reducing the reactor power by increasing the
feedwater temperature is studied. The mechanism of reducing the !
reactor power is associated with decreasing the inlet
subcooling. Sensitivities of key parameters are also analyzed. A large
negative void coefficient causes an undesirable large peak in the
reactor power. A small recirculation pump moment of inertia decreases
the reactor power.

<b><a name="4">Experience with COSYMA in an International Intercomparison

<i>I. Hasemann, J. A. Jones, J. van der Steen, E. van Wonderen</i>
<p>

The Commission of the European Communities and the Nuclear Energy
Agency of the OECD have organized an international exercise to compare
the predictions of accident consequence assessment codes, and to
identify those features of the models which lead to differences in the
predicted results. Alongside this, a further exercise was undertaken
in which the COSYMA code was used independently by several different
organizations. Some of the findings of the COSYMA users' exercise are
described that have general applications to accident consequence
assessments. A number of areas are identified in which further work on
accident consequence models may be justified. These areas, which are
also of interest for codes other than COSYMA, are (a) the calculation
and averaging of doses and risks to people sheltered in different
types of buildings, particularly with respect to the evaluation of
early health effects; (b) the modeling of long-duration releases and
their description as a series of !  shorter releases; (c)
meteorological sampling for results at a certain location,
specifically for use with trajectory models of atmospheric dispersion;
and (d) aspects of calculating probabilities of consequences at a
point.


<h5>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h5>

<b><a name="5">Thermal Decomposition of Nitrated Tributyl
Phosphate</a></b><br>
<i>Y. Hou, E. K. Barefield, D. W. Tedder, S. I. Abdel-Khalik</i>
<p>

Extended contact between heated mixtures of tri-n-butyl phosphate
(TBP) and aqueous solutions of nitric acid and/or heavy metal nitrate
salts at elevated temperatures can lead to exothermic reactions of
explosive violence. Most solvent extraction operations (e.g., Purex)
are conducted at ambient conditions without heating TBP and have been
performed safely for decades, but several explosions involving TBP
have occurred in the United States, Canada, and the former Soviet
Union. This investigation was undertaken to characterize the products
of thermal decomposition of both single- and two-phase mixtures of
TBP, nitric acid, and water under a variety of conditions. The data
indicate that the extent of reaction and the rate of gaseous product
formation are affected by the presence of Zr<sup>4+</sup>,
distillation compared with reflux conditions, temperature,
water/HNO<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>/TBP ratios, and whether the
decomposition occurs under constant pressure or constan!  t volume
conditions. Higher reaction temperatures accelerate the rate of
decomposition, but the extent of decomposition, as measured by the
quantity of gaseous products, was greater at lower temperatures when
the decomposition was performed under distillation conditions. Higher
gas production occurs under reflux conditions, lower
H<sub>2</sub>O/HNO<sub>3</sub> ratios, and when a separate
water-HNO<sub>3</sub> phase is initially present. The major gaseous
products include N<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and
N<sub>2</sub>O. Measurable amounts of NO<sub>2</sub> were not present
in the final product mixture, although an orange color suggesting the
presence of NO<sub>2</sub> was observed in the early stages of
decomposition. The major liquid products were dibutyl phosphoric acid,
butyl nitrate, and water. Small amounts of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>
carboxylic acids were also present. Because of the small sample sizes
that were employed and the isothermal conditions of the decomposition,
runaway reactions were not observed. Some possiblereaction pathways
are considered.

<i>Leonardo Romero, Luis Moreno, Ivars Neretnieks</i>
<p>

Radionuclides leaking from a damaged canister spread into the clay
surrounding the canister and then migrate through various pathways
into the mobile water in the rock fractures. To quantify uncertainties
regarding the release to the far field, a sensitivity analysis is
performed for variations in the parameters governing the
release. Variations in the size of the damage in the canister, uranium
solubility, sorption capacity of the clay, and hydraulic properties of
the fractured rock nearest to the canister have to be accurately
determined in order to minimize uncertainties in the release.


<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>

<b><a name="7">Two-Phase Flow Instability for Low-Flow Boiling in
Vertical Uniformly Heated Thin Rectangular Channels</a></b><br>
<i>Chang H. Oh, John C. Chapman</i>
<p>

Flow experiment and analysis were performed to determine flow
instability condition in a single thin vertical rectangular flow
channel (1.98 mm in channel gap, 50.8 mm in width, and 121.92 or 60.96
cm in heated height), which represents one of the Advanced Test
Reactor's inner coolant channels between fuel plates. The maximum
surface heat flux and flow rate are 159.8 kW/m<sup>2</sup> and 462.5
kg/s<img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif"
align=absmiddle>m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, which simulates decay
heat removal from the single heated surface of the Advanced Test
Reactor. The tests are conducted at atmospheric and subatmospheric
pressure, simulating expected conditions during a hypothetical
loss-of-coolant accident.  <p>

The precursor of the flow instability [the point of net void
generation and the onset of flow instability (OFI) defined by Saha and
Zuber] was compared, and the OFI map (power density versus minimum
mass flux at OFI) was developed in this study.

<b><a name="8">A Passive System for Long-Term Heat Removal in Advanced
Light Water Reactors: Prototype Test Results and Analysis</a></b><br>
<i>Luca Galbiati, Luigi Mazzocchi, Paolo Vanini</i>
<p>

The simplified boiling water reactor makes use of an isolation
condenser (IC) submerged in a large water pool; following a postulated
accident, the pool water boils off, releasing steam to the atmosphere
and ensuring passive containment cooling for at least 3 days. A
further improvement is the isolation condenser pool cooling system
(ICPCS), proposed by ENEL/CISE. It makes use of reflux condensing heat
exchangers directly connected to the pool gas space of the IC;
noncondensable gases can be vented during the earlier phase of
operation by means of a water seal mechanism operating in a passive
way. The expected benefits from the ICPCS are the elimination of
constraints on the ``grace period'' duration and the possibility of
avoiding an extended release of a visible and potentially radioactive
steam plume.
<p>

To verify the performance both at component and system level, an
instrumented ICPCS prototype, operating with a thermal power scaling
factor of ~1:615, has been built and tested at
CISE laboratories, both in steady and dynamic conditions. The
experimental results confirm the capability of the tested ICPCS module
to operate in a safe and passive way.

<i>Chien Chung, Chin-Hsuen Tsai</i>
<p>

A method to monitor in situ the dose rate from the gaseous
radionuclide <sup>41</sup>Ar is developed using a portable gamma-ray
spectrometer. A high-purity germanium detector with a sensitivity of
0.358 nSv/h per count per minute is used to calibrate 1294-keV gamma
rays emitted from radioactive <sup>41</sup>Ar. Field measurements are
conducted both inside and outside of the containment of a nuclear
reactor during full-power operation, and iso-dose rate contour curves
are mapped. The in situ measurement can be readily performed at
various locations near a nuclear reactor with a 14-kg portable
spectrometric unit. The detection limit for a 1-h counting period is
as low as 0.35 nSv/h for the gaseous <sup>41</sup>Ar. One can use the
method and field measurements developed in this research to
quantitatively determine the gaseous fission products of krypton and
xenon dispersed from a nuclear power plant.

<b><a name="10">Optimization of Standby Safety System Maintenance
Schedules in Nuclear Power Plants</a></b><br>
<i>Mohammad Harunuzzaman, Tunc Aldemir</i>
<p>

A methodology and a computational scheme are developed based on
dynamic programming (DP) to find the minimum cost maintenance schedule
for nuclear power plant standby safety systems. Surveillance and
testing are assumed to return the component to as-good-as-new
condition whether accompanied by restorative maintenance only or full
repair or replacement. The methodology defines component state as the
number of unsurveilled and untested maintenance intervals or stages,
and the optimization process is decomposed into (a) feasibility
screening and (b) DP search. This approach achieves a significant
reduction in the state space over which the DP search is to be
performed. The application of the scheme is demonstrated on the
ten-component high-pressure injection system of a pressurized water
reactor. This demonstration indicates that the scheme is viable and
efficient and particularly suited to exploit any economies of scale
and scope that may be present.

<b><a name="11">Multiple-Failure Signal Validation in Nuclear Power
Plants Using Artificial Neural Networks</a></b><br>
<i>Paolo F. Fantoni, Alessandro Mazzola</i>
<p>

The possibility of using a neural network to validate process signals
during normal and abnormal plant conditions is explored. In boiling
water reactor plants, signal validation is used to generate reliable
thermal limits calculation and to supply reliable inputs to other
computerized systems that support the operator during accident
scenarios. The way that autoassociative neural networks can promptly
detect faulty process signal measurements and produce a best estimate
of the actual process values even in multifailure situations is
shown. A method was developed to train the network for multiple
sensor-failure detection, based on a random failure simulation
algorithm. Noise was artificially added to the input to evaluate the
network's ability to respond in a very low signal-to-noise ratio
environment. Training and test data sets were simulated by the
real-time transient simulator code APROS.

<h5>FISSION REACTORS</h5>

<b><a name="12">Modified Conversion Ratio Measurement in Light
Water-Moderated UO<sub>2</sub> Lattices</a></b><br>
<i>Ken Nakajima, Masanori Akai</i>
<p>

To investigate the accuracy of the neutronic calculations in various
neutron spectra, the modified conversion ratios [(MCR): ratio of
<sup>238</sup>U capture rate-to-total fission rate] of four kinds of
light water-moderated UO<sub>2</sub> fuel lattices were measured. In
the measurements, the relative reaction rates of <sup>238</sup>U
capture and total fission were obtained from the nondestructive
gamma-ray spectrometry of <sup>239</sup>Np and <sup>143</sup>Ce,
respectively, which accumulated in the fuel rod irradiated at the
Tank-Type Critical Assembly. The moderator-to-fuel volume ratios
V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>f</sub> of the measured lattices were 1.50
(undermoderate) to 3.00 (overmoderate). The measured MCRs were 0.477
<img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif>
0.014(V<sub>m</sub>/V<sub>f</sub> = 1.50), 0.434 <img
src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 0.013(1.83),
0.383 <img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif>
0.011(2.48), and 0.356 <img
src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 0.011(3.00),
respectively.
<p>

The Monte Carlo calculation employing the JENDL-3 library showed good
agreement with the experiments for all the cores, although they showed
a tendency of overestimation for larger values of MCR, as shown in the
case of UO<sub>2</sub> tight lattices. Therefore, it was concluded
that, for the cores investigated, the accuracy of the neutronic
calculation method currently used was very good.

<a name=0><b>Verification and Implications of the Multiple-Pin Treatment in the SASSYS-1 Liquid-Metal Reactor Systems Analysis Code</b><br></a>
<i>Floyd E. Dunn</i>
<p>

As part of a program to obtain realistic, as opposed to excessively
conservative, analysis of reactor transients, a multiple-pin treatment
for the analysis of intrasubassembly thermal hydraulics has been
included in the SASSYS-1 liquid-metal reactor systems analysis
code. This new treatment has made possible a whole new level of
verification for the code. The code can now predict the steady-state
and transient responses of individual thermocouples within
instrumented subassemblies in a reactor rather than just predicting
average temperatures for a subassembly. Very good agreement has been
achieved between code predictions and the experimental measurements of
steady-state and transient temperatures and flow rates in the shutdown
heat removal tests in the Experimental Breeder Reactor II
(EBR-II). Detailed multiple-pin calculations for blanket subassemblies
in the EBR-II demonstrate that the actual steady-state and transient
peak temperatures in these subassemblies are significantly lower
than those that would be calculated by simpler models.

<h5>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h5>

<p>
<a name=1><b>Preliminary Accident Analysis to Support a Passive Depressurization System Design</b><br></a>
<i>Roberto Lenti, Luigi Mansani, Gianfranco Saiu</i>
<p>

The new generation of evolutionary nuclear power plants, e.g., the
Westinghouse AP600 and the General Electric simplified boiling water
reactor, relies on a full reactor coolant system (RCS)
depressurization to allow gravity injection from an in-containment
tank and thereby assure long-term core cooling. Studies performed to
support the licensing process and design of both evolutionary and
innovative reactors have shown that cold water injection may, under
particular plant conditions, induce a large plant depressurization.
<p>

Preliminary studies have been performed to support the design of a
passive injection and depressurization system (PIDS) based on the idea
of depressurizing the RCS by mixing cold water with the RCS hot water
and inducing steam condensation in the primary system. The analyses,
performed with the RELAP5/MOD3 computer code, show the response of a
typical midsize pressurized water reactor plant [two loops, 600
MW(electric)] equipped with the PIDS.
<p>

Different RCS injection locations including pressurizer, vessel upper
head, and hot leg, and actuation at different residual reactor coolant
masses have been investigated. Several factors, including RCS mixing,
RCS residual mass at PIDS actuation, PIDS injection flow rate, and
steam generator conditions, have been shown to affect the plant
depressurization.
<p>

The PIDS performance has also been verified against the following
reference severe accident scenarios: (a) complete station blackout
event, and (b) a small-break loss-of-coolant accident and concomitant
station blackout event.
<p>

Preliminary experimental activities to support the PIDS concept have
already been performed. Additional experimental activities, including
integrated system tests, have been planned to support system
development and computer code validation.


<p>
<a name=2><b>A Probabilistic Risk Assessment-Related Methodology to Support Performance-Based Regulation Within the Nuclear Power Industry</b><br></a>
<i>Renee M. DuBord, Michael W. Golay, Norman C. Rasmussen</i>
<p>

Maintenance and inspection costs at nuclear power plants consume a
large portion of a utility's resources. The stresses of commercial
competition make better resource allocation for such procedures
vital. A nuclear power plant's probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is
an excellent source of information about the safety importance of
various plant systems, structures, and components. As both the nuclear
power industry and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission begin to
focus attention on the use of performance-based regulation, it is
important to find how best to put a nuclear power plant's PRA to work
in prioritizing maintenance and inspection resources.
<p>

In light of these concerns, two ratios were developed to compare the
risk significance of individual components to the amount of plant
staff time, or burden, associated with inspecting the component. These
risk-to-burden ratios point out existing disparities between
inspection practices and safety concerns. These ratios can be used to
develop new inspection schedules constituting a more equitable
risk-to-burden distribution.


<p>
<a name=3><b>Risk Assessment for Spent-Fuel Pool Cooling at Boiling Water Reactors</b><br></a>
<i>Truong V. Vo, Timothy M. Mitts, Tyrone R. Blackburn, Hanh K. Phan</i>
<p>

A risk assessment of potential events at Susquehanna Steam Electric
Station (SSES) is described wherein a loss of cooling occurs in a
spent-fuel pool (SFP). This evaluation was performed as part of the
evaluation of potential generic issue 93-01, regarding the safety
impact of incidents involving the loss of SFP cooling (SFPC). The
analysis investigates allegations and concerns identified in a Title
10, Part 21 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR 21) report filed by
two former contract employees, who alleged that SSES has design
deficiencies associated with SFPC that make it susceptible to unsafe
conditions. The evaluation estimates the likelihood of a loss-of-SFPC
event at SSES and the associated probability of the SFP heating up to
near-boiling conditions. The evaluation also includes an assessment
for such near-boiling events for their contribution to core damage and
an estimate of order-of-magnitude core damage frequency.
<p>

The analysis addresses SSES plant conditions that existed prior to the
10 CFR 21 report and also current plant conditions. Data for this
analysis were obtained from the SSES licensee and from other relevant
data sources, including probabilistic risk assessment
information. Background for the evaluations performed, the methodology
used in the evaluation, the data and modeling used for the analyses,
the analysis techniques and results, and conclusions are presented.

<a name=4><b>Preparation of Transuranium Fuel and Target Materials for the Transmutation of Actinides by Gel Coconversion</b><br></a>
<i>Guido Ledergerber, Franz Ingold, Richard W. Stratton, Hans-Peter Alder, Claude Prunier, Dominique Warin, Mireille Bauer</i>
<p>

In the fabrication of fuel containing transuranium (TRU) elements,
flow sheets and techniques that allow a shielded and/or remote
fabrication will probably need to be applied. One approach, which has
been demonstrated on the laboratory and semiprototype scale, is the
wet fabrication route of coprecipitation of the matrix element uranium
mixed with plutonium to form either dense spherical particles or to
produce hybrid pellets made from pressed gel microspheres. The ceramic
material produced holds the TRU elements homogeneously distributed in
the matrix.
<p>

In conjunction with the Departement d'Etudes des Combustibles of the
French Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique in Cadarache, France, the
Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland is further developing a mixed
nitride ceramic and mixed oxide with high concentrations (up to 50%)
of plutonium with the aim of a joint irradiation test of TRU elements
in the French Phenix reactor.


<p>
<a name=5><b>Computer Modeling of Single-Cell and Multicell Thermionic Fuel Elements</b><br></a>
<i>Jeffrey W. Dickinson, Andrew C. Klein</i>
<p>

Modeling efforts are undertaken to perform coupled thermal-hydraulic
and thermionic analysis for both single-cell and multicell thermionic
fuel elements (TFE). The analysis---and the resulting MCTFE computer
code (multicell thermionic fuel element)---is a steady-state finite
volume model specifically designed to analyze cylindrical TFEs. It
employs an iterative successive overrelaxation solution technique to
solve for the temperatures throughout the TFE and a coupled thermionic
routine to determine the total TFE performance. The calculated results
include temperature distributions in all regions of the TFE, axial
interelectrode voltages and current densities, and total TFE
electrical output parameters including power, current, and
voltage. MCTFE-generated results compare experimental data from the
single-cell Topaz-II-type TFE and multicell data from the General
Atomics 3H5 TFE to benchmark the accuracy of the code methods.

<a name=6><b>Criticality Safety Strategy and Analysis Summary for the Fuel Cycle Facility Electrorefiner at Argonne National Laboratory West</b><br></a>
<i>Robert D. Mariani, Robert W. Benedict, Richard M. Lell, Ronald B. Turski, Edward K. Fujita</i>
<p>

As part of the termination activities of Experimental Breeder Reactor
II (EBR-II) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) West, the spent
metallic fuel from EBR-II will be treated in the fuel cycle facility
(FCF). A key component of the spent-fuel treatment process in the FCF
is the electrorefiner (ER) in which the actinide metals are separated
from the active metal fission products and the reactive bond
sodium. In the electrorefining process, the metal fuel is anodically
dissolved into a high-temperature molten salt, and refined uranium or
uranium/plutonium products are deposited at cathodes.
<p>

The criticality safety strategy and analysis for the ANL West FCF ER
is summarized. The FCF ER operations and processes formed the basis
for evaluating criticality safety and control during actinide metal
fuel refining. To show criticality safety for the FCF ER, the
reference operating conditions for the ER had to be defined. Normal
operating envelopes (NOEs) were then defined to bracket the important
operating conditions. To keep the operating conditions within their
NOEs, process controls were identified that can be used to regulate
the actinide forms and content within the ER. A series of operational
checks were developed for each operation that will verify the extent
or success of an operation. The criticality analysis considered the ER
operating conditions at their NOE values as the point of departure for
credible and incredible failure modes. As a result of the analysis,
FCF ER operations were found to be safe with respect to criticality.

<h5>RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT</h5>

<p>
<a name=7><b>Near-Field and Far-Field Migration of Radionuclides from a Shallow Land Burial Facility</b><br></a>
<i>R. N. Nair, T. M. Krishnamoorthy</i>
<p>

Mathematical models have been developed to predict the spatial and
temporal profiles of radionuclide concentration in the near field and
far field of a shallow land burial facility. The disposal facility
considered is a reinforced concrete vault located 2.9 m above the
water table. The source term is derived from leaching considerations
based on diffusion-controlled kinetics for the transfer of
radionuclides from the cylindrical waste form into the surrounding
pore water of the backfill material. The concentration of
radionuclides in the backfill at the bottom boundary of the vault is
converted to a release rate into the near field using the outgoing
water flux. The delay and decay during transit in the sand and soil
layers are taken into account while evaluating the concentration and
release at the near field-water table boundary. Using this release
rate as the inlet flux, the concentration of radionuclides in the
groundwater has been computed using a two-dimensional model. Results
indicate that the vault facility with cement as the backfill material
could contain almost all the radionuclides commonly encountered in the
waste stream generated during the operation of nuclear power
plants. However, the storage of some of the long-lived radionuclides
produced in fuel reprocessing plants such as <sup>79</sup>Se,
<sup>99</sup>Tc, and <sup>129</sup>I in the vault facility need to be
regulated for restricting the resultant dose within the apportioned
dose limit prescribed for the facility.

<a name=8><b>Formation of Hot Particles During the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident</b><br></a>
<i>Valery A. Kashparov, Yuri A. Ivanov, Sergey I. Zvarisch, Valentin P. Protsak, Yuri V. Khomutinin, Alexander D. Kurepin, Edvard M. Pazukhin</i>
<p>

The oxidation of irradiated Chernobyl nuclear fuel at 670 to 1170K for
3 to 21 h resulted in its destruction into fine particles, the
dispersal composition of which is well described by lognormal
distribution regularity. The median radius of the formed particles
does not depend on the annealing temperature and decreases with the
increase of the annealing period from 10 to 3 <img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m. Proceeding from
the dispersal composition and matrix composition of the Chernobyl hot
fuel particles, it can be concluded that the oxidation of nuclear fuel
was one of the basic mechanisms of hot fuel particle formation during
the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
<p>

With oxidation in air and the dispersal of irradiated oxide nuclear
fuel at as low as 670K, ruthenium, located on the granular borders, is
released. Ruthenium is oxidized to volatile RuO<sub>4</sub>,
sublimated, and condensed on materials of iron. Nickel and stainless
steel can be efficiently used at high temperatures (tested to 1200K)
for radioruthenium adsorption in accidents and for some technological
operations. As the temperature of hot fuel particles annealed in inert
media increases from 1270 to 2270K, the relative release of
radionuclides increases in the following sequence: cesium isotopes;
europium isotopes; cerium isotopes; americium isotopes; and ruthenium,
plutonium, and curium isotopes.


<p>
<a name=9><b>Investigation of <sup>14</sup>C Release in an Engineered Low-Level Waste Disposal Facility</b><br></a>
<i>Man-Sung Yim, Scott A. Simonson, Terry M. Sullivan</i>
<p>

Atmospheric releases of <sup>14</sup>C from a generic engineered
low-level waste (LLW) disposal facility and its radiological impacts
are investigated. A computer model that describes microbial gas
generation and the transport has been developed and used to analyze
the generation of <sup>14</sup>C contaminated gases and subsequent
migration in a facility. Models are based on a chemical kinetic
description of aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of organic
materials coupled with attending models of oxygen transport and
consumption within waste containers in a facility. Effects of
radiolysis on gas generation are addressed based on the estimated dose
rate for class B and C wastes.

Estimates predict that annual atmospheric release of <sup>14</sup>C
due to atmospheric pressure variations could range between ~2.6 x
10<sup>8</sup> and 5.5 x 10<sup>11</sup> Bq as a result of microbial
gas generation based on a volume of 48000 m<sup>3</sup> LLW disposed
in a facility. The associated dose to a maximally exposed individual
is estimated to be dominated by ingestion pathway and strongly depends
on the fraction of the food imported from an uncontaminated outside
area. Dose rates are expected to be &lt;0.04 mSv/yr, considering a
reasonable distance between the facility and the exposed
population. The depletion through airborne releases of <sup>14</sup>C
inventory that is available for transport through other pathways is
not expected to be a significant issue.

<a name=0><b>Analytic Initialization of Nonequilibrium Iodine and Xenon Distributions for Core Transient Simulation</b><br></a>
<i>Jae Seung Song, Nam Zin Cho, Byung Ho Lee, Sung Quun Zee</i>
<p>

In a core transient simulation, the initial condition of the
simulation should be consistent with the real core state. The initial
iodine and xenon distributions, which cannot be measured in the core,
have significant effects on the transient with xenon dynamics of a
pressurized water reactor. In simulating the transient starting from a
nonequilibrium xenon state, accurate initialization of the
nonequilibrium iodine and xenon distribution is essential to predict
the core transient behavior. An initialization method that uses the
iodine and xenon states to predict a core transient starting from a
nonequilibrium xenon condition is developed through the analytical
treatment of the relationship between power and the iodine and xenon
distributions. An application of this method is provided by simulating
a transient in the start-up test of Yonggwang Unit 3.


<h4>NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY</h4>
<p>

<a name=1><b>A Formal Approach for Quantitative Treatment of Modeling Uncertainties in Safety Analysis</b><br></a>
<i>Kwang-Il Ahn, Young-Ho Jin</i>
<p>

In a probabilistic safety assessment for nuclear power plants, an
important issue is the treatment and quantification of the
uncertainties involved in each step of the system safety or accident
analysis. There are two main types of uncertainties that should be
explicitly considered in the analysis, i.e., parameter uncertainties
contained in the model describing the behavior of real systems or
accidents, and modeling uncertainties due to the imperfect description
of the model itself. The latter case indicates a representation of
imprecision in the analyst's knowledge about models or their
predictions. Although the field of uncertainty analysis has progressed
to the point that several studies have been carried out that maintain
a distinction between parameter and model uncertainty, in recent
times, the model uncertainty analysis has indeed been less complete
than that of the former type. However, there are important advantages
to explicit consideration of the modeling uncertainty in risk
analysis. The most imp ortant advantage is that it mitigates the
overconfidence that can occur when a single model is used to make
predictions since uncertainty bounds tend to be more realistic when a
range of plausible models is considered. The second advantage is that
it facilitates scientific communication because scientifically
defensible analyses that explicitly incorporate a range of models
obviate the problem of arguing over whose model is correct. The third
advantage is the enhancement of credibility in the predictions or
final outcomes. For these reasons, the modeling uncertainty should be
incorporated into the current context of uncertainty analysis. A
formal approach on the expression of highly uncertain models and its
assessment within a probabilistic framework are provided. The basic
idea of the current procedure is that the quantification of modeling
uncertainties can be made by combining all the uncertainties assigned
to alternative models into a probability distribution (or a family of
probability distributions) about a particular result of interest, conditional on all the modeling assumptions that have been made in the analysis.

<a name=2><b>Investigation of System Responses of the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant to the Loss of Residual Heat Removal During Midloop Operation Using a RELAP5/MOD3 Simulation</b><br></a>
<i>Yuh-Ming Ferng, Shau-Shei Ma</i>
<p>

Because several abnormal incidents involving the loss of the residual
heat removal (RHR) system during refueling and maintenance outages
have occurred in pressurized water reactors, the importance of
investigating the physical phenomena with respect to these events has
been recognized. RHR cooling is a major means to remove core decay
heat after a reactor power plant shutdown. If the RHR system is lost
and an alternate means for heat removal cannot be established in time,
the core will boil off, and the primary system will be pressurized,
which potentially results in uncovering of the fuel rods and failure
of the temporary boundaries. The objective of this paper is to
simulate the Maanshan nuclear power plant (MNPP) responses to the loss
of the RHR system during midloop operation under variable outage
conditions. Without gravity feed, the current investigation
concentrates on the effects of different liquid levels, the existence
of vents, and the number of active steam generators.
<p>

Based on the simulated results, the total heat removal capability of
one active steam generator and the pressurizer venting process is
sufficient to remove core decay heat of 11.1 MW, which corresponds to
the power level 3 days after plant shutdown, in the event that RHR
cooling fails during midloop operation. The primary system will be
stabilized, and the pressure throughout the transient will not exceed
the design pressure of the nozzle dams or the temporary seals. The
heat removal capability of the pressurizer vent plays a crucial role
in system pressurization during loss of RHR and in the severity of
this event, as shown by the calculated results of the open and closed
MNPP, respectively. If only one or two active steam generators serve
as an alternate cooling means, the increased pressure will exceed the
design criteria of the temporary low-pressure boundaries. Then, for
the closed conditions of MNPP, the loss-of-RHR event during midloop
operation has the potential to induce another loss-of-coolant acci
dent and to cause more serious consequences.

<i>Rajesh K. Ahluwalia, Howard K. Geyer</i>
<p>

The GC computer code has been developed for flow sheet simulation of
pyrochemical processing of spent nuclear fuel. It utilizes a robust
algorithm SLG for analyzing simultaneous chemical reactions between
species distributed across many phases. Models have been developed for
analysis of the oxide fuel reduction process, salt recovery by
electrochemical decomposition of lithium oxide, uranium separation
from the reduced fuel by electrorefining, and extraction of fission
products into liquid cadmium. The versatility of GC is demonstrated by
applying the code to a flow sheet of current interest.

<a name=5><b>Treatment of Simulated High-Level Radioactive Waste with Formic Acid: Bench-Scale Study on Hydrogen Evolution</b><br></a>
<i>Chia-Lin W. Hsu, James A. Ritter</i>
<p>

At the Savannah River Site, the Defense Waste Processing Facility
(DWPF) was constructed to vitrify high-level radioactive liquid waste
in borosilicate glass for permanent storage. Formic acid, which serves
as both an acid and a reducing agent, is used to treat the washed
alkaline sludge during melter feed preparation primarily to improve
the processability of the feed and to reduce mercury to its zero state
for steam stripping. The high-level sludge is composed of many
transition metal hydroxides. Among them, there are small quantities of
platinum group metals such as ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium that
are fission products. During the treatment of simulated sludge with
formic acid, significant amounts of hydrogen were generated when the
platinum group metals were included in the sludge. Apparently the
noble metals in the sludge were reduced to their zero states and
caused formic acid to decompose catalytically into hydrogen and carbon
dioxide, usually with an induction period. The production of hydrogen
gas presented the DWPF with a safety issue. Therefore, the objective
of this research was to gain a fundamental understanding of what
controlled the hydrogen evolution so that a practical solution to the
safety issue could be obtained.
<p>

A bench-scale parametric study revealed the following: increasing the
amount of formic acid added to the sludge increased the hydrogen
generation rate dramatically; once the catalysts were activated, the
hydrogen generation rate decreased significantly with a lowering of
the temperature of the sludge; the relative catalytic activities of
the noble metals in the sludge decreased in the following order:
rhodium > ruthenium >> palladium; ammonium ions were generated
catalytically from the reaction between formic acid and nitrate; and
when present, the noble metals caused higher upward drifts of the
sludge pH. Based on these bench-scale results, in conjunction with a
pilot-scale study, a forced air purge and hydrogen monitoring system,
along with a temperature controlled safety shutdown algorithm, were
developed.

<a name=6><b>Efficient Modeling of Reactive Transport Phenomena by a Multispecies Random Walk Coupled to Chemical Equilibrium</b><br></a>
<i>Wilfried Pfingsten</i>
<p>

Reactive transport is modeled by the sequentially coupled code MCOTAC
that couples one-dimensional advective, dispersive, and diffusive
transport with chemical equilibrium complexation and
precipitation/dissolution reactions in a porous medium. Transport,
described by a random walk of multispecies particles, and chemical
equilibrium calculations are solved separately, coupled only by an
exchange term. The modular-structured code was applied to incongruent
dissolution of hydrated silicate gels, to movement of multiple solid
front systems, and to an artificial, numerically difficult
heterogeneous redox problem. These applications show promising
features with respect to applicability to relevant problems and
possibilities of extensions.

<a name=7><b>A Comparison of (Th,Pu)O<sub>2</sub> and UO<sub>2</sub> Fuels as Waste Forms for Direct Disposal</b><br></a>
<i>Peter Taylor, William H. Hocking, Lawrence H. Johnson, Roderick J. McEachern, Sham Sunder</i>
<p>

Issues relevant to the performance of irradiated (Th,Pu)O<sub>2</sub>
as a waste form for geological disposal are briefly reviewed. Fuels of
this type are among those being considered for burning plutonium from
dismantled nuclear weapons in power reactors, including Canada
deuterium uranium (CANDU) systems. The high chemical stability and low
aqueous solubility of thoria make this type of fuel attractive as a
waste form. In contrast with UO<sub>2</sub> fuel, the inertness of
thoria to oxidation dominates most of the chemical issues of fuel
disposal. The overall performance of a thoria-based fuel waste form is
likely to be determined by the ``instant'' release of the gap
inventories of mobile fission products such as <sup>129</sup>I. This in
turn will be controlled largely by the in-reactor power history and
probably also by details of fuel fabrication. Limited experience with
thoria-based fuels [chiefly (Th,U)O<sub>2</sub>] indicates that, for
given power and burnup levels, gas releases can be substantially l
ower than with UO<sub>2</sub> fuels. The gap and grain-boundary
inventories of fission products are expected to be correspondingly
low. A fabrication route involving molecular-level mixing (e.g.,
sol-gel process) would be preferable to powder blending, because
microscopic heterogeneities in the fuel might adversely affect the
retention of fission products. Pilot-scale irradiation,
postirradiation examination, and leaching studies are required to
support this preliminary assessment. Other issues that need to be
addressed include impurity specifications (to minimize formation of
long-lived activation products) and criticality and safeguards issues
that might influence the design of fuel-handling facilities.

<i>Louis M. Shotkin</i>
<p>

A review is provided of the reasons why the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission needs thermal-hydraulic system computer codes, the
assumptions and approximations contained within these codes, and the
reasons why test data are required to assess the accuracy of the
codes. Specific examples of codes and test programs are given. The use
of computer codes assessed against data from scaled test facilities to
predict the full-scale plant response is discussed. A method to help
focus resources and the need for quantifying code uncertainties are
discussed.

<a name=9><b>Failure-Dependent Test, Repair, and Shutdown Strategies: Reducing the Impact of Common-Cause Failures</b><br></a>
<i>Stanislav P. Uryasev, Pranab K. Samanta</i>
<p>

Failure-dependent testing implies a test of redundant components (or
trains) when the failure of one component has been detected. The
purpose of such testing is to detect any common-cause failures (CCFs)
of multiple components so that a corrective action, such as repair or
plant shutdown, can be taken to reduce the residence time of multiple
failures. This type of testing focuses on reducing the conditional
risk of CCFs. Formulas are developed for calculating the conditional
failure probability of a two-train system with different test, repair,
and shutdown strategies. A methodology is presented, with an example
calculation, showing the risk effectiveness of failure-dependent
strategies for emergency diesel generators in nuclear power
plants. Four alternative actions after the identification of a failure
of one component are analyzed: (a) not carrying out any additional
testing, (b) testing the redundant components and shutting down the
plant if a CCF is present, (c) emergency repair of the failed
component in a given time (less than the allowed outage time), and (d)
additional testing of redundant components after the repair of the
failed component.

<a name=10><b>Exposure Buildup Factors of UO<sub>2</sub> Using the Monte Carlo Method</b><br></a>
<i>Ahmet Bozkurt, Nicholas Tsoulfanidis</i>
<p>

When the gamma dose rate around an irradiated nuclear reactor fuel
element is calculated, it is important to know the attenuating
characteristics of the fuel element itself, one of them being the
buildup factor. Exposure buildup factors of uranium dioxide
(UO<sub>2</sub>) for ten gamma-ray energies (0.050 to 10.0 MeV) have
been computed for ten material thicknesses (0.5 to 10.0 mean free
paths) using the MCNP code. The accuracy of the MCNP model was checked
by computing the buildup factors of oxygen and uranium and comparing
these results with the data given in the literature for these
elements. The results indicate that the UO<sub>2</sub> exposure
buildup factors, for the energies and distances studied, are close to
those of uranium.

<a name=0><b>Advanced Neutron Source Enrichment Study</b><br></a>
<i>Robert A. Bari, Hans Ludewig, John R. Weeks</i>
<p>

A study has been performed of the impact on performance of using
low-enriched uranium (20% <sup>235</sup>U) or medium-enriched uranium
(35% <sup>235</sup>U) as an alternative fuel for the Advanced Neutron
Source, which was initially designed to use uranium enriched to 93%
<sup>235</sup>U. Higher fuel densities and larger volume cores were
evaluated at the lower enrichments in terms of impact on neutron flux,
safety, safeguards, technical feasibility, and cost. The feasibility
of fabricating uranium silicide fuel at increasing material density
was specifically addressed by a panel of international experts on
research reactor fuels. The most viable alternative designs for the
reactor at lower enrichments were identified and discussed. Several
sensitivity analyses were performed to gain an understanding of the
performance of the reactor at parametric values of power, fuel
density, core volume, and enrichment that were interpolations between
the boundary values imposed on the study or extrapolations from
known technology.

<a name=1><b>Method and Results of Safety Evaluation of the High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Shigeaki Nakagawa, Kazuhiko Kunitomi, Kazuhiro Sawa</i>
<p>

A modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) is expected to
be one of the best energy sources in the near future because it can
supply high-temperature heat and have high thermal efficiency and
sufficient safety features. The safety evaluation of the future MHTGR
should be performed based on the experience obtained from the safety
evaluation of the High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor
(HTTR). The safety evaluation of the HTTR was performed considering
the specific safety design features of the HTGR and is applicable to
the future MHTGR. Before the detailed safety evaluation of the future
MHTGR, the safety evaluation method and results of the HTTR should be
reviewed, and newly established acceptance criteria and methods for
selecting evaluation events must be clarified.
<p>

This paper describes in detail the method and results of the safety
evaluation of the HTTR.

<a name=2><b>Thermal Bonding of Light Water Reactor Fuel Using Nonalkaline Liquid-Metal Alloy</b><br></a>
<i>Richard F. Wright, James S. Tulenko, Glen J. Schoessow, Richard G. Connell, Jr., Mark A. Dubecky, Thad Adams</i>
<p>

Light water reactor (LWR) fuel performance is limited by thermal and
mechanical constraints associated with the design, fabrication, and
operation of fuel in a nuclear reactor. These limits define the
lifetime of the fuel, the maximum power at which the fuel can be
operated, the probability of fuel structural failure over the fuel
lifetime, and the transient performance of the fuel during an
accident. A technique is explored that extends fuel performance by
thermally bonding LWR fuel with a nonalkaline liquid-metal
alloy. Current LWR fuel rod designs consist of enriched uranium oxide
fuel pellets enclosed in a zirconium alloy cylindrical clad. The space
between the pellets and the clad is filled by an inert gas (typically
helium). Because of the low thermal conductivity of the gas, the gas
space thermally insulates the fuel pellets from the reactor coolant
outside the fuel rod, elevating the fuel temperatures.
<p>

Filling the gap between the fuel and clad with a high-conductivity
liquid metal thermally ``bonds'' the fuel to the cladding and
eliminates the large temperature change across the gap while
preserving the expansion and pellet-loading capabilities. The
resultant lower fuel temperature has a direct impact on fuel
performance limit margins and also on core transient performance.
<p>

The application of liquid-bonding techniques to LWR fuel is explored
to increase LWR fuel performance and safety. A modified version of the
ESCORE fuel performance code (ESBOND) is developed to analyze the
in-reactor performance of the liquid-metal- bonded fuel. An assessment
of the technical feasibility of this concept for LWR fuel is
presented, including the results of research into materials
compatibility testing and the predicted lifetime performance of
liquid-bonded LWR fuel. The results show that liquid-bonded boiling
water reactor peak fuel temperatures are 400<sup>o</sup>F lower at
beginning of life and 200<sup>o</sup>F lower at end of life compared
with conventional fuel.

<p>

The tertiary pyridine-type anion-exchange resin has been synthesized
for the treatment of spent nuclear fuels and high-level radioactive
waste. This resin, with a uniform diameter of 60 <img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m, is
mechanically strong enough and shows no swelling or shrinking
regardless of its chemical forms. Systematic analysis was made of the
adsorption selectivities of the resin in HCl solutions for a number of
cations that exist in spent fuels, such as uranium and fission product
elements. The results indicate that the resin is suitable to be used
for the treatment of spent fuels and high-level radioactive waste.

<p>

Potential routes to autocatalytic criticality in geologic repositories
are systematically assessed. If highly enriched uranium (HEU) or
<sup>239</sup>Pu are transported and deposited in concentrations
similar to natural uranium ore, in principle, criticality can
occur. For some hypothesized critical configurations, removal of a
small fraction of pore water provides a positive feedback mechanism
that can lead to supercriticality. Rock heating and homogenization for
these configurations can also significantly increase reactivity. At
Yucca Mountain, it is highly unlikely that these configurations can
occur; plutonium transport would occur primarily as colloids and
deposit over short distances. HEU solute can move large distances in
the Yucca Mountain setting; its ability to precipitate into critical
configurations is unlikely because of a lack of active reducing
agents. Appropriate engineering of the waste form and the repository
can reduce any remaining probability of criticality.

<p>

The broad beam facility (BBF) at the Brookhaven Medical Research
Reactor (BMRR) can provide a thermal neutron beam with flux intensity
and quality comparable to the beam currently used for research on
neutron capture therapy using cell-culture and small-animal
irradiations. Monte Carlo computations were made, first, to compare
with the dosimetric measurements at the existing BBF and, second, to
calculate the neutron and gamma fluxes and doses expected at the
proposed BBF. Multiple cell cultures or small animals could be
irradiated simultaneously at the so-modified BBF under conditions
similar to or better than those individual animals irradiated at the
existing thermal neutron irradiation facility (TNIF) of the BMRR. The
flux intensity of the collimated thermal neutron beam at the proposed
BBF would be 1.7 x 10<sup>10</sup> n/cm<sup>2</sup><img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif">s at 3-MW
reactor power, the same as at the TNIF. However, the proposed

contaminations, 64 and 180f those at the TNIF, respectively. The

<a name=6><b>Loss-of-Normal-Feedwater Sensitivity Studies for AP600 Behavior Characterization</b><br></a>
<i>Gianfranco Saiu, Gabriele Del Nero, Antonio Madonna, Giuseppe Marella, Andrea Orazi</i>
<p>

Activity concerning the development of a RELAP5/MOD3 model to simulate
the Westinghouse Electric Corporation AP600 is summarized. The aim is
to gain initial insight into the capability of RELAP5 to simulate the
behavior of AP600 safety features. A-loss-of-normal-feedwater event is
studied. Of the transients that must be investigated, this transient
has been chosen to be one of the most relevant because the response of
the AP600 to a loss-of-normal-feedwater event differs significantly
from that of current pressurized water reactors in the extensive use
of passive safety features peculiar to the AP600.
<p>

Also, strong interactions among the AP600 safety systems, which should
be further analyzed to permit full optimization of the system
actuation logic and operation, are shown.
<p>

Finally, a loss of normal feedwater without reactor scram, performed
to investigate short-term plant behavior, shows that the pressure peak
is affected by critical discharge flow coefficients applied to the
pressurizer safety valves, while a relatively small reduction of the
pressure peak is observed when both heat exchangers of the passive
heat removal system are operating as opposed to the case in which only
one is available.
<p>

The data used for this study are derived from the Standard Safety
Analysis Report configuration of the Westinghouse AP600 as of 1992.

<p>

Multiphase flow frequently occurs in a progression of accidents of
nuclear reactor severe core damage. The CHAMPAGNE code has been
developed to analyze thermohydraulic behavior of multiphase and
multicomponent fluid, which requires for its characterization more
than one set of velocities, temperatures, masses per unit volume, and
so forth at each location in the calculation domain. Calculations of
multiphase flow often show physical and numerical instability. The
effect of numerical stabilization obtained by the upwind differencing
and the fully implicit techniques gives us a convergent solution more
easily than other techniques. Several results calculated by the
CHAMPAGNE code are explained.

<a name=8><b>A Hybrid Approach for Detecting and Isolating Faults in Nuclear Power Plant Interacting Systems</b><br></a>
<i>J. Wesley Hines, Don W. Miller, Brian K. Hajek</i>
<p>

A fault detection and isolation (FDI) system is presented that can
detect and isolate nuclear power plant (NPP) faults occurring in
interacting systems. The proposed methodology combines two tools,
observer-based residual generation and neural network pattern
matching, into a powerful, hybrid diagnostic system. A computer-based
model of a commercial boiling water reactor (BWR) is used as the
reference plant.
<p>

Two FDI methods are implemented on each of two BWR systems, and their
performance characteristics are compared. One method uses conventional
neural network techniques that use parameter values for input, and a
second, hybrid methodology uses system models to create residuals for
input to a neural network. Both FDI systems show good generalization
abilities, but only the hybrid system decouples system
interactions. Although implementation is impractical for all NPP
systems, this hybrid technique is most useful in specific applications
where operators have difficulty diagnosing faults in strongly
interacting systems.

<i>Mihalis Lazaridis, Joaquim Areia Capitao, Yannis Drossinos</i>
<p>

The RAFT computer code for aerosol formation and transport was
modified to include boron species in its chemical database. The
modification was necessary to calculate fission product transport and
deposition in the FAL-17 and ISP-34 Falcon tests, where boric acid was
injected. The experimental results suggest that the transport of
cesium is modified in the presence of boron. The results obtained with
the modified RAFT code are presented; they show good agreement with
experimental results for cesium and partial agreement for boron
deposition in the Falcon silica tube. The new version of the RAFT code
predicts the same behavior for iodine deposition as the previous
version, where boron species were not included.

<a name=0><b>Solubility of Nickel Ferrite in High-Temperature Pure or Oxygenated Water</b><br></a>
<i>Yukiko Hanzawa, Daisuke Hiroishi, Chihiro Matsuura, Kenkichi Ishigure</i>
<p>

The solubility of nickel ferrite is measured at 423, 473, and 523K in
a pure or oxygenated water system, which is similar to boiling water
reactor conditions, using a specially designed batch autoclave
system. Thermodynamic analysis is performed by a procedure minimizing
Gibbs free energy of the system at the final state. On the basis of
both the analysis and the experimental results, it is shown that the
dissolution mechanism of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> under the
condition where no redox reaction takes place consists of both
NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> dissolution and
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> precipitation equilibria. The calculated
value of the solubility at 423K using literature values of the
thermodynamic data agree with the experimental value, but at 473 and
523K they deviate somewhat from the experimental ones. By fitting to
the experimental results at these temperatures, the thermodynamic data
of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> for 473 and 523K are reanalyzed, and
new values are proposed.

<i>R. C. Haight, D. W. Kneff, B. M. Oliver, L. R. Greenwood, H. Vonach</i>
<p>

Helium production cross sections for the elements iron, nickel, and
copper and for the isotopes <sup>56</sup>Fe, <sup>58</sup>Ni,
<sup>60</sup>Ni, and <sup>61</sup>Ni for 9.85-MeV neutrons have been
measured by irradiation with an intense, quasi-monoenergetic neutron
source followed by helium analysis with isotope dilution gas mass
spectrometry. The results are in fair agreement with (n,<img src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">) cross
sections measured by alpha-particle detection and integration over the
alpha-particle energies and angular distributions.

<i>Noriaki Nakao, Hiroshi Nakashima, Takashi Nakamura, Shun-ichi Tanaka, Susumu Tanaka, Kazuo Shin, Mamoru Baba, Yukio Sakamoto, Yoshihiro Nakane</i>
<p>

The energy spectra of neutrons that penetrate 25- to 200-cm-thick
concrete shields are measured using 40- and 65-MeV quasi-monoenergetic
neutron sources at the 90-MeV AVF cyclotron of the Takasaki Ion
Accelerator Facility for Advanced Radiation Application at the Japan
Atomic Energy Research Institute. Source neutrons are produced at 3.6-
and 5.2-mm-thick <sup>7</sup>Li targets bombarded by 43- and 68-MeV
protons, respectively, and their spectra are measured with a proton
recoil counter telescope and the time-of-flight method. In the
shielding experiment, a BC501A organic liquid scintillator and a
multimoderator spectrometer with a <sup>3</sup>He counter (the Bonner
Ball) are used as the neutron spectrometer. The collimated source
neutrons are used to obtain the neutron spectra with the unfolding
technique on the neutron beam axis and at off-center positions. MORSE
Monte Carlo calculations are performed with the DLC119/HILO86
multigroup cross-section library for comparison with the measured
data on the beam axis. The comparison reveals that the calculated
spectra are in good agreement with the measured spectra. The measured
data at off-center positions are used to check the calculational
accuracy of the angular distribution of neutron scattering in the
MORSE-CG, DOT3.5 discrete ordinates, and HETC-KFA2 Monte Carlo
codes. The MORSE-CG code gives better results than the other two
codes.

<i>Hiroshi Nakashima, Noriaki Nakao, Shun-ichi Tanaka, Takashi Nakamura, Kazuo Shin, Susumu Tanaka, Hiroshi Takada, Shinichiro Meigo, Yoshihiro Nakane, Yukio Sakamoto, Mamoru Baba</i>
<p>

Neutron spectra in the energy range above 10<sup>-4</sup> eV
transmitted through iron shields succeedingly are measured with a
BC501A liquid scintillation detector and the Bonner Ball detector
using quasi-monoenergetic neutron sources generated via the
<sup>7</sup>Li(p,n) reaction by 43- and 68-MeV protons. Using the
collimated source neutrons, the spectra are obtained on the neutron
beam axis and at off-center positions. The calculations using the
MORSE-CG and DOT3.5 codes with the DLC119 group cross-section data
sets as well as the HETC-KFA2 code are carried out and compared with
the measurements. The spectra calculated with the Monte Carlo code
MORSE-CG and the DLC119 data agree with the measurements on the whole
in the energy region above a few mega-electron-volts. It, however, is
found that a few orders of Legendre expansion fail to reproduce the
measurements at the position dominated by the neutrons scattered at a
large angle. The calculations with the two-dimensional discrete
ordinates code DOT3.5 and the DLC119 data also agree with the
measurements in the overall energy region, though the restricted
numbers of angular quadrature and a few orders of Legendre expansion
led to the disagreement with the measurements at the off-center
positions or in the neutron peak energy region. The comparison among
the calculations with the Monte Carlo code HETC-KFA2 and the
measurements show that the contribution of elastic scattering is very
important in the intermediate energy region, and the treatment of the
angular distribution of the elastic scattering reaction in the
HETC-KFA2 code should be modified.

<a name=4><b>Effects of the Photon Cross Sections and Energy-Absorption Coefficients of Air to the Gamma-Ray Point Isotropic Exposure Buildup Factors</b><br></a>
<i>Hideo Hirayama</i>
<p>

The effects of using different photon cross-section libraries and
energy-absorption coefficients on the gamma-ray point isotropic
exposure buildup factors up to 40 mean free path (mfp) were studied
using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code for water, iron, and lead from the
0.1- to 10-MeV energy regions.
<p>

Differences due to the cross sections used exist, but are small, <10%,
except those for lead at 0.1 and 10 MeV. The differences in the case
of lead increase along with an increase in the depth and are nearly
30% at 40 mfp depth.
<p>

The effects of using different energy-absorption coefficients of air
are <2%.

<p>

Alpha-particle production cross sections and spectra produced by
neutron bombardment of <sup>59</sup>Co are measured at 30, 60, 90, and
135 deg over the neutron energy range from 5 to 50 MeV. A source of
neutrons continuous in energy is provided by the Los Alamos Weapons
Nuclear Research Facility spallation neutron source
facility. Comparison of the measurements with results of calculations
including sequential reaction Hauser-Feshbach calculations and
pre-equilibrium processes indicates that the majority of the alpha
particles result from compound nuclear reactions. The degree of
agreement of calculation with experimental data for the cross section
as a function of neutron energy and on the alpha-particle emission
spectra depends on the selection of nuclear level densities and
optical model parameters.

<a name=6><b>Analysis of Nuclear Power Transmutation Potential at Equilibrium</b><br></a>
<i>M. Salvatores, I. Slessarev, A. Tchistiakov</i>
<p>

A major issue to secure the development of nuclear energy in the
future is the radioactive waste minimization, both inside the fuel
cycle and in a deep geological storage. Most of the research
activities have been devoted to assess the potential benefits of the
so-called partitioning/transmutation technologies.
<p>

The physical principles that provide an inherent minimization of the
radioactive wastes is established. A new concept is introduced to
characterize the radiotoxicity associated with various nuclei families
in an equilibrium state. The analysis shows the potential of
evolutionary nuclear systems, mostly based on known technologies and
the potential of more futuristic systems, like accelerator-driven
systems and the thorium fuel cycle.


<p>
<a name=7><b>Optimization of Nonanalog Monte Carlo Games Using Differential Operator Sampling</b><br></a>
<i>P. K. Sarkar, Herbert Rief</i>
<p>

The amounts of change in the variance and in the efficiency of
nonanalog Monte Carlo simulations for certain variations in the
biasing parameters are important quantities when optimizing such
simulations. A new approach, based on the differential operator
sampling technique, is outlined to estimate the derivatives of
variance and efficiency with respect to the biasing parameters; the
same simulation constructed to solve the primary problem is used. An
algorithm requiring the first- and higher order derivatives of the
natural logarithm of the second moment to predict
minimum-variance-biasing parameters is presented. Equations pertaining
to the algorithm are derived and solved numerically for an
exponentially transformed one-group slab transmission problem for
various slab thicknesses and scattering probabilities. The results
indicate that optimization of nonanalog simulations can be achieved so
that the present method will be useful in self-learning Monte Carlo
schemes.


<p>
<a name=8><b>A Modified P<sub>3</sub>-Like Approximation to the Transport Equation</b><br></a>
<i>Bingjing Su, G. C. Pomraning</i>
<p>

Standard P<sub>N</sub> theory is well developed as an approximation to
the neutron transport equation. However, this theory contains no
physics in the sense that it simply represents the angular flux as a
sum of polynomials in angle. Thus, standard P<sub>N</sub> theory (with
N finite) cannot qualitatively predict correct asymptotic transport
behavior except in the limit of pure scattering. In this paper, we
modify standard P<sub>N</sub> theory by incorporating certain
transport physics, namely, the Case discrete modes, into a modified
P<sub>N</sub> expansion of the angular flux. The theory resulting from
using this modified P<sub>N</sub>-like expansion predicts the exact
transport asymptotic growth/decay length, since it contains the
discrete Case eigenvalue. Such modified P<sub>3</sub>-like equations
and associated boundary conditions are derived in planar geometry
according to a recently introduced variational calculus. Analyses and
numerical calculations reveal that this modified P<sub>3</sub>-like
theory possesses the following features: (a) It reduces to standard
P<sub>3</sub> theory in the limit of pure scattering; (b) it conserves
neutrons but exhibits a scalar flux discontinuity at a material
interface; (c) it is shown numerically to be exceedingly accurate,
much more accurate than standard P<sub>3</sub> theory, in predicting
various transport theory behavior for homogeneous problems; and (d)
for heterogeneous problems, it is necessary that each material region
in the system be sufficiently large for this theory to predict better
results than standard P<sub>3</sub> theory.


<p>
<a name=9><b>Boundary Condition Perturbations in Transport Theory</b><br></a>
<i>Farzad Rahnema</i>
<p>

Expressions are derived for the first-order change in the fundamental
eigenvalue of the neutron transport equation due to a perturbation in
the boundary condition of the system. The perturbation formula is
derived in the context of the energy-dependent transport theory and
its diffusion approximation. Numerical examples are given in both
transport and diffusion theory.


<p>
<a name=10><b>Quantitative Method to Measure Void Fraction of Two-Phase Flow Using Electronic Imaging with Neutrons</b><br></a>
<i>K. Mishima, T. Hibiki</i>
<p>

A quantitative method of image processing coupled with the neutron
radiography technique is proposed to accurately measure the void
fraction of a two-phase flow in a metallic duct. The spatial
distribution of the dark current component is experimentally shown to
be smooth, and the temporal variation cannot be ignored. Since the
neutrons scattered in an object can be smoothed and reduced by setting
the test section at a large distance from the converter, it is
clarified that the corrections for the dark current and scattered
neutrons can be represented by an offset. The offset value can be
determined by using the total macroscopic cross section of the object
(<img src="/graphics/symbols/Sigma.gif">-scaling method). By comparing
the calculated void fractions with the measured ones obtained by
simulating the known void profile using a standard test section, the
void fraction can be measured by this method within 2% error. The
measurement error is estimated to be up to ~10% when no correction for
scattered neutrons is made or arbitrary offset values are used.


<p>
<a name=11><b>Neural Network-Based Fault Detections in a Pressurized Water Reactor Pressurizer</b><br></a>
<i>M. Marseguerra, M. E. Ricotti, E. Zio</i>
<p>

The early detection of incipient failures is of paramount importance
for the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants. The
feasibility of using artificial neural networks as process simulators
in a fault detection device is explored. Two neural networks are
trained to follow the dynamic evolution of the system pressure in a
nonfaulty pressurizer of a pressurized water reactor. During an
accident, the discrepancy between the plant's signals and the neural
networks' predictions can be used to rapidly detect the faulty
condition. In reality, the signals will be unavoidably affected by a
certain level of noise. The robustness of neural networks to noisy
patterns assures a satisfactory degree of accuracy in the process
predictions and, therefore, a high efficiency in the detection as
well.

A semiempirical method based on the evaporation and exciton models is
developed to calculate continuum gamma-ray spectra and multiplicities
from neutron-induced reactions. The calculation results are in good

<a name=14><b>Autoregressive Moving Average Inverse Dynamics for Rhodium Self-Powered Neutron Detector</b><br></a>
<i>Charles W. Mayo, Lian Yan</i>
<p>

The autoregressive moving average (ARMA) solution is derived for the
rhodium self-powered neutron detector inverse dynamics. Numerical
performance is compared to the autoregressive (AR) inverse dynamics
form. A potential difference in the dynamic range of the two methods
would be masked by analog-to-digital converter quantizing noise. The
AR and ARMA inverse dynamics methods have equal performance for
additive noise and require the same number of multiplications and
additions per time step.

<a name=0><b>A Hybrid Multigroup/Continuous-Energy Monte Carlo Method for Solving the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck Equation</b><br></a>
<i>J. E. Morel, Leonard J. Lorence, Jr., Ronald P. Kensek, John A. Halbleib, D. P. Sloan</i>
<p>

A hybrid multigroup/continuous-energy Monte Carlo algorithm is
developed for solving the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation. This
algorithm differs significantly from previous charged-particle Monte
Carlo algorithms. Most importantly, it can be used to perform both
forward and adjoint transport calculations, using the same basic
multigroup cross-section data. The new algorithm is fully described,
computationally tested, and compared with a standard condensed history
algorithm for coupled electron-photon transport calculations.
<p>


<a name=1><b>Higher Order Fokker-Planck Operators</b><br></a>
<i>G. C. Pomraning</i>
<p>

If the scattering interaction in linear particle transport problems is
highly peaked about zero momentum transfer, a common and often useful
approximation is the replacement of the integral scattering operator
with the differential Fokker-Planck operator. This operator involves a
first derivative in energy and second derivatives in angle. In this
paper, higher order Fokker-Planck scattering operators are derived,
involving higher derivatives in both energy and angle. The
applicability of these higher order differential operators to
representative scattering kernels is discussed. It is shown that,
depending upon the details of the scattering kernel in the integral
operator, higher order Fokker-Planck approximations may or may not be
valid. Even the classic low-order Fokker-Planck operator fails as an
approximation for certain highly peaked scattering kernels. In
particular, no Fokker-Planck operator is a valid approximation for
scattering involving the widely used Henyey-Greenstein scattering
kernel.
<p>


<a name=2><b>Forward-Adjoint Monte Carlo Coupling with No Statistical Error Propagation</b><br></a>
<i>S. N. Cramer</i>
<p>

Methods for coupling multiple forward and adjoint radiation transport
Monte Carlo calculations with no statistical error propagation are
presented. Correlated forward and adjoint particle histories are
uniformly initialized on arbitrarily placed intermediate source
boundaries throughout the calculational system. In applying the method
to multilegged duct streaming problems, these source boundaries are
placed at the duct leg intersections. The necessary forward and
adjoint fluxes for the coupling procedure are each computed from an
opposite-mode calculation. The no-error-propagation feature is the
result of an exact correlation of all phase-space variables for
coupled forward-adjoint particle histories at each boundary. For ducts
of more than two legs, next-event estimation between forward and
adjoint collision sites across arbitrarily placed intermediate scoring
boundaries is necessary to achieve the variable
correlation. Comparison of calculational results between the coupled
and standard methods for two- a nd three-legged ducts are presented.

<i>Nam Zin Cho, Chang Je Park</i>
<p>

We solve the neutron diffusion equation by a wavelet Galerkin scheme
in this paper. Wavelet functions are generated by dilation and
translation operation on a scaling function. The wavelet functions are
localized in space and have a recursive property, so these properties
may be utilized to solve a differential equation that has severe
``stiffness.''
<p>

The wavelet Galerkin method (WGM) represents the solution as a
summation of Daubechies' scaling functions, which are also used as the
weighting function. The Daubechies' scaling functions have the
properties of orthogonality and high smoothness. Unlike the finite
element method, the weighting function is the Daubechies' scaling
function, and the unknowns determined are not the fluxes of the nodes
but the coefficients of the scaling functions. The scaling functions
are overlapping in the nodes and require special treatment at
interfaces between nodes and at the boundaries.
<p>

We tested the WGM with several diffusion theory problems in reactor
physics. The solutions are very accurate with increasing Daubechies'
order and dilation order. The boundary conditions are also satisfied
very well. In particular, the WGM provides very accurate solutions for
heterogeneous problems in which the flux distribution exhibits very
steep gradients.
<p>

We conclude that it is worthwhile investigating further the WGM for
reactor physics problems and that numerical integration and
acceleration of the matrix equation must be improved so as to reduce
computing time.

<p>

The derivation and proper use of a formula originally published in
1959 for thermal neutron self-shielding computations in scattering
bodies are presented. It is shown that the f<sub>0</sub> entity in
this formula must be computed using the total macroscopic cross
section <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/Sigma.gif"><sub>t</sub>
instead of the macroscopic absorption cross section <img alt=""

Monte Carlo computations.  <p>


<a name=5><b>Mass Spectrometric Measurements of Fission Product Effusion from Irradiated Light Water Reactor Fuel</b><br></a>
<i>F. Capone, J. P. Hiernaut, M. Martellenghi, C. Ronchi</i>
<p>

Irradiated light water reactor fuel from the BR3 reactor was thermally
annealed up to 2500K in a Knudsen cell, and the effusing vapors were
measured by mass spectrometry. The experiments provide data on the
stoichiometry evolution of the fuel during release as well as a
reliable method to evaluate the diffusion coefficients of volatile and
less-volatile fission products.
<p>

The analysis of the data starts from diffusion of xenon, which clearly
shows three typical release stages respectively controlled by
radiation damage annealing, self-diffusion, and matrix
vaporization. The experimental measurements are also in agreement with
the predictions of intragranular trapping models.
<p>

Barium and cesium showed faster release than xenon, the former being
likely to diffuse atomically to the grain boundaries where no evidence
of formation of stable zirconates was found. These results were
compared with those obtained by a burnup-simulated fuel, where barium
was initially present in a perovskite phase, producing essentially
different release patterns.

<a name=6><b>Systematic Evaluation of Neutron Shielding Effects for Materials</b><br></a>
<i>K. Ueki, A. Ohashi, N. Nariyama, S. Nagayama, T. Fujita, K. Hattori, Y. Anayama</i>
<p>

Three types of experiments with a <sup>252</sup>Cf neutron source are
proposed to evaluate systematically the neutron shielding effects of a
material. The type 1 experiment deals with each shielding material
alone, the type 2 experiment combines a shielding material and a
structural material, and the type 3 experiment constructs the
optimization with the materials used in the type 2 experiment. In the
stainless steel (SS) + polyethylene shielding system, because of the
location of the SS slabs at the source side, the tenth layer of the
polyethylene becomes approximately one-half the value as when the
polyethylene is employed alone. This is the enhancement effect of the
SS. In the type 3 experiment, the total thickness of the SS +
polyethylene shielding system is 40 cm, and the total thicknesses of
the SS and the polyethylene slabs are fixed at 25 and 15 cm thick,
respectively. The minimum total dose-equivalent rate (neutron +
secondary gamma rays) is observed when the polyethylene slabs are
located at a 20-cm depth from the source side, with an arrangement of
20-cm-thick SS + 15-cm-thick polyethylene + 5-cm-thick and SS, and
with a ratio of the maximum to the minimum dose-equivalent rate of
2.5. The shielding optimization can be constructed by combining the
materials having different shielding characteristics. The experimental
results of the three types of experiments are reproduced fairly well
by using the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MCNP 4A with a
next-event surface crossing estimator.

<a name=7><b>Thermalization of Neutrons in Graphite: Status and Error Analysis</b><br></a>
<i>F. C. Difilippo, J. P. Renier, B. A. Worley</i>
<p>

Calculations related to the temperature coefficient of reactivity of
enriched gas-cooled reactors show the high sensitivity of this
parameter to the proper description of thermalization effects in the
moderator. Additionally, the calculation of the temperature dependence
of the inelastic-scattering cross section with current ENDF/B
formalisms correlates the errors of the cross sections as functions of
the temperature. Neglecting this temperature correlation introduces
unnecessary conservatism in the estimation of the error of the
reactivity coefficient.
<p>

These two facts drove our efforts to characterize the present status
of the inelastic cross section of graphite and to calculate its
covariance file. The ENDF/B evaluation of the scattering matrix S(<img
alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">,<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif">,T) is still based on the
approximations (incoherent component only) and phonon spectra of the
early 1960s. Subsequent measurements showed that the structure
observed in S(<img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">,<img
alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif">,T) cannot be described using
the incoherent approximation, and soon after the availability of
highly intense neutron beams and large specimens of pyrolitic graphite
have allowed the direct measurement of elastic constants of relevance
for a better calculation of the phonon spectra. Calculations of the
probability distributions of the moment and energy transfer, <img
alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif"> and <img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif">, in a Maxwellian spectrum allow us
to define a range of <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">
and <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif"> for which comparison
of experimental and theoretical data are of most interest for reactor
analysis, and to point out regions of deficient resolution or
excessive de tails in the present <img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">,<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif"> mesh used in the ENDF/B
files. Because the phonon spectrum defines S(<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">,<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif">,T), mathematical formulas have been
found that allow the calculation of the covariance matrix of S by
propagating the errors of the phonon spectra.  <p>


<a name=8><b>Kinetics of Dissolution of Uranium Metal Foil by Alkaline Hydrogen Peroxide</b><br></a>
<i>Daojie Dong, George F. Vandegrift</i>
<p>

To develop a new process for the production of <sup>99</sup>Mo using
low-enriched uranium targets, uranium dissolution in alkaline hydrogen
peroxide was studied. Molybdenum-99 is a parent of the widely used
medical isotope <sup>99m</sup>Tc.
<p>

The rates of uranium dissolution in alkaline hydrogen peroxide
solution were measured in an open, batch-type reactor and were found
to be a 0.25th order reaction with respect to equilibrium hydrogen
peroxide concentration. In general, uranium dissolution can be
classified as a low-base (&lt;0.2 M hydroxide) and a high-base
(&gt;0.2 M hydroxide) process. In the low-base process, both the
equilibrium hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxide concentrations affect
the rate of uranium dissolution. In the high-base process, uranium
dissolution is independent of alkali concentration; the presence of
base affects only the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen
peroxide. An empirical kinetics model is proposed and discussed.

<p>

Transmutation of actinide waste into fission products could be
enhanced by using resonance fission of odd-odd target materials; those
of interest are <sup>232</sup>Pa, <sup>238</sup>Np, and
<sup>242</sup>Am. Fission cross-section measurements of two of these
short-lived materials were performed at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. Samples were produced by the (d,2n) reaction in the Los
Alamos Ion Beam Facility followed by fast radiochemistry to separate
the odd-odd target of interest. The fission cross section of the
nanogram samples was measured in a high intensity pulsed neutron beam
produced by 800-MeV proton spallation. Using this procedure, the
fission cross sections of the 1.3-day <sup>232</sup>Pa and 2.1-day
<sup>238</sup>Np were successfully measured in the energy range from
0.01 eV to 50 keV. The fission cross section of the relatively
long-life isotope <sup>236</sup>Np was also measured in the same system
while the short half-life isotopes were being prepared. The results
and resonance analysis are present ed.

<a name=0><b>An Upwind Numerical Method for Two-Fluid Two-Phase Flow Models</b><br></a>
<i>I. Toumi</i>
<p>

An upwind numerical method for a six equation two-fluid model is
presented based on a linearized Riemann solver. The construction of
this approximate Riemann solver uses an extension of Roe's method that
has been successfully used to solve gas dynamics equations in
aerodynamics problems. As far as the two-fluid model is hyperbolic,
this numerical method seems very efficient for the numerical solution
of two-phase flow problems. In practice, this new numerical method has
proved to be stable on nonstaggered grids and capable of generating
accurate nonoscillating solutions for two-phase flow calculations. The
scheme was applied both to shock tube problems and to standard tests
for two-fluid codes.

<i>V. E. Fortov, B. Goel, C.-D. Munz, A. L. Ni, A. V. Shutov, O. Yu. Vorobiev</i>
<p>

A Godunov scheme is proposed for the simulation of impact problems and
detonations where nonstationary fronts and interfaces are tracked as
boundaries of subregions that move in time. In each subregion and at
each time step, a new grid is created by the use of boundary-fitted
coordinates. The numerical method is based on a finite-volume approach
in the space-time domain, and the fluxes are calculated using the
solution of Riemann problems. Numerical results are shown for several
impact and detonation problems, showing the efficiency of this
approach.

<a name=2><b>Evaluation of Inherent Distortions in the IIST Facility Using the RELAP5/MOD3 Code</b><br></a>
<i>Yuh-Ming Ferng</i>
<p>

The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) integral system test
(IIST) facility is a reduced-height, reduced-pressure test facility
constructed at INER that is used to simulate the thermal hydraulics of
the Maanshan nuclear power plant (NPP). A small-scaled facility is not
capable of simulating all the physical phenomena of an NPP because the
behavior of an NPP during accidents is very complicated. Proper
scaling then plays an important role in the design of a test facility
to ensure the usefulness and applicability of experimental data
obtained from a small-scaled facility. However, distortions caused by
necessary compromises in the design and construction of a small-scaled
test facility exist. The analysis here evaluates whether the inherent
distortions in the IIST facility will distort the thermal-hydraulic
behaviors of a natural-circulation experiment and influence the
usefulness and applicability of the experimental data. Based on the
current calculations, the IIST experimental results are found to be
partially distorted. Appropriate consideration of and correction for
these distortion effects are needed before the results of the IIST
natural-circulation experiments can be used to reliably investigate
the Maanshan NPP behavior expected by way of an appropriate scale-up
procedure.

<a name=3><b>A Second-Derivative-Based Adaptive Time-Step Method for Spatial Kinetics Calculations</b><br></a>
<i>Nicolas Crouzet, Paul J. Turinsky</i>
<p>

In solving few-group neutron kinetic equations in multidimensions, one
must select time-step sizes as a function of time such that the
temporal truncation error introduced by the discrete time derivative
approximation is limited to ensure the desired fidelity. When using
the Euler backward finite difference to approximate the first
derivative of the flux---a popular approximation because it ensures
numerical stability---the truncation error is know to be
O(<img src="/graphics/symbols/Delta.gif"><i>t</i><sup>2</sup>) and proportional to the second
derivative. By employment of the double-time-step-size technique,
modified to reduce the frequency that double-time-step-size solutions
are required, an estimate of the second derivative can be obtained,
leading to an efficient computational algorithm for determining the
near-optimum time-step-size sequence to ensure the desired fidelity.

<i>S. Kitsos, C. M. Diop, A. Assad, J. C. Nimal, P. Ridoux</i>
<p>

Improvements of gamma-ray transport calculations in S<sub>n</sub>
codes aim at taking into account the bound-electron effect of Compton
scattering (incoherent), coherent scattering (Rayleigh), and secondary
sources of bremsstrahlung and fluorescence. A computation scheme was
developed to take into account these phenomena by modifying the
angular and energy transfer matrices, and no modification in the
transport code has been made. The incoherent and coherent scatterings
as well as the fluorescence sources can be strictly treated by the
transfer matrix change. For bremsstrahlung sources, this is possible
if we can neglect the charged particles path as they pass through the
matter (electrons and positrons) and is applicable for the energy
range of interest for us (below 10 MeV). These improvements have been
reported on the kernel attenuation codes by the calculation of new
buildup factors. The gamma-ray buildup factors have been carried out
for 25 natural elements up to 30 mean free paths in the energy
range between 15 keV and 10 MeV.

<a name=5><b>Inconsistencies in Widely Used Monte Carlo Methods for Precise Calculation of Radial Resonance Captures in Uranium Fuel Rods</b><br></a>
<i>Donald Bogart</i>
<p>

Although resonance neutron captures for <sup>238</sup>U in
water-moderated lattices are known to occur near moderator-fuel
interfaces, the sharply attenuated spatial captures here have not been
calculated by multigroup transport or Monte Carlo methods. Advances in
computer speed and capacity have restored interest in applying Monte
Carlo methods to evaluate spatial resonance captures in fueled
lattices. Recently published studies have placed complete reliance on
the ostensible precision of the Monte Carlo approach without auxiliary
confirmation that resonance processes were followed adequately or that
the Monte Carlo method was applied appropriately.
<p>

Other methods of analysis that have evolved from early resonance
integral theory have provided a basis for an alternative approach to
determine radial resonance captures in fuel rods. A generalized method
has been formulated and confirmed by comparison with published
experiments of high spatial resolution for radial resonance captures
in metallic uranium rods. The same analytical method has been applied
to uranium-oxide fuels. The generalized method defined a spatial
effective resonance cross section that is a continuous function of
distance from the moderator-fuel interface and enables direct
calculation of precise radial resonance capture distributions in fuel
rods.
<p>

This generalized method is used as a reference for comparison with two
recent independent studies that have employed different Monte Carlo
codes and cross-section libraries. The Monte Carlo studies have been
found to undercount reference radial resonance captures in the
moderator-fuel interface region. The steep radial capture gradients
within 0.50 mm of the interface account for the majority of resonance
captures and take place where Monte Carlo spatial resolution is poor
and the effects of resonance peaks on neutron flux are large.
<p>

Inconsistencies in the Monte Carlo application or in how pointwise
cross-section libraries are sampled may exist. It is shown that
refined Monte Carlo solutions with improved spatial resolution would
not asymptotically approach the reference spatial capture
distributions. It is suspected that the resolved resonance peak and
offpeak cross sections may not be represented or accounted for
appropriately in the Monte Carlo calculations and should be
reviewed. If these inconsistencies were cleared up, use of the
generalized method might very well challenge the need to perform
further Monte Carlo studies of radial resonance captures for isolated
uranium-oxide fuel rods.

<i>Richard B. Vilim, Richard W. Brock</i>
<p>

The trend toward increased reliance on passive features for power
reactor safety makes it important to obtain the characteristics of the
reactor system from measurements on the system. A method is described
for solving for the delayed neutron parameters in a liquid-metal power
reactor by fitting an analytic solution of the point-kinetics
equations to the flux die-away from a dropped rod in an initially
critical core. The method includes treatment of those conditions found
in a power reactor that depart from those in a critical assembly
experiment. These include a comparatively long rod drop time and a
detector signal that instead of providing an integrated count rate is
a sampled data signal proportional to the instantaneous fission
power. The delayed neutron parameter values calculated from a rod drop
experiment in the Experimental Breeder Reactor II are in agreement
with values calculated using first principles and knowledge of core
material composition and nuclear cross sections.

Gamma-ray production data of carbon, fluorine, aluminum, silicon,
titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, niobium, molybdenum,
tungsten, and lead in JENDL-3.2 and FENDL/E-1.0 induced by 14-MeV

spectrum measurements conducted at the OKTAVIAN deuterium-tritium
neutron source facility. The MCNP transport code is used along with
the flagging method for detailed analyses of the spectra. As a result,
several moderate problems are pointed out for secondary gamma-ray data
of titanium, chromium, manganese, and niobium in JENDL-3.2 and for the
data of titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, niobium, and lead in
FENDL/E-1.0. Because no fatal errors are found, however, secondary
gamma-ray data for the 13 elements in both libraries are reasonably
well validated through these benchmark tests as far as 14-MeV neutron
incidence is concerned.

The line-beam response function, needed for skyshine analyses based on

code for photon energies from 20 to 100 MeV and for source-to-detector
distances out to 1000 m. These results are compared with point-kernel
results, and the effects of bremsstrahlung and positron transport in
the air are found to be important in this energy range. The
three-parameter empirical formula used in the integral line-beam
skyshine method was fit to the MCNP results, and values of these
parameters are reported for various source energies and angles.

<i>Mark H. Stedry, J. Kenneth Shultis, Richard E. Faw</i>
<p>

A hybrid Monte Carlo and integral line-beam method is used to
determine the effect of a horizontal slab shield above a gamma-ray
source on the resulting skyshine doses. A simplified Monte Carlo
procedure is used to determine the energy and angular distribution of
photons escaping the source shield into the atmosphere. The escaping
photons are then treated as a bare, point, skyshine source, and the
integral line-beam method is used to estimate the skyshine dose at
various distances from the source. From results for arbitrarily
collimated and shielded sources, the skyshine dose is found to depend
primarily on the mean-free-path thickness of the shield and only very
weakly on the shield material.

The DAMAGE-PREDICTOR computer code, which has the capability of
simultaneously estimating the concentrations of radiolysis species,
the electrochemical corrosion potential (ECP), and the crack growth
rate (CGR) of a reference crack in sensitized Type 304 stainless
steel, is used to evaluate the responses of the Dresden-2 and Duane

(HWC). The HWC simulations for these two BWRs are carried out for
feedwater hydrogen concentrations ([H<sub>2</sub>]<sub>FW</sub>)
ranging from 0.0 to 2.0 parts per million (ppm). Results such as
species concentrations (H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc.), ECP, and CGR are predicted for
various components in the heat transport circuits (HTCs) of the two
reactors. It is found that while 1.3 ppm of feedwater hydrogen is
needed to protect part of the lower downcomer, the recirculation
system, and the lower plenum in Dresden-2 from intergranular stress
corrosion cracking, only 0.3 ppm is needed to achieve the same goal
in Duane Arnold. However, it is also found that the ECP in many
regions (core channel, core bypass, upper plenum, downcomer, etc.) in
the HTCs cannot be lowered to below the critical corrosion potential
of -0.23 V<sub>SHE</sub> for sensitized Type 304 stainless steels,
even when [H<sub>2</sub>]<sub>FW</sub> is as high as 2.0 ppm.

<p>

The DAMAGE-PREDICTOR computer code, which has the capability of
simultaneously estimating the concentrations of radiolysis species,
the electrochemical corrosion potential (ECP), and the crack growth
rate (CGR) of a reference crack in sensitized Type 304 stainless
steel, is used to evaluate the responses of the Dresden-2 and Duane
Arnold boiling water reactors (BWRs) to hydrogen water chemistry (HWC)
at different power levels. The HWC simulations for these two BWRs are
carried out for feedwater hydrogen concentration
([H<sub>2</sub>]<sub>FW</sub>) ranging from 0.0 to 2.0 parts per
million and for power levels at 100, 90, 80, and 70%. Variations in
the oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrogen concentrations; ECP; and
CGR for four specific areas (the side of the core shroud head, the
base of the core shroud, the recirculation system outlet, and the
bottom of the lower plenum) as a function of the feedwater hydrogen
concentration and power level are analyzed. It is found that lower
power levels alleviate the amount of hydrogen injected into the
feedwater that is required to protect the reactor components from
intergranular stress corrosion cracking. HWC is particularly effective
in protecting the base of the core shroud and the recirculation system
outlet but is only moderately effective in protecting the bottom of
the lower plenum. On the other hand, the ECP and the CGR at the side
of the core shroud head seem to be indifferent to both the operating
power level and the feedwater hydrogen concentration.

<a name=1><b>A Three-Dimensional Time-Dependent Unstructured Tetrahedral-Mesh <i>SP<sub>N</sub></i> Method</b><br></a>
<i>J. E. Morel, J. M. McGhee, Edward W. Larsen</i>
<p>


A three-dimensional time-dependent multigroup SP<sub>N</sub> method
for unstructured tetrahedral meshes is developed. The SP<sub>N</sub>
equations are expressed in a canonical form that allows them to be
solved using standard diffusion solution techniques in conjunction
with source iteration, diffusion-synthetic acceleration, and
fission-source acceleration. A computational comparison of this
SP<sub>N</sub> method with an even-parity S<sub>N</sub> method is
given.


<p>
<a name=2><b>Asymptotic Derivation of the Multigroup P<sub>1</sub> and Simplified <i>P<sub>N</sub></i> Equations with Anisotropic Scattering</b><br></a>
<i>Edward W. Larsen, J. E. Morel, John M. McGhee</i>
<p>


The multigroup P<sub>1</sub> and simplified P<sub>N</sub>
(SP<sub>N</sub>) equations are derived by an asymptotic expansion of
the multigroup transport equation with anisotropic scattering. The
P<sub>1</sub> equations are the leading-order approximation in this
expansion; the SP<sub>N</sub> equations for N = 2,3,... are
increasingly higher order approximations. The physical assumptions
underlying these approximations are that the material system is
optically thick, the probability of absorption is small, and the mean
scattering angle <img
src="/graphics/symbols/overbarmu.gif"><sub>0</sub> is not close to
unity. For multigroup isotropic scattering transport problems, a
dispersion analysis is given that verifies the accuracy of the
SP<sub>N</sub> approximations. Numerical comparisons of P<sub>1</sub>,
SP<sub>N</sub>, and S<sub>N</sub> solutions are also given. These
comparisons show that for low N, SP<sub>N</sub> solutions are
significantly more accurate (transportlike) than P<sub>1</sub>
solutions and are obtained at a significantly lower
 computational cost than S<sub>N</sub> solutions.


<p>
<a name=3><b>Asymptotic Derivation of the Fermi Pencil-Beam Approximation</b><br></a>
<i>Christoph Borgers, Edward W. Larsen</i>
<p>


The Fermi pencil-beam approximation describes the broadening of a
monoenergetic, nearly monodirectional particle beam in an optically
thick system in which the mean scattering angle is small and
large-angle scattering is negligible. This physical problem has
applications in such diverse fields as astrophysics, materials
science, electron microscopy, and radiation cancer therapy. The Fermi
equation is derived two different ways: as an asymptotic limit of the
Fokker-Planck equation for <img
src="/graphics/symbols/sigma.gif"><sub>tr</sub> to 0 and as an
asymptotic limit of the linear Boltzmann equation for <img
src="/graphics/symbols/sigma.gif"><sub>tr</sub> to <i>0 and <img
src="/graphics/symbols/sigma.gif"><sub>t</sub> to <img
src="/graphics/symbols/infinity.gif"></i>. Some numerical results
illustrating the Fermi approximation are also given.


<p>
<a name=4><b>Application of the <i>B<sub>n</sub></i> Theory to Unit Cell Calculations</b><br></a>
<i>R. Roy</i>
<p>

The integral transport equation is solved in square unit cells by
assuming the existence of a fundamental mode. The equations governing
the B<sub>n</sub> method are given without making the small buckling
approximation. First, the angular flux is factorized into two parts: a
periodic microscopic fine-structure flux and a macroscopic form with
no angular dependence. The macroscopic form only depends on a buckling
vector with a given orientation. The critical buckling norm, along
with the corresponding fine-structure flux, is obtained using
collision probability calculations that are repeated until criticality
is achieved. The procedure allows the periodic or reflective boundary
conditions of the unit cell to be taken into account using closed-form
contributions obtained from the cyclic tracking technique. Numerical
results are presented for one-group heterogeneous cell problems with
isotropic and linearly anisotropic scattering kernels, some of which
include void regions.


<p>
<a name=5><b>Variational Nodal Transport Perturbation Theory</b><br></a>
<i>Kirsten F. Laurin-Kovitz, E. E. Lewis</i>
<p>


A perturbation method based on the variational nodal method for
solving the neutron transport equation is developed for
multidimensional geometries. The method utilizes the solution of the
corresponding adjoint transport equation to calculate changes in the
critical eigenvalue due to cross-section changes. Both first-order and
exact perturbation theory expressions are derived. The adjoint
solution algorithm has been formulated and incorporated into the
variational nodal option of the Argonne National Laboratory DIF3D
production code. To demonstrate the efficacy of the methods,
perturbation calculations are performed on the three-dimensional
Takeda benchmark problems in both Cartesian and hexagonal
geometries. The resulting changes in eigenvalue are also obtained by
direct calculation with the variational nodal method and compared with
the change approximated by the first-order and exact theory
expressions from the perturbation method. Exact perturbation results
are in excellent agreement with the actual eige nvalue differences
calculated in VARIANT. First-order theory holds well for sufficiently
small perturbations. The times required for the perturbation
calculations are small compared with those expended for the
base-forward and adjoint calculations.


<p>
<a name=6><b>Solution of Mathematical Adjoint Equation for a Higher Order Nodal Expansion Method</b><br></a>
<i>Taek Kyum Kim, Chang Hyo Kim</i>
<p>


A method for determining the mathematical adjoint solution of a higher
order nodal expansion method (NEM) based on the simultaneous solution
of multigroup equations for each node in the rectangular geometry is
presented. In the higher order NEM, the forward NEM equations in a
given node include not only the nodal balance and interface-current
equations but also weighted residual method (WRM) equations for higher
order expansion coefficients. In deriving the mathematical adjoint
equations corresponding to these forward NEM equations, the transverse
leakage terms in the WRM equations need to be replaced by partial
currents. Because transverse leakage terms of a node are linked to
partial currents of many neighboring nodes, replacement of transverse
leakage terms by partial currents results in complicated WRM
equations. Because mathematical adjoint equations are obtained by
transposing the nodal forward equations, direct use of these
complicated WRM equations makes the numerical computation of the
adjoint solut ion inefficient. This problem is avoided by treating the
transverse leakage terms contained in the WRM equations as additional
unknowns and by including the equations defining the transverse
leakage terms in terms of partial currents into the nodal forward
equations. The mathematical adjoint equations are then derived by
transposing the resulting nodal forward equations.
<p>

This adjoint solution method is verified by comparing nodal adjoint
fluxes with the fine-mesh VENTURE solution for the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) pressurized water reactor (PWR) benchmark
problem and by comparing the local reactivity changes computed with
first-order perturbation theory for the IAEA PWR and the Yonggwang
unit 2 PWR with the exact reactivity values determined from the
eigenvalue difference between perturbed and unperturbed cores.


<p>
<a name=7><b>Collision Probability Calculation and Multigroup Flux Solvers Using PVM</b><br></a>
<i>A. Qaddouri, R. Roy, M. Mayrand, B. Goulard</i>
<p>


Collision probability evaluation and flux computation are the most
time-consuming aspects of applications based on the linearized
time-independent transport equation. Parallelization for collision
probability calculation and multigroup flux computation are
investigated. Particular techniques pertinent to the two-step
energy/space iterative process of solving a multigroup transport
equation are described. The parallel performance is studied in cases
where the cyclic tracking technique is used to integrate collision
probability. Parallelization is achieved by distributing either
different energy groups or different regions on a set of
processors. These algorithms were tested on a four-processor IBM SP2
and an eight-processor SPARC 1000 as well as on networks of
workstations using the public domain PVM library. Typical run times
are provided for unit cell calculations.


<p>
<a name=8><b>An Incomplete Domain Decomposition Preconditioning Method for Nonlinear Nodal Kinetics Calculations</b><br></a>
<i>Han Gyu Joo, Thomas J. Downar</i>
<p>


Methods are proposed for the efficient parallel solution of nonlinear
nodal kinetics equations. Because the two-node calculation in the
nonlinear nodal method is naturally parallelizable, the majority of
the effort is devoted to the development of parallel methods for
solving the coarse-mesh finite difference (CMFD) problem. A
preconditioned Krylov subspace method (biconjugate gradient
stabilized) is chosen as the iterative algorithm for the CMFD problem,
and an efficient parallel preconditioning scheme is developed based on
domain decomposition techniques. An incomplete lower-upper triangular
factorization method is first formulated for the coefficient matrices
representing each three-dimensional subdomain, and coupling between
subdomains is then approximated by incorporating only the effect of
the nonleakage terms of neighboring subdomains. The methods are
applied to fixed-source problems created from the International Atomic
Energy Agency three-dimensional benchmark problem. The effectiveness
of the incom plete domain decomposition preconditioning on a
multiprocessor is evidenced by the small increase in the number of
iterations as the number of subdomains increases. Through the
application to both CMFD-only and nodal calculations, it is
demonstrated that speedups as large as 49 with 96 processors are
attainable in the nonlinear nodal kinetics calculations.


<p>
<a name=9><b>A Domain Decomposition Method for Nonlinear Steady-State Flow Computations</b><br></a>
<i>Sebastien Clerc</i>
<p>


A domain decomposition method for steady-state, subsonic fluid
dynamics calculations is presented. An implicit solver is used in each
subdomain, with boundary data from previous iterations. A nonlinear
numerical boundary condition is used to enhance convergence. Numerical
examples are presented for the Euler equations of gas dynamics and a
two-phase flow model.


<p>
<a name=10><b>Moving-Particle Semi-Implicit Method for Fragmentation of Incompressible Fluid</b><br></a>
<i>S. Koshizuka, Y. Oka</i>
<p>

A moving-particle semi-implicit (MPS) method for simulating
fragmentation of incompressible fluids is presented. The motion of
each particle is calculated through interactions with neighboring
particles covered with the kernel function. Deterministic particle
interaction models representing gradient, Laplacian, and free surfaces
are proposed. Fluid density is implicitly required to be constant as
the incompressibility condition, while the other terms are explicitly
calculated. The Poisson equation of pressure is solved by the
incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient method. Collapse of a water
column is calculated using MPS. The effect of parameters in the models
is investigated in test calculations. Good agreement with an
experiment is obtained even if fragmentation and coalescence of the
fluid take place.


<p>
<a name=11><b>Kalman Filter Application for Distributed Parameter Estimation in Reactor Systems</b><br></a>
<i>Robert P. Martin, Robert M. Edwards</i>
<p>


An application of the Kalman filter has been developed for the
real-time identification of a distributed parameter in a nuclear power
plant. This technique can be used to improve numerical method-based
best-estimate simulation of complex systems such as nuclear power
plants. The application to a reactor system involves a unique modal
model that approximates physical components, such as the reactor, as a
coupled oscillator, i.e., a modal model with coupled modes. In this
model both states and parameters are described by an orthogonal
expansion. The Kalman filter with the sequential least-squares
parameter estimation algorithm was used to estimate the modal
coefficients of all states and one parameter. Results show that this
state feedback algorithm is an effective way to parametrically
identify a distributed parameter system in the presence of
uncertainties.


<p>
<a name=12><b>Flow Modeling in Heterogeneous Media in the Context of Geologic Nuclear Waste Repositories</b><br></a>
<i>Budhi Sagar</i>
<p>

Assessing long-term performance of geologic repositories requires
simulation of flow through heterogeneous geologic formations. The
effect on flow field of discontinuities such as fracture zones in such
media is not only of interest to waste management professionals but
also to those involved in petroleum engineering and water resources
development. Significant differences in the space and time scales
associated with these discontinuities as compared with those
associated with bulk geology cause special problems in modeling. The
modeling problems are in addition to the very practical problem
inherent in proper topological characterization of the discontinuities
and also in field measurement of their flow and transport
properties. After briefly reviewing various generally used classes of
methods for accommodating heterogeneities represented by fractures in
numerical models, a different technique of deriving mass balance
equations in the presence of fractures is discussed. Compared with
full representation of fractures, the proposed technique provides
coarser resolution of the flow field, but it is relatively
computationally efficient. Two examples of its application are also
provided.

<a name=0><b>Error Estimations and Their Biases in Monte Carlo Eigenvalue Calculations</b><br></a>
<i>Taro Ueki, Takamasa Mori, Masayuki Nakagawa</i>
<p>

Biases in the estimators of the variance and intercycle covariances in
Monte Carlo eigenvalue calculations are analyzed. The relations among
the ``real'' and ``apparent'' values of variances and intercycle
covariances are derived, where real refers to a true value that is
calculated from independently repeated Monte Carlo runs and apparent
refers to the expected value of estimates from a single Monte Carlo
run. Next, iterative methods based on the foregoing relations are
proposed to estimate the standard deviation of the eigenvalue. The
methods work well for the cases in which the ratios of the real to
apparent values of variances are between 1.4 and 3.1. Even in the case
where the foregoing ratio is >5, >700f the standard deviation
estimates fall within 40 0.000000rom the true value.


<p>
<a name=1><b>Post-Convergence Automatic Differentiation of Iterative Schemes</b><br></a>
<i>Yousry Y. Azmy</i>
<p>

A new approach for performing automatic differentiation (AD) of
computer codes that embody an iterative procedure, based on
differentiating a single additional iteration upon achieving
convergence, is described and implemented. This post-convergence
automatic differentiation (PAD) technique results in better accuracy
of the computed derivatives, as it eliminates part of the derivatives
convergence error, and a large reduction in execution time, especially
when many iterations are required to achieve convergence. In addition,
it provides a way to compute derivatives of the converged solution
without having to repeat the entire iterative process every time new
parameters are considered. These advantages are demonstrated and the
PAD technique is validated via a set of three linear and nonlinear
codes used to solve neutron transport and fluid flow problems. The PAD
technique reduces the execution time over direct AD by a factor of up
to 30 and improves the accuracy of the derivatives by up to two orders
of magnitude. The PAD technique's biggest disadvantage lies in the
necessity to compute the iterative map's Jacobian, which for large
problems can be prohibitive. Methods are discussed to alleviate this
difficulty.


<p>
<a name=2><b>Perturbation of General Boundary Condition for an Eigenvalue Change in the Neutron Boltzmann Transport Equation</b><br></a>
<i>Toshihiro Yamamoto</i>
<p>

First-order perturbation formalisms, representing a change in the
eigenvalue of the neutron Boltzmann transport eigenvalue equation due
to the boundary condition change, are derived. The same expression for
first-order perturbations is also obtained using Rahnema's
procedure. The formalisms obtained are applicable to the general
boundary condition. These formalisms are verified, and their accuracy
is estimated by applying the formalisms to systems whose boundary
conditions deviate slightly from the standard vacuum and white
boundary conditions.


<p>
<a name=3><b>The Suite of Analytical Benchmarks for Neutral Particle Transport in Infinite Isotropically Scattering Media</b><br></a>
<i>Drew E. Kornreich, B. D. Ganapol</i>
<p>

The linear Boltzmann equation for the transport of neutral particles
is investigated with the objective of generating benchmark-quality
evaluations of solutions for homogeneous infinite media. In all cases,
the problems are stationary, of one energy group, and the scattering
is isotropic. The solutions are generally obtained through the use of
Fourier transform methods with the numerical inversions constructed
from standard numerical techniques such as Gauss-Legendre quadrature,
summation of infinite series, and convergence
acceleration. Consideration of the suite of benchmarks in infinite
homogeneous media begins with the standard one-dimensional problems:
an isotropic point source, an isotropic planar source, and an
isotropic infinite line source. The physical and mathematical
relationships between these source configurations are
investigated. The progression of complexity then leads to
multidimensional problems with source configurations that also emit
particles isotropically: the finite line source, the disk source, and
the rectangular source. The scalar flux from the finite isotropic line
and disk sources will have a two-dimensional spatial variation,
whereas a finite rectangular source will have a three-dimensional
variation in the scalar flux. Next, sources emitting particles
anisotropically are considered. The most basic such source is the
point beam giving rise to the Green's function, which is physically
the most fundamental transport problem, yet may be constructed from
the isotropic point source solution. Finally, the anisotropic plane
and anisotropically emitting infinite line sources are
considered. Thus, a firm theoretical and numerical base is established
for the most fundamental neutral particle benchmarks in infinite
homogeneous media.

<a name=4><b>Measurements of Delayed Neutron Decay Constants and Fission Yields from <SUP>235</SUP>U, <SUP>237</SUP>Np, <SUP>241</SUP>Am, and <SUP>243</SUP>Am</b><br></a>
<i>Habeeb H. Saleh, Theodore A. Parish, S. Raman, Nobuo Shinohara</i>
<p>

Delayed neutron yields and decay constants for <SUP>235</SUP>U,
<SUP>237</SUP>Np, <SUP>241</SUP>Am, and <SUP>243</SUP>Am were measured at
the Texas A&amp;M University TRIGA reactor using a fast pneumatic transfer
system. The detection system consisted of an array of BF<sub>3</sub>
proportional counters embedded in a polyethylene cylinder. The
measured values of the total delayed neutron yield per 100 fissions
from thermal neutron-induced fission of <SUP>235</SUP>U,
<SUP>237</SUP>Np, <SUP>241</SUP>Am, and <SUP>243</SUP>Am were determined
to be 1.59 <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif"> 0.04, 1.29 <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif"> 0.04, 0.49 <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif">
0.02, and 0.84 <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif"> 0.04, respectively. The newly measured
values of delayed neutron group parameters and total yields were
compared with other values recommended by Keepin; Waldo, Karam, and
Meyer; and Tuttle. Very good agreement was obtained, especially for
<SUP>235</SUP>U.

<a name=5><b>Study of Total Discrete Gamma Radiation from Aluminum Under 14.9-MeV Neutron Bombardment</b><br></a>
<i>Hongyu Zhou, Guangshun Huang</i>
<p>

Combining the usual prompt gamma radiation measurement technique and
the lifetime correction method for delayed gamma radiation yield
measurements allows the study of total discrete gamma radiation from
14.9-MeV neutron-induced <SUP>27</SUP>Al(n,x<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">) reactions. The following are
identified: 21 prompt gamma lines from (n,n'<img alt=""

src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">) reactions; 5 delayed gamma lines
from one isomeric state produced in the (n,<img alt=""

residual nuclei in the (n,p) and (n,<img alt=""

production cross sections at 55, 90, and 140 deg are determined
simultaneously. Compared with previous experimental results, one sees
a clear advantage in separating the delayed component from the mixed
gamma-ray peaks, which consist of prompt and delayed gamma radiation;
completely clean prompt gamma-ray production data are obtained. The
accurate (n,p) cross sections and a preliminary (n,<img alt=""

relative differential production cross sections. They are in good
agreement with the known activation data obtained from previous
measurements and evaluations. The isomeric cross section for the
472.3-keV state of <SUP>24</SUP>Na is also given. The present result
shows that the total gamma radiation measurement method is valuable
not only to acquire accurate gamma-ray production data but also to
acquire accurate neutron activation data with a wide half-life range.

<a name=6><b>The Role of Heater Thermal Response in Reactor Thermal Limits During Oscillatory Two-Phase Flows</b><br></a>
<i>A. E. Ruggles, A. D. Vasil'ev, N. W. Brown, M. W. Wendel</i>
<p>

Analytical and numerical investigations of critical heat flux (CHF)
and reactor thermal limits are conducted for oscillatory two-phase
flows often associated with natural circulation conditions. The CHF
and associated thermal limits depend on the amplitude of the flow
oscillations, the period of the flow oscillations, and the thermal
properties and dimensions of the heater. The value of the thermal
limit can be much lower in unsteady flow situations than would be
expected using time average flow conditions. The properties of the
heater strongly influence the thermal limit value in unsteady flow
situations, which is very important to the design of experiments to
evaluate thermal limits for reactor fuel systems.

<a name=7><b>An Estimation of the Energy Generation Potential of Proton-Driven Subcritical ThO<sub>2</sub> Lattices</b><br></a>
<i>Meir Segev, A. Galperin</i>
<p>

Interest in generating energy with thorium fuel has increased lately
as a result of the activation of subcritical ThO<sub>2</sub> lattices
by accelerated protons. A tight, ThO<sub>2</sub> water-cooled lattice
has been proposed to generate 200 MW(thermal) with 1.5-GeV protons in
a current of ~7 mA. A tight-latticed core, consisting of a
ThO<sub>2</sub>/<SUP>233</SUP>UO<sub>2</sub> seed embedded in a large
ThO<sub>2</sub> blanket, has been proposed to generate 2400 MW(thermal)
with 1.0-GeV protons in a current of 20 mA.
<p>

A consistent detailed analysis of these two energy amplifiers, carried
out with the HERMES, MCNP, KORIGEN, WIMS, and BOXER codes, results in
performances inferior to those claimed. The net power generated will
be one-fourth of that claimed for the former and 1/2.5 of that claimed
for the latter.

<a name=8><b>Sensitivity Study of the Positive Scram Effect Relevant to the Chernobyl Accident Simulation</b><br></a>
<i>A. D'Angelo</i>
<p>

The positive scram effect (PSE) during the first seconds of the
Chernobyl accident following the activation of the scram command has
been investigated by using the French CRONOS three-dimensional code
under different hypotheses on the axial shape of the initial power
distribution. Assuming an initial power shape similar to the
information recorded by the SKALA monitoring system and relevant to
the core condition ~2 min before the reactivity accident, the results
of the present work well confirm the first seconds of the simulation
annexed to the INSAG-7 report. But, these results cannot explain the
signals of too high power and too short period registered by all the
lateral ionization chambers 3 s after the scram command
activation. The present work shows that the PSE can reproduce those
alarms under the hypothesis of a further power shape deformation in
the lower part of the core.

<p>
<a name=9><b>A New Variational Functional for Space-Time Neutronics</b><br></a>
<i>J. A. Favorite, W. M. Stacey, Jr.</i>
<p>

A new variational functional for space-time neutronics is
presented. This functional is stationary about the
integro-differential form of the diffusion equation, in which the
delayed neutron source is expressed as a convolution integral of the
flux, and an integro-differential adjoint flux equation. The new
functional is used to derive a quasi-static method that is similar to
the improved quasi-static (IQS) method, except that the equation for
the flux shape uses a different expression for the delayed neutron
source. In a one-dimensional sub-prompt critical test problem, the new
variational quasi-static method was slightly more accurate than the
IQS method.

<a name=2><b>The Even-Parity and Simplified Even-Parity Transport Equations in Two-Dimensional <i>x-y</i> Geometry</b><br></a>
<i>Taewan Noh, Warren F. Miller, Jr., Jim E. Morel</i>
<p>

The finite element and lumped finite element methods for the spatial
differencing of the even-parity discrete ordinates neutron transport
equations (EPS<sub>N</sub>) in two-dimensional x-y geometry are
applied. In addition, the simplified even-parity discrete ordinates
equations (SEPS<sub>N</sub>) as an approximation to the
EPS<sub>N</sub> transport equations are developed. The
SEPS<sub>N</sub> equations are more efficient to solve than the
EPS<sub>N</sub> equations due to a reduction in angular domain of
one-half, the applicability of a simple five-point diffusion operator,
and directionally uncoupled reflective boundary
conditions. Furthermore, the SEPS<sub>N</sub> equations satisfy the
same diffusion limits as EPS<sub>N</sub> in an optically thick regime,
appear to have no ray effect, and converge faster than EPS<sub>N</sub>
when using a diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Also, unlike the
case of EPS<sub>N</sub>, the SEPS<sub>N</sub> solutions are strictly
positive, thus requiring no negative flux fixups. It is also
demonstrated that SEPS<sub>N</sub> is a generalization of the
simplified P<sub>N</sub> method. Most importantly, in these
second-order approaches, an unconditionally effective DSA scheme can
be achieved by simply integrating the differenced EPS<sub>N</sub> and
SEPS<sub>N</sub> equations over the angles. It is difficult to obtain
a consistent DSA scheme with the first-order S<sub>N</sub>
equations. This is because a second-order DSA equation must generally
be derived directly from the differenced first-order S<sub>N</sub>
equations.


<p>
<a name=3><b>A Locally Exact Numerical Scheme with Nonoscillation Properties for Stationary Transport Equations with Absorption and Source Terms</b><br></a>
<i>Katsuhiro Sakai</i>
<p>

A locally exact numerical scheme (LENS) based on the concept of
locally exact numerical differencing is presented. The essence of the
LENS scheme consists in determining the coefficients of the difference
scheme so that the resulting equation interpolating numerical fluxes
at the control volume surface satisfies the analytical solution of
transport equations with absorption and source terms. The spatial
distribution of the coefficients of transport equations is taken into
consideration based on a four-region model among three adjacent
control volumes, in which continuous conditions for solutions are
imposed on the boundary between two adjacent regions.
<p>

An analysis of nonoscillation properties of the present LENS scheme
was performed using the characteristic polynomial analysis method. It
was found that the LENS scheme possesses the potential for
nonoscillation properties for stationary convection-diffusion
equations with absorption. The LENS scheme is examined through
numerical experiments and shows stable and accurate solutions for
transport equations with absorption and source terms.


<p>
<a name=4><b>Singular Perturbation Solutions of the Neutron Transport Equation</b><br></a>
<i>David C. Losey, John C. Lee, William R. Martin, Thomas C. Adamson, Jr.</i>
<p>

A singular perturbation technique is applied to the time-independent
one-dimensional neutron transport equation with isotropic neutron
scattering. The technique reduces the transport problem to a series of
diffusion theory problems in the interior medium and a series of
simplified transport problems solved analytically in the boundary
layer. The analysis provides a consistent method for deriving and
comparing various diffusion theory approximations to the transport
equation. In addition, the resulting scheme provides a systematic
method for enhancing the accuracy of diffusion theory calculations of
global flux distributions. A general asymptotic expansion of c, the
number of secondary neutrons per collision, is obtained and an
O(<img src="/graphics/symbols/epsilon.gif"><sup>2</sup>) correction to the diffusion theory boundary
condition at a material interface is derived. The perturbation
technique has been applied analytically to both fixed source and
criticality problems. The technique is also incorporated in a
multigroup diffusion theory computer code. In test calculations, the
error in flux distributions is reduced to about one-half that achieved
with standard diffusion theory techniques.

<a name=5><b>The FLEXBURN Neutron Transport Code Developed by the <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> Method with Transmission Probabilities in Arbitrary Square Meshes for Light Water Reactor Fuel Assemblies</b><br></a>
<i>Takanori Kameyama, Tetsuo Matsumura, Makoto Sasaki</i>
<p>

The FLEXBURN neutron transport code is developed by the discrete
ordinates (S<sub>n</sub>) method to analyze heterogeneous fuel
assemblies in light water reactors. The transport equations are
formulated with transmission and leakage probabilities in arbitrary
convex square meshes. Arbitrary convex square meshes precisely
describe fuel assemblies as lattices of cells. The code deals with
fuel assemblies including gadolinia doped fuel rods, water rods, or
plutonium mixed fuel rods with control blades. The code can make
burnup calculation sequentially to high burnup. The results computed
by the FLEXBURN code are validated by comparing them with those of the
ANISN typical transport code and the KENO-IV Monte Carlo code. The
FLEXBURN code provides control blade worth and detailed distributions
of flux, power, burnup, and atomic densities in complicated boiling
water reactor and pressurized water reactor fuel assemblies.

<a name=6><b>Continuous Energy Monte Carlo Calculations of Randomly Distributed Spherical Fuels in High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors Based on a Statistical Geometry Model</b><br></a>
<i>Isao Murata, Takamasa Mori, Masayuki Nakagawa</i>
<p>

The method to treat randomly distributed spherical fuels in continuous
energy Monte Carlo calculations has been established. In this method,
the location of a spherical fuel is sampled probabilistically along
the particle flight path from the spatial probability distribution of
spherical fuels, called the nearest neighbor distribution. The
necessary probability distribution was evaluated by a newly developed
Monte Carlo hard sphere packing simulation code, which employs a
random vector synthesis method to reduce overlaps of spherical
fuels. The obtained probability distribution was validated by
comparing a cross-section photograph of a real fuel compact and an
X-ray diffraction experimental result.
<p>

This method was installed in a Monte Carlo particle transport code and
validated by an inventory check of spherical fuels and criticality
calculations of ordered packing models. Also, an analysis of a
critical assembly experiment was performed with the new code. As a
result, it was confirmed that the method was applicable to practical
reactor analysis.
<p>

The method established is quite unique in the respect of
probabilistically modeling the geometry of a great number of spherical
fuels distributed randomly without any loss of the advantage of the
continuous energy method.


<p>
<a name=7><b>The Two-Region Milne Problem</b><br></a>
<i>B. D. Ganapol, G. C. Pomraning</i>
<p>

We consider the two-region Milne problem, defined as the steady-state
monoenergetic linear transport problem for two adjoining homogeneous
source-free half-spaces, with a particle source coming from infinity
in one of the half-spaces. We demonstrate that the asymptotic (Case
discrete mode) component of the solution for the scalar flux is easily
and explicitly written in terms of Chandrasekhar's H-function for each
medium. This asymptotic solution is shown to exhibit a discontinuity
in both the scalar flux and current at the interface between the two
half-spaces. Numerical benchmark results for the linear extrapolation
distance and the discontinuities are given for various combinations of
the mean number of secondaries (c) characterizing the two
media. Contact is also made with a variational treatment. In
particular, the variational formalism is shown to predict the linear
extrapolation distance and these asymptotic discontinuities correct to
first order in the difference between the values of c
characterizing the two half-spaces.

<a name=8><b>The Effective Fuel Temperature to be Used for Calculating Resonance Absorption in a <sup>238</sup>UO<sub>2</sub> Lump with a Nonuniform Temperature Profile</b><br></a>
<i>W. J. M. de Kruijf, A. J. Janssen</i>
<p>

Calculations of resonance absorption for simple temperature profiles
both in a slab and in a pin of <sup>238</sup>UO<sub>2</sub> are
presented to show the influence of a nonuniform fuel temperature
profile on the choice of the equivalent uniform temperature, or the
effective fuel temperature. The effective fuel temperature is given as
a weighted average of the temperatures in the fuel zones. Two simple
theoretical expressions for this weighted average, derived from the
literature, are discussed. First, for high absorption, the effective
fuel temperature is given by the so-called chord-averaged fuel
temperature. Second, for low absorption, the effective fuel
temperature is given by the volume-averaged fuel temperature. The
results for a slab of <sup>238</sup>UO<sub>2</sub> show that a
brute-force method is necessary to calculate an accurate effective
fuel temperature. A set of weights for one specific
<sup>238</sup>UO<sub>2</sub> pin is calculated. This set agrees well
with the chord-averaged fuel temperature. However, this appears to
be a coincidence because the results for specific neutron energy
ranges do not agree with this set of weights.


<p>
<a name=9><b>The Effect of Gas Injection Configuration on Two-Phase Countercurrent Flow Limitation in Short Vertical Channels</b><br></a>
<i>S. M. Ghiaasiaan, J. D. Bohner, S. I. Abdel-Khalik</i>
<p>

Countercurrent flow limitation in channels with evaporation taking
place inside them is examined. Countercurrent flow limitation in
short, small-diameter channels subject to purely axial, purely radial,
and combined axial and radial gas injection is studied. Experiments
were performed using air and water, with channel diameters 0.475 to
1.91 cm and channel lengths 1.27 to 5.72 cm. Purely axial gas
injection data are shown to agree with Wallis's correlation but with
coefficients that strongly depend on channel dimensions. Purely radial
gas injection data and data obtained with combined axial and radial
gas injection result in flooding curves significantly different from
those representing the purely axial gas injection data and indicate
that near complete flooding (zero liquid penetration) can occur in
small-diameter and short channels due to relatively small radial gas
injection rates. Flooding curves for long or large-diameter channels
are insensitive to the gas injection configuration, however.

<a name=0><b>Linear Transport in Correlated Stochastic Media</b><br></a>
<i>J. Devooght</i>
<p>

The problem of linear transport in a stationary stochastic medium is
examined in the context of stochastic geometry. Boolean models of
stochastic media allow calculation of density correlations without use
of Markovian assumptions. Most correlation functions are well
represented by linear combinations of a few exponentials. Systems of
integrodifferential equations are obtained either (a) by a
perturbative treatment or (b) by truncation of the hierarchy of
moments. The presence of an integral term (i.e., a nonlocal flux) can
be avoided by the use of an approximate equivalence between the
product of the transport Green function by an exponential with the
transport Green function of a modified problem. Introduction of
auxiliary unknowns gives rise to a system of coupled Boltzmann
equations describing the ensemble average of the flux.


<p>
<a name=1><b>The Effectiveness of P<sub>2</sub> and Simplified P<sub>2</sub> Synthetic Accelerations in the Solutions of Discrete Ordinates Transport Equations</b><br></a>
<i>Taewan Noh, Warren F. Miller, Jr.</i>
<p>

Using the operator form of a synthetic acceleration, the P<sub>1</sub>
acceleration [diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA)] and
P<sub>2</sub> acceleration schemes for one-dimensional slab and the
P<sub>1</sub> and simplified P<sub>2</sub> acceleration schemes for
two-dimensional x-y geometry are derived. The convergence rate of each
scheme for a simple model problem is compared, and the result is
generalized by performing a Fourier analysis. In the one-dimensional
case, the new second-moment P<sub>2</sub> acceleration outperforms an
earlier third-moment P<sub>2</sub> acceleration developed by Miller
and Larsen. However, it is still less efficient than P<sub>1</sub>
acceleration. Similar results show that the P<sub>1</sub> acceleration
converges faster than the simplified P<sub>2</sub> acceleration in
two-dimensional x-y geometry. These results confirm that one cannot
simply assume that replacement of the DSA method with a higher order
operator will lead to a smaller spectral radius.


<p>
<a name=2><b>Analysis of Inherent Oscillations in Multidimensional <i>S<sub>N</sub></i> Solutions of the Neutron Transport Equation</b><br></a>
<i>Bojan G. Petrovic, Alireza Haghighat</i>
<p>

Recent pressure vessel fast fluence calculations have revealed
numerical difficulties (spatial oscillations) in the S<sub>N</sub>
solutions, which have persisted in spite of mesh refinement. It is
demonstrated that other shielding/deep-penetration applications may be
affected; in fact, any S<sub>N</sub> solution in which the uncollided
flux component is significant is likely to exhibit such difficulties.
<p>

Test problems have been designed to characterize and understand
numerical difficulties. Main analyses are performed using the
diamond-difference (DD) scheme, which is linear and forms the basis
for other (more complex) low-order differencing schemes. The genesis
of oscillations is shown to be related to several effects specific for
multidimensional geometries as follows: ambiguity in the
interpretation of boundary conditions, discontinuities, and different
directions of particle streaming and differencing. It has further been
explained why the mesh refinement does not produce the intuitively
expected results.
<p>

Other low-order differencing schemes (e.g., the DD with negative flux
fixup and the <img src="/graphics/symbols/theta.gif">-weighted) may partly remedy the situation by
reducing the oscillations or by eliminating the oscillations at a cost
of ``oversmoothing'' the results everywhere (e.g., the zero-weighted
scheme). These schemes provide more robust solutions, but the inherent
difficulties (although reduced) still remain.
<p>

Types of discontinuities that trigger the oscillations are also
examined; it is difficult to envisage an actual practical application
free of such discontinuities. The magnitude of numerical difficulties
(oscillations) and their practical relevance will depend on all
S<sub>N</sub> model features, the differencing scheme being used, and
the application requirements, but this study has shown that they are
inherent to multidimensional finite-difference S<sub>N</sub>
algorithms.

The analytical representation of eigenfunctions for finite moments
method approximations of radiative transport equations is constructed
in slab geometry problems. The truncated balance algorithm is used. An
angle dependence of discrete eigenfunctions is determined by discrete
characteristic equation solutions. It is established that
space-dependent factors of discrete eigenfunctions are Pade
approximations of the exponential functions and correspond to the
original transport problem eigenfunctions. This technique proves to be
useful for analyzing solvability and accuracy of finite moment
approximations and also for developing computational
algorithms. Slowly changing eigenfunctions are included in the regular
component of the optically thick slab problem solution. Coarse-mesh
algorithms or diffusion approximations at specific boundary conditions
can be used to determine these components. Other eigenfunctions
determine the singular component of the mesh solution. This component
represents the transition regime on coarse meshes with typical
oscillations or with a slow decrease in boundary layers. It is
strongly different from the singular component of the exact solution.

<a name=4><b>A Diffusion-Accelerated Solution Method for the Nonlinear Characteristic Scheme in Slab Geometry</b><br></a>
<i>Todd A. Wareing, Wallace F. Walters, Jim E. Morel</i>
<p>

Recently, the nonlinear characteristic (NC) scheme for spatially
discretizing the discrete ordinates equations was introduced. This
scheme is accurate for both optically thin and optically thick spatial
meshes and produces strictly positive angular fluxes. The NC discrete
ordinates equations can be solved using the source iteration method;
however, it is well known that this method converges prohibitively
slowly for optically thick problems with scattering ratios at or near
unity. A general nonlinear diffusion synthetic acceleration method for
solving the NC equations in slab geometry is described. Numerical
results to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the new solution
method are provided.

<a name=5><b>Accounting for Strong Localized Heterogeneities and Local Transport Effect in Core Calculation</b><br></a>
<i>J. M. Ruggieri, R. Boyer, J. Y. Doriath, P. J. Finck</i>
<p>

Two methods based on the variational nodal transport method have been
developed to account for localized heterogeneities and local transport
effects in full core calculations. A local mesh refinement technique
relies on using the projected partial ingoing surface currents
produced during coarse-mesh iterations as boundary conditions for
fine-mesh calculations embedded within the coarse-mesh
calculations. The outgoing fine-mesh partial currents are averaged to
serve in the coarse-mesh iterations. Then, a mixed transport-diffusion
method using two levels of angular approximations for the surface
partial currents depending on the node considered has been implemented
to account for local transport effects in full core diffusion
calculations. These methods have been tested for a model of the
Superphenix complementary shutdown rods.

<a name=6><b>Particle Transport in the Presence of Parametric Noise</b><br></a>
<i>Anil K. Prinja, Alejandro Gonzalez-Aller</i>
<p>

Particle transport in rod and plane geometry random media is
considered. The cross section is assumed to be a continuous random
function of position, with fluctuations about the mean taken as
Gaussian distributed. In rod geometry, an exact closure is constructed
for semi-infinite media that yields exact equations for the
ensemble-averaged scalar flux <img src="/graphics/symbols/phi.gif"> and current J. The same closure
scheme yields a Fokker-Planck equation for the joint probability
distribution function of <img src="/graphics/symbols/phi.gif"> and J, from which ensemble-averaged
equations for higher order quantities are derived and solved exactly
for an arbitrary correlation function. Finally, the penetration of a
beam of charged particles in a highly forward scattering random medium
is considered, and circumstances that yield a closed ensemble-averaged
transport equation are determined.

<a name=7><b>Efficient Higher Order Nodal Finite Element Formulations for Neutron Multigroup Diffusion Equations</b><br></a>
<i>J. P. Hennart, E. M. Malambu, E. H. Mund, E. del Valle</i>
<p>

Several polynomial finite elements of nodal type are introduced that
should lead to convergence of O(h<sup>3</sup>) in the L<sup>2</sup>
norm. Two of these methods are new and are expected to achieve the
same orders of convergence with fewer parameters than the third
method. They are applied to the one-group diffusion equation under
different formulations, namely, several versions (with or without
reduced and transverse integrations) of the primal and the
mixed-hybrid formulations.
<p>

Convergence rates are checked for a model problem with an analytical
solution. Two of these methods exhibit superconvergence phenomena
[O(h<sup>4</sup>) instead of O(h<sup>3</sup>)], a fact that can be
explained heuristically. The most promising method, with only five
parameters per cell, turns out to yield only O(h<sup>2</sup>) in its
most algebraically efficient versions, while it has the potential of
O(h<sup>3</sup>) convergence rates. Again, an explanation is given for
this behavior and a fully O(h<sup>3</sup>) version is developed.
<p>

Finally, these methods are applied to more realistic multigroup
situations. In all cases, they are compared with results obtained from
polynomial nodal methods in response matrix formalism. In the
multigroup case, a well-known reference solution is also used.

<a name=8><b>Methods and Performance of the Three-Dimensional Pressurized Water Reactor Core Dynamics SIMTRAN On-Line Code</b><br></a>
<i>Jose M. Aragones, Carol Ahnert, Oscar Cabellos</i>
<p>

New reactor physics and computation methods have been developed in our
three-dimensional pressurized water reactor (PWR) core dynamics
SIMTRAN code for on-line surveillance and prediction. The accuracy of
the coupled neutronic thermal-hydraulic solution is improved, and its
scope is extended to provide, mainly, the calculation of the fission
reaction rates at the in-core minidetectors, the responses at the
ex-core detectors, and the in-vessel coolant flow and temperature
distributions.
<p>

The functional capabilities implemented in the on-line SIMTRAN code
include on-line surveillance, in-core-ex-core calibration, evaluation
of peak power factors and thermal margins, nominal cycle follow,
prediction of maneuvers, and diagnosis of fast transients and
oscillations. The new code has been operating on-line at the
Vandellos-II PWR unit in Spain since the startup of its cycle 7 in
mid-June 1994, including the machine-man interfaces for on-line
acquisition of measured data and interactive graphical utilization.
<p>

The agreement of the simulations with the measurements, along the full
cycle 7 and the first months of cycle 8 operation, is well within the
accuracy requirements. The performance and usefulness for operational
support shown during the demo and routine use phases have proved that
the on-line SIMTRAN code has the qualities for the accurate, reliable,
comprehensive, and user-friendly on-line core surveillance and
prediction.

<a name=9><b>Numerical Stability of the Six-Equation, Single-Pressure Model with Viscous Terms</b><br></a>
<i>J. Michael Doster, Mark A. Holmes</i>
<p>

A standard model for describing time-dependent two-phase flows is the
so-called six-equation or two-fluid model, where mass, energy, and
momentum equations are considered for each phase. It is well known
that the single-pressure form of this model can contain complex
characteristics and is therefore ill posed. This ill-posedness has
been blamed for numerical instabilities that have at times been
observed when finite difference solutions of these equations have been
attempted. One method to render the characteristics real is to include
viscous terms. The numerical implications of adding viscous terms to
the six-equation model are considered, and the potential impact of
these implications on the stability of the finite difference solution
is evaluated.


<p>
<a name=10><b>A Parallel Multigrid Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Algorithm for Groundwater Flow Simulations</b><br></a>
<i>Steven F. Ashby, Robert D. Falgout</i>
<p>

The numerical simulation of groundwater flow through heterogeneous
porous media is discussed. The focus is on the performance of a
parallel multigrid preconditioner for accelerating convergence of
conjugate gradients, which is used to compute the pressure head. The
numerical investigation considers the effects of boundary conditions,
coarse grid solver strategy, increasing the grid resolution, enlarging
the domain, and varying the geostatistical parameters used to define
the subsurface realization. Scalability is also examined. The results
were obtained using the ParFlow groundwater flow simulator on the CRAY
T3D massively parallel computer.

<a name=11><b>Incorporation of a New Spectral History Correction Method into Local Power Reconstruction for Nodal Methods</b><br></a>
<i>C. H. Lee, Y. J. Kim, J. W. Song, C. O. Park</i>
<p>

The spectral history problem encountered in reconstructing local
homogeneous power distributions is investigated. Because of
difficulties in most nodal codes concerning spectral interactions
between neighboring assemblies when rebuilding the local power
distribution, nodal codes assume a constant spectrum or do not
properly consider local spectrum variations within an assembly. A
simple, fuel-type-independent method is presented to eliminate the
spectrum-induced errors from local homogeneous powers within an
assembly over the entire burnup range. The method, which is
generalized for its application to any fuel type in the entire
assembly burnup domain, uses the proportional relationship between
macroscopic cross sections and average spectral history
indices. Verification results through embedded calculations and an
actual core calculation show that local homogeneous power errors are
reduced to the same magnitude as flux errors. The error reduction is
conspicuous in the cases of mixed-oxide and highly poisoned fuel
assemblies.


<p>
<a name=12><b>On the Neutron Noise Diagnostics of Pressurized Water Reactor Control Rod Vibrations--IV: Application of Neural Networks</b><br></a>
<i>I. Pazsit, N. S. Garis, O. Glockler</i>
<p>

A neutron noise-based technique for the localization of excessively
vibrating control rods is elaborated upon in the previous three papers
of this series. The method is based on the inversion of a formula that
expresses the auto- and cross spectra of three neutron detector
signals through the parameters of the vibrating rod, i.e., equilibrium
position and displacement components.
<p>

Successful tests of the algorithm with both simulated and real data
were reported in the previous papers. The algorithm had nevertheless
certain drawbacks, namely, that its use requires expert knowledge, the
redundancy of extra detectors cannot be utilized, and with realistic
transfer functions the calculations are rather lengthy.
<p>

The use of neural networks offers an alternative way of performing the
inversion procedure. This possibility was investigated by constructing
a network that was trained to determine the rod position from the
detector spectra. It was found that all shortcomings of the
traditional localization method can be eliminated. The neural
network-based identification was also tested with success.


<p>
<a name=13><b>Multiobjective Pressurized Water Reactor Reload Core Design by Nondominated Genetic Algorithm Search</b><br></a>
<i>G. T. Parks</i>
<p>

The design of pressurized water reactor reload cores is not only a
formidable optimization problem but also, in many instances, a
multiobjective problem. A genetic algorithm (GA) designed to perform
true multiobjective optimization on such problems is described.
<p>

Genetic algorithms simulate natural evolution. They differ from most
optimization techniques by searching from one group of solutions to
another, rather than from one solution to another. New solutions are
generated by breeding from existing solutions. By selecting better (in
a multiobjective sense) solutions as parents more often, the
population can be evolved to reveal the trade-off surface between the
competing objectives.
<p>

An example illustrating the effectiveness of this novel method is
presented and analyzed. It is found that in solving a reload design
problem the algorithm evaluates a similar number of loading patterns
to other state-of-the-art methods, but in the process reveals much
more information about the nature of the problem being solved. The
actual computational cost incurred depends on the core simulator used;
the GA itself is code independent.


<p>
<a name=14><b>Fuel Management Optimization Using Genetic Algorithms and Expert Knowledge</b><br></a>
<i>Michael D. DeChaine, Madeline A. Feltus</i>
<p>

The CIGARO fuel management optimization code based on genetic
algorithms is described and tested. The test problem optimized the
core lifetime for a pressurized water reactor with a penalty function
constraint on the peak normalized power. A bit-string genotype encoded
the loading patterns, and genotype bias was reduced with additional
bits. Expert knowledge about fuel management was incorporated into the
genetic algorithm. Regional crossover exchanged physically adjacent
fuel assemblies and improved the optimization slightly. Biasing the
initial population toward a known priority table significantly
improved the optimization.


<p>
<a name=15><b>Monte Carlo Calculation of Point-Detector Sensitivities to Material Parameters</b><br></a>
<i>R. L. Perel, J. J. Wagschal, Y. Yeivin</i>
<p>

Hall's differential operator method for the Monte Carlo calculation of
sensitivities was extended so as to apply to point-detector-type
problems. By this method, the evaluation of the sensitivities of the
detector response (or, equivalently, those of the neutron flux at the
detector) to material parameters of interest (cross sections, average
number of fission neutrons, number densities) is concurrent with that
of the very response. In such a Monte Carlo game, the neutron
histories, or paths, are sampled, collision by collision, and the
calculated contributions of each collision to the response and to its
partial derivatives with respect to the parameters of interest are
accumulated. For each path, these sums are the estimates for the
response and its respective sensitivities. The Monte Carlo evaluations
are then the respective averages of the individual path
estimates. This procedure was applied to the analysis of the
time-of-flight spectra of the leakage from several of the Livermore
pulsed spheres. As an illustration, measured and calculated spectra
and some calculated sensitivities are depicted and discussed.

<a name=0><b>Response Functions for Neutron Skyshine Analysis</b><br></a>
<i>Ah Auu Gui, J. Kenneth Shultis, Richard E. Faw</i>
<p>

Neutron and associated secondary photon line-beam response functions
(LBRFs) for point monodirectional neutron sources are generated using
the MCNP Monte Carlo code for use in neutron skyshine analysis
employing the integral line-beam method. The LBRFs are evaluated at 14
neutron source energies ranging from 0.01 to 14 MeV and at 18 emission
angles from 1 to 170 deg, as measured from the source-to-detector
axis. The neutron and associated secondary photon conical-beam
response functions (CBRFs) for azimuthally symmetric neutron sources
are also evaluated at 13 neutron source energies in the same energy
range and at 13 polar angles of source collimation from 1 to 89
deg. The response functions are approximated by an empirical
three-parameter function of the source-to-detector distance. These
response function approximations are available for a
source-to-detector distance up to 2500 m and, for the first time, give
dose equivalent responses that are required for modern radiological
assessments. For the CBRFs, ground correction factors for neutrons and
secondary photons are calculated and also approximated by empirical
formulas for use in air-over-ground neutron skyshine problems with
azimuthal symmetry. In addition, simple procedures are proposed for
humidity and atmospheric density corrections.

<a name=1><b>A New Weight-Dependent Direct Statistical Approach Model</b><br></a>
<i>K. W. Burn</i>
<p>

A weight-dependent capability is inserted into the direct statistical
approach (DSA) to optimize splitting and Russian roulette (RR)
parameters in Monte Carlo particle transport calculations. In the new
model, splitting or RR is carried out on a progenitor arriving at a
surface in such a way that the weight of the progeny is fixed (for the
particular surface). Thus, the model is named the DSA weight line
model. In the presence of weight-dependent games, all components of
the second moment, and the time, are not separable. In the absence of
weight-dependent games, the component of the second moment describing
the weight-dependent splitting or RR is still not separable. Two
approximations are examined to render this component separable under
these circumstances. One of these approximations, named the noninteger
approximation, looks promising. The new DSA model with the noninteger
approximation is tested on four sample problems. Comparisons with the
previous weight-independent DSA model and with the MCNP (version 4a)
weight window generator are made.


<p>
<a name=2><b>The Generalized P<sub>N</sub> Synthetic Acceleration Method for Linear Transport Problems with Highly Anisotropic Scattering</b><br></a>
<i>Kassem M. Khattab</i>
<p>

The diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) method has been known to be
an effective tool for accelerating the iterative solution of transport
equations with isotropic or mildly anisotropic scattering. However,
the DSA method is not effective for transport equations that have
strongly anisotropic scattering. A generalization of the modified DSA
(MDSA) method is proposed that converges (clock time) faster than the
MDSA method. This method is developed, the results of a Fourier
analysis that theoretically predicts its efficiency are described, and
numerical results that verify the theoretical prediction are
presented.


<p>
<a name=3><b>Resonance Calculations Using the Multiband Method and Interface Currents</b><br></a>
<i>Masahiro Tatsumi, Tomoko Ito, Toshikazu Takeda, Masatoshi Yamasaki, Akio Yamamoto, Masaharu Takayasu</i>
<p>

To provide accurate effective cross sections for core calculations,
the multiband method was applied to light water reactor assembly
calculations. The multiband method has been extended to arbitrary
geometries by introducing band-dependent currents at the boundaries of
a region. The transport of neutron is treated by the angular
space-dependent current coupling collision probability method. A fuel
assembly is divided into heterogeneous domains where the multiband
method is applied directly by using collision probabilities.
<p>

Several examples of numerical calculations for UO<sub>2</sub> and
mixed oxide fuel assemblies are shown. The space dependence of the
effective cross section can be expressed accurately by this method,
which leads to an accurate prediction of k<sub><img alt=""

<p>
<a name=4><b>A Geometry-Independent Fine-Mesh-Based Monte Carlo Importance Generator</b><br></a>
<i>Lianyan Liu, Robin P. Gardner</i>
<p>

A new importance map approach for Monte Carlo simulation that can be
used in an adaptive fashion has been identified and developed. It is
based on using a mesh-based system of weight windows that are
independent of any physical geometric cells. It consists of an
importance map generator and a splitting and Russian roulette
algorithm for a mesh-based weight windows game that is used in an
iterative fashion to obtain increasingly efficient results. The
general purpose Monte Carlo code MCNP is modified to incorporate this
new mesh-based importance map generator and matching weight window
technique for variance reduction. Two nuclear well logging
problems--one for neutrons and the other for gamma rays--are used to
test the new importance map generator. Results show that the new
generator is able to produce four to six times larger figures of merit
than MCNP's physical geometry cell-based importance map
generator. More importantly, the superior user friendliness of this
new mesh-based generator makes variance reduction easy to accomplish.

<i>S. Hlavac, L. Dostal, I. Turzo, A. Pavlik, H. Vonach</i>
<p>

The gamma radiation from the interaction of 14.6-MeV neutrons with
aluminum has been investigated by high-resolution germanium-detector
gamma-ray spectroscopy. Cross sections for gamma lines from the
<SUP>27</SUP>Al(n,n'<img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">),
(n,p<img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">), and (n,np<img

measured at an emission angle of 125 deg. The results are compared
with previous measurements and with predictions based on the
statistical theory of nuclear reactions (including direct and
precompound contributions). The current results are within the range
of values reported in the widely discrepant previous measurements and
thus allow the resolution of these discrepancies. The relative
intensities of the gamma lines analyzed in this work are in good
agreement with the results of a white neutron source measurement
performed by two of the authors at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The
measured gamma-ray production cross sections were compared with the
results of nuclear model calculations using the GNASH code. The
agreement with the calculated cross sections is unsatisfactory. The
results of the statistical calculations are on average ~20% below the
measured cross sections, and there are also some discrepancies between
the calculated and measured relative intensities for the different
lines from the (n,n'<img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">)
reaction.

<a name=6><b>Measurement of Neutron Energy Spectrum Below 10 keV in an Iron Shield Bombarded by Deuterium-Tritium Neutrons and Benchmark Test of Evaluated Nuclear Data from 14 MeV to 1 eV</b><br></a>
<i>F. Maekawa, Y. Oyama</i>
<p>

Neutron spectra below 10 keV in an iron shield assembly bombarded by
deuterium-tritium neutrons are measured with accuracy between 5 to 13%
by adopting the slowing-down time method. The measurement supplemented
previous spectrum measurements for higher energies so that the neutron
spectrum in the whole energy range from 14 MeV down to 0.3 eV is now
available. Benchmark tests of iron data in JENDL-3.1, JENDL-3.2, JENDL
fusion file, and FENDL/E-1.0 were carried out in the whole energy
range with experimental uncertainty at ~10% by utilizing the present
and previous experiments. As a result, it was found that cross-section
data in the newer versions of JENDL were improved in terms of
agreement with the experiment. Calculation with JENDL fusion file and
FENDL/E-1.0 could predict neutron fluxes in the whole energy range
within 20 and 15%, respectively. Possible over- and underestimations
for nonelastic and elastic cross sections, respectively, at 14 MeV in
all JENDLs were pointed out. It was confirmed that low-energy neutron
fluxes were very sensitive to Q values for discrete inelastic cross
sections of natural iron and <SUP>57</SUP>Fe(n,n'<sub>1</sub>)
reaction, which were not adequately treated in JENDL-3.1.

<a name=8><b>Experimental Study on Buoyancy-Driven Exchange Flows Through Breaches of a Tokamak Vacuum Vessel in a Fusion Reactor Under the Loss-of-Vacuum-Event Condition</b><br></a>
<i>Kazuyuki Takase, Kunugi Tomoaki, Masurou Ogawa, Yasushi Seki</i>
<p>

As one of thermofluid safety studies in the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, buoyancy-driven exchange flow
behavior through breaches of a vacuum vessel (VV) has been
investigated quantitatively by using a preliminary
loss-of-vacuum-event (LOVA) apparatus that simulated the tokamak VV of
a fusion reactor with a small-scaled model. To carry out the present
experiments under the atmospheric pressure condition, helium gas and
air were provided as the working fluids. The inside of the VV was
initially filled with helium gas and the outside was atmosphere. The
breaches on the VV under the LOVA condition were simulated by opening
six simulated breaches to which were set the different positions on
the VV. When the buoyancy-driven exchange flow through the breach
occurred, helium gas went out from the inside of the VV through the
breach to the outside and air flowed into the inside of the VV through
the breach from the outside. The exchange rate in the VV between
helium gas and air was calculated from the measured weight change of
the VV with time since the experiment has started. Experimental
parameters were breach position, breach number, breach length, breach
size, and breach combination. The present study clarifies that the
relation between the exchange rate and the breach position of the VV
depended on the magnitude of the potential energy from the ground
level to the breach position, and then, the exchange rate decreased as
the breach length increased and as the breach size decreased.

<i>Joel L. McDuffee, Arthur E. Ruggles</i>
<p>

A model is presented for predicting the pressure gradient in partially
developed subcooled boiling of water for velocities from 15 to 30 m/s
and inlet peaked, nonuniform axial flux profiles with channel average
flux values of 6 MW/m<SUP>2</SUP>. The partially and fully developed
boiling regions are considered separately, however; the same general
modeling technique is used for both. Several correlations for the void
fraction at onset of significant void are considered, and their effect
on the channel pressure drop is evaluated. The effect of nonuniform
axial heat flux on the channel pressure drop is also evaluated. The
model is compared with pressure drop data from the thermal-hydraulic
test loop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and is found to agree with
the data within 24%.

<p>

Validation of neutron fluence on VVER-440 pressure vessel methodology
is performed by comparative analysis of calculational compared with
experimental results for the induced activity of scraps taken out from
the inner surface of the VVER reactor pressure vessel after the 14th
and 17th cycles. The mean deviation of 9% between the experimental and
the calculated activity values is evaluated. The good consistency of
the results demonstrates the validity of the neutron fluence
calculational methodology.

<a name="1"><b>Concurrent Source Iteration in the Solution of
Three-Dimensional, Multigroup Discrete Ordinates Neutron Transport
Equations</b></a><br>
<i>Milo R. Dorr, Charles H. Still</i>
<p>

A strategy for implementing source iteration on massively parallel
computers for use in solving multigroup discrete ordinates neutron
transport equations on three-dimensional Cartesian grids is proposed
and analyzed. Based on an analysis of the memory requirement and
floating-point complexity of the formal matrix-vector multiplication
effected by a single source iteration, a data decomposition and
communication strategy is presented that is designed to achieve good
scalability with respect to all phase-space variables, i.e., neutron
position, energy, and direction. A performance model is developed to
analyze the scalability properties of the algorithm and to provide
computational and heuristic strategies for determining a data
decomposition that minimizes wall clock execution time. Numerical
results are presented to demonstrate the performance of a specific
implementation of this approach on a 1024-node nCUBE/2.
<p>

<a name="2"><b>The Simplified P<sub>2</sub> Approximation</b></a><br>
<i>Djordje I. Tomasevic, Edward W. Larsen</i>
<p>

The simplified P<sub>2</sub> (SP<sub>2</sub>) approximation to the
transport equation is derived by a formal procedure and by a
variational analysis. The variational analysis yields the
SP<sub>2</sub> equations, together with interface and Marshak-like
boundary conditions. Numerical calculations show that the resulting
SP<sub>2</sub> solution is generally more accurate than the
P<sub>1</sub> solution for both integral quantities and detailed flux
distributions, except near material interfaces, where the
SP<sub>2</sub> solution is discontinuous.
<p>

<a name="3"><b>Efficient Monte Carlo Simulation of <sup>16</sup>O
Neutron Activation and <sup>16</sup>N Decay Gamma-Ray Detection in a
Flowing Fluid for On-Line Oxygen Analysis or Flow Rate
Measurement</b></a><br>
<i>R. P. Gardner, C. L. Barrett, W. Haq, D. E. Peplow</i>
<p>

A Monte Carlo code named MCNAFF has been developed and tested for flow
rate measurement and general composition determination of a flowing
fluid by neutron activation analysis. Specifically, oxygen
determination in a flowing fluid is treated, including simulating the
emission and transport of neutrons in the fluid, the activation of
<sup>16</sup>O to <sup>16</sup>N, the subsequent flow and dispersion of
the <sup>16</sup>N in the flow channel, the downstream decay of
<sup>16</sup>N, and the subsequent detection of the emitted decay gamma
rays. This code is very efficient, partly because (a) the continuous
single history approach has been taken, which follows a single history
from emission of a neutron, through the production and decay of the
<sup>16</sup>N and the emission of a characteristic gamma ray, and
finally to the full energy detection of the gamma ray and (b) the
principle of forcing can be and is used throughout so that almost
every history results in a partial success. Th!  e present MCNAFF code
is capable of calculating gamma-ray detection yields per neutron
emitted to the same accuracy as an approach by Perez-Griffo, Block,
and Lahey, which numerically solves the partial differential equations
for modeling particle dispersion and diffusion and calculates
separately by Monte Carlo both the neutron absorption and gamma-ray
detection process. The MCNAFF code is estimated to be about two orders
of magnitude faster and should be more convenient to use because all
calculations are accomplished in a single step.
<p>


<a name="4"><b>A Point-Kinetics Approach to Sensitivity Study of Fast
Reactor Dynamic Behavior and Delayed Neutron Spectra</b></a><br>
<i>S. Das</i>
<p>

The method of point reactor kinetics in conjunction with the new
concepts of delayed spectrum factor and beta growth factor is used to
calculate the sensitivity of the dynamic behavior of a fast breeder
reactor to large changes in delayed neutron energies following
postulated reactivity accidents. The positive ramp rates are
introduced not to simulate physical possibilities but solely to test
the sensitivity to delayed neutron spectral changes under different
conditions. A limited number of transient calculations are made using
the point-kinetics code SENSTVTY, six precursor groups, and Doppler
feedback. The calculational method and the reactor model are
described. Delayed neutron requirements in reactor dynamics are
discussed, and a brief review of the sensitivity studies is
presented. The results of the sensitivity calculations indicate that
the relative power, the peak power, and the accident energy release
are sensitive to changes in <img
src=/graphics/symbols/beta.gif align=absbottom><sub>eff</sub> resulting from unc!
ertainty in the delayed spectral data, but the sensitivity of the
relative power is much greater than the peak power and the accident
energy release. The spread in the maximum reactivity reached is found
to be ~18%, and the time spread in the melting
of fuel and cladding is in milliseconds.
<p>


<a name="5"><b>Estimation of Measured Control Rod Worths in Fast
Breeder Test Reactor--Effect of Different Delayed Neutron
Parameters</b></a><br>
<i>P. Mohanakrishnan, C. P. Reddy, V. Gopalakrishnan, John Arul</i>
<p>

Control rod worths have been measured by the inverse kinetics method
in the small PuC-UC core of the Fast Breeder Test Reactor at
Kalpakkam. Delayed neutron fractional yields based on Tuttle's data,
ENDF/B-VI data, and the full summation approach of Brady and England
have been used to get measured control rod worths. Unreasonably large
reductions in control rod worths are obtained by the ENDF/B-VI
data. It is suspected that the procedure, of normalizing fractional
yields obtained by the summation approach to earlier evaluated total
yields, is inconsistent.
<p>


<a name="6"><b>Neutron Scattering Angular Distribution in
<sup>239</sup>Pu at 570 and 700 keV</b></a><br>
<i>Gang Yue, Michael O'Connor, James J. Egan, Gunter H. R. Kegel</i>
<p>

Neutron elastic and inelastic scattering in <sup>239</sup>Pu have been
studied via the time-of-flight technique. Neutrons were generated by
the <sup>7</sup>Li(p,n)<sup>7</sup>Be reaction at the University of
Massachusetts Lowell 5.5-MV Van de Graaff Accelerator
Laboratory. Angular distributions were measured at 570 and 700 keV for
two level groups, ground state plus first excited state, and second
plus third excited state. The plutonium sample was disk-shaped with a
mass of 28.7 g. The angle-integrated cross sections obtained for the
two scattered neutron groups, one corresponding to the elastic plus
7.9 keV level and the other corresponding to the inelastic 57 keV plus
76 keV levels, were 5864 <img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 264 mb and 570 <img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 42 mb, respectively, for
570-keV incident neutrons and 5060 <img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 308 mb and 518 <img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 62 mb,
respectively, for 700-keV incident neutrons. The results are compared
with ENDF/B-VI and with the measurement of Haouat et al. at 700 keV.
<p>


<a name="7"><b>Cross-Section Calculations for Neutron-Induced Reactions
up to 50 MeV</b></a><br>
<i>Nobuhiro Yamamuro</i>
<p>

In the field of accelerator development, medium-energy reaction
cross-section data for structural materials of accelerator and
shielding components are required, especially for radiation protection
purposes. For a d + Li stripping reaction neutron source used in
materials research, neutron reaction cross sections up to 50 MeV are
necessary for the design study of neutron irradiation facilities.
<p>

The current version of SINCROS-II is able to calculate neutron- and
proton-induced reaction cross sections up to ~50 MeV with some
modifications and extensions of the cross-section calculation
code. The production of isotopes when structural materials and other
materials are bombarded with neutrons or protons is calculated using a
revised code in the SINCROS-II system. The parameters used in the
cross-section calculations are mainly examined with proton-induced
reactions because the experimental data for neutrons above 20 MeV are
rare. The status of medium mass nuclide evaluations for aluminum,
silicon, chromium, manganese, and copper is presented. These data are
useful to estimate the radiation and transmutation of nuclei in the
materials.
<p>


<a name="8"><b>Evaluation of Reconstruction Methods for Time-Resolved
Spectroscopy of Short-Pulsed Neutron Sources</b></a><br>
<i>Ion Tiseanu, Teddy Craciunescu</i>
<p>

A comparison of five methods for the reconstruction of the
time-resolved neutron energy spectrum of short-pulsed neutron sources
from time-of-flight measurements is reported. The first method is an
analog Monte Carlo reconstruction technique (AMCRT), expressly
designed for the optimization of such measurements. It was proved that
the studied problem can be treated as a tomographic one with a limited
data set. A Fourier convolution and backprojection method and three
other tomographic methods, which have been shown to work with a
limited data set, are used: the maximum entropy method, the algebraic
reconstruction technique, and a Monte Carlo implementation of the
backprojection (MCBP) technique. Through numerical tests, the quality
of reconstructions in different image geometries at various noise
levels has been studied. Besides the AMCRT method, which produces the
best results, good reconstructions are also obtained using MCBP and
maximum entropy. If computing time must be min!  imized, the maximum
entropy algorithm is most convenient. This algorithm could be used
routinely in time-resolved spectroscopy measurements.
<p>


<a name="9"><b>A Test of Main Stream Pin Power Reconstruction
Methods</b></a><br>
<i>Peter Grimm, Menashe Aboudy, Alex Galperin, Meir Segev</i>
<p>

Preliminary to implementing a pin power reconstruction scheme in the
nodal core calculations of the ELCOS system, the ``main stream''
methods and elements thereof were tested against fine-mesh
calculations of a number of benchmark ``small cores'' consisting of
uranium, controlled uranium, and mixed-oxide assemblies. Overall, the
results do not clearly favor one of the methods. However, test details
conduce us to prefer the 32-term expansion for corner-point fluxes
over their determination by the separability assumption, and the
21-term expansion of the intranodal flux over the 13-term
expansion. There is little difference whether the factorization of the
pin power distribution into global and form factors is imposed on the
group fluxes or on the power. Data transfers and matrix inversions
connected with the many-term flux expansions slow down the nodal
calculation. This condition may be alleviated in some cases by an
approximation leading to fewer matrix inversions.
<p>


<a name="10"><b>Power Series Solutions of the Reactor Kinetics
Equations</b></a><br>
<i>Jay Basken, Jeffery D. Lewins</i>
<p>

Accurate solutions of the reactor kinetics equations in a lumped model
with time-varying reactivity have been obtained using a spreadsheet on
a personal computer (PC)/workstation from a straightforward power
series recurrence relation. These have been shown to converge readily
over time steps of ~1101,1,3I s in models of a thermal
reactor. Solutions over such macrosteps can readily be extended to
durations of interest (~100 s). Examples are given for both a ramp
reactivity input and an oscillating reactivity. This latter shows in a
direct fashion the first-order phase distortion and the second-order
effect on power level that are generally associated with perturbation
solutions that have to be taken to second order. The method applies
also to fast reactors. It is concluded that accurate calculations of
thermal and fast reactor transients, obtained analytically with
considerable difficulty, are readily available to the student on a PC.  <p>


<a name="11"><b>Experiments on Steam Generator Water Level Swell and
Shrinkage</b></a><br>
<i>B. S. Moon, K. R. Kim, J. S. Moon, S. B. Kim</i>
<p>

Equipment that is one-tenth the size of the steam generators for the
Westinghouse 900-MW(electric) nuclear power plants is used to study
the swell and shrinkage of the water level. The cyclic aspect of level
swell and shrinkage occurring during low-power operation of the
nuclear power plants is realized by sequential steam dump valve
control. Experimental results show that a simple mathematical model
based on the amount of steam generated during depressurization
provides a good approximation for predicting level swell and
shrinkage. Steam generation also causes water movement between the
downcomer area and the inner part of the vessel, the effect of which
during the initial steam dump period is estimated and applied to
adjust this model.

reduction with the recent results of

also compared with calculations based on the statistical model.

<a name="general"><h3>General Comments</h3></a>

First, another note about the differences between mark-up languages
and word processors.  The importance of these differences is rooted in
the portability of documents.
<p>

The first issue is that of software portability.  For example, when
you prepare a document with extensive formatting in the newest version
of WordPerfect, other users who with Lotus AmiPro, old MS Word, or
even older WordPerfect versions will be unable to read your document.
This is because the formatting of the document is very specific to the
software which you used.
<p>

Next is "user" portability.  Since the WWW is designed to spread
information to a maximum number of people, it has always been
important to consider the needs and capabilities of the many users.
Although the WWW was not really popularized until the creation of the
graphical Mosaic software at UI at Urban-Champaign, it is still
possible to find text based software for browsing the WWW.  This is
important for a number of different segments of the global population:
<ol>
  <li> visually impaired,
  <li> connection impaired (people with slow internet connections),
  <li> technology impaired (people with simpler technology such as
       those in developing nations).
</ol>

For this reason, basic mark-up is based on the idea of suggesting how
pieces of text should be considered (emphasized, strong, headings)
rather than specifying the exact format (bold, italics, font size).
<p>

By specifying, for example, that a piece of text should be emphasized
(rather than italicised) each person who reads that document can have
a different way of providing that emphasis.  Most readers may, in
fact, interpret emphasis as italics.  However, for blind users, it may
be read from their screen in a different tone or pitch.  For users of
text terminals, it may be underlined, and so on.
<p>

That said, the lines between mark-up and formatting have become
blurred over the development of the WWW.  This is because the authors
of most of these documents are used to having more influence over how
their documents look.  This is the subject of much debate amongst the
diehards of mark-up languages, but should not concern you directly.
<p>

What you should be aware of is the way that your HTML document may be
interpreted by other readers!!!!

<hr>


Many different software packages are available to assist in marking up
text documents with HTML.  They fill the whole range of price and
effectiveness.  In most cases, however, they will work just like a
word processor, but don't forget what I just said... this is mark-up
not word processing.  With most of these packages, you will probably
realize this immediately: a page which you looked one way in the HTML
authoring program will look different when viewed from your WWW
browser!
<p>

That should not discourage you from using such software, however.  The
originators of the WWW never intended the average person to have to
learn the intricacies of HTML.  Instead, they expected such tools to
be developed so that people could easily generate such documents.
<p>

On the other hand, one almost always gives up some of the fine control
which is available when you directly edit the HTML by hand, an often
tedious process.  (Author's note: Since I have been involved from the
early days of the WWW, I edit all my HTML by hand with some tools and
macros.  On the other hand, I have explored some of the other programs
which are out there and many of them are quite adequate.)

<hr>

As a new HTML author, the biggest bonus about HTML and the WWW is that
it is an entirely open concept.  This means that if you are browsing
the WWW and see an effect (blinking text or a well constructed table)
that you find interesting and effective, you can simply view the HTML
which was used to create it.
<p>

Regardless of which browsing software you are using, there is probably
a menu option to "View Document Source..." or something like that.
This should present you with a new window with the same text document
created by the author with all the formatting shown.  (It is like a
"Reveal Codes..." mode for you WP users :)
<p>

Take full advantage of this!!!!  This openness is responsible for many
of the best effects and features you have seen or heard of on the WWW.
It is one of the best examples of collaborative progress I can think
of!

<hr>

I am about to begin describing the various HTML tags which are used to
mark-up a text document.  Before I begin, however, a quick word about
tags and the general flow of un-marked text.
<p>

As mentioned above, all tags in HTML are enclosed in angle brackets
like "&lt;tag&gt;".  All tags also have a "begin" and "end" version.
In all cases, the begin version will be "&lt;tag&gt;" and the end
version will be "&lt;/tag&gt;".  The beginning tag may also include
some options, as will be described in each case below.  In many cases,
the ending tag is not necessary (eg. in a list, when you begin the
next list item, it is very clear that the previous item has ended),
and when you look at other people's HTML as described above, you will
find many variations.  As a rule, an extra ending tag should never
cause an error!

<hr>

Finally, don't be afraid to play with HTML.  Even if you don't
immediately have access to a server, you can create files locally on
your hard drive and then open the directly with your WWW browser.  If
you are going to do this with WordPerfect or something similar
(Windows NotePad even), don't forget to save/export the file as text.

<hr>

In this chapter I will describe the most common markup commands.
There are likely to be many others and I will give references to
complete lists of HTML tags.  They way that I describe the various
tags and options may also not be strict, but it is the way that I have
successfully used them for the last 3 years.

<a name="text"><h3>Text Mark-Up</h3></a>

<ol>
  <li> <a name="doc"><b>Document Mark-Up</b></a>
       <p>

       Each document should have some basic sections so that it
       conforms well with standards.  In particular, each document
       should have a <tt>&lt;head&gt;....&lt;/head&gt;</tt> and a
       &lt;body&gt;....&lt;/body&gt;.  In the 'head' should be a
       &lt;title&gt;....&lt;/title&gt; which is a short message
       displayed in the title bar of the browser and when a bookmark
       is made.
       
       <pre>
       &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Sample Page for HTML Primer&lt;/title&gt;
       &lt;/head&gt;
       
       &lt;body&gt;
       A bunch of text and HTML here.
       &lt;/body&gt;
       </pre>

       Advanced features include <tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt> tags inside the
       <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> for providing keyword lists and document
       descriptions for use by internet search engines, and elements
       to put a background image on the page and change the color of
       the background, text, links, etc. within the
       <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> tag.
       <p>

  <li> <a name="char"><b>Character Mark-Up</b></a>
       <p>

       Despite the above lecture on markup, I use predominantly "bold"
       and "italics" commands because they are more intuitive to me
       and they are intepreted as "strong" and "emphasis",
       respectively, in most cases anyways!  The commands for these
       are:
       <pre>
       This word would be &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and this one
       would be in &lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;.
       </pre>
       
       Hopefully, you have already realized that this will not be as
       hard you may have thought!
       <p>

       The other predominant type of character mark-up is to create
       headings.  This is done with the 6 built-in levels of headings:

       <pre>
       &lt;h1&gt;Top level most important heading&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;h2&gt;Next most important heading&lt;/h2&gt;
       .
       .
       .
       &lt;h6&gt;Last level of heading, barely more important that normal
           text&lt;/h6&gt;
       </pre>
       
       This is a good example of mark-up as opposed to formatting.
       Nowhere do you as the author define how <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt>
       through &lt;h6&gt; should be displayed.  A user could make
       <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt> appear as very small hard to read text if
       they chose (although this would be rather silly and confusing
       for that reader!).
       <p>

       Recently, Netscape has introduced an extension which allows you
       to directly change the font size.  This is considered by many
       to be a bold transgression of the line between mark-up and
       formatting and should never be used as important formatting.
       If the change in font will be important to interpretting a
       piece of text, you should find another method!  For that
       reason, I will not introduce this command.
       <p>

  <li> <a name="par"><b>Paragraph Mark-up</b></a>
       <p>

       When HTML text is processed, all white space is ignored.  White
       space is any space between words or characters including
       spaces, tabs, new lines, carriage returns, etc.  Therefore, now
       matter how many blank lines you see in your text file, it will
       appear as a single paragraph when processed, unless you include
       tags to indicate the beginning/end of paragraphs or new lines.
       <p>

       To specify the beginning of a new paragraph, use the
       <tt>&lt;p</tt> tag.  Since a new paragraph automatically
       implies the end of the previous, the <tt>&lt;/p&gt;</tt> tag is not
       necessary.  This tag will, in most cases, be interpretted by
       putting a blank line between the pieces of text which it
       separates.
       <p>

       To start a new line without starting a new paragraph, the
       <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt> (for "break") tag is used.  A new line will
       start immediately following this tag.
       <p>

       To center some text on the page, use the following tags:

       <pre>
       The following line is
       <center><tt>&lt;center&gt;</tt>centered on the
       page<tt>&lt;/center&gt;</tt></center>
       as you can see.
       </pre>
       
       Finally, an often used element in HTML is the "horizontal
       rule", a simple line across the page to indicated a change in
       topic or other separation.  The tag to create a horizontal rule
       is <tt>&lt;hr&gt;</tt>.
       <p>

       There are many variations on these tags.  Other references and
       examples on-line will show you how to use them.  (For example,
       is you use <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>...<tt>&lt;/p&gt;</tt> pair for
       paragraphs, it is possible to specify alignment as:

       <pre>
                  <tt>&lt;p align=center&gt;</tt>This paragraph
                       will be centered on
                  the page horizontally until it
                      comes to an end<tt>&lt;/p&gt;</tt>
       </pre>

       See other references for more.
       <p>

  <li> <a name="lists"><b>Lists</b></a>
       <p>

       A common feature in HTML is the list.  There are many ways to
       use lists to organize data but in HTML, there are three types
       of lists:

       <ol type=a>
	 <li> <i>Ordered Lists</i>
	      <p>

	      This type of list is numbered beginning with '1.'  It is
	      common to use this kind of list when you the order or
	      number of elements in the list is important.
	      <p>
	      <pre>
	How to make a cake:
	<tt>&lt;ol&gt;</tt>
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> turn on oven
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> mix ingredients
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> pour into pan
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> bake for 1 hour
        <tt>&lt;/ol&gt;</tt>
	      </pre>
	      to produce:
	      <p>

	      How to make a cake:
	      <ol>
		<li> turn on oven
		<li> mix ingredients
		<li> pour into pan
		<li> bake for 1 hour
	      </ol>
	      <p>
	      
	 <li> <i>Unordered Lists</i>

	      When order and number are not important, simple bulleted
	      lists are sufficient:

	      <pre>
        Reasons to learn HTML
	<tt>&lt;ul&gt;</tt>
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> important future job skill
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> easier to share information with others
	  <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt> lots of fun!!
	<tt>&lt;/ul&gt;</tt>
	      </pre>
	      to produce:
	      <p>

	      Reasons to learn HTML
	      <ul>
		<li> important future job skill
		<li> easier to share information with others
		<li> lots of fun!!
	      </ul>
	      <p>

	 <li> <i>Definition Lists</i>
	      <p>

	      Definition lists are used to have a format like a
	      definition or item description.  They are used when a
	      word or phrase should be used instead of a number of
	      bullet.

	      <pre>
	Here are the officers of the ANS:
	<tt>&lt;dl&gt;</tt>
          <tt>&lt;dt&gt;</tt>President
          <tt>&lt;dd&gt;</tt>The president is elected for one year terms and
	      serves for one year as the vice president.
	  <tt>&lt;dt&gt;</tt>Treasurer
	  <tt>&lt;dd&gt;</tt>The treasurer is elected for two year terms.
        <tt>&lt;/dl&gt;</tt>
	      </pre>

	      to produce:
	      <p>

	      Here are the officers of the ANS:
	      <dl>
		<dt>President
		<dd>The president is elected for one year terms and
		     serves for one year as the vice president.
		<dt>Treasurer
		<dd>The treasurer is elected for two year terms.
	      </dl>
       </ol>

       Be sure to try combining various things within lists.  For
       example, description lists often look better when a paragraph
       is inserted between each item and the description term in bold:

       <pre>
       Here are the officers of the ANS:
       <tt>&lt;dl&gt;</tt>
          <tt>&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;</tt>President<tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt>
          <tt>&lt;dd&gt;</tt>The president is elected for one year terms and
	      serves for one year as the vice president.
	  <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
	  <tt>&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;</tt>Treasurer<tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt>
	  <tt>&lt;dd&gt;</tt>The treasurer is elected for two year terms.
       <tt>&lt;/dl&gt;</tt>
       </pre>
       so that it looks like this:
       <p>

       Here are the officers of the ANS:
       <dl>
          <dt><b>President</b>
          <dd>The president is elected for one year terms and
	      serves for one year as the vice president.
	  <p>
	  <dt><b>Treasurer</b>
	  <dd>The treasurer is elected for two year terms.
       </dl>
       <p>

  <li> <a name="ent"><b>Other Entities</b></a>
       <p>

       There are some characters which serve a special purpose in HTML
       and therefore, there are special ways to include those
       characters in text.  In general, special characters are
       insterted with the format '&code;' where the code is something
       intuitive.
       <p>
       
       We have already seen that the angle brackets,
       <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>, serve a special purpose.  Therefore, to
       include them in your document use the <tt>&amp;lt;</tt> and
       <tt>&amp;gt;</tt> entities ("less than" and "greater than").
       This construction, however, means that the ampersand, &amp;,
       now has a special meaning, so should be included as
       <tt>&amp;amp;</tt>.
       <p>

       Other examples of this construction are for foreign characters
       such as accents.  Comprehensive lists can be found in various
       references.
</ol>

<a name="links"><h3>Links</h3></a>

The power of hypertext and the WWW lies in the ability to link
documents together through common pieces of text and phrases.  Now
that you know how to make your document look nice, you can learn how
to harness this power.

<ol>
  <li> <a name="linksyn"><b>Link Syntax</b></a>
       <p>

       There are two main types of links, basic links and named
       links. Basic links point to the top of another document while
       named links point to a named section of a document, either the
       same document or another document.
       <p>
       
       Both types use the following command to make a link to another
       document:

       <pre>
       Click <tt>&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;</tt>here<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</tt> for the New York Times.
       </pre>

       The basic tag is <tt>&lt;a&gt;</tt> for "anchor??", and has the
       special option 'href' for "hyper-reference".  The value of the
       href option can be any valid URL.  The choices are endless.
       For example, for people to send me e-mail I could have:

       <pre>
       Please send me 
       <tt>&lt;a href="mailto:wg-chair@maple.fzk.de"&gt;</tt>e-mail<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</tt> if you have
       any questions.
       </pre>

       Named links require to addition pieces of information.  In the
       section of the document where the link should arrive, a name
       must be defined, eg:
       <pre>
       <tt>&lt;a name="section1"&gt;</tt><tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt>Section 1: Introduction<tt>&lt;/h1&gt;</tt><tt>&lt;/a&gt;</tt>
       </pre>
       
       Then, in the linking document, the href is slightly changed.
       Assuming the above name is placed in a document called
       "intro.html",
       <pre>
       <tt>&lt;a href="http://www.ans.org/intro.html#section1"&gt;</tt>
       NOTE:                                 ^^^^^^^^^
       </pre>

  <li> <a name="relurl"><b>More About URL's</b></a>
       <p>

       The basic form of a URL defined in the previous chapter is:
       <pre>
       protocol://server/path/and/directories/file.name
       </pre>

       This format will always work for any file you want to reach,
       but there are some shorcuts which make it easier to create and
       faster to use when linking between files on the same HTTP
       server.
       <p>

       First, if you are linking between two files, say from
       'index.html' to 'other.html', on the same server and in the
       same directory, it is sufficient to use:
       <pre>
       Here is the <tt>&lt;a href="other.html"&gt;</tt>other<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</tt> file.
       </pre>

       Or, if the file 'index.html' is in the same directory as the
       sub-directory 'info' which has a file named 'intro.html', then
       the following suffices:
       <pre>
       Here is an <tt>&lt;a href="info/intro.html"&gt;</tt>intro<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</tt> to some information.
       </pre>

       Finally, to return to the file 'other.html' from 'intro.html',
       we can use:
       <pre>
       Return to <tt>&lt;a href="../other.html"&gt;</tt>other<tt>&lt;/a&gt;</tt> file.
       </pre>

       This concept is known as "Relative URL's" because their
       formation is relative to the current location.  Again, this
       only works for files on the same HTTP server.

</ol>

<a name="images"><h3>Images</h3></a>

<ol>
  <li> <a name="imgsyn"><b>Basic Image Syntax</b></a>
       <p>

       One of the biggest advances made by the WWW/HTML/HTTP over its
       predecessor, Gopher, is the ability to include images in
       documents. Images can be included in two formats:
       <ul>
	 <li> GIF
	 <li> JPEG
       </ul>
       <p>

       The tag to include an image has the following syntax:
       <pre>
       <tt>&lt;img src="URL for image" alt="Text to display instead of image"
            align="left|right|center|middle|bottom....."&gt;</tt>
       </pre>
       <i>(Note: a command such as this can cross over two or more lines)</i>
       <p>

       <ul>
	 <li> <tt>src</tt>: this is a URL for an image, following all
	      the above rules.  This image can be on another server,
	      an FTP server, the same server, etc.
	 <li> <tt>alt</tt>: this optional element is strongly
	      recommended. For visually impaired readers and readers
	      with slow connections, the images themselves may not be
	      useful.  This text is shown instead and gives
	      information about the topic of the picture.
	 <li> <tt>align</tt>: this optional element is most important
	      when you want to have text wrapping around an image on
	      the left or right. The various options set the alignment
	      of the image vertically with respect to the text in the
	      same line (if there is any) or in the page.  If the
	      alignment is right, the text which follows this command
	      will continue beside the image on the left side, until
	      the end of the image, at which point it continues with
	      the full width.
       </ul>
       <p>

  <li> <a name="imgs"><b>Working with Images</b></a>
       <p>

       Creating, acquiring, modifying and formatting images can be an
       extensive task.  Most scanned images end up in a TIFF Format
       which cannot be put directly on-line.  There are many programs
       available as shareware or freeware which perform image
       manipulation.  There may also be some programs (eg. Adobe
       Photoshop, Corel Photopaint ?) at ANS HQ which will allow some
       modification.
       <p>

       As mentioned above about learning HTML, this an open
       technology.  The same is true of images.  If you see an image
       you like on the WWW, you can download it and save it directly
       for your own use, or you can link to it directly in its current
       location.  You will probably have to "View Document Source..."
       (or equivalent) to find the exact location of the image on the
       original server.  Further, you should probably ensure that the
       image is not copyrighted or protected for use by the site you
       are retrieving it from (or more difficult--for use by another
       original site -- the image may already be "borrowed").

     Standards Program Workshop</b></a></a>,<br>
     July 8 - 10, 1997, L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, Washington, D.C.
<dd> The workshop theme is "The 'Work-Smart' Implementation of Public
     Law 104-113 in the Department of Energy."  The workshop will
     provide a forum for panel discussions concerning the features of
     the new law that are relevant to Department operations.  Panel
     discussions will reflect on the many performance improvement
     initiatives (i.e., "work smart" standards, safety issues
     management, transition to external oversight, etc.)  currently in
     process within the Department and address how the new law may
     influence these initiatives.  In addition, workshop participants
     will learn from representatives of other Federal agencies as to
     how the new law may influence their business practices and
     technical operations.  The target audience for this workshop are
     individuals within the DOE community who either use technical
     standards in the conduct of their work, participate in standards
     writing/management activities (through voluntary standards
     organizations or DOE "topical" standards committees), or need to
     better understand and support the Department's performance
     improvement initiatives.  <p>

     The workshop is sponsored by the Office of Nuclear Safety Policy
     and Standards, EH-31.  There is no registration fee for
     participating in the workshop.  A block of rooms has been
     reserved at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel for workshop participants
     from outside the Washington, D.C. area.  A group room rate of
     $101 per night (plus 13% tax and $1.50 occupancy tax) is
     available under the "DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS" room block name.
     Provisions have been made for some early check-ins before the
     workshop; however, the number of rooms available is limited and
     will be filled on a "first-come" basis.  The hotel is directly
     accessible via the "Metro" rail system.  Room reservations can be
     made by contacting the hotel at (202) 484-1000 [fax: (202)
     646-4456].  <p>

     In addition, the DOE Technical Standards Managers' Committee will
     meet on July 7-8, 1997, at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel immediately
     prior to the workshop.  All DOE and DOE contractor Technical
     Standards Managers (TSMs) are encouraged to attend this meeting
     and the annual workshop.  The meeting agenda is being developed;
     input from the TSMs on the agenda is requested and appreciated.
     For comments or information on the meeting, please contact Marty
     Marchbanks, ORNL, (423) 241-3658 (voice), (423) 574-0382 (fax),
     marchbanksmf@ornl.gov (e-mail).  <p>

     A final agenda of the workshop panel discussions and speakers
     will be distributed in April.  If you would like to register your
     planned attendance for the 1997 workshop, please contact:

<title>Policy Suggestions of the ANS Electronic Communications and Publications Committee</title>

<table width=600><tr><td>
<center>
<h3>ANS Electronic Communications and Publications Committee</h3>
<h1>Policy and Protocol for the Electronic World</h1>
</center>

A running compendium of Policy and Protocol for the
development and maintenance of the ANS WWW HomePage

<img src=/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif>

<h3>Technical Peer Review</h3>

One of the major concerns with presentation of technical information
by ANS is that it must be technically correct in order to preserve the
credibility of ANS.  The only technical information included in the
HomePage should have a clear reference to the source of the
information (presumably some other technical source), and thus avoid
the need to "approve" technical content.

<h3>Approval Protocol</h3>

The approval protocol established for the HomePage is as follows: ANS
Headquarters Staff maintain access control for posting changes to
www.ans.org.  The committee will not take an active role in approval
of content.

<h3>Linking to other Web Sites</h3>

Since ANS is not in a position to endorse or condone other sources of
information, a soft disclaimer should be provided when links to other
sites are established.  For example, related information could be
listed as "Other sites of interest".

<h3>Membership Information</h3>

In order to protect the privacy of our membership, only names and
e-mail addresses will be provided on the ANS HomePage without the
consent of the member, unless this information is provided by an ANS
committee, division, etc.  Member requests for removal of information
will be honored.

<h3>Software Compatibility</h3>

Having older versions of the software could impair the speed of
access, while using the most recent versions could prevent access by
members with older versions.  A rolling minimum standard should be
used, i.e., the earliest version of INTERNET software currently in
widespread use should be used for the ANS HomePage.

<h3><a href="email.std.html">E-Mail Standard</a></h3>

The standard format for e-mail text is ASCII.  If other formats are
used, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure that the
recipients have compatible software prior to sending the material.
The standard format for filenames is 8.3 characters in length and from
the character set [0-9,a-z, A-Z,_.-], no leading numbers, and
absolutely never [!@#$%^&amp;*?].

<h3>Internet Web page Space Allocation</h3>

In order to ensure consistent support and to prevent over committing
of resources, available space on the ANS web site will be allocated as
follows: First priority for space allocation will be ANS Staff.  If
available, governance committees will be allocated space for a web
page.  Divisions will each be provided a brief description page as a
minimum. All groups will be provided the opportunity to link to the
ANS HomePage.

<title>ANS EC&amp;P: Standards for Electronic Mail</title>
</head>

<h3>ANS Electronic Communications &amp; Publication Committee</h3>
<h1>Electronic Mail Standards</h1>
</center>
<img src=/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif>

To ensure that communication between members is in fact helped and not
hindered by electronic communications, the EC&amp;P committee has
recommended an unofficial standard for electronic mail communication
and transfer of documents.
<p>
<ol>
  <li> The preferred <a href="/guild/glossary.html#file.type">file
       type</a> for the exchange of all documents is as a text file.  Most
       text-based document types and formats can be converted to plain ASCII
       text if necessary.  Any other <a
       href="/guild/glossary.html#file.format">format</a> of text document may
       require special software at the receivers end, and therefore, should be
       avoided.
       <p>

  <li> There will be documents or files for which this is not possible.  In
       those cases, care should be taken to establish the capabilities of the
       recipient <b>BEFORE</b> sending the file, without making assumptions (eg:
       not all computer users can use Postscript files).  Examples of such cases
       are:
       <ul>
	 <li> images (GIF, JPEG, PICT, Bitmap)
	 <li> application documents (Word, Excel, WordPerfect, CorelDraw)
	 <li> text documents (LaTeX, HTML, Postscript)
       </ul>
       Where possible, files should be converted to a format which is useful to
       the receiver before sending (eg: Word to text, PICT to GIF).  In all
       cases but the text document type, a <a
       href="/guild/glossary.html#file.encoding">file encoding</a> will be
       necessary.  Care should be taken to ensure that the transmitted encoding
       type is compatible with the decoding capabilities of the receiver.  If
       compatible encoding schemes are not available, File Transfer Protocol
       (FTP), should be considered as an alternative.
       <p>

</ol>

<i>(Note: Where available to both parties, File Transfer Protocal
(FTP) sites are often a prefered option for the transfer of binary
documents.)</i>

	 <CENTER><P><IMG SRC="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif"></P></CENTER>

	 <P>The archiving of Peer reviewed technical information has
	 great potential to benefit our membership and the scientific
	 community. Now that the ANS WebPage has been established
	 (<I><A HREF="http://www.ans.org/">The ANSWER</A></I>), we
	 would like to encourage Divisions and Committees to start
	 developing this potential by submitting past and future ANS
	 materials for inclusion on the ANS Web Page. If done
	 properly, this process could also lead to future CD-ROM
	 publications as well. No other organization will convert this
	 paper information into electronic format, and no other
	 organization has the talent to select appropriate Papers and
	 Transactions Summaries for inclusion.</P>

	 <P>The ANS Publications Steering Committee has endorsed a
	 method for ANS Divisions and Committees to post past
	 publications on the ANS WebPage in &quot;Book Review&quot;
	 form. This format eliminates the need for repeating the
	 lengthy and tedious Peer Review Process, while protecting the
	 potential for future revenue generation from sale of the
	 documents.</P>

	 <DL>
	   <DT> <B><I>1. BOOK REVIEW FORMAT FOR <A
		HREF="http://www.ans.org/">THE&nbsp;ANSWER</A></I></B></DT>

	   <DD> <P>The Book Review format is just what it says - a
		descriptive summary of the paper designed to influence
		a decision to obtain the full teqxt of the
		material. This format is preferred for two
		reasons:</P>
		
		<OL>
		  <LI> to make it easier to post on the WebPage,
		       and</LI>
		  <LI> to avoid jeopardizing future sales of paper
		       publications and subscriptions.
		       </LI>
		</OL>

		<P>The book review should be a true Summary,
		containing enough information for the knowledgeable
		reader to decide whether it is worthwhile to obtain
		the full printed copy. It is not just an Abstract,
		where the reader cannot tell the important conclusions
		and may thus waste time by obtaining a printed
		copy.</P>

		<P>A Book Review should also have sufficient and
		appropriate accurate Keywords to assure location by an
		INTERNET search engine. Length should be 900 words,
		and format should comply with the requirements for ANS
		Transactions Summaries, as may be modified for
		electronic retrieval. Formulae, graphs and
		illustrations should be avoided. </P>

		<P>INTERNET Search Engines typically will retrieve
		only the first 50 words of an item -- making it
		imperative that the first 50 words of the Book Review
		be a mini-summary, and not waste words describing the
		author's organization or the sponsoring company.</P>

	   <DT> <B><I>2. MODIFIED FORMATS FOR FUTURE ANS TRANSACTIONS
		AND MAGAZINE SUMMARIES</I></B> </DT>

	   <DD> <P>To maintain consistency between past and future
		electronic retrieval, ANS Transactions' Summaries
		should be written by the Author as above so that they
		may be directly used in electronic retrieval after
		removal of formulae, graphs and illustrations.
		Similarly Journal and Magazine articles should have
		consistent summaries.</P>

	   <DT> <B><I>3. APPROVAL OF BOOK REVIEWS</I></B></DT>

	   <DD> <P>Each Division or Committee will be the approval
		authority for Book Reviews they wish to post on the
		WebPage. In the event of two entqities preparing Book
		Reviews for the same item, please negotiate. The
		qobjective would be for the Author to provide
		appropriate summaries so that the Division / Committee
		need only select items for inclusion.</P>

	   <DT> <B><I>4. SELECTION OF PAST ITEMS FOR WEBPAGE
		EMPLACEMENT </I></B></DT>

	   <DD> <P>For items already published, each Division or
		Committee should select items of interest to them, and
		prepare appropriate Book Reviews. ANS does not have
		enough people power to make Book Reviews of all past
		publications, and wishes to avoid arbitrary
		selections.</P> 

	   <DT> <B><I>5. EMPLACEMENT ON <A
		HREF="http://www.ans.org/">THE ANSWER</A></I></B></DT>

	   <DD> <P>The ANS Special Committee on Electronic
		Communications and Publishing will provide a
		standardized structure for locating an individual
		item.  For example, observe the method of placing a
		month's current titles of Nuclear Science and
		Engineering. An ANS Division or Committee need only
		prepare the book review with appropriate indication of
		its origin, and transmit this officially to a central
		location to be posted.</P> </DD>
	 </DL>
	 
	 <P>We suggest that each Division / Committee begin this
	 process at their June 1997 meeting with appointment of a
	 Coordinator to liaison with the ANS Special Committee on
	 Electronic Communications and Publishing.</P>

	 <P>If you have questions or comments send an e-mail to <A
	 HREF="mailto:marc832@primenet.com">marc832@primenet.com</A>
	 or <A
	 HREF="mailto:john.dewes@srs.gov">john.dewes@srs.gov</A>, or

	 <CENTER><P><h3>ANS On The Web!</h3></P></CENTER>

	 <P>Last June, ANS entered a new era of communications by
	 establishing our own INTERNET Home Page, <i><a href="/">The
	 ANSWER</a></i>. The web site is intended to foster
	 communications between ANS staff, members, and the general
	 public! Our site is growing every moqnth, as we add new
	 features and additional links are established.  Seven of the
	 Technical Divisions currently have their own web sites linked
	 to the ANS site. Member services available on the web incqlude
	 membership application, meeting registration, and Staff
	 e-mail links. Additional volunteers are needed to help build
	 the site!  If you are interested, contact the ANS WebMaster,
	 Paul Wilson, at
	 <a href="mailto:wg-chair@ans.neep.wisc.edu">wg-chair@ans.neep.wisc.edu</a>.</P>

	 <CENTER><P><h3>ANS Developing<br>
	 Listserver Capability</h3></P></CENTER>

	 <P>Our next step in facilitating electronic communications is
	 establishing listserver capability for ANS members and staff
	 at ANS headquarters. A listserver is a program that allows
	 users to &quot;subscribe&quot; to a list. Any e-mail
	 addressed to theq list is automatically sent to all
	 subscribers on the list. This is a wonderful tool for
	 communicating amongst groups with common interests, such as
	 Technical Program Committees, Division Executive Committee
	 members, or a Standards Sub-Committee. If you or your
	 organization is interested, contact John Dewes at (803)
	 557-9497 or e-mail to
	 <a href="mailto:john.dewes@srs.gov">john.dewes@srs.gov</a>.<BR> </P>
	 </td>
    <td width=300>
	 <CENTER><P><h3>Interested in FREE UNLIMITED INTERNET Access?</h3></P></CENTER>
	 
	 <P>Many INTERNET Service Providers (ISPs) will provide free
	 web sites to tax-exempt organizations, which include ANS
	 Technical Divisions and Committees!  If you have even
	 beginner-level computer skills, you can get free unlimited
	 INTERNET access by serving as a WebMaster for your Technical
	 Division or a Governance committee!  The level of effort is
	 minimal, and the rewards are great! If you are interested in
	 this program, contact John Dewes via e-mail at
	 <a href="mailto:john.dewes@srs.gov">john.dewes@srs.gov</a> or
	 at (803) 557-9497.</P>

	 <CENTER><P><h3>EC&amp;P Committee<br>
	 Establishes Standards</h3></P></CENTER>

	 <P>One of the functions of the EC&amp;P committee is to keep
	 us all talking in the same language! To facilitate this, we
	 have <a href="../policy/">established Policies</a> on web
	 site content, review of information, software compatibility,
	 and e-mail. In addition, we are soliciting samples of
	 ready-for-publication Technical Papers in various software
	 formats (Word, WordPerfect, etc.). Please contact <a
	 href="mailto:wg-chair@ans.neep.wisc.edu">Paul Wilson</a>
	 if you have a suitable sample. <BR> </P>

	 <CENTER><P><h3>CD-ROM Needed for ANS Staff</h3> </P></CENTER>

	 <P>Our hard-working staff at ANS HQ is in dire need of a
	 CD-ROM recorder for use in electronic publishing. If your
	 group is looking for a worthy cause for donation, your
	 generosity will be greatly rewarded! <BR> </P>

		   ensure consistent support and to prevent over
		   committing of resources, available space on the ANS
		   web site will be allocated as follows: First
		   priority for space allocation will be ANS Staff.
		   If available, governance committees will be
		   allocated space for a web page.  Divisions will
		   each be provided a brief description page as a
		   minimum. All groups will be provided the

	      <dd> Discussion was held on the policies for summarizing
		   information, such as the book review format.  The
		   consensus was that the because of the temporary
		   nature of the Electronic Communications Committee,
		   the Publications Steering Committee needs to
		   establish policy for: 1) presentation of previously
		   published materials so that copyrights and
		   potential for future sales are not infringed upon;
		   and 2) policies on how long materials are presented
		   on the web.<p>

	      <dd> ANS is pursuing a proposal to install new software
		   that would fully integrate their Intranet with
		   their business software.  Part of the proposal
		   would include hiring a temporary (1 year) worker to
		   develop and train the staff in the use of an ANS
		   Intranet.  The committee is urged to support this
		   effort.  Development of an ANS Intranet would
		   greatly enhance the use of electronic
		   communications among the staff.

	      <dt> <a name="3.B.2">ANS Staff Development:</a>
	      <dd> <i><b>Previous Action:</b> Develop Staff Training
		   (Cramer, Wilson)</i> <p>

		   Paul Wilson has placed an <a

		   meeting, the <a href="/pubs/magazines/NN/">Nuclear
		   News table of contents</a> is
		   being delivered in html format for inclusion into
		   the ANSWER every month.  This is an example of how

		   Tomkiewicz has agreed to pursue a professional

	    Listserver capability was being installed at ANS-HQ at the
	    time of the meeting.  Full functionality is expected
	    within a month.  Kudos to Dolores Faison for diligently
	    pursuing this task!
	    <p>

	    <dl>
	      <dt> <a name="3.C.1">Priority Listing:</a>
	      <dd> The committee discussed various issues related to
		   listserver capability.  The consensus of the
		   committee was that the priorities for e-mail lists
		   should be as follows: 
		   <ol>
		     <li> existing listservers; 
		     <li> requested listservers from Divisions and
			  Committees; and 
		     <li> requested listservers from Local
			  Sections and Plant Branches.
		   </ol>

		   Paul Wilson will work with Dolores to attempt
		   electronic transition of existing listservers.
		   <p>

		   <p>

	      <dt> <a name="3.C.2">Public vs. Private:</a>
	      <dd> It was noted that management of Listservers need
		   not be done from ANS HQ, but that an external
		   administrator could be used to support private
		   listservers.  The consensus of the committee was
		   that Private listservers would be supported if the
		   group provides an administrator.

	      <dd> <i><b>Previous Actions:</b> Discuss with ANS-HQ
		   Staff (Dewes)</i><p>

		   Mr. Wenzel proposed that an ANS Electronic
		   Membership be considered for the future; this would
		   involve a new category of membership where all
		   information provided to the member is sent
		   electronically (resulting in cost savings).  In
		   return, the membership category would have a
		   different dues structure.
		   <p>

	      <dt> <a name="3.C.4">New Business</a>
	      <dd> An action was requested to ask ANS-HQ Staff to
		   develop a WWW (html) compatible member listing,
		   including e-mail addresses.  This would provide for
		   easier integration of the member listing into the
		   HomePage and potential electronic (CD-ROM)
		   dissemination.<p>

	      <dt> <a name="3.D.2">CD/ROM Procurement:</a>
	      <dd> Gene Cramer indicated that purchase of a CD/ROM had
		   been authorized at the February Finance Committee
		   meeting, but that no action had been taken at this
		   time by the staff.  It was noted that several
		   Topical Meetings have published their proceedings
		   on CD-ROM, and that at some point in time it may be
		   possible for a topical to donate a CD/ROM recorder
		   to HQ for staff use.  The consensus of the
		   committee was that we should wait and see if the
		   proposal for an ANS Web master succeeds because
		   hardware needs would be part of the ANS Intranet
		   proposal.<p>

		   Gene Cramer submitted a draft memo to ANS Groups
		   concerning the need to identify valuable legacy
		   materials and make them accessible through the
		   ANSWER.  The memo was forwarded to the Publications
		   Steering Committee Chair for comment, but as of
		   this date no comment had been received.  The memo
		   will be sent.  Gene Cramer is pursuing a

		   The committee further discussed the need for "style
		   sheets".  Ken Schultz of the Technical Publications
		   Committee wants electronic templates for papers in
		   various formats (e.g., WordPerfect, Microsoft Word,
		   etc.).  Paul Wilson provided and example of style
		   files at www.elsevier.nl/homepage/about/sgml/ and
		   in the ANS Toolbox on the ANSWER.  The need for
		   templates will be included in the memo to ANS
		   Groups.<p>

       <dt> <a name="3.E">E. HomePage</a>
       <dd> Paul Wilson provided a summary of achievements and future
	    plans for the ANSWER (see Attachment 3).  It was noted
	    that 70 persons registered for the Washington D.C. meeting
	    via the ANSWER vs. 18 for the Reno meeting.

		   href="/ans/contact.html">the ANSWER.</a>
		   <p>

		   <i><b>Previous Action:</b> Maximize search engine
		   detection (Wilson, Cramer)</i><p>

		   One additional issue relates to the use of
		   Skywriter messages.  These messages are designed to
		   improve the chances of an Internet search engine
		   (such as Yahoo, WebCrawler) listing our home page
		   first when such key words as nuclear, atomic, etc.,
		   are searched.  Paul and Gene have put together a
		   quite <a href="../keywords.html">comprehensive
		   selection of keywords</a> which should serve this
		   purpose well.
		   <p>
	      <dt> <a name="3.E.2">ANS HQ Use:</a>
	      <dd> The committed discussed use of the web at HQ.  One
		   issue raised was the advertisement of the existence
		   of the web site.  It was determined that the
		   corporate norm was to add the address of a web site
		   to the corporate letterhead.<p>

		   <i><b>Action:</b> Pursue addition of the HomePage
		   address to the ANS Letterhead (Dewes)</i>

	      <dt> <a name="3.E.3">Governance Use:</a>
	      <dd> The committed discussed the hosting of Division,
		   Committee, etc. home pages.  It was determined that
		   with the resource limitations of ANS-HQ, that
		   support of such home pages was not feasible at this
		   time.  Other means of providing this service will
		   be pursued.<p>

		   <i><b>Action:</b> Pursue external hosting of
		   Division, Committee, etc. HomePages (Dewes)</i>
		   <p>
	      <dt> <a name="3.E.4">Coordination of Student Projects:</a>
	      <dd> The committee discussed the many opportunities
		   available for students to work on ANS related
		   projects for either academic credit or financial
		   reward.  The role of the ANSWER in facilitating
		   this effort was discussed.  A suggestion was made
		   to develop a listing of student involvement
		   opportunities with a description of the effort and
		   a contact.  It was suggested that the Student
		   Activities Committee should spearhead such an activity.
		   <p>

		   <i><b>Action:</b> Pursue addition of a Student
		   Projects section to the ANSWER (Wenzel)</i>
		   <p>
	      <dt> <a name="3.E.5">Standards:</a>
	      <dd> The committee discussed placement of Standards in
		   the ANSWER.  As standards are constantly being
		   revised, this is a high-effort task.  It was
		   indicated that the ANSI HomePage contains a listing
		   of current standards, and is updated about once per
		   month.  Paul Wilson will explore substituting a
		   link to the ANSI home page rather than maintaining
		   our listing.<p>

		   <i><b>Action:</b> Explore link to ANSI HomePage for

	      <dt> <a name="3.E.6">Toolbox:</a>
	      <dd> <i><b>Previous Action:</b> Explore development of EC&amp;P
		   Toolbox (Wilson)</i><p>
		   
		   Paul Wilson has established an <a
		   href="../toolbox/">EC&amp;P Toolbox</a> on
		   the ANSWER.  As discussed above, we will attempt to
		   increase our selection of templates for papers as
		   well.  Bob Edwards has provided a primer of sorts
		   on the Electronic Technical Paper Review process.
		   It is located at <a
		   href="http://webnuc.nuce.psu.edu/~edwards/Publications/www_art">http://webnuc.nuce.psu.edu/~edwards/Publications/www_art</a>.<p>
		   
		   <i><b>Action:</b> Add link to Toolbox on Electronic
		   Paper Review (Wilson)</i>
		   <p>

		   Other potential additions to the toolbox were
		   discussed.  Among the additions mentioned were the
		   Local Sections Manual and the Topical Meeting
		   Manual.<p>

		   <i><b>Action:</b> Pursue addition of Manuals to

	      <dt> <a name="3.F.1">Internet Access at National Meetings</a>
	      <dd> A revenue-generation proposal was discussed which
		   involves making Internet accessavailable to members
		   during national meetings.  The concept would start
		   with one or two terminals connected to the web and
		   grow as demand dictates.  One means of testing the
		   potential demand for such a service is to have a
		   corporate sponsor provide web access in the Nuclear
		   Technology Expo on a single terminal and gauge the
		   response.  It was agreed that web access, although
		   not as permanent as a caricature, would be much
		   more useful to attendees.<p>

    <dd> 
	 <dl>
	   <dt> Approval Policy:
	   <dd> This policy will be revised to reflect the transfer of
		the HomePage to ANS-HQ.  ANS Staffers will control
		content.  Paul Wilson will work with the Staff to
		facilitate this arrangement.  The committee will not
		take an active role in approval of content.
		<p>

	   <dd> The policy will be revised to allow posting of
		information provided by Divisions, Committees, Local
		Sections, and Plant Branches (hereinafter referred to
		as ANS Groups)<p>
		<i><b>Action:</b> <a href="../policy/">Revise Policies</a> (Dewes)</i>
	 </dl>
	 <p>

    <dt> <a name="3.B">B)  Training Course</a>
    <dd> The Professional Development Coordination Committee has
	 requested that our committee facilitate a professional
	 development course on electronic communications, to be held
	 in conjunction with a national meeting.  Bob Tomkiewicz will
	 be asked to assist in setting this up at a future ANS
	 meeting.
	 <p>
	 <i><b>Action:</b> Discuss Training Course with Tomkiewicz(Dewes)</i>
	 <p>

    <dt> <a name="3.C">C)  ANS Staff Development</a>
    <dd> The committee discussed the issue of ANS Staff INTERNET
	 training.  It is apparent that the success of our mission is
	 highly dependent on how well we facilitate and encourage the
	 use of electronic communications and publishing amongst the
	 HQ Staff.  The primary need was to enable the staff to
	 convert word processing documents to html so that they can be
	 updated with minimal effort.  Paul Wilson, Annie Penner, and
	 Gene Cramer expressed an interest in putting together a
	 tutorial for the staff.<p>
	 <i><b>Action:</b> Develop Staff Training (Cramer, Wilson)</i>
	 <p>
    <dt> <a name="3.D">D)  Web Page Structure</a>
    <dd> Discussion emphasized the need for a home page which provides
	 a top level structure to all the information.  The home page
	 should be reactive to keep it current; should encourage
	 members to browse and comment.
	 <p>

	 The development of a "members only" section was discussed.
	 It was determined that there was not an immediate need for
	 this feature, therefore wait until one develops.
	 <p>

	 The need for a "contact listing" was discussed.  This would
	 better serve members by providing a directory of ANS HQ Staff
	 online.
	 <p>
	 <i><b>Action:</b> Pursue addition of HQ Staff Contact Listing (Wilson)</i>
</dl>

<p><img src="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif"><p>

  <dt> <a name="4.A">A)  E-Mail</a>
  <dd> 
       <dl>
	 <dt> <a name="4.A.1">1)  Listserver</a>
	 <dd> The committee discussed the current situation with
	      Listservers.  Our current situation is not supporting
	      our needs, as great difficulty has been experienced in
	      getting listservers added.  Several incidents of
	      listserver unavailability and/or reliability were also
	      reported.  The committee will continue to pursue
	      development of listserver capability at ANS-HQ.  This
	      would be confined to "passive" support, i.e. the HQ
	      Staff would install the listserver software and ensure
	      its continued operation.  The "care and feeding" of
	      listservers by HQ Staff would be up to each Department
	      at HQ.
	      <p>
	      <i><b>Action:</b> Pursue Listserver Capability at ANS-HQ (Dewes, All)</i>
	      <p>

	      The committee also discussed use of listservers by
	      governance.  It was agreed that once listserver
	      capability was available, we should establish default
	      lists for ANS Groups, and encourage the use of private
	      lists for the governance of these groups.
	      <p>

	      Mr. Wenzel proposed that an ANS Electronic Membership be
	      considered for the future; this would involve a new
	      category of membership where all information provided to
	      the member is sent electronically (resulting in cost
	      savings).  In return, the membership category would have
	      a different dues structure.
	      <p>
	      <i><b>Action:</b> Discuss with ANS-HQ Staff (Dewes)</i>
	      <p>

	      An action was requested to ask ANS-HQ Staff to develop a
	      WWW (html) compatible member listing, including e-mail
	      addresses.  This would provide for easier integration of
	      the member listing into the HomePage and potential
	      electronic (CD-ROM) dissemination.
	      <p>
	      <i><b>Action:</b> Discuss with ANS-HQ Staff (Dewes)</i>
	      <p>

	 <dt> <a name="4.A.2">2)  Protocol for Document Transfer</a>
	 <dd> During several meeting at the Reno Conference, the topic
	      of electronic formats was raised.  Many members
	      complained about the incompatibility of e-mail messages,
	      particularly when platforms were crossed.  The consensus
	      of the committee was that the preferred format was
	      ascii, and that if other formats were used, then the
	      sender should ensure that the recipients have compatible
	      software.
       </dl>
       <p>
  <dt> <a name="4.B">B)  Electronic Publication</a>
  <dd> 
       <dl>
	 <dt> <a name="4.B.1">1)  CD-ROM</a>
	 <dd> Gene Cramer, incoming chair of the Public Information
	      Committee, discussed the status of developing electronic
	      publication capability for ANS.  There are many ideas
	      being discussed by the PI Committee, some of which are,
	      for example:
	      <ul>
		<li> Putting REACTIONS back issues on a CD for Teachers
		<li> Publishing our various Nuclear Questions and Answer books on CD
		<li> Consideration to have ANS Publications publish
		     Alan Waltars latest book on CD,along with the
		     references and other info
	      </ul>

	      The long term plan is for one of these ideas will be
	      pursued based upon a sound business plan.  Once ANS
	      purchases the CD-ROM recorder, the door will be open for
	      publication of additional materials which demonstrate
	      financial promise.  Gene is also looking at the
	      possibility of using consultants to convert documents to
	      CD-ROM ready work at low cost.
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <a name="4.B.2">2) Publications Steering</a>
	 <dd> The policy for incorporation of previously published
	      materials into electronic form (CD-ROM, Web) was
	      discussed.  The Chair has discussed this issue with the
	      Publications Steering Committee, which concurred with
	      the idea of using Book Review form for past publications
	      in order to ensure that we do not impact the future
	      sales of published materials.
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <a name="4.B.3">3) Legacy Materials</a>
	 <dd> Gene Cramer discussed the need for ANS Groups to
	      identify valuable information that may be useful in the
	      future, and agreed to develop a draft memo requesting
	      them to 
	      <ol>
		<li> identify past publications which have valuable
		     information (yet are no longer in print), and
		<li> convert these to electronic format so that they
		     may be disseminated electronically.
	      </ol>
	      <p>
	      <i><b>Action:</b> Draft Memo to ANS Groups (Cramer)</i>
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <a name="4.B.4">4) Format Sheets</a>
	 <dd> The committee discussed the need for "style sheets".
	      These would recommend appropriate styles for groups that
	      are preparing book reviews, establish protocol for
	      dealing with figures and pictures, etc.  Gene Cramer
	      will work with Paul Wilson on developing such
	      information.
	      <p>
	      <i><b>Action:</b> Discuss adoption of "Style Files" (Cramer, Wilson)</i>
       </dl>
       <p>
  <dt> <a name="4.C">C)  Home Page</a>
  <dd> 
       <dl>
	 <dt> <a name="4.C.1">1)  Previous Action: </a>
	 <dd> Establish new domain name for ANS HomePage (Dewes) The
	      ANS HomePage was transitioned to <a
	      href="http://www.ans.org/">http://www.ans.org</a> on
	      June 11, 1996.  Many thanks to staffers Dolores Faison
	      and Rod Clemmons for making this happen.
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <a name="4.C.2">2)  Content</a>
	 <dd> Paul Wilson continues to do an excellent job of
	      developing the WWW ANS HomePage.  The committee paused
	      to applaud his efforts.  The page continues to grow, but
	      more assistance is welcome!
	      <p>

	      One additional issue relates to the use of Skywriter
	      messages.  These messages are designed to improve the
	      chances of an Internet search engine (such as Yahoo,
	      WebCrawler) listing our home page first when such key
	      words as nuclear, atomic, etc., are searched.  Various
	      methods were discussed.
	      <p>
	      <i><b>Action:</b> Maximize search engine detection (Wilson, Cramer)</i>
	      <p>

	 <dt> <a name="4.C.3">3)  Use/Structure</a>
	 <dd> 
	      <dl>
		<dt> ANS-HQ Use
		<dd> With the completion of the ISDN line to ANS-HQ,
		     Staffers will now have access to the Internet
		     from their workstations.  This is expected to
		     encourage the use of electronic communications
		     across the board.  Although the home page has
		     been migrated to the HQ service provider, the
		     Staff policy on support of the home page remains
		     the same; each department at HQ is responsible
		     for their own materials on the home page.  No
		     central HQ support is available other than
		     keeping the connection to UUNET in service.
		     <p>
		<dt> Governance Use
		<dd> The participation of the various ANS Groups in
		     the home page is increasing steadily.  As of the
		     Reno meeting, 4 Technical Divisions, 13 Student
		     Branches, and several individuals had established
		     links to the ANS home page.  This is expected to
		     grow as others develop interest.
		     <p>
		     <ul>
		       <li> <b>PI Committee</b> The PI Committee is
			    actively pursuing development of a
			    presence on the Web.  Gene Cramer and Paul
			    Wilson are leading this effort.  This is
			    seen as a great way to communicate with
			    teachers, especially if links can be
			    established to other sources of
			    information for Teachers (such as the
			    National Science Teachers Association web
			    page).
		     <p>
		       <li> <b>Program Committee</b> Registration for
			    the Reno meeting was available thru the
			    home page.  Many future topicals and all
			    future national meetings are also using
			    the home page for providing registration
			    information and for actual registration.
			    The committee discussed the potential for
			    establishing an Electronic Communications
			    and Publishing home page which would serve
			    as a toolbox for ANS Groups.  Included in
			    the toolbox would be pre-programmed
			    examples of registration protocols, paper
			    review processes, and other items that
			    might be useful.
			    <p>
			    <i><b>Action:</b> Explore development of
			    EC&amp;P Toolbox (Wilson)</i>
			    
		     </ul>
		     <p>
		<dt> Membership Use
		<dd> A suggestion was made that one of the most urgent
		     needs for the membership is to have a listing of
		     ANS-HQ Staffers and their area of responsibility.
		     It was also suggested that this listing have some
		     form of e-mail link to the listed
		     personnel.<p>
		     <i><b>Action:</b> Explore development of ANS-HQ Staff listing (Wilson)</i>
	      </dl>
	      <p>
	 <dt> <a name="4.C.4">4)  Future Development</a>
	 <dd> Income Production<br>
	      Several ideas were discussed for potential revenue production.  Included are:
	      <ul>
		<li> <b>Home Page Hosting</b> This would
		     involve offering available space on the ANSWER to
		     other organizations (such as Exhibitors, Vendors,
		     Nuclear News Advertisers, etc.) willing to pay
		     for the service.  Space could also be offered as
		     a package deal along with advertising, exhibit
		     space, etc.
		     <p>
		<li> <b>Home Page Linking</b> This would also involve
		     offering interested parties a for-pay link from
		     the ANSWER.  The link would probably not be
		     salable on its own, but could be offered as and
		     additional component of advertising, exhibit
		     space, etc.
		     <p>
		<li> <b>Publications Purchase</b> The purchase of all
		     ANS products (Standards, Publications, etc.)
		     should be available from the ANSWER.  This would
		     only enhance our accessibility, and could be done
		     for little cost.
	      </ul>

	      No specific actions were assigned in regards to these
	      ideas.  As volunteers become available, they will be
	      assigned the most promising tasks to pursue.

 are a complimentary institution to Czech Embassies, and as such
they contribute to the total visibility of the Czech Republic
abroad. The activities of Czech Centers are regulated by intergovernmental
agreements, and are aimed at the widest public audience of the
host country. <I>They intend to contribute to international understanding
and tolerance by improving the mutual exchange of information.</I>
<P>
 They are run by the <A HREF="#hermes" >Czech Centers Headquarter</A>
in Prague which was established in 1993 under the<U> Czech Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.</U> Its main goal is to coordinate the activities
of Czech Centers.<BR>
<P>
The basic philosophy of this organization is to be open and prepared
to perceive society&#180;s current needs toward the international
community, and to flexibly react to them in accordance with the
overall goals of Czech foreign policy.<BR>
<H3>Major areas of activity: </H3>
<P>
<A HREF="#culture" ><B>Culture</B></A>
<P>
The cultural program, organized in the Czech Centers&#180; own
facilities and elsewhere, is the result of a close selection from
the best Czech offer of existing projects in this area, carefully
tailored to the country in which the individual Czech Centers
are located. The cultural program is not limited merely to traditional
categories such as music, film, drama, or fine arts, but seeks
to support the broadest possible spectrum of activities to form
a comprehensive picture of the Czech Republic as a country integrating
itself within the community of developed nations, striving to
fulfill democratic principles, and helping to solve global problems.
In this sense, it puts emphasis on a broad spectrum of <A HREF="#combined" >combined projects</A>,
such as Czech days, regional presentations, and reviews of Czech
art.<BR>
<P>
<A HREF="#bussines" ><B>Business</B></A>
<P>
The Administration of Czech Centers would like to assist the coordination
of all attempts leading to <U>export support</U>, and thus minimalize
the present discord of limited human and financial resources of
government and half-private institutions active in this sphere.
<P>
By means of Czech Centers abroad, the Administration of Czech
Centers offers all organizations that are taking part in <A HREF="http://www.export.cz" >export support</A>,

from the <A HREF="http://www.mpo.cz/mpo/english/mpo_uk.htm" >Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade</A>,
and companies alone, the space to make a presentation of their
activities. Czech Centers offer their own available localities
for use in one-time <A HREF="#bussines" >presentations</A> but
also for short-time rent to business subjects.<BR>
<P>
<A HREF="#tourism" ><B>Tourism</B></A>

Czech Centers encourage general awareness of the Czech Republic
as an attractive tourist destination. They provide information
about accommodation, travel agencies, regions of the Czech Republic,
leisure and entertainment, sports, and dultural events. The Administration

<HR>

<P>
Thanks to its long and rich history and the diversity of its natural
environment, the Czech Republic is a great attraction for the
millions of guests who visit it every year. <B>The jewel in the
Czech crown is Prague with its gorgeous and rich architectural
styles but the country is also dotted with numerous historical
city centres, castles and chateaux. </B>Outside the urban areas,
deep woods, rock formations and limestone caves are among the
many interesting sites the Czech Republic has to offer.
<H5>Historical Sites</H5>

<P>
Since the Czech lands lie exactly on the border of Eastern and
Western Europe, the country has come under the influence of several
different cultures throughout the course of history. Each of these
influences indelibly marked the face of the country with architectural
or artistic monuments. This accounts for the <B>uniquely rich
cultural heritage of this relatively small country</B>. In addition,
the Czech lands are extraordinary in Europe due to the fact that
they are practically untouched by the large-scale destruction
of war.
<H4><A NAME="i1"></A>CITIES</H4>

<H4><a href="http://www.cz/czech/prague/index.html">Prague</a> </H4>

<P>
The attractiveness of Prague lies in the breadth and diversity
of its offerings. The ordinary tourist is fascinated and forever
captivated by the unique atmosphere of the city, which has been
called the <B>&quot;heart of Europe&quot; </B>for ages. Among
the most fascinating places are the &quot;genius loci&quot; of
the inner historical parts of Prague - Hradcany (the Prague Castle),
the Lesser Town (Mala Strana) and the Old Town (Stare Mesto).
These areas, which virtually amount to small unique cities within
the larger city have their own particular features. Hradcany,
the large-scale, historically rich complex, has been the residence
and symbol of Czech statehood for centuries. The grandiose Gothic
St. Vitus Cathedral, dominates the Lesser Town roofs and offers
a beautiful view of dozens of Old Town towers. Charles Bridge,
the oldest stone bridge in Central Europe, connects the two historic
sites of the city. Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and especially
in the Old Town - Art Nouveau, cubism and modern styles from the
beginning of the century from a unique aesthetic unit.
<P>
There is only room here to describe a handful of examples from
the more than forty historically valuable cities in the country.
<H5>Kutna Hora </H5>

<P>
This town competed in richness and architectural beauty with Prague
during the Middle Ages when silver was mined here.
<H4>Cesky Krumlov </H4>

<P>
This beatiful city is dominated by its castle, which is located
at the top of a sheer granite cliff. The castle is almost comparable
in size with the one in Prague and the entire city has been included
on the UNESCO list of protected cities.
<H5>Telc </H5>

<P>
A Renaissance chateau and Renaissance and Baroque houses constitute
this city of European importance.
<H5>Olomouc </H5>

<P>
This city contains the second most important collection of historical
monuments in the Czech Republic (after Prague). Some of the oldest
parts of the city were built by the Premyslid dynasty in the 11th
century.
<H5><A NAME="i2"></A>CASTLES AND CHATEAUX</H5>

<P>
Kings and influential nobility built dozens of castles in order
to protect their lands, important trade routes, and regional frontiers.
Over time many of them fell into ruin, while others were rebuilt
as chateaux or used for business purposes. Nevertheless, many
castles still dominate the Czech landscape today.
<P>
The biggest or the most important of these are the architecturally
beautiful <B>Zvikov </B>castle known as &quot;the king
of Czech castles,&quot; the 15th century Gothic castle <B>Krivoklat</B>,
<B>Karlstejn </B>built by Charles IV to protect the coronation
jewels, and the Gothic castle <B>Bouzov </B>which looks like something
out of a fairy tale.
<P>
During the l6th century the nobility started to leave the uncomfortable
castles and to build new, more comfortable residences. Among them
are the Romantic <B>Konopiste </B>chateau which houses a
large collection of hunting trophies, the Baroque <B>Kuks </B>chateau
which houses a unique collection of statues by M.B. Braun illustrating
the Virtues and Vices, the Romantic chateau <B>Lednice </B>containing
the highest minaret outside Islamic countries and the most romantic
chateau in the country, the <B>Cervena Lhota </B>which
is built on a rock in the middle of a lake.
<H5>SACRAL MONUMENTS</H5>

<P>
The Czech Republic is also home to hundreds of churches, cathedrals
and monasteries of all types, including Benectine, Cisterian and
Pemonstratensian monasteries.
<H5>FOLK ARCHITECTURE AND TRADITIONS</H5>

<P>
Many monuments of folk architecture have been preserved in the
Czech Republic - dwellings of stone and brick (more than 5,000
of them). In addition, technical monuments have been preserved
- smithy forges, mills and so on. Other attractions include uniquely
preserved open-air folk museums in Moravia, picturesque, traditional
villages in Southern Bohemia preserved in their original appearance
and colorful folk festivals.
<P>
The custom of wearing local folk costumes has survived in Moravia
as well as in the Chodsko and Blata regions of Bohemia.
<H5>Spas</H5>

<P>
The Czech Republic is an outstanding world leader with regard
to spas. In addition to the world-famous Karlovy Vary, Marianske
Lazne and Frantiskovy Lazne, the Czech Republic
offers treatment at 50 additional spas. Many famous figures from
European cultural history enjoyed relaxing at Czech spas, among
them Goethe, Schiller and Janacek.
<H5><A NAME="i3"></A>Natural Heritage</H5>

<P>
The countryside is covered with hundreds of protected scenic regions
and natural preserves. They are accessible through a network of
hiking trails that allow visitors to wander through breathtaking
pieces of natural beauty. Tourist maps carry detailed depictions
of the trails.
<P>
<B>Krkonose (Giant Mountains)</B> 
<P>
The highest and most frequently visited mountains of the Czech
lands are the Krkonose. They offer terrain for summer Alpine
tourism as well as for cross-country and downhill skiing in the
winter. The highest peak is Mt. Snezka measuring 1,602 metres.
<P>
<B>Sumava (Bohemian Forest)</B> 
<P>
The picturesque beauty of the Sumava with its elongated slopes
and deep forests has attracted nature lovers for generations.
Its jewels are five glacial lakes, three of which are in the territory
of the Czech Republic: Cerne (46 acres and 130 ft deep),
Certovo and Plesne.
<P>
The nature preserve of the Boubin Primeval Forest is one
of the most valuable examples of virgin nature in Central Europe.
In addition to giant trees which are several centuries old, the
preserve features bizarre tangles of overhead roots.
<P>
<B>Southern Bohemia</B> 
<P>
This is the least industrialized part of the Czech lands. A characteristic
feature of South Bohemia is its large amount of lakes, moors,
meadows and mixed woods. It offers countless possibilities for
recreation near water and many historical monuments.
<P>
<B>Cesky Raj (Bohemian Paradise)</B> 
<P>
Here are vast granite rock cities, deep-cut valleys and river
canyons, which are located near Turnov, Jicin and
Mnichovo Hradiste.
<P>
<B>Moravsky kras (Moravian Karst)</B> 
<P>
This rather small limestone territory northeast of Brno contains
dozens of kilometres of caves with rich stalactite decoration.
An extraordinary experience awaits tourists who take a boat ride
on the underground river Punkva. The famous Macocha Abyss came
into existence after the collapse of several cave floors. It is
138,4 metres deep, and at the upper part 174 metres long and 76
metres wide.
<H4>Sport Tourism</H4>

<P>
<B>Skiing</B> 
<P>
Particularly outstanding terrain and slopes for downhill and cross-country
skiing are located in the Krkonose ski areas (Pec pod Snezkou,
Spindleruv Mlyn, Harachov), and in the Sumava,
the Jizera, the Jeseniky, and the Krusne (Ore)
Mountains.
<P>
<B>Mountain Climbing</B> 
<P>
Unique granite rocks offering varying degrees of scaling difficulty
( more than l,000 separate rocky towers) are situated in the Cesky
raj, near Decin, and near Adrspach at Broumov.
<P>
<B>Golf</B> 
<P>
- Despite 4O years of communist government, golf associations
in Prague and Marienbad are still operating.
<P>
- The largest new golf course is under construction near Karlstejn
castle, approximately 13 mi from Prague\
<P>
<B>Horseback riding </B>in the countryside is offered by many
riding schools.
<P>
Long <B>boat rides </B>on the Vltava, Luznice or Sazava
rivers offer unusual views of the Czech landscape.
<P>
Ideal conditions for <B>sailing and windsurfing </B>exist on the
Lipenska and Orlicka Dams in Southern Bohemia or
on the Vranovska Dam (Southern Moravia)

<P>
The Czech Republic is located in the Central European Time zone.
In line with neighbouring countries it uses the so-called summer
time from the last Sunday in March until the last Saturday in
September ( summer time means a 1 hour shift of time ahead from
normal Central European Time).
<H5><A NAME="i11"></A>Food in the Czech Republic</H5>

<P>
The Czech cuisine is rich in meat, most usually served with dumplings
or potatoes. Among the most common meals are various kinds of
goulash, beef with special cream sauce ( svickova
) or other sauces with various flavors (dill, tomato, etc.) The
real Czech specialty, dumplings filled with fruit, are not often
included on the menus of most restaurants. In the centers of big
cities, even the lower grade restaurants serve select meals from
international cuisine including fish and poultry meals. Venison
is popular, too.
<P>
Czech beer is one of the best in the world (Pilsen, Budvar and
Velkopopovicke beer are among the finest). Excellent wine
is produced in South Moravia and the Bohemian regions around Zernoseky
and Roudnice. A rather unique drink is the Czech herb liquer,
Becherovka. In central Moravia, in the area around Vizovice, plum
brandy (slivovice) is very popular. It contains up to 90% alcohol.

<P>
<A NAME="e1"></A>At the beginning of this century the territory
of the Czech Republic was one of the most economically developed
parts of Europe and was the most industrialized part of the former
Austria-Hungary. <B>Between the two world wars the Czech lands
were listed among the ten most developed states of the world.
</B>
<P>
After the Second World War the Czech state came under the Soviet
sphere of influence and for forty years was the victim of communist
experiments. Market relations were deeply repressed, market institutions
were liquidated and industry, land, and trade were completely
nationalized and submitted to central control. The whole country
went through a long and destructive economic stagnation and actual
decline in some areas.
<P>
However, even under the communists many companies maintained or
built-up relatively respectable reputations.

<P>
The fall of communism in l989 opened the road to economic reversal
and the reintroduction of a market economy through <B>radical
economic transformations</B>, which drew upon five basic measures:
<UL>
<LI>liberalization of prices and foreign trade
<LI>internal convertibility of the currency
<LI>privatization programs
<LI>restrictive monetary and financial policy of the state
<LI>tax reform
</UL>

<P>
Today the <B>transformation of economy is nearing completion </B>and
there are many encouraging signs of economic recovery.
<UL>
<LI>The private sector has begun to prevail in economy and its
influence on general economic development is steadily increasing.
By the end of 1994, 80-90% of economy should be privatized.
<LI>Millions of Czechs participated in the unique &quot;coupon
privatization&quot; scheme which is now in its second wave of
selling off state-owned companies. The process enabled citizens
to purchase inexpensive coupon booklets of privatization &quot;points&quot;
which they could exchange for shares in companies. The model is
now being adopted by other former communist countries.
<LI>The goods and labor market is quickly developing and at the
same time a capital market has been established. (The Commercial
Stock Exchange takes place three times a week with an average
700 million Kc in transactions per day.)
<LI>The exchange rate with foreign currencies has been stabilized
(for the past 4 years it has been maintained at approximately
29 Kc for l USD, l8 Kc for l DM.)
<LI>The balance of payments is in surplus and foreign currency
reserves reached 7.7 billion USD (June l994) which corresponds
approximately to seven months worth of imports.
<LI>Inflation is under control and the rate is expected to stay
below 10 percent in 1994, according to government and OECD estimates.
<LI>The national debt of the Czech Republic per capita, pegged
at approximately 850 USD, is the lowest in the region. The Czech
government paid back all its loans from the International Monetary
Fund in the summer of 1994 - two years ahead of time.
<LI>Demand is substantially increasing; this is apparent from
rising household expenses for goods and services at stable prices.
<LI>The unemployment rate remains low and is expected to rise
to a maximum of only 4% in 1994, according to government estimates.
<LI>The export market is rapidly and successfully shifting to
the markets of OECD countries, and exports themselves are rapidly
increasing (in l993 stable prices increased by more than 17%).
<LI>Both the volume of personal and corporate deposits is increasing.
The rate of savings is also increasing. These trends reflect the
population's confidence in the domestic currency.

<H4><A NAME="e3"></A>DEVELOPMENT OF MAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS 
</H4>

<H5>Gross Domestic Product</H5>

<P>
The noticeable decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) during
l991 slowed down and in 1993 the situation was further stabilized.
The GDP is expected to increase by up to 2.5% in 1994, according
to government estimates.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr1.jpg">GDP chart...</a>
<H5>Industrial Production</H5>

<P>
The long-term decline of industrial production is a natural process
involving a decrease in the production of unnecessary products
and a reduction of the disproportionate amount of heavy and light
industry in the gross domestic product. The loss of markets in
Slovakia after the split, and economic stagnation in Western Europe
also play a role. Of those large and medium-size industrial enterprises
already privatized by coupon privatization, some have been harmed
because new owners were slow to take control of management.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr2.jpg">Industrial production chart...</a>
<H5>Consumer Prices</H5>

<P>
The complete liberalization of prices which began Jan. 1, 1991
led to an extreme but isolated rise in prices. The implementation
of a value added tax (VAT) on 1.1.1993 brought another rise in
prices. Consumer prices have now stabilized and average monthly
inflation has been kept under 0.8% during the first half 1994.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr3.jpg">Consumer prices graph...</a>
<H5>Foreign trade</H5>

<P>
Despite the considerable drop in exports to the Slovak Republic
after the division of Czechoslovakia, the balance of the foreign
trade of the Czech Republic in l993 showed a credit and this tendency
continued in the first quarter of l994 as well.
<P>
The territorial structure of the Czech Republic's foreign trade
turnover has changed considerably over the past four years. Trade
with all post-Communist states has substantially decreased while
trade with the European Union and European Free Trade Agreement
countries has increased significantly.

<H5>State Budget</H5>

<P>
The state budget for l993 registered a slight surplus. Revenues
totalled 358 million Kc and expenditures 356.9 million Kc. The
government proposed a balanced state budget for l994, which was
approved by Parliament. At the end of the first half of 1994,
the state budget registered a surplus of 9.7 billion Kc.

<H5><A NAME="e4"></A>Exchange Rate</H5>

<P>
In l990 the Czechoslovak currency was devalued three times thus
deflating the artificially high exchange rate of the crown.
<P>
Since May l993 the Czech crown has been affixed to the two most
important world currencies - USD and DEM - oscillating only to
the extent that the exchange rate between these two currencies
oscillates. The exchange rate of about 29 Kc to l USD has been
maintained since l990. The fixed exchange rate of the crown in
relation to other freely convertible currencies has become the
main anchor of the Czech economy.

<P>
The slow-down of direct investments in l993 was brought on by
investors who waited to see what consequences the split with Slovakia
would have on the political and economic stability of the Czech
Republic. Also, following the conclusion of the first wave of
privatization, investors were waiting to learn what interesting
projects were planned for the second wave. These conditions, however,
have not changed the character of the current economic climate
as one which is favorable for foreign investment. Major foreign
consulting firms evaluate the Czech Republic as a reliable country
where any risks attached to investment are becoming less significant.

<H4><A NAME="e6"></A>BANKING SYSTEM OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC </H4>

<P>
The banking system can be divided into three groups. The large
banks, which emerged before l990 and which offer a complete assortment
of banking services and command a wide network of branches. These
include the Ceska sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank), the
Investicni a postovni banka (Investment and
Postal Bank), the Komercni banka (Commercial Bank), the
Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka (Czechoslovak Commercial
Bank) and Zivnostenska Bank.
<P>
The second group is composed of smaller Czech banks with a relatively
minor share of foreign capital. They offer certain specialized
services, the majority of which are oriented toward the private
sector.
<P>
The third group is comprised of foreign banks which help complement
the necessary competitive environment in the banking sector.
<P>
The structure of the banking system as of June 31, 1994:
<P>
- 24 commercial banks, joint stock companies without foreign ownership
<P>
- 12 commercial banks, joint stock companies with partial foreign
ownership
<P>
- lO commercial banks, joint stock companies with lOO% foreign
ownership
<P>
- lO branches of foreign banks
<P>
- l state monetary institute (Konsolidacni banka)
<P>
- There are also 41 representatives of foreign banks in the Czech
Republic.
<P>
A new amendment to the banking law provides for state insurance
of deposits in the country, which brings the Czech Republic's
laws in this area closer into line with European norms.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr11.jpg>Interest rates on new credits graph...</a>
<H4><A NAME="e7"></A>CAPITAL MARKET</H4>

<P>
The capital market emerged in 1993. Crucial practical steps were
taken for the development of stocks and shares in the Czech Republic
during this year. These processes led to the creation of the Stock
Exchange of Securities Praha, and the stock trading agency known
as RM-System.
<P>
Stock and shares are traded on the Stock Exchange. Currently the
exchange has 52 members who are entitled to trade. Other interested
parties have access to the market only through the mediation of
these members.
<P>
In the framework of the automatic electronic securities market,
the RM-System is used mainly by minor investors who acquired their
shares through coupon privatization and who have difficulty gaining
access to the Stock Exchange. On the whole, trading is done within
the framework of RM-S with approximately l,l00 securities.

<H3><A NAME="e8"></A>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC
</H3>
<HR>

<P>
The favourable geographical position of the Czech Republic, its
highly qualified labor force, and the excellent reputation of
Czechoslovak products from the pre-war period began attracting
the interest of foreign investors as early as November l989. Phillip
Morris, Coca Cola, Procter and Gamble, Volkswagen, AVX/Kyocera
are among the many multinational corporations to have opened production
plants in the Czech Republic.
<P>
Among other factors, the Czech Republic is attractive to foreign
investors for the following reasons:
<UL>
<LI><B>liberal economic policy of the government </B>
<LI><B>political stability </B>
<LI><B>highly qualified labour force </B>
<LI><B>wage controls, which enable the maintenance of low production
costs </B>
<LI><B>an exchange-rate of the crown favourable for export </B>
</UL>

<P>
In recent years, legislation guaranteeing the security of foreign
investors has been strengthened, and these investors are now considered
fully equal to native entrepreneurs. There are no restrictions
on the amount of foreign investment in the Czech Republic.
<P>
No formal approval is needed for foreign investments except in
the case of investment in the privatization scheme, banking, or
the arms industry.
<P>

<H4>Curriculum vitae</H4>

<P>
Vaclav Havel was born in Prague on October 5, 1936. In 1951 he
completed his
<P>
compulsory schooling. Being the offspring of a prominent Prague
businessmen's family,
<P>
he was barred from pursuing regular studies afterwards. For four
years, while taking an
<P>
apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory technician, he was attending
evening classes at
<P>
a grammar school. It was at the age of nineteen that he started
publishing studies and
<P>
articles in literary and theater magazines. Family tradition has
led him toward embracing
<P>
the humanist values of Czech culture that were suppressed or destroyed
in the 1950s. As
<P>
he was not allowed, due to his family background, to study humanities,
he went on to a
<P>
Technical University where he spent two years.
<P>
After completing his military service, he worked as a stagehand
at the ABC Theater and
<P>
later, from 1960, in the Theater on the Balustrade. The latter
theater produced his first
<P>
plays, most importantly The Garden Party (1963), a piece representing
in an outstanding
<P>
manner the strong regeneration tendencies prevailing in Czech
culture and Czech society
<P>
in the 1960s which culminated in the so-called Prague Spring of
1968. At that time

Vaclav Havel was taking part in public and cultural life as <p>one
of the standard-bearers
of the democratic concepts of Czech <p>culture and society. In the
second half of the 1960s
<P>

<img src="/infosrc/hrad/havel/pictures/hthinks.jpg">
</table>
his next plays, The Memorandum (1965) and The Increased Difficulty
of Concentration
<P>

(1968), were performed. After the invasion of Czechoslovakia by
Soviet troops, which put
<P>
an end to the Prague Spring regeneration process, Vaclav Havel
did not abandon his
<P>
convictions. Consequently, a lasting ban was imposed on publication
of his plays in
<P>
Czechoslovakia. (In 1974 he even worked as a laborer in a brewery.)
<P>
It was then that Vaclav Havel began to be known by the international
public as a
<P>
representative of the Czechoslovak intellectual opposition. As
a citizen he protested
<P>
against the extensive oppression marking the years of the so-called
normalization. His
<P>
open letter to Dr. Gustav Husak (the then President of Czechoslovakia)
of 1975 in which
<P>
he pointed out the critical condition of the society and the responsibility
of the then
<P>
ruling regime for that condition became widely known. In 1977
he became one of the co-
<P>
founders of, and one of the first three spokesmen for, the Charter
77 initiative. He was
<P>
also a member of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
Prosecuted which was
<P>
founded by a group of Charter 77 signatories. His activity brought
him to prison three
<P>
times; altogether he spent in prison nearly five years. Of extraordinary
importance at that
<P>
time was his essay The Power of the Powerless (1978) in which
he analyzed the essence
<P>
of Communist totalitarian oppression and described the means and
mechanisms used by
<P>
the Communist regime in its effort to create a powerless, resigned
society consisting of
<P>
timid and morally corrupt individuals. Against the background
of that analysis, he
<P>
demonstrated the strength of moral resistance - of life in truth.
The impact of the essay
<P>
reached beyond the scope of the Czechoslovak dissent, influencing
also the opposition
<P>
movements in other then &quot;socialist&quot; countries.
<P>
In November 1989 Vaclav Havel was one of the leading initiators
of the founding of the
<P>
Civic Forum, an association uniting opposition civic movements
and democratic
<P>
initiatives. Since the very first days of its existence he was
the head of the Civic Forum,
<P>
becoming a key figure of the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot;. In
December 1989 he was elected
<P>
President of Czechoslovakia for a term ending after parliamentary
elections were held
<P>
in the country. The freely elected Parliament re-elected him to
the presidency in July
<P>
1990 for a term of two years.
<P>
As President of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, he met
nearly all European
<P>
Heads of State, as well as the Presidentsof the United States,
the Soviet Union and a
<P>
number of other countries. His activity in the area of foreign
policy has laid the
<P>
foundations of Czechoslovakia's new external relations. In domestic
policy Vaclav Havel
<P>

has been a leading initiator of democratic changes in the <p>administration
of the country and of the advancement <p>of democracy in society. He has been respected
as a nonpartisan
<P>
President and as an essential integrating authority on the political <p>
scene and also in

matters relating to the Czecho-Slovak relationship.
<P>
</table>
From the position of President of the Czechoslovak Republic Vaclav
Havel resigned on
<P>
July 20, at 6 pm. On July 17 he accounted for the abdication by
explaining that he could
<P>
no longer fulfill commitments necessitated by the oath of allegiance
to the Czech and
<P>
Slovac Republic in a way that would harmonize with his convictions,
dispositions
<P>
and consciousness.
<P>
After his resignation he left public life for 2 months. In September
1992 he agreed with
<P>
goverment's suggestion that first, President is to be elected
by both chambers of
<P>
Parliament, second, President cannot be recalled by Parliament
and third, the President
<P>
has right to dissolve Parliament. Moreover, he agreed with so-called
right of suspensive
<P>
veto (it is the right of President to return laws to Parliament).
<P>
On January 1993 Vaclav Havel was elected the first President of
the Czech Republic.
<P>
During Vaclav Havel's presidency two more books have come into
being - Projevy (only
<P>
in Czech, 1990) and Letni premitani (1991).

<body>
<img align=left  vspace=7 hspace=12 src="zel2.gif">

<strong>JOSEF ZIELENIEC, 

THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC</strong>
<br>
was appointed Foreign Minister on July 5,
1992 by the Czech National Council, i.e., the Czech parliament,
after the June elections. He was given a mandate to create the
Czech Foreign Ministry, and on January 1, 1993 was appointed the
Czech Foreign Minister.<br>
     Josef Zieleniec is a co-founder of the Civic Democratic
Party (ODS) and a member of its Executive Committee. He was
elected its Deputy Chairman in November 1991 and reelected in
November 1992.<br>
     Josef Zieleniec is one of the main authors of the ODS party
platform, especially of the economic and foreign policy chapters
of the programme.<br>
     Until 1990, he was not a member of any political party,
having spent most of his life as an academic.<br>

     Born in 1946, Josef Zieleniec graduated from the School of

mathematical methods in economics.<br>
      In 1986, he defended his thesis in microeconomics and began
work at the Institute of Economics of the Czechoslovak Academy
of Sciences. There he initiated a seminar which greatly
influenced the opinion of Czechoslovak economists on the
transformation proless a centrally planned to a free market
economy. Within the framework of this seminar, he prepared the
study "Czechoslovakia at the Crossroads," which influenced the
post-November discussions on economic reform.<br>
      In January 1990, Josef Zieleniec founded and became director
of the Centre for economic Research and Graduate Educations
(CERGE) at Charles University, the first Western-style Ph D-

<B><A NAME="a2"></A>TOPOGRAPHY</B> 
<P>
 The divide between the two principal orographic systems in Europe
- the Hercynian and Alpine-Himalayan - runs through Czech territory.
Thus the country's topography is quite varied: plains (4.5% of
the territory), hills (50.1%) highlands (33.9%) and mountains
(11.6%).
<P>
<B>Altitude levels:</B> 
<P>
lowland regions up to 200 m above sea level (4.9% of the territory)
<P>
regions 200 - 500 m above sea level (74.1%)
<P>
regions 600 - 1 000 m above sea level (19.3%)
<P>
regions above 1 000 m above sea level (1.6%)
<P>
<B>Principal Mountain Ranges</B> 
<P>
<I>Krkonose (Giant Mountains)</I> 
<UL>
<LI>The Krkonose range stretches 40 km into Bohemian territory,
creating a natural border between the Czech Republic and Poland.
<LI> It is the highest mountain range of the Czech Republic.
<LI>lThe highest peak is Mt. Snezka (1,602 m). Several other peaks
exceed 1,500 m.
<LI>In order to preserve both wildlife and the environment, Krkonose
was proclaimed a national park in 1963.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>Hruby Jesenik (Ash Montains)</I> 
<UL>
<LI>The second highest mountain range of the Czech Massif.
</UL>

<P>
Highest peak - Praded Peak (1,491 m).
<UL>
<LI>Located in northern Moravia, this range is similar in character
to that of the Krkonose range.
<LI>It has been a protected region since 1969.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>Sumava (Bohemian Forest)</I> 
<P>
The third highest mountain range of the Czech Massif (Plechy
Peak: 1,373 m).
<UL>
<LI>It extends 125 km into southwestern Bohemia from the border
and creates a natural boundary with Germany.
<LI>Five limestone lakes found here are of glacial origin. The
Black Lake is the largest (46 acres).
<LI>Sumava has been a protected region since 1962 and was
declared a national park in 1991. This region is also protected
on the German side as it becomes The Bavarian Forest National
Park.
</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="a3"></A>WATERS</B> 
<P>
The Czech lands are called the &quot;roof of Europe&quot; since
their only source of water is atmospheric rain and snowfall. All
the rivers which have their source in the area, drain into neighboring
countries.
<P>
The Czech Republic has three watersheds:
<UL>
<LI>The Labe (Elbe) River Basin (North Sea bound) - 51,399 sq.km
</UL>

<P>
Main rivers: Labe, Vltava
<UL>
<LI>The Odra (Oder) River Basin (Baltic bound) - 4,721 sq.km
</UL>

<P>
Main rivers: Odra, Opava, Ostravice and Olse
<UL>
<LI>The Dunaj (Danube) River Basin (Black Sea bound) - 22,744
sq. km
</UL>

<P>
Main rivers: Morava, Dyje
<P>
The watersheds intersect at Kralicky Sneznik on
the Polish border.
<P>
<B>Lakes and Ponds</B> 
<P>
There are 455 natural lakes in the Czech Republic, 350 of which
are river lakes in the grasslands of larger rivers.
<UL>
<LI>A characteristic feature of the Czech landscape is the large
number of ponds created for fish-farming. They number 21,800 in
total and cover about 101,311 acres. The largest of them are Lake
Rozmberk and Lake Bezdrev in southern Bohemia.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Mineral Waters</B> 
<P>
The abundance and quality of mineral springs in the Czech Republic
makes it a world leader in this area.
<P>
Many large and renowned spas have been founded around natural
or drilled mineral water springs, including the spa at <I>Karlovy
Vary</I>, as well as <I>Marianske Lazne</I>,
<I>Frantiskovy Lazne</I>, <I>Podebrady, Luhacovice,
Jachymov</I>, and many others which are smaller but therapeutically
important. The warmest Czech springs include the famous Thermal
Spring in Karlovy Vary (72&#176 C), springs in Teplice (42&#176 C) and Janske
Lazne (29.6&#176 C). The waters from former uranium mines in
Jachymov have the highest radioactivity in the world (5,085
Mach units, .08 oz. Rn/gal.)<HR>

<P>
<b><A NAME="a4"></A>CLIMATE</b>
<P>
The Czech Republic lies in the temperate climate zone of Europe,
which makes for pleasantly mild summers and winters with only
moderate amounts of precipitation.
<UL>
<LI>Lowland temperatures in July average 20&#176 C, (Prague 19.5&#176 C)
and in
</UL>

<P>
mountainous areas 8-11&#176 C.

<H5><A NAME="c1"></A>Basic Historical Outline </H5>

<UL>
<LI>End of the 5th and beginning of the 6th century - arrival
of Slavs in present-day Moravia and Slovakia
<LI>Second half of the 9th century - arrival of Christian missionaries
<LI>9th century - 1306 a gradual strengthening of the Czech state
during the reign of the Premyslid dynasty
<LI>1346-1378 - the peak in the prestige and power of the kingdom

<LI>Beginning of the 15th century - a crisis of state leads to
the Hussite movement
<LI>1526 - the Habsburg dynasty succeeds to the throne of Bohemia
- the formation of a multi-national empire
<LI>1620 - the defeat of the Bohemian Estates at the Battle of
White Mountain, continued centralization of the Habsburg Empire
<LI>28.10.1918 - foundation of an independent state of Czechs
and Slovaks
<LI>15.3.1939 - 9.5.1945 - German occupation
<LI>February 1948 - Communist takeover
<LI>August 1968 - Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw
Pact countries brings an end to the &quot;Prague Spring&quot;
and the Communist Party's attempt to build &quot;Socialism with
a human face&quot;
<LI>November 1989 - fall of the Communist regime
<LI>1.1. 1993 Czech Republic founded after the split of Czechoslovakia
</UL>

<P>
<B>Around the 4th century B.C. the present-day Czech Republic
was populated by Celts. </B>They were the first ethnic group to
arrive in the area, according to historical evidence. The Celtic
Boii tribe gave the country its Latin name - Boiohaemum (Bohemia).
They were pushed out by the German tribes (Marcomanni, Quidi)
before the beginning of our era.
<P>
<B>At the end of 5th and the beginning of 6th century Slavs settled
in the territory of Bohemia and Moravia </B>during the period
known as the Migration of Peoples. The first half of the 7th century
marks the first successful attempt to unite Slavonic tribes. The
so-called &quot;Samo's kingdom&quot; resisted the pressure of
the powerful Avar empire centered in the Hungarian lowlands, and
defended its territory against the forces of the Frank attackers
from the west, with partial success.
<H5><B><A NAME="c2">The Great Moravian Empire </A></B>(the last
two-thirds of the 9th century - destroyed by the Magyars in the
years 903-907) </H5>

<P>
The culture of the Great Moravian Empire greatly influenced the
development of culture and religion among the Eastern and Southern
Slavs in the Middle Ages. In 863, the Byzantine Christian missionaries
Constantin and Methodius came to Moravia to introduce Slavic liturgy
there. Very soon, however, the influence of the Roman Catholic
Church expanded, proving to be decisive in the course of the history
of Bohemia and Moravia.
<H4><A NAME="c3">The Premyslid Dynasty </A>(9th century - 1306)
</H4>

<P>
Bohemia became the center of an independent state-building process.
During the reign of the native Premyslid dynasty, <B>the Czech
state gradually grew in strength </B>and succeeded in preserving
its actual sovereignty despite formal vassal ties to the Holy
Roman Empire.
<P>
935 - death of Prince Wenceslas, the patron saint of Bohemia
<P>
973-976 - establishment of the Prague Bishopric
<P>
1085 - Vratislav became the first Bohemian prince to be granted
the right to use a royal title, as a reward for his support of
the Emperor Henry IV during the struggle with Pope Gregory VII
<P>
<B>1212 - Premysl Otakar I received The Golden Bull of Sicily,
a decree proclaiming Bohemia a kingdom and Bohemian princes hereditary
kings</B>, and also declaring the indivisibility of the kingdom
of Bohemia and regulating the relationship of the realm to the
Holy Roman Empire. Bohemia then became one of the most important
states within the framework of the Empire.
<P>
1253-1278 - the reign of the powerful king Premysl Otakar II was
characterized by a policy of expansion of power. This expansionist
tendency was continued during the reigns of the last Premyslid
kings as well.
<P>
1306 - the murder of Wenceslas III and the Premyslid dynasty dies
out in the spear - side.
<H5><A NAME="c4">The Luxembourg Dynasty </A>(1310 - 1437) </H5>

<P>
The reign of the dynasty began when John of Luxembourg (1310-1346)
was elected King of Bohemia in 1310. The Luxembourg kings added
new regions to their kingdom. This realm was named The Crownlands
of Bohemia, a term made official by a decree of Charles IV in
1348. The official Crownlands were made up of the kingdom of Bohemia
and the so-called adjoining lands - the margravate of Moravia,
the Silesian principalities, Upper Lusatia and, from 1368, Lower
Lusatia too.
<P>
<B>The kingdom of Bohemia reached its height of power and prestige
during the reign of Charles IV (1346-1378)</B>, the second Luxembourg
on the throne of Bohemia: In 1344, the Prague Archbishopric was
founded. He established Charles University in 1348 - it was the
first university founded north of the Alps. Charles IV was crowned
Roman Emperor in Rome in 1355.
<H5><A NAME="c5"></A>The Hussite Revolution (1419 - 1436) </H5>

<P>
Several conditions led to the creation of the Hussite reform movement.
The first was the economic and political crisis during the reign
of Wenceslas IV (1378-1419), the successor of Charles IV. This
crisis was exacerbated by the problems in Europe of this time
(the Great Schism, criticism of the Church). The Hussite movement
was inspired by the ideas of Master Jan Hus, a preacher who was
burnt at the stake in 1415 at Constance. Despite his death, his
supporters successfully continued in their efforts to reform the
Church.
<P>
Heir to the crown of Bohemia, the Roman Emperor Sigismund, tried
to defeat the growing revolution with force, but <B>the Hussites
defeated his five consecutive crusades in the years 1420-1431</B>.
Only the victory of 1434, when the moderates defeated the radicals,
opened the way for a temporary agreement between Hussite Bohemia
and Catholic Europe. This agreement, The Compacts of Basle was
proclaimed in 1436 and confirmed the Hussite denomination, and
would later be paralleled by the Reformation of the 16th century.
<B>The Hussite movement changed the structure of society in many
ways. It created religious dualism for the first time in Christian
Europe. </B>There was a decline in the power and prosperity of
the Church from which the nobility and towns were able to profit.
The Czech nation and Czech culture came to the forefront of social
life. In the years of unrest, a Czech noble - George of Podebrady,
a skillful diplomat and a man of outstanding personality, became
the leader of Czech political life. He was elected King of Bohemia
in 1458. His diplomatic activities - notably his effort to establish
a peace confederation of the European sovereigns - even reached
beyond the horizon of central Europe.
<H5><A NAME="c6">The Jagellon Dynasty</A> (1471-1526) </H5>

<P>
1471-1516 - Vladislav Jagellon, a son of King Cazimir of Poland,
was elected King of Bohemia.
<P>
During the reigns of Vladislav and his son Louis, the power of
the Estates grew, however, royal power diminished. Various conflicts
also took place: a conflict between royal towns and nobles, and
religious struggles between the Hussite Church and the minority
Catholic Church which aimed to regain its former power.
<H5><A NAME="c7">The Habsburg Dynasty</A> (1526-1918) </H5>

<P>
The Habsburgs of Austria succeeded to the throne of Bohemia when
the Jagellon line died out. <B>The Habsburg rule brought the re-introduction
of the Roman Catholic faith, centralization and the construction
of a multi-national empire. The Habsburgs included the Crownlands
of Bohemia in their monarchy, and they remained a part of the
Habsburg empire until 1918.</B> 
<P>
When Rudolf II (1576-1611), during his reign, left Vienna for
Prague, Bohemian capital grew into an important center of European
culture. The Czech Estates forced Rudolf II to issue a decree
- so called &quot;Maiestatus&quot; - proclaiming freedom of religious
confession. The Emperors Matthias and Ferdinand tried to limit
this freedom and their efforts sparked a civil war between the
Estates and the Catholic Emperor. The Estates were defeated in
1620 at the Battle of the White Mountain. The following period
of the Thirty Years' War brought political disorder and economic
devastation to Bohemia which had far-reaching consequences on
the future development of the country. The people of Bohemia were
forced to accept the Catholic faith or to emigrate. The throne
of Bohemia was made hereditary in the Habsburg dynasty and the
most important offices were transferred permanently to Vienna.
<P>
In the period after the end of the Thirty Years' War high Baroque
culture became deeply rooted in Bohemia. Czech Baroque influenced
the architecture of Czech towns and villages for several centuries.
<P>
A crisis of feudalism and the fiscal interests of the state led
to the Enlightment reforms of Maria Theresa and Joseph II in the
second half of the 18th century. The reforms brought some positive
results as Bohemia and the margravate of Moravia each became an
independent part of the Habsburg Monarchy. There were some negative
results however. The reforms contributed to the centralization
of power and to Germanization, which proved to be a serious threat
to the identity of the Slavic nationalities of the empire.
<H5><A NAME="c8">Foundation of the Modern Czech Nation</A> </H5>

<P>
Although the Czech national revival movement aspired at first
only to a revival of the Czech language and culture, it soon began
to strive for political emancipation. In the revolutionary year
1848, Czech politicians made the first coherent political propositions
aimed at rebuilding the empire into a federalist state. <B>A desire
for national emancipation was supported by the quick industrialization
of Bohemia, which made the country the most developed land of
the monarchy in the second half of the 19th century.</B> 
<H5><A NAME="c9">Independent State </A>(from 1918) </H5>

<P>
In the years during World War I Czech politics took a turn towards
radicalism as a result of the activities abroad of T. G. Masaryk
and E. Benes, the future presidents. The defeat of the Austria-Hungary
cleared the way for the foundation of an independent state of
Czechs and Slovaks (28.10.1918). <B>The Czechoslovak Republic
became one of the ten most developed countries of the world. </B>A
period of twenty years of democracy and prosperity was ended by
the aggression of Hitler's Germany. The conference in Munich and
the following German occupation in March 1939 brought the end
of the independent Czech state.
<P>
After World War II, the restored republic became part of the Soviet
sphere of power. A period of &quot;limited&quot; democracy was
ended by a <B>Communist takeover in February 1948</B>. All private
property was expropriated and political and human rights were
supressed. An attempt to change and humanize Communist totality
and to weaken ties to the Soviet Union failed when the Soviet
Army invaded the country in August 1968.
<P>
The gradual decay of the Communist regime and the Soviet empire,
and the mass protests and demonstrations of the Czechoslovak people
culminated in the <B>overthrow of the Communist regime in November
1989</B>. The changes were confirmed by the election of Vaclav
Havel as president of the republic.
<P>
<B>On January 1, 1993, the Czechoslovak state was peacefully divided
and the independent Czech and Slovak Republics were founded. </B>The
Czechs are now completing the transformation of the formerly centralized
state system into a parliamentary democracy and market economy.

<H2>POLITICAL SYSTEM </H2>
<HR>

<H5>The Czech republic is a parlamentary democracy with a number
of active political parties and movements. In this section you
can find a short description of Czech <A HREF="#d1">political history</A>,
information about the most <A HREF="#d2">important constitutional institutions</A>
(e.g. President, Parlament, Chamber of Deputies, Senate, Government,
the Supreme Audit Office, The Czech National Bank, The Constitutional
Court and the Supreme Court), and an outline of the Czech <A HREF="#d3">political scene </A>(political
parties of <A HREF="#d4">coalition </A>and <A HREF="#d5">opposition</A>).
<a href="http://jupiter.felk.cvut.cz/html/organy.html">Directory of the Government</a> and <a href="gopher://sunny.stat-usa.gov/00/STAT-USA/NTDB/Ccg/ccg00304.txt">Czech Government Contacts</a> offer

Departement's Annual Report on Human Rights</a>.</H5>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="d1">History</A> </H4>

<P>
After World War II, the political system in Czechoslovakia was
greatly affected by the establishment of a Soviet-style Communist
regime, which took place in other countries of Central and Eastern
Europe as well. The system of power was distorted.
<P>
In effect this imbalance meant that the three branches of power
necessary for democratic development - executive, legislative
and judicial - were substituted by a unified Communist power.
Its power was based on the constitution and for forty years it
ruled all layers of social and political life throughout the country
with the help of oppressive institutions.
<P>
From January 1948, when the Communist Party took over, it became
the only autonomous political entity. It allowed a few other parties
to exist within the so-called National Front; however, these parties
held no real power and were created to provide the outward image
of Czechoslovakia as a democratic state.
<P>
After the revolutionary events of November 1989 which brought
about the fall of the Communist regime, the entire country faced
an uneasy task - to resume its pre-Communist traditions and to
build a democratic political system.
<P>
A wide diversity of political parties was established even before
the breakup of Czechoslovakia on December 31, 1992. The constitution
of the Czech Republic, which became valid on the day of the birth
of the new state, explicitly defined: civil rights, the relationship
between the executive and legislative branches of power, and the
independence of the courts.

In 1989, after overthrowing the &quot;one party&quot; government,
Czechoslovak citizens found new freedom - the right to freely
form political parties and movements according to one's political
convictions. Very soon after the fall of the totalitarian regime
a colorful variety of political parties was established and provided
the foundations for a more stable political climate.

further party divisions occurred except within the opposition
parties.
</UL>

<H5><A NAME="d4">Coalition </A></H5>

of the most important <A HREF="#e2">macroeconomic indicators</A>
of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and their
<A HREF="#e3">development</A> in the last few years. You can find
information on the <A HREF="#e4">exchange rate</A>, <A HREF="#e5">foreign investment</A>,
<A HREF="#e6">the banking system</A>, <A HREF="#e7">capital markets</A>,

<HR>

<P>
<A NAME="e1"></A>At the beginning of this century the territory
of the Czech Republic was one of the most economically developed
parts of Europe and was the most industrialized part of the former
Austria-Hungary. <B>Between the two world wars the Czech lands
were listed among the ten most developed states of the world.
</B>
<P>
After the Second World War the Czech state came under the Soviet
sphere of influence and for forty years was the victim of communist
experiments. Market relations were deeply repressed, market institutions
were liquidated and industry, land, and trade were completely
nationalized and submitted to central control. The whole country
went through a long and destructive economic stagnation and actual
decline in some areas.
<P>
However, even under the communists many companies maintained or
built-up relatively respectable reputations.
<P>
- glass industry - <I>Moser, Bohemia Glass</I> 
<P>
- brewing - <I>Pilsner Urquell, Budweiser</I> 
<P>
- trucks - <I>Tatra, Avia, Liaz</I>

<P>
The fall of communism in l989 opened the road to economic reversal
and the reintroduction of a market economy through <B>radical
economic transformations</B>, which drew upon five basic measures:
<UL>
<LI>liberalization of prices and foreign trade
<LI>internal convertibility of the currency
<LI>privatization programs
<LI>restrictive monetary and financial policy of the state
<LI>tax reform
</UL>

<P>
Today the <B>transformation of economy is nearing completion </B>and
there are many encouraging signs of economic recovery.
<UL>
<LI>The private sector has begun to prevail in economy and its
influence on general economic development is steadily increasing.
By the end of 1994, 80-90% of economy should be privatized.
<LI>Millions of Czechs participated in the unique &quot;coupon
privatization&quot; scheme which is now in its second wave of
selling off state-owned companies. The process enabled citizens
to purchase inexpensive coupon booklets of privatization &quot;points&quot;
which they could exchange for shares in companies. The model is
now being adopted by other former communist countries.
<LI>The goods and labor market is quickly developing and at the
same time a capital market has been established. (The Commercial

700 million Kc in transactions per day.)
<LI>The exchange rate with foreign currencies has been stabilized
(for the past 4 years it has been maintained at approximately
29 Kc for l USD, l8 Kc for l DM.)
<LI>The balance of payments is in surplus and foreign currency
reserves reached 7.7 billion USD (June l994) which corresponds
approximately to seven months worth of imports.
<LI>Inflation is under control and the rate is expected to stay
below 10 percent in 1994, according to government and OECD estimates.
<LI>The national debt of the Czech Republic per capita, pegged
at approximately 850 USD, is the lowest in the region. The Czech
government paid back all its loans from the International Monetary
Fund in the summer of 1994 - two years ahead of time.
<LI>Demand is substantially increasing; this is apparent from
rising household expenses for goods and services at stable prices.
<LI>The unemployment rate remains low and is expected to rise
to a maximum of only 4% in 1994, according to government estimates.
<LI>The export market is rapidly and successfully shifting to
the markets of OECD countries, and exports themselves are rapidly
increasing (in l993 stable prices increased by more than 17%).

<H4><A NAME="e3"></A>DEVELOPMENT OF MAIN ECONOMIC INDICATORS 
</H4>

<H5>Gross Domestic Product</H5>

<P>
The noticeable decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) during
l991 slowed down and in 1993 the situation was further stabilized.
The GDP is expected to increase by up to 2.5% in 1994, according
to government estimates.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr1.jpg>GDP chart...</a>
<H5>Industrial Production</H5>

<P>
The long-term decline of industrial production is a natural process
involving a decrease in the production of unnecessary products
and a reduction of the disproportionate amount of heavy and light
industry in the gross domestic product. The loss of markets in
Slovakia after the split, and economic stagnation in Western Europe
also play a role. Of those large and medium-size industrial enterprises
already privatized by coupon privatization, some have been harmed
because new owners were slow to take control of management.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr2.jpg>Industrial production chart...</a>
<H5>Consumer Prices</H5>

<P>
The complete liberalization of prices which began Jan. 1, 1991
led to an extreme but isolated rise in prices. The implementation
of a value added tax (VAT) on 1.1.1993 brought another rise in
prices. Consumer prices have now stabilized and average monthly
inflation has been kept under 0.8% during the first half 1994.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr3.jpg>Consumer prices graph...</a>
<h5>Foreign trade</H5>

<P>
Despite the considerable drop in exports to the Slovak Republic
after the division of Czechoslovakia, the balance of the foreign
trade of the Czech Republic in l993 showed a credit and this tendency
continued in the first quarter of l994 as well.
<P>
The territorial structure of the Czech Republic's foreign trade
turnover has changed considerably over the past four years. Trade
with all post-Communist states has substantially decreased while
trade with the European Union and European Free Trade Agreement
countries has increased significantly.

<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr6.jpg>FT development</a>
<H5>State Budget</H5>

<P>
The state budget for l993 registered a slight surplus. Revenues
totalled 358 million Kc and expenditures 356.9 million Kc. The
government proposed a balanced state budget for l994, which was
approved by Parliament. At the end of the first half of 1994,
the state budget registered a surplus of 9.7 billion Kc.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr7.jpg>State budget total surplus chart...</a>
<H5><A NAME="e4"></A>Exchange Rate</H5>

<P>
In l990 the Czechoslovak currency was devalued three times thus
deflating the artificially high exchange rate of the crown.
<P>
Since May l993 the Czech crown has been affixed to the two most
important world currencies - USD and DEM - oscillating only to
the extent that the exchange rate between these two currencies
oscillates. The exchange rate of about 29 Kc to l USD has been
maintained since l990. The fixed exchange rate of the crown in
relation to other freely convertible currencies has become the
main anchor of the Czech economy.

</ul>
<P>
The slow-down of direct investments in l993 was brought on by
investors who waited to see what consequences the split with Slovakia
would have on the political and economic stability of the Czech
Republic. Also, following the conclusion of the first wave of
privatization, investors were waiting to learn what interesting
projects were planned for the second wave. These conditions, however,
have not changed the character of the current economic climate
as one which is favorable for foreign investment. Major foreign
consulting firms evaluate the Czech Republic as a reliable country
where any risks attached to investment are becoming less significant.

<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr10.jpg>Direct foreign investment in the CR (Territorial structure)</a>
<H4><A NAME="e6"></A>BANKING SYSTEM OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC </H4>

<P>
The banking system can be divided into three groups. The large
banks, which emerged before l990 and which offer a complete assortment
of banking services and command a wide network of branches. These
include the Ceska sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank), the
Investicni a postovni banka (Investment and
Postal Bank), the Komercni banka (Commercial Bank), the
Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka (Czechoslovak Commercial
Bank) and Zivnostenska Bank.
<P>
The second group is composed of smaller Czech banks with a relatively
minor share of foreign capital. They offer certain specialized
services, the majority of which are oriented toward the private
sector.
<P>
The third group is comprised of foreign banks which help complement
the necessary competitive environment in the banking sector.
<P>
The structure of the banking system as of June 31, 1994:
<P>
- 24 commercial banks, joint stock companies without foreign ownership
<P>
- 12 commercial banks, joint stock companies with partial foreign
ownership
<P>
- lO commercial banks, joint stock companies with lOO% foreign
ownership
<P>
- lO branches of foreign banks
<P>
- l state monetary institute (Konsolidacni banka)
<P>
- There are also 41 representatives of foreign banks in the Czech
Republic.
<P>
A new amendment to the banking law provides for state insurance
of deposits in the country, which brings the Czech Republic's
laws in this area closer into line with European norms.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr11.jpg>Interest rates on new credits graph...</a>
<H4><A NAME="e7"></A>CAPITAL MARKET</H4>

<P>
The capital market emerged in 1993. Crucial practical steps were
taken for the development of stocks and shares in the Czech Republic
during this year. These processes led to the creation of the Stock
Exchange of Securities Praha, and the stock trading agency known
as RM-System.
<P>
Stock and shares are traded on the Stock Exchange. Currently the
exchange has 52 members who are entitled to trade. Other interested
parties have access to the market only through the mediation of
these members.
<P>
In the framework of the automatic electronic securities market,
the RM-System is used mainly by minor investors who acquired their
shares through coupon privatization and who have difficulty gaining
access to the Stock Exchange. On the whole, trading is done within
the framework of RM-S with approximately l,l00 securities.
<P>
<a href="/infosrc/ff/gr12.jpg>Stock exchange index</a>
<H3><A NAME="e8"></A>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC
</H3>
<HR>

<P>
The favourable geographical position of the Czech Republic, its
highly qualified labor force, and the excellent reputation of
Czechoslovak products from the pre-war period began attracting
the interest of foreign investors as early as November l989. Phillip
Morris, Coca Cola, Procter and Gamble, Volkswagen, AVX/Kyocera
are among the many multinational corporations to have opened production
plants in the Czech Republic.
<P>
Among other factors, the Czech Republic is attractive to foreign
investors for the following reasons:
<UL>
<LI><B>liberal economic policy of the government </B>
<LI><B>political stability </B>
<LI><B>highly qualified labour force </B>
<LI><B>wage controls, which enable the maintenance of low production
costs </B>
<LI><B>an exchange-rate of the crown favourable for export </B>
</UL>

<P>
In recent years, legislation guaranteeing the security of foreign
investors has been strengthened, and these investors are now considered
fully equal to native entrepreneurs. There are no restrictions
on the amount of foreign investment in the Czech Republic.
<P>
No formal approval is needed for foreign investments except in
the case of investment in the privatization scheme, banking, or
the arms industry.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="e9">TAXES</A></H4>

<P>
From January 1, l993, a new tax system, which is based on the
principles implemented in the tax systems of EC countries, is
valid in the Czech Republic.
<P>
The most important aspects of the tax system are: a value added
tax (VAT); a consumer tax; an import tax; a tax on incomes of
physical and legal entities; a road tax; a real property tax;

<H5><A NAME="f2"></A>Weekly Papers and Monthly Periodicals </H5>

<UL>
<LI>Just as with daily papers, the successors of magazines which
existed before 1989 are among the nation s favorite periodicals.
However, several new magazines founded after 1990 are also popular.
Here, too, foreign capital has brought many changes - notably
an improvement in the quality of the print and graphic lay-out.
At the same time the content of new magazines have started to
approach international standards.
<LI>The most widely read periodicals are general interest weeklies
such as Reflex , Mlady svet and Kvety. In addition, a wide
array of new titles have emerged to fill the demands of special
niche markets ranging from magazines that cater to women to publications
that focus on sports.
<LI>Three English weeklies are published in Prague:
</UL>

<P>
<B>THE PRAGUE POST,</B>

<H5><A NAME="f3">Radio and Television</A></H5>

<P>
The Czech Republic has a <B>dual state and private broadcasting
system</B>.
<UL>
<LI>At this time the only operators recognized by law are the
publicly owned institutions Czech Radio and Czech Television.
They have an arms-length relationship with the government and
finance their own actvities. These institutions have a specific
mission with regard to upholding public interest and they are
limited in developing their own business, particularly as regards
advertisement broadcasting.
<LI>The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting of the Czech
Republic adminsters licensing policy. The council is elected by
parliament and is not dependent on the government.
<LI>At present, over 5O licences for radio broadcasting have been
granted.
<LI>The largest licensed radio stations operating in the Czech
Republic include: Radio ALFA, Radio FREKVENCE 1,Radio EVROPA 2,
BBC WORLD SERVICE, and RADIO FREE EUROPE.
<LI><B>NOVA was the first private television station in all of
the former Eastern bloc </B>to receive a broadcasting license.
It went on air Feb. 4, 1994 and within six months secured half
the viewing audience in the Czech Republic, according to television
ratings.
</UL>

<H5><A NAME="f4">Advertising</A></H5>

<P>
l Since 1989, advertising expenditures have increased dramatically
- from almost five million dollars in 1989 to more than 212 million
dollars in 1993. It is estimated that in 1994 total expenditures
on advertising will increase to 250 million dollars.

<LI>Telecommunications in the Czech Republic have not yet reached
the standards of developed countries. On the other hand, huge
customer demand and ambitious plans for the future make this one
of the most promising areas for development and investment.
<LI>Although from 1980 to 1993 the number of main telephone lines
in Czechoslovakia shot up from 1,616,000 to 2,334,000, (i.e. from
10.6 lines per 100 inhabitants to 14.9 lines), there are still
more than 500,000 applications pending. On average, applicants
for a new telephone line have to wait 2.6 years. Although foreign
capital is involved in current planning, the demand for new telephone
lines is not likely to be met until the year 2000, at an expense
of more than 4 billion USD.
<LI>The former telephone network is quickly being enlarged by
a network of cellular telephones covering most populated parts
of the country.

<H5><A NAME="g1"></A>FINE ARTS</H5>

<UL>
<LI>The Czech Republic ranks among the most attractive tourist
destinations in all of Europe thanks to numerous artictic monuments
which display a rich variety of artistic styles combined with
high preservation standards.
<LI>After the fall of the Great Moravian Empire (905), which was
artistically influenced by Byzantium, Czech art developed within
the scope of West European artistic styles, though these styles
were often adapted in unique ways.
<LI>Czech Gothic painting in particular developed its own distincive
style (<I>anonymous Master of the Vyssi Brod
Altar, Master Theodoricus etc.</I>).
<LI>Also outstanding is the work of architect Petr Parler, especially
the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle and the decoration
of the Old Town Bridge Tower of the famous Charles Bridge.
<LI>The late Gothic Vladislav Hall at Prague Castle, a work by
<I>Benedikt Reid</I>, is one of the most marvellous secular halls
of late Gothic style in the world.
<LI>During the Renaissance and the Manneristic Period numerous
foreigners, mainly Italians, worked in Bohemia. The Emperor Rudolf
II (who reigned between 1576 and 1611), an ardent collector and
patron of the arts, brought many outstanding works by European
artists to Bohemia which today form the basis of various contemporary
collections.
<LI>The appearance of the Czech landscape was considerably enriched
by Baroque architecture (especially by the buildings of <I>Christopher
and Kilian Ignaz Diezenhoffer and Giovanni Santini</I>)
<LI>In addition, Czech Baroque painting (<I>Petr Brandl, Jan Kupecky
</I>etc.) as well as sculpture (<I>Ferdinand Maximilian Brokoff,
Matthias Bernhard Braun</I>) reached a high standard.
<LI>At the beginning of 20th century Czech Art Nouveau was among
the world's finest (mainly in architecture and applied arts);
the painter <I>Alfons Mucha </I>in particular made the style famous
abroad.
<LI>Cubistic architecture is completely unique in Prague and functionalist
buildings are also of great artistic value. A number of remarkable
Czech artists of the 20th century lived and worked at least partly
abroad, for example the painters <I>Frantisek Kupka, Emil
Filla, Toyen and Josef Sima</I>.
<LI>Even contemporary Czech art, in spite of the difficulties
in the communist era, retains a high standard (<I>Jan Zrzavy,
Mikulas Medek, Jiri Tichy, Jiri
Kolar</I>).
<LI>The birth of photography as an original art form is connected
with names such as <I>Frantisek Drtikol, Jaromir Funke,
Jaroslav Rossler and Josef Sudek</I>.
</UL>

<H5><A NAME="g2"></A>MUSIC</H5>

<P>
The Czech music scene came alive in the 19th century as national
awareness began to increase, fostering composers the two great
composers <I>Antonin Dvorak </I>and <I>Bedrich Smetana
</I>whose work is played all over the world to this day. In the
early part of this century the Czech composer <I>Leos Janacek
</I>wrote strikingly original music that has achieved increasing
popularity around the world in recent years.
<UL>
<LI>The roots of Czech musical history are lodged in the distant
9th century. Over the course of the 11th century Gregorian chants
predominated. They were complimented by traditional Czech sacred
songs such as Saint Wenceslas.
<LI>Between 1583 and 1612 during the reign of Rudolf II, the Habsburg
Imperial Orchestra - among the biggest ensembles in Europe - had
its seat at Prague Castle. The Czech composer <I>J.D. Zelenka</I>,
a contemporary of Bach's, was hailed as one of the leading composers
of his age.
<LI>The arrival of the musical classicism period at the end of
the 18th century saw the establishment of several new municipal
opera houses in the country including the famed F.A. Nostitz theatre
(later renamed the Stavovske theatre). It was here that
some of Mozart's most famous operas had their opening nights.
<LI>A distinctive trait of the period was the emigration of Czech
musicians fleeing low standards of living and religious oppression
in their homeland. Czech musicians remained popular abroad though
(<I>J. V. Stamitz </I>worked at Mannheim, the <I>Benda </I>family
in Berlin and Gotha, <I>J. Myslivecek </I>in Italy, <I>A. Rejcha
</I>in Paris).
<LI>The establishment of a new period of Czech music is connected
with <I>B. Smetana </I>(1824-1884), <I>A. Dvorak </I>(1841-1904)
and <I>Z. Fibich </I>(1850-1900). In the period 1890-1930 the
leading personalities were <I>L. Janacek, J. B. Foerster,
O. Ostrcil, V. Novak and J. Suk</I>, and later <I>J. B.
Martinu</I>.
<LI>In the second half of the 20th century <I>M. Kabelar
</I>and <I>P. Eben </I>achieved a worldwide reputation.
<LI>The foundation of the Czech Philharmonic was of decisive importance
for musical life. They performed for the first time in 1896 (among
the conductors were <I>V. Talich, R. Kubelik, K. Ancerl,
and V. Neumann</I>).
<LI>Czech concert art was made famous above all by several internationally
acclaimed violinists, pianists, chamber ensembles and singers.
Among them are the violinist <I>F.Ondricek</I>, singers
<I>F. Burian </I>and <I>J. Novotna</I>, and the pianist
<I>R. Firkusny </I>chamber. In addition to the Czech
Philharmonic, the Symphonic Orchestra of the City of Prague FOK
is also well known.
<LI>The highlight of Czech concert life is the annual musical
festival <I>Prague Spring</I>, featuring performers from around
the world.
<LI>Despite political repression, jazz and rockn roll music
started to develop at the end of the 1950s, mainly in clubs and
alternative theatres. These were hot-beds of creativity from which
many world-famous names arose, such as <I>J. Stivin and
R. Dasek</I>. Many of them, such as <I>J. Mraz, J.
Hammer and A. Vitous </I>established themselves as international
stars living abroad.
</UL>

<H5><A NAME="g3"></A>LITERATURE</H5>

<P>
After centuries of development, Czech literature began to attract
international attention over the course of this century. Recently,
the names of several Czech writers have joined the ranks of the
world's literary luminaries and their work has been translated
into dozens of languages.
<P>
Perhaps one of the most famous of Prague's literati was the German-Jewish
writer <I>Franz Kafka</I>. In a series of unique novels and short
stories Kafka mapped out the state of modern society. The dilemmas
his characters found themselves in came to symbolize the absurdities
of modern life, which people now describe as Kafkaesque.
<P>
Kafka's works are echoed in the internationally renowned novels
of <I>Milan Kundera </I>which delve into the problematics of personal
identity in today's world.
<UL>
<LI>Many great writers emerged out of the period between the two
world wars. Among them, perhaps the most famous was <I>Karel Capek
</I>a humanist who wrote a number of anti-military works. In one
of them he invented the word Robot' which became an international
word (R.U.R.- Rossum's Universal Robots). He also founded the
crucial Czech literary organization PEN Club.
<LI>Other Czech writers, such as <I>V. Nezval, K. Biebl, K. Teige,
J. Seifert </I>were on the cutting edge of the avant-garde of
poetism and surrealism. In 1984 Seifert became the first Czech
writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.
<LI>Up to the end of World War II the Czech lands were also home
to several German and Jewish writers living in Prague: <I>Rainer
Maria Rilke, Franz Werfel and Max Brod.</I> 
<LI>After 1948, literature was materially and intellectually impoverished
by the imposition of a centralized state ideology. Not until the
1960s as the communist regime eased did a new literary generation
arise and efforts to renew contacts with Europe were revived.
<LI>However, the short period of artistic freedom ended in August
1968 with the invasion of the armies of the Warsaw Pact. The majority
of the most important authors of the generation continued their
work abroad; or their samizdat works circulated during the following
two decades only in typed copies. Among these were the internationally
renowned authors:
<LI>The emigre prose writers Milan Kundera, Arnost
Lustig, Egon Hostovsky and Josef Skvorecky,
and those who stayed home, Ludvik Vaculik, Ladislav
Fuks, Bohumil Hrabal and Ivan Klima.
</UL>

<H5><A NAME="g4"></A>THEATER</H5>

<UL>
<LI>The theatre has played a crucial role in the history of the
Czech nation. So much more fitting that today, <I>Vaclav
Havel</I>, the country's most famous dissident playwright is also
the president of the republic. Among his most famous absurdist
plays, which have been translated and performed all over the world,
are Temptation, Memorandum and The Garden Party.
<LI>Havel, along with fellow playwrights like <I>Josef Topol</I>,
were tapping into a long theatrical tradition that began in the
12th century.
<LI>In 1862 the first permanent Czech theater Prozatimni
divadlo (The Provisional Theater) was opened. The National Theater
has stood as a strong symbol of national independence since it
opened in 1881, thanks to public donations and collections. The
first performance at the theatre was Smetana's Libuse, an
opera based on the legendary founding of the city of Prague. Although
it burned down afterwards it re-opened in 1883.
<LI>Between 1927 and 1938 the Osvobozene divadlo (The Liberated
Theater) served as a breeding ground for a new genre of satiric
political commentary developed by the authors and actors <I>J.
Voskovec and J. Werich.</I> 
<LI>After World War II regional theaters began to open. At the
end of the 1950s theater life was revived with the creation of
several small theaters: Divadlo Na Zabradli - Theater
on the Balustrade, Semafor Theater, Divadlo za Branou - Theater
Beyond the Gate (at present Divadlo za Branou II), and Cinoherni
klub.
<LI>Czech stage design (<I>F. Troster, F. Muzika, J. Capek,
J. Svoboda </I>- the founder of Laterna Magica) enjoyed great
success abroad as did ballet (<I>P. Smok</I>), mime (<I>L.
Fialka, B. Hybner, B. Polivka</I>) and puppet theater (Spejbl
a Hurvinek Theatre, Vychodoceske loutkove
divadlo DRAK - East Bohemian Puppet Theater DRAK in Hradec Kralove).
</UL>

<H5><A NAME="g5">F</A>ILM</H5>

<P>
Czech filmmaking leaped into the international spotlight over
the past couple of decades thanks to the work of directors <I>Milos
Forman and Jiri Menzel</I>, whose films are played in moviehouses
all over the world. Forman won Oscar awards for his films One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus and Menzel secured one
for Ostre sledovane vlaky/Closely Watched Trains.
<UL>
<LI>Film history in the Czech Republic goes back to 1898 when
the first ones were produced by <I>J. Krizenecky</I>.
The film era began to really take off in the country when permanent
movie theatres started operating in 1907 and with the arrival
of permanent film distributors in 1909.
<LI>In the 1930s Czech writers and cinematographers began making
headway in the production of exceptional artistic films, documentaries
and the first sound newsreels.
<LI>In 1945 Czechoslovak cinematography was nationalized. However
its growth was slowed down after February 1948 when communist
leaders started to interfere in film production and pushed the
production of propaganda films.At that time puppet films by <I>J.
Trnka </I>and cartoons and feature films by <I>K. Zeman and J.
Svankmajer </I>achieved world wide fame.
<LI>In the 1960s productions by young artists formed the so-called
Czech New Wave. Both Forman and Menzel were a part of this wave
along with <I>J. Jires, V. Chytilova, J. Nemec, E.
Schorm and F. Vlacil</I>. After the Soviet-led invasion
in 1968 a series of films were locked away and prohibited. Among
them J. Kadars and E. Kloss Obchod na
korze /The Shop on the Main Street/, which was awarded an Oscar
in 1966, and J. Menzels Ostre sledovane vlaky /Closely
Watched Trains/, which received the same award the following year.
<LI>The most important modern film festivals which take place
in the Czech Republic are the International Film Festival in Karlovy
Vary and the Childrens Film Festival in Zlin.
<LI>Every year the Czech Republic produces approximately 30 feature
films and 1,200 documentaries and cartoons.
<LI>Recently, the state film industry went through economic transformation
and privatization. A network of private film companies and distributors
is now operating in the country.

The most popular sports in the Czech Republic are <B>football
</B>(<B>soccer</B>)<B>, ice hockey, volley-ball, tennis and kickball
</B>(an original Czech sport similar to volley-ball in which the
players kick the ball over a low net.)
<UL>
<LI>The most famous Czech sports grouping is the mass partcipation
<B>Sokol organization</B>. Although the main goal of Sokol is
to promote national health and sports, it played a key role in
the national resistance to the Austrian Empire, the Nazi occupation
and the Communist regime. Soon after it was founded in 1862, colorful
gymnastics rallies were held regularly in Prague until the German
occupation in 1938. The Communist regime banned the organization
after its 1948 rally, but Sokol continued to exist abroad. In
July 1994, Sokol staged a triumphant return with a rally in Prague.

<HR>

<P>
Thanks to its long and rich history and the diversity of its natural
environment, the Czech Republic is a great attraction for the
millions of guests who visit it every year. <B>The jewel in the
Czech crown is Prague with its gorgeous and rich architectural
styles but the country is also dotted with numerous historical
city centres, castles and chateaux. </B>Outside the urban areas,
deep woods, rock formations and limestone caves are among the
many interesting sites the Czech Republic has to offer.
<H5>Historical Sites</H5>

<P>
Since the Czech lands lie exactly on the border of Eastern and
Western Europe, the country has come under the influence of several
different cultures throughout the course of history. Each of these
influences indelibly marked the face of the country with architectural
or artistic monuments. This accounts for the <B>uniquely rich
cultural heritage of this relatively small country</B>. In addition,
the Czech lands are extraordinary in Europe due to the fact that
they are practically untouched by the large-scale destruction
of war.
<H4><A NAME="i1"></A>CITIES</H4>

<H4>Prague </H4>

<P>
The attractiveness of Prague lies in the breadth and diversity
of its offerings. The ordinary tourist is fascinated and forever
captivated by the unique atmosphere of the city, which has been
called the <B>&quot;heart of Europe&quot; </B>for ages. Among
the most fascinating places are the &quot;genius loci&quot; of
the inner historical parts of Prague - Hradcany (the Prague Castle),
the Lesser Town (Mala Strana) and the Old Town (Stare Mesto).
These areas, which virtually amount to small unique cities within
the larger city have their own particular features. Hradcany,
the large-scale, historically rich complex, has been the residence
and symbol of Czech statehood for centuries. The grandiose Gothic
St. Vitus Cathedral, dominates the Lesser Town roofs and offers
a beautiful view of dozens of Old Town towers. Charles Bridge,
the oldest stone bridge in Central Europe, connects the two historic
sites of the city. Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and especially
in the Old Town - Art Nouveau, cubism and modern styles from the
beginning of the century from a unique aesthetic unit.
<P>
There is only room here to describe a handful of examples from
the more than forty historically valuable cities in the country.
<H5>Kutna Hora </H5>

<P>
This town competed in richness and architectural beauty with Prague
during the Middle Ages when silver was mined here.
<H4>Cesky Krumlov </H4>

<P>
This beatiful city is dominated by its castle, which is located
at the top of a sheer granite cliff. The castle is almost comparable
in size with the one in Prague and the entire city has been included
on the UNESCO list of protected cities.
<H5>Telc </H5>

<P>
A Renaissance chateau and Renaissance and Baroque houses constitute
this city of European importance.
<H5>Olomouc </H5>

<P>
This city contains the second most important collection of historical
monuments in the Czech Republic (after Prague). Some of the oldest
parts of the city were built by the Premyslid dynasty in the 11th
century.
<H5><A NAME="i2"></A>CASTLES AND CHATEAUX</H5>

<P>
Kings and influential nobility built dozens of castles in order
to protect their lands, important trade routes, and regional frontiers.
Over time many of them fell into ruin, while others were rebuilt
as chateaux or used for business purposes. Nevertheless, many
castles still dominate the Czech landscape today.
<P>
The biggest or the most important of these are the architecturally
beautiful <B>Zvikov </B>castle known as &quot;the king
of Czech castles,&quot; the 15th century Gothic castle <B>Krivoklat</B>,
<B>Karlstejn </B>built by Charles IV to protect the coronation
jewels, and the Gothic castle <B>Bouzov </B>which looks like something
out of a fairy tale.
<P>
During the l6th century the nobility started to leave the uncomfortable
castles and to build new, more comfortable residences. Among them
are the Romantic <B>Konopiste </B>chateau which houses a
large collection of hunting trophies, the Baroque <B>Kuks </B>chateau
which houses a unique collection of statues by M.B. Braun illustrating
the Virtues and Vices, the Romantic chateau <B>Lednice </B>containing
the highest minaret outside Islamic countries and the most romantic
chateau in the country, the <B>Cervena Lhota </B>which
is built on a rock in the middle of a lake.
<H5>SACRAL MONUMENTS</H5>

<P>
The Czech Republic is also home to hundreds of churches, cathedrals
and monasteries of all types, including Benectine, Cisterian and
Pemonstratensian monasteries.
<H5>FOLK ARCHITECTURE AND TRADITIONS</H5>

<P>
Many monuments of folk architecture have been preserved in the
Czech Republic - dwellings of stone and brick (more than 5,000
of them). In addition, technical monuments have been preserved
- smithy forges, mills and so on. Other attractions include uniquely
preserved open-air folk museums in Moravia, picturesque, traditional
villages in Southern Bohemia preserved in their original appearance
and colorful folk festivals.
<P>
The custom of wearing local folk costumes has survived in Moravia
as well as in the Chodsko and Blata regions of Bohemia.
<H5>Spas</H5>

<P>
The Czech Republic is an outstanding world leader with regard
to spas. In addition to the world-famous Karlovy Vary, Marianske
Lazne and Frantiskovy Lazne, the Czech Republic
offers treatment at 50 additional spas. Many famous figures from
European cultural history enjoyed relaxing at Czech spas, among
them Goethe, Schiller and Janacek.
<H5><A NAME="i3"></A>Natural Heritage</H5>

<P>
The countryside is covered with hundreds of protected scenic regions
and natural preserves. They are accessible through a network of
hiking trails that allow visitors to wander through breathtaking
pieces of natural beauty. Tourist maps carry detailed depictions
of the trails.
<P>
<B>Krkonose (Giant Mountains)</B> 
<P>
The highest and most frequently visited mountains of the Czech
lands are the Krkonose. They offer terrain for summer Alpine
tourism as well as for cross-country and downhill skiing in the
winter. The highest peak is Mt. Snezka measuring 1,602 metres.
<P>
<B>Sumava (Bohemian Forest)</B> 
<P>
The picturesque beauty of the Sumava with its elongated slopes
and deep forests has attracted nature lovers for generations.
Its jewels are five glacial lakes, three of which are in the territory
of the Czech Republic: Cerne (46 acres and 130 ft deep),
Certovo and Plesne.
<P>
The nature preserve of the Boubin Primeval Forest is one
of the most valuable examples of virgin nature in Central Europe.
In addition to giant trees which are several centuries old, the
preserve features bizarre tangles of overhead roots.
<P>
<B>Southern Bohemia</B> 
<P>
This is the least industrialized part of the Czech lands. A characteristic
feature of South Bohemia is its large amount of lakes, moors,
meadows and mixed woods. It offers countless possibilities for
recreation near water and many historical monuments.
<P>
<B>Cesky Raj (Bohemian Paradise)</B> 
<P>
Here are vast granite rock cities, deep-cut valleys and river
canyons, which are located near Turnov, Jicin and
Mnichovo Hradiste.
<P>
<B>Moravsky kras (Moravian Karst)</B> 
<P>
This rather small limestone territory northeast of Brno contains
dozens of kilometres of caves with rich stalactite decoration.
An extraordinary experience awaits tourists who take a boat ride
on the underground river Punkva. The famous Macocha Abyss came
into existence after the collapse of several cave floors. It is
138,4 metres deep, and at the upper part 174 metres long and 76
metres wide.
<H4>Sport Tourism</H4>

<P>
<B>Skiing</B> 
<P>
Particularly outstanding terrain and slopes for downhill and cross-country
skiing are located in the Krkonose ski areas (Pec pod Snezkou,
Spindleruv Mlyn, Harachov), and in the Sumava,
the Jizera, the Jeseniky, and the Krusne (Ore)
Mountains.
<P>
<B>Mountain Climbing</B> 
<P>
Unique granite rocks offering varying degrees of scaling difficulty
( more than l,000 separate rocky towers) are situated in the Cesky
raj, near Decin, and near Adrspach at Broumov.
<P>
<B>Golf</B> 
<P>
- Despite 4O years of communist government, golf associations
in Prague and Marienbad are still operating.
<P>
- The largest new golf course is under construction near Karlstejn
castle, approximately 13 mi from Prague\
<P>
<B>Horseback riding </B>in the countryside is offered by many
riding schools.
<P>
Long <B>boat rides </B>on the Vltava, Luznice or Sazava
rivers offer unusual views of the Czech landscape.
<P>
Ideal conditions for <B>sailing and windsurfing </B>exist on the
Lipenska and Orlicka Dams in Southern Bohemia or
on the Vranovska Dam (Southern Moravia)

The Czech Republic is located in the Central European Time zone.
In line with neighbouring countries it uses the so-called summer
time from the last Sunday in March until the last Saturday in
September ( summer time means a 1 hour shift of time ahead from
normal Central European Time).
<H5><A NAME="i11"></A>Food in the Czech Republic</H5>

<P>
The Czech cuisine is rich in meat, most usually served with dumplings
or potatoes. Among the most common meals are various kinds of
goulash, beef with special cream sauce ( svickova
) or other sauces with various flavors (dill, tomato, etc.) The
real Czech specialty, dumplings filled with fruit, are not often
included on the menus of most restaurants. In the centers of big
cities, even the lower grade restaurants serve select meals from
international cuisine including fish and poultry meals. Venison
is popular, too.
<P>
Czech beer is one of the best in the world (Pilsen, Budvar and
Velkopopovicke beer are among the finest). Excellent wine
is produced in South Moravia and the Bohemian regions around Zernoseky
and Roudnice. A rather unique drink is the Czech herb liquer,
Becherovka. In central Moravia, in the area around Vizovice, plum
brandy (slivovice) is very popular. It contains up to 90% alcohol.

<H5><B>POLITICAL BACKGROUND</B></H5>
<HR>

<P>
The Czech Republic, population 10.32 million, is ruled by Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus and the 200-member Czech Parliament.
The parliament is currently a unicameral body dominated by a coalition
of ODS, KDU-CSL, ODA, KDS. According to the Czech Constitution,
the parliament should be bicameral body with a House of Representatives
and a Senate, but as yet the legislators have not decided how
to form the Senate. They are debating whether to hold early elections
or wait until the next regular election in June 1996.
<P>
Former Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel is now President
of the Czech Republic. While executive powers are largely divided
between Klaus and Parliament, Havel does have the power to veto
legislation. But his powers are limited. For example, Havel can
only ratify, not negotiate, foreign treaties; he can not directly
consult the ministries on domestic matters, but must work through
the prime minister.
<P>
Slovakia, population 5.26 million, is ruled by Prime Minister
Jozef Moravcik and the 150-member Slovak Parliament.====, has
27 members in Parliament - most political commentators predict
that HZDS's popularity will decline. In March, former Slovak foreign
minister and vice chairman of HZDS, Milan Knazko, broke ranks
and formed an independent club with seven other deputies. In a
February poll by the Bratislava Statistics Office, the party's
popularity dropped to 18 percent, down from 37 percent in the
June, 1992 elections.
<P>
Michal Kovac, former Federal Finance Minister and Federal
Parliament Chairman, Michal Kovac, is the current Slovak
president. He is empowered to ratify international agreements,
convene the Slovak National Council, appoint ministers and return
constitutional laws to the National Council.

<H2>RESTAURANTS IN PRAGUE</H2><HR>

<P>
This is a selection of restaurants that we think have something
extraordinary, good, and different to offer diners than the run-of-mill
food in town. We appreciate any suggestions you may have about
restaurants that we should include in Resources. In the summer,
it is advisable to make reservations a few days in advance. Unless
specified, the restaurant does not take credit cards. 
<P>
Credit Card Codes:
<P>
<I>A= American Express, V = Visa,  MC = Eurocard/Mastercard, DC
= Diner's Club </I>

<P>
<I>Outdoor patio</I> This is four restaurants in one, each sharing
the same basic kitchen. In   the summer, it is best to go upstairs
to the Teresa restaurant outside, which serves decent grilled
dishes. In the winter, visit the Galerie, Le Souffle whose menu
includes pastas, chicken, and small salads.

Andy's is adorned with cartoons and bright abstract paintings
that liven up an already lively young Czech crowd. Most people
come for the spareribs, but make sure to bring your own sauce
because they have not mastered the art of fine barbeque sauce
yet. The spaghetti is also surprisingly good. 
<P>

<I>Belgian, French</I><B> </B>When you walk into Esprit, you walk
out of Prague, at least for a few minutes. The muted colors, soft
lighting and simple furniture set the tone for a long, relaxing
meal. The food is fresh, creative light french cuisine that is
beautifully presented.
<P>

<P>
<B> </B>Avalon  is  a taste  of  California  in  Prague. Its 
spacious  rooms,
<P>
colorwashed walls and placemats that double as menus have all
the makings of a West  Coast restaurant. They serve a wonderful
breakfast, featuring buckwheat pancakes and eggs benefit. Later
in the day, choose from creative pasta, salads, and sandwiches.

but once inside, you will be treated to some of the best Italian
pasta in the city. Everything from the basic tomato-basil  spaghetti
to the mushroom cream and tomato penne is very good. Try the antipasto
salad bar.

fare. The cozy wooden cafe serves good coffee and a broad selection
of healthy drinks, including fresh squeezed orange juice. One
small table in the back courtyard.

Tex-Mex joint - Wild    West posters on the wall, waiters in Texas
ties, a punchy menu - but if you want hot, spicey dishes, you
must ask the waiter to spice it up. Their fajitas and taco salads
are especially good.

finer restaurants in Prague. They fly in fresh fish from Italy,
and offer a few dishes that are hard to find elsewhere in Prague.

may have trouble finding a place to sit down. The pub is divided

Czech fare but the beer is delicious home-brewed unfiltered beer.

<H2>What is Glimpse ?</H2>
<QUOTE>
<P>
Glimpse (which stands  for  GLobal  IMPicit  SEarch)  is  an
indexing  and query system that allows you to search through
all your files very quickly.   For  example,  a  search  for
Schwarzkopf  allowing  two  misspelling errors in 5600 files
occupying 77MB took 7 seconds on a SUN  IPC.   Glimpse  supports
most of agrep's options (agrep is our powerful version
of  grep)  including  approximate  matching  (e.g.,  finding
misspelled  words),  Boolean  queries, and even some limited
forms of regular expressions.<BR>
Glimpse's running time is typically slower than systems
tems using inverted indexes, but its index is  an  order  of
magnitude smaller (typically 2-5% of the size of the files).

    Implications of  Czech membership In the UN Security Council<br><br>

   The former Czechoslovakia submitted its candidature as early as 1984 and
proceeded to confirm it annually. In 1992, it was decided to initiate a campaign for
the election of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. Notes announcing that the
Czech Republic, by agreement with the Slovak Republic, assumed the candidature
were dispatched already before the dissolution of ths federation in December 1992.
Within the East European regional group, another candidate for the seat of
non-permanent member of the Security Council for the years 1994-1995 was
Belarus. At the 48th session of the UN General Assembly in autumn 1993, the
Czech Republic acquired the two-third majority of votes necessary for election.<br><br>

   The UN Security Council is the only international organ authorized to adopt
decisions legally binding for other members of the international community. To
become a member of the Security Council means to undertake a share of
responsibility for the international development, including the participation in the
diplomatic settlement of conflicts. Consequently, our country has the opportunity to
participate through its delegation in the political settlement of the issues on the
agenda and to promote our national interests. The Czech Republic presents itself as
a democratic state promoting human rights and other basic standards of
international coexistence.<br><br>



      History of Czech membership In the UN Security Council<br><br>
                (January-June 1994)<br><br>

   In January 1994, the presidency fell on the Czech Republic. The Czech
representative in the UN, Mr. Karel Kovanda, became President of the Security
Council.
<br><br>
   In January-June 1994, the Security Council held 67 formal sessions, adopted
38 resolutions and 29 presidential statements. Nevertheless, the focus was on
closed informal consultations which were convened almost a hundred times. The
Security Council documents were considered and discussed above all during such
informal consultations.<br><br>

   The Czech delegation takes an active part in the discussion of almost all
issues. It participated in the preparation and "fine-tuning" of a number of resolutions.
The remarkable activity of Ambassador Kovanda at the Security Council sessions
has aroused exceptional interest  from other delegations to the UN as well as of the
mass media. In the course of the first six months, the Czech delegation took the
floor almost twenty times. Especially our positions on Bosnia, Georgia and, during
the last month, Rwanda, have been followed closely.<br><br>



    Apart from the formal sessions and informal consultations, the Security
Council members attend also other forums, not so visible but nevertheless very
demanding from the point of view of time and agenda. The most important ones are
the so-called Sanction Committees, established on the basis of binding Security
Council resolutions to monitor sanctions imposed on a certain state and to grant
exceptions. Each Security Council member is also a member of all sanction
committees. The Committees are chaired by representatives of non-permanent
members and personel. Ambassador Kovanda chairs the Sanction Committee on
Libya. Other committees are in charge of Iraq, Somalia, former Yugoslavia, Rwanda
and Haiti. The Sanction Committee on the Republic of South Africa has already
been abolished.<br><br>



Participation of the Czech Republic In United Nations peace-keeping missions<br><br>

1) UNPROFOR: ACR military contingent in the territory of the former Yugoslavia
(Croatia, the territory of the so-called Republic of  Serbian Krajina), currently consists
of 989 members of the ACR:<br>
- a UNPROFOR battalion (924 persons),<br>
- a group of UNPROFO officers (15 persons, including the commander of
Sector-South, Brig.Gen. R. Kotil),<br>
- a group of military police (Sector-South, 8 ACR members, including the
commander of the military police in Zagreb),<br>
- a group of economic logistics tor Sector-South (6 ACR members),<br>
- stationary switching node (15 ACR members),<br>
- independent surgical ward (21 persons).<br><br>

2) UNGCI: (Iraq) 21 observers and 11 policemen.<br>

3) UNOMIL: (Liberia) 15 military observers.<br>

4) UNOMOZ: (Mozambique) 19 military observers.<br>

5) UNOMIQ: plan to send 5 military observers to Georgia.<br>

       Integratlon of the Czech Republlc In West European<br><br>

    political and security structures and the problems ot regional<br>
            cooperatlon - basis and practice</center>
<br><br>


   Senators and deputies, ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>

   Let me thank you for giving me the exceptional opportunity to speak to
you. This is the first time a Czech Foreign Minister has been allowed to address your
honourable assembly. It is an honour for me, but I feel the epxanded responsibility.<br><br

   I have arrived at the time of the fifth anniversary of the events which changed
Europe and thanks to which both our states could return to the traditional European
values of which they have been deprived for generations. For both states, it was the return to full sovereignty,  the asset which they have already lost
several times in their history and which they had to renew and defend. Therefore we
 once again have the possibility to independently create our foreign policy,
to freshly acknowledge the values on which our European or, to be more precise,
Euroatlantic civilization is based. We consider these values our only possible choice
and consequently we all seek to integrate into the community and structures which
exist on the basis of such values.<br><br>

   The values are without a doubt shared values. Nowadays the fact is perceived as
self-evident and consequently often happens that the differences in details and
individual practical steps may seemingly predominate as great and serious ones.
Such an impression is sometimes created by mass media which, in accordance with
the principles of their work, stress small differences rather than
great and principal agreements. Nevertheless, such a view must not prevail in our
political perception.<br><br

   The best solutions are always mutual contacts and exchanges of information resulting in trust and understanding of the differences. This also results in understanding of their historical as well as present roots. That is why I would like to thank you once again for the oppportunity to talk to you and to contribute to such understanding.<br><br>

    Today, I would like to talk about the roots of our foreign policy - not only of its
principal trends, but also of some details and individual steps. Above all, I would like
to talk about our opinions on the integration process in the European Union, and about
security issuss as well. Specifically I would also like to discuss how these opinions relate to the issue of  cooperation in the Central European region. In conclusion I will attempt to locate our bilateral relations within this framework.<br><br>



    Our foreign policy is similar to our domestic policy in that it is based on the ideas of
our reform. In the wider sense of the word, it embodies the ethos of the Czech
nation, the roots of which can be sought in history, especially during the period after
1848. During that period our country, as well as Poland, went through the period of
national revival and both nations reawoke in regards tolanguage, culture and
especially politics. To understand some of the differences in the perception of
particular political issues, it is worthwhile to, at least shortly, characterize the period.
The Czech nation, deprived of its political and aristocratic elite, grew from below,
from the plebeian class of burghers, farmers and tradesmen. Its first national
movement was unpolitical, it promoted above all education and national
consciousness. We were able to see the Polish example, which functioned as a catalyst of the development of Czech political thought. Nevertheless, Czech political thought
retained a considerable portion of pragmatism, realism, responsibility and perhaps
also cautiousness - features which can be seen in Czech policy of our time.<br><br>

    On the contrary, the Polish national revival sprang from the national
aristocratic elite, which preferred more dramatic methods such as conspiration and
uprising. The ethos of the Polish national revival, extensively recorded in the works
of great Polish romanticists, marked the modern Polish national consciousness. Its
traces could be observed not only in the tumultous years, such as the time of war,
but also in the method of protest against the Communist totalitarian rule of the past
years. Our more recent history was also different, regardless of whether we consider
the birth and orientation or our renewed states after 1918, the unhappy period of
strained relations immediately before and after the Second World War or the
manifestations of opposition against the Communist regime, which emerged in
different periods, which had different forms and different destiny. Nevertheless, such
manifestations illustrate a very important feature of our national existence - the
longing for freedom, the feature which both our nations share and which they have,
together with the wiil to survive, retained in spite of all the misfortunes and risks of
history.<br><br>

    At present, especially after 1993, when the Czech state entered a new
chapter of its history as an independent country. The policy building the state on civil
principle, on the responsibility of each citizen for himself, for his family, for his
community and for the state, exactly in this order, enjoys the support of the majority
of our population. Besides such values as freedom and democracy, we therefore
have an inborn feeling of responsibility for ourselves, which is conspicuously,
sometimes even manifestly present also in our foreign policy.<br><br>

    Our principal aim, for which we do not want to seek any alternatives and the
fulfillment of which we perceive as our irreplaceable role, is the full-fledged
membership in the European Union. The wider, primary basis of such decision is the
contemplation of the European space and the seemingly obvious statement: we,
and of course also you, are in Europe, even in its very centre. To continue to apply
this geopolitical concept only to the countries which have been lucky enough not to
be included in the Soviet bloc would be an ominous resumption of the approach



from the past. Less obvious and the more difficult is to say that Europe ends
somewhere and its would be foolish to pretend this is not so. I think that we have the
right to expect both conclusions from our partners.<br><br>

   We regard our memebrship in the Union as an entirely logical outcome of our
location, our history, our values as well as to the end of bipolarity, which we have
unquestionably helped to achieve. On the other hand, we are aware of the fact that
our merits and our knocking on the door of Brussels will not transform our country
into a developed state of the European type. This may be achieved only by our own
effort. We cannot be accepted among the developed states, we must become one of
them. Therefore any membership in the community of developed West European
states, such as the European Union, must be formally based upon acceptance, we
have never ceased to stress that the process of integration takes place above all at
home. This is also the reason for our hitherto sober approach to the concrete
symbols and rituals of the procedure of acceptance in Brussels, which, let me stress
this once more, does not imply that we flout them, it only testifies to our increased
concentration on the demanding domestic process.<br><br>

    However, we do not consider the form of the European Union an obvious fact
and thanks to the obligatory character of our intention we feel not only entitled, but-
also obliged to consider what the Union looks like and in which direction it develops.
We have been following the disscussion concerning the future form of the European
Union, the discussion which is of vital importance for us. Of course, we cannot be the
only  subject of  the discussion. The interest of our state, but also the feeling of
shared responsibility for the future fate of Europe makes us take an active part in it.
Our historical experiance enables us to introduce some issues which are relevant
and which, seen from another point of view, need not be so striking.<br><br>

    Another priority of our foreign policy is our full-fledged membership in the
NATO. This aim also complies with the logic of our development after November
1989. It also involves the question of our identity and the feeling that we share the
values which form the basis of Western Europe, as well as our readiness to
undertake a share of responsibility for the security and stability in our region and in
the whole world. We regard the increased importance of the security dimension to
the European Union as a positive feature, but, however, we do not see any
alternative to NATO. The transatlantic character of the Alliance was the key
factor of the changes in Europe which have brought freedom for so many, ourselves included. The active political and military presense of the United States in Europe is therefore for us one of the most important safeguards to security and stability in our part of the world. But again, when speaking about the security of our country, we realize that our own security must be ensured by ourselves. The Alliance may function as an
additional safeguard, but without the awareness of our own responsibility for the
security, we will not be safe and, moreover, we will have no value as an ally for any
alliance.<br><br>



    This is one of the resons why we have so sincerely welcomed the Partnership
for Peace project, which opened the space for our own military and political activity
in the name of the future alliance. I am glad that in the course of my stay in Poland I
will be able to visit for the first time the military exercises organized under the
Partnership for Peace project and see our soldiers participate in the exercises here
in Poland.<br><br>

    To change the subject, I will now talk about some issues of regional and
bilateral cooperation, which I would like to discuss in light of the considerations I
have already mentioned. For each state, regional cooperation, and especially
cooperation with neighbours, is one of the key tasks of foreign policy. For a small
state, such as the Czech Republic, and moreover a state located at an important
European crossroads, success in this field is of vital interest.<br><br>

    After the great changes in our region in 1989, our states
started to communicate freely and intensely. The grouping, later called the Visegrad
Group, successfully managed to dismantle the COMECON and the Warsaw Treaty.
It managed to attract the attention of global public to the danger arising from the
continuing existence of the Soviet Union. It was the time of great deeds, associated
with the dissolution of the Soviet empire.<br><br>

    The period of dismantling has started to give way to the period of
construction. I am glad that the Visegrad Group has been gradually transformed into
the Central European Free Trade Zone with the nice abbreviation CEFTA. Vis-a-vis
our principal tasks associated with the integration into the European Union, it would
be difficult for us to find a better new embodiment for it. For centuries we have
known that trade connects nations (often contrary to politics). We should bear it in
mind especially today, when we are seeking new forms of regional cooperation in
our complicated and dynamic times. Often I hear the objection that we should not
seek more intensive political integration instead of a commercial one. I know that the
great effort necessary for the removal of the barriers to trade and for the
establishment of the framework for intensive economic contacts may be daunting.
However, we should realize how lasting results as concerns cooperation and
friendship between states and nations this may bring about. Let us not be tempted
by the ease with which meaningless phrases about political cooperation are
pronounced (to be soon forgotten) at various summits. We have already heard so
many of them! We must not put up with this, because the easiest and most
impressive ways are seldom the best ways.<br><br>

    It is understood that cooperation in the field of economy and trade does not
exclude fruitful political cooperation. What I am trying to say is that the CEFTA
creates a natural basis for the formulation and articulation of our common interests,
which need not be purely eeonomic. Nevertheless, I must say that at the present
moment we cannot imagine any regional arrangement as an alternative to our
European and Atlantic choice. I do not think, chiefiy for the reasons I have
mentioned in the first part of my address, that such arrangement could serve as a
mediator ot our aceceptance to the structures.<br><br>

    My address to the Polish Parliament would not be complete without
mentioning bilateral Czech-Polish relations.<br><br>

    Also in the bilateral sphere, I give priority to economic cooperation. Its recent
decline can in most cases be attributed to the drop in the planned, dictated trade
exchange within the Eastern Bloc, nevertheless we cannot be satisfied with the
current situation. In many cases this implies abandoning the already established
relations, which could remain profitable in the future. I am glad that while I am here
talking to you, our Deputy Prime Ministers responsible for economic issues, Mr.
Kocarnik and Mr. Kolodko, meet to carry out a comprehensive survey of our
economic relations and to seek ways of their speedy intensification.<br><br>

    An increasingly important role in our bilateral relations will be played by the
cross-border cooperation, including the cooperation between regions, communities,
individual firms and civic associations. In this respect, we have made a concrete
step forward by signing the Agreement on cross-border cooperation. An
undisputable success and at the same time also a proof that "great" international
problems can be suitably interconnected with "small" concrete and mutually
profitable projects in border regions is the envisaged agreement on the payment of
instalments of Polish balance by means of ecologic investments.<br><br>

    I cannot omit another important aspect of our relations, which is the existence
of Polish minority, the most numerous minority group in the Czech Republic. Its fate
has been marked by all historical ups and downs undergone by our states in this
century. Under the Communist rule, its development was unnatural, deformed by
totalitarian social schemes. In accordance with the civil principle, the fundamental
principle of our state, we attribute the highest value to the Individual rights and
freedoms of a citizen as such. However, we realize that from the point of view of
members of a national minority, the possibility to develop their own national identity
is an integral part of their civil rights.<br><br>

    By way of conclusion, let me say once again what the basis of our foreign
policy is. Our aim is a friendly, mutually profitable and stabilizing cooperation with our
neighbours and gradual integration into West European structures. We want the
West to be prepared to accept such cooperation from us, but in the first place we
ask ourselves, what can we do to be prepared for it, to be trustworthy and attractive.

Mr. President,<br><br>

  Please accept my most sincere congratulations on your election to the office of
President of the 49th General Assembly. Let me also thank the outgoing President;
Ambassador Insanally displayed exceptional diplomatic skills in managing the
business of the General Assembly this past year. I wish to welcome the delegation
of South Africa which has joined us after an absence of many years. We have been
following developments in that country with particular attention and are delighted
with the remarkable progress it has chalked up. Restoring South Africa's full
membership further augments the universality of the UN; something we all favour.<br><br>

Mr. President,<br><br>

   The Czech Republic takes very seriously the responsibility it shares for the
maintenance of international peace and security. This is reflected, on the one hand,
in our participation in UN operations in the former Yugoslavia, Mozambique, Liberia
and Iraq, and, on the other hand, in our aspirations to become a member of Atlantic
and European security organizations, NATO and the Western European Union. This
is why we have also joined the Partnership for Peace: one of its priorities is the
coordination and cooperation of its participants for peace-keeping missions. The
Czech Republic also participates in humanitarian assistance to stricken countries as
best it can. We are fast approaching the time when we will be able to provide direct
economic development assistance as well.<br><br>

Mr. President,
<br><br>
  The active part the Czech Republic tries to play in the Security Council stems
from our belief that we were elected to serve. To serve not our particular interests,
but to serve certain fundamental principles, irrespective of where in the world they
may be imperiled.<br><br>

  The Security Council has in recent months dealt with several truly extraordinary
situations. Let me examine some of them.<br><br>

  As tor the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, reaching a political settlement is a key
objective of world diplomacy. UNPROFOR has been a critical element in managing
this problem, and my country is proud of having a mechanized batailion integrated in
this force.<br><br>

  Belgrade, in accepting the Contact Group plan, has taken a helpful step towards
an overall solution of the area's problems. We have also welcomed Belgrade's
closing of the border with Pale. In response, the Security Council reevaluated the
extent of sanctions imposed on Belgrade, hoping that its change of attitude turns out
to be serious and lasting. We will, nevertheless, be carefully examining reports of
international monitors on how strictly Belgrade keeps its international border with the
Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina sealed.<br><br>



   Mutual recognition of the states of the former Yugoslavia, within their
internationally recognized borders, is the next most important possible step, one
important for all countries of the region.<br><br>

Mr. President,<br><br>


  We are closely following the operations of the CIS forces, and its cooperation
with the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG).<br><br>

 The case of Georgia is viewed by some observers as paradigmatic: this was the
first time that a peace-keeping operation, UNOMIG, included forces of a power of
the region. It was also the first time the Security Council actually welcomed the use
of a force dominated by such a power, the CIS force, in solving a local conflict.
According to this view, UNOMIG-CIS cooperation in Georgia might perhaps serve as
a model for resolving certain other conflicts elsewhere in the CIS. The Czech
Republic, however, strongly believes that each peace-keeping operation is sui generis . Each conflict is different, and each operation therefore has to be evaluated
on its own merits.<br><br>

Mr President,<br><br>

 Your continent, Africa, has this year seen some of the greatest tragedies to befall
mankind since World War II. The scope and ferocity of the genocide in Rwanda is
hard to comprehend. It is outside the envelope of anything that can be considered a
"mere" civil war, and we are hard pressed to find any parallel to it. We welcome the
conciliatory attitude of the new Rwandan Government.<br><br>

  The US-led multinational force in Haiti has raised many hopes during the initial
phase of its operations. Its difficuit task will be to curb and, better yet, prevent
violence in a society that has seldom known any other way of solving political
differences.<br><br>

Mr. President,<br><br>

 The Middle East is happily moving toward peace and we congratulate the leaders
of Israel, Palestine, Jordan and others who have amply demonstrated that even the
world's most intractable problems can be solved.<br><br>

  In some circumstances the UN has played a gallant and unique role in the
region. The liberation of Kuwait was one example of this role. Since the Gulf War, we have insisted
on Iraq fulfilling all relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We have great
appreciation for the work of UNSCOM, and have taken serious note of a number of
measures Iraq has undertaken to meet Security Council resolutions concerning
weapons of mass destruction. We are still, however, looking for a declaration by
appropriate Iraqi authorities which would recognize the independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Kuwait, in its internationally respected borders.<br><br>


Mr. President,<br><br>

   Even this review suggests that a large portion of the Security Council's agenda
has to do with peace-keeping operations, PKO's. Following the end of the Cold War,
their number increased dramatically, with rocketing costs. This progression could not have continued unchecked. Exercising restraint in authorizing new PKO's
is the first condition for putting the whole system on a sound footing. In
peace-keeping, as in every other aspect of its operations, the UN must live within its
means.<br><br>

  There are of course two financial flows which determine the UN's means. On the
one hand, the outflow: a function of how troubled our world is, and which of its
troubles do we choose to tackle. On the other hand, the inflow: a function of equity
in allocating the financial burden, and of members' discipline in shouldering it.<br><br>


   Only a few operations come to mind as having been largely successful. Let me
take a closer look at one of these - ONUMOZ In Mozambique.<br><br>

  We see the following success factors involved in the ONUMOZ operation: a well-
crafted peace plan; a realistic mandate for the UN force; the politicians concerned
putting interests of their country above all else; tenacity of UN personnel in carrying
out their mandate; and the operation's timing - one wonders whether today, the
necessary troops could even be assembled.<br><br>

   By contrast, Mr. President, a number of PKO's are struggling. Angola's peace
plan for example was probably not crafted quite well enough: post-election fighting is
a consequence of the antagonists keeping their armies intact. In Somalia, the
factions do not seem to agree that there ever was a peace plan in the first place.
This is perhaps the case in Liberia as well. In the former Yugoslavia, the strength of
UNPROFOR troops is in many ways incommensurate with their mandate.<br><br>

  We then have to draw the necessary lessons.<br><br>

  Examining the key success factors of successful operations and trying to ensure
that they are present in every PKO is very important. But the main lesson is this: the
UN is not a panacea for all of the world's ills. The Security Council is often sought
out by "clients" who cannot agree on anything among themselves. But we have to
insist on one principle: in general, it is the people and the leaders of a country who
themselves have to demonstrate a readiness to tackle their problems before the UN
can come in and assist.<br><br>

   Enough gerneralizations about the outflows. On the other hand, the
UN faces a terrible crisis of inflow.<br><br>


   A radical reform of the existing system of financing is needed to overcome the
crisis of peace-keeping financing. We strongly support the idea of replacing the



existing arbitrary mechanism with a system based on standard, objective and
quantifiable criteria. We also support the idea of establishing an independent body
to study the principle of countries' capacities to pay. This should become the
fundamental criterion for determining the scale of assessments.<br><br>
  The Czech Republic meets its financial obligations toward the UN in full and on
time. It has also covered an appropriate share of obligations of the former
Czechoslovakia. My country has not, however, been assessed yet for
peace-keeping operations, pending determination of which group it should be placed
in. This matter should be settled in the context of agreeing to objective criteria for
making these determinations in general.<br><br>

  Mr. President,<br><br>

   The increased number of PKO's has increased the dangers faced by their
personnel. We therefore consider it particularly important to finish work on the
Convention on Responsibility for Attacks against UN Personnel as soon as possible.
Last year, we acutely felt the need for greater responsiveness of the Security
Council to UN members at large. This need continues, but some small progress has
been attained. Meetings of Security Council members with troop-contributing
countries of major PKO's have become more frequent, perhaps even routine.<br><br>

  Mr. President,<br><br>

   Improved cooperation between the UN and regional organizations would no
doubt improve the efficiency of both in dealing with international crises. We are
particularly interested in further strengthening UN's cooperation with the CSCE, but
also with NATO. This is why last January, during our Presidency of the Security
Council we suggested the possibility of a UN seminar with regional organizations.
Understanding full well that they all have different charters, characters and qualities,
we still feel that a continuing exchange of experiences can enrich the entire
international system of muitilateral diplomacy. We commend the Secretary General
for organizing the first meeting along these lines earlier this year.<br><br>

  Mr. President,<br><br>

  The future shape of the Security Council is one of the most important questions
this General Assembly session will deal with. The effort exerted to date is reflected
in the report of Ambassador Insanally, Chairman of the ad hoc working group. The
basic role of the Security Council, maintenance of international peace and security,
determines its unique position. There is no question about a need for it or about its
impact on international affairs. This exceptional position of the Council should be
maintained.<br><br>


  Efforts to improve its functioning are thus informed by other considerations: it has
to win greater confidence of Member States. Even after it is reformed, the Council



will have to remain rather small, to maintain its efficiency. If its work improves, it
should not be because of increased size or expanded responsibilities, but because of
its enhanced authority.<br><br>

  Those countries should be considered for new permanent membership which
have the economic, political and military potential to contribute to the maintenance
of global security, which are prepared to assume the responsibilities implied by
permanent membership, and are ready to actively participate in the implemantation
of Security Council decisions. The key factor, in our view, is the global influence of
candidates. The principle of unanimity and its obverse, that is, veto power,
expressed in 1945 the fundamental responsibility of great powers for maintaining
world peace. Since the dissolution of the bi-polar world, this responsibility has, if anything, further increased. We therefore favour maintaining the unanimity principle.
<br><br>
Mr. President,<br><br>

  We are delighted that our last General Assembly session resulted in the creation
of the post of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and congratulate
Ambassador Ayala-Lasso on having been appointed to it. Even during his very first
few months in office he has demonstrated its usefulness. We have no doubt that this
Assembly will follow through with the implementation of additional recommendations
of the 1993 Vienna Human Rights Conference.<br><br>

Mr. President,<br><br>

  The danger of nuclear proliferation has not disappeared: ongoing discussions
with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are one example that proves this
point. We support an indefinite and unconditional extension of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and will advocate this position at the Fifth NPT Review Conference next
year. We support an increased role for the International Atomic Energy Agency in
verifying how the NPT is being adhered to.<br><br>

  We favour accelerating the work on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We
share the view that the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons and of
nuclear explosive devices should be banned. We support maintaining a moratorium
on nulcear tests, and an agreement on banning all such tests, as well as further
negotiations on limiting nuclear arsenals and on necessary measures to prevent
illicit trafficking in nuclear material.<br><br>

  Mr. President,<br><br>

  A small world full of problems, with almost 50 years of global peace but replete
with local wars. Abundance side by side with poverty. Success in South Africa,
progress in the Middle East, but a Bosnia and a Rwanda torn asunder. All this, and
much more, is characteristic for today's world and is reflected in today's United
Nations. Our fervent hope, Mr, President, is that when leaders of the world meet



here next year, they will be celebrating 50 years of an organization that will have
become even more successful, in a world that will be much closer to overall peace,
prosperity and democracy.<br><br>

 Thank you, Mr. President.

Jozef Zieleniec, Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs
</title>
</head>
<body>

 Ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>


    Allow me first to express my thanks for the opportunity to present the foreign
policy orientation of the Czech Republic at an institute so renowned in European
politcs and political science. At the same time, I would like to remind you that
France was one of the states that contributed decisively to Czechoslovak

Independence after the year 1918, and that the Czechs have not forgotten that fact.
Today's Czech Republic values highly this tradition of friendship and alliance.<br><br>


    This occasion is all the more welcome because it follows the intensive talks I
had with my colleague Mr. Alain Juppe, and it also comes after the recent visit to
France of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. These contacts confirm that France,
in keeping with its role in the today's world, and in Europe specifically, has not lost
interest in the region of Central Europe.<br><br>


    I would like to use this occasion to acquaint you, two years after the founding
of the independent Czech state, with the philosophy behind our reform and the
priorities of Czech foreign policy arising from it.<br><br>


    It is the nature of the media to fill their front pages mostly with news about
trouble-makers and crisises. News about the Czech Republic in the past two years
has appeared only sporadically, and then usually on the business pages. We are not
complaining. On the contrary! Nevertheless, we realize that - to quote the words of
your colleague, the politicist Helee Carrere d'Encausse - the Czech Republic as a
stable democracy and dependable political and economic partner in the centre of
Europe "does not need to make headlines, but has to remain on the agenda".<br><br>


    Of course, even the first concrete rasults of our reforms inspire us with a
csrtain sober optimism. The Czech economy shows macroeonomic stability,
unemployment is very low, the market has been liberalized, privatization is drawing
to a  close and re-orientation of exports to advanced European and world markets
has been successful.<br><br>


    But the most important fact is that Czech society has never ceased to identify
itself with the fundamental philosophy of the reforms, despite all the difficulties the
economic transformation has brought. The ethos of the economic transformation
that has been embarked upon has shifted the centre of the life of society from its
collectivist.past to individuals - free  citizens fully responsible for their own fate and
for the future of the society in which they live.<br><br>


    Success of reforms depends above all on the ability and wiliingness of the
majority of the population to orient themselves in the new situation, to identify with
the philosophy and the progress of reforms and to take an active part in  the process.
I am glad that the Czech govemment has been able to count on the willingness and
trust of the citizens, and I hope that it will be the case in the future as well.<br><br>


Ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>


    I emphasize the philosophy of our reforms because it has also become the
basis of the orientation of our foreign policy. We are convinced that like each
individual in society, the state should build up its international position among
other states above all by its efforts at home. Thus the before mentioned philosophy
also inspires the positions of the Czech Republic in all its foreign policy priorities: the
approach to European integration and regional cooperation, and issues of national
and European security.<br><br>


    It will certainly not surprise you if I confirm that integration of the Czech
Republic into the European Union remains one of the main objectives of Czech
foreign policy. This goal follows from the fact that with the exception of the four
postwar decades, the Czech Lands have always been geopolitically, historically and
spiritually part of Westem culture. The "retum to Europe" has from the beginning
been an election pledge of the Czech government that has the full support of most
voters, even thougrh they are aware that certain sacrifices will have to be made
along the way.<br><br>


    Our sober pro-European orientation is based on the  civic principle, which I
have already mentioned. I think that before starting to knock on the door of Europe,
we will have to tully prepare for our entry. More important than speculations about
when to submit our candidature is the work in the economic, political and legislative
spheres, which must be done at home. It is our own effort that is of decisive
importance. Therefore, I never fail to stress that a country is not admitted among
the advanced countries, unless a country becomes advanced.<br><br>


    On the basis of the progress of the reforms in the Czech Republic, we expect
that we will not be entering the European Union as a passive recipient of various
funds and subsidies, but as a stable and possibly prosperous country that the other
members of the Union will consider a useful partner in both political and economic
matters. We are convinced that we will be ready in a few years time. We believe we
will submit our application before the intergovenmental conference scheduled for
1996.<br><br>


    But the expansion of the European Union also calls for thorough preparation
on the part of the EU. And it is in the context of the reflection on the optimum future
face of the European Union, which is expected to culminate at that conference.
that we deem it useful to present our own views in the discussion, to emphasize
what we consider important, to point out some of our unique historical experiences.
This should in no way be perceived as an expression of doubts about the viability of
European institutions or as an effort to weaken the trend of European integration.

<br><br><br><br>



                       4<br><br>



    Today as Europeans, we would  appreciate an intensification of the
political dialogue regarding our common future, particularly in preparations for the
intergovernmental conference, which is schedualed to start next year. This would raise the
relationship between the countries of the European Union and the countries of
Central and Eastem Europe to the level of real partnership. This would help remove
mutual stereotypes and misunderstandings. In addition to this it would also prove that the European Union is truly serious about its expansion.
<br><br>

    In recent weeks we have witnessed the first signs of French and German
efforts to specify how the European Union would institutionally bring into harmony
the processes of intensification and expansion of integration. The vague idea of
Europe modelled after the principles of  "geometrie variable" has thus once again come
into the forefront. It would be premature to comment on these thoughts before they
take on a more concrete and less sketchy form. It is obvious, however, that they are
based on effors to assess the abilities of each member country and applicant for
membership. In this respect we understand them. At the same time, we believe that,
regardless of partnership with the countries that will not become members of the
Union; this concept does not in any way create a new institutional division of Europe.
<br><br>

    I have mentioned these issues as examples of the echnomic and political
problems which should, in my opinion, become a topic of the intensified dialogue I
have already mentioned.<br><br>


Ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>


    An essential part of the European integration of the Czech Republic is its
incorporation into the European and transatlantic security structures.<br><br>


    Our analysis of the current national and European security situation is based
on our specfic historical experience. From the traumas of our history, we have
gained the dearly paid-for knowledge that our sovereign national existence cannot
be ensured by relying exclusivaly on foreign help. That is why in the unstable
situation, which has arisen in Europe afer the end of the Cold War, we emphasize
above all the building and strengthening our own defensive capacity, in the military
and also the political and psychologicai sense.<br><br>


   This means among other things that we are aware of the vital need to anchor
our republic in a wider military and security alliance with the countries that share our
values and our interest in the security and stability of the European continent. The
North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the natural point of intersection to such
relations. The Czech govemment is backed in the efort of joining NATO by a vast
majority of the population, as well as the political parties.<br><br>


   Our interest in the Atlantic alliance is primarily dictated by our determination to
share and to defend our common heritage. From our own historical experienoe we
know that the transatlantic bond has always proved essential for the enduring
security of Europe. We do not want to passively ensure for ourselves some type of
secure haven.<br><br>



   It is no acddent that the Czech Republic has sent 1,000 soldiers as part of
the UNPROFOR peace mission to the territory of the former Yugoslavia. I would like
to say how highly we appreciate in this context the initiative and devotion shown by
France in coping with the situation in the Balkan Peninsula.<br><br>


   Although we are convinced that enduring and effective European security
involves American presence on the Old Continent, we realize at the same time that
European security must remain predominantly the business of us, Europeans. In our
view, both dimensions of European security complement each other, and we
therefore welcome the pragmatic approach to NATO that has recently prevailed in
France. That attitude corresponds to France's position in Europe and in the world.<br><br>


                     



    The Czech Republic appreciates the possibility of intensifying military
cooperation with the emerg:ng pillar of European security via its associated status in
the WEU. We believe that not only the political extent but also the real extent of that
cooperation will grow.<br><br>


    As far as the prospect of our membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization is concerned, we realize here,  that certain minimum conditions
should be fulfilled on both sides. On our part, we are trying to fulfill the political,
organizatlonal and technical conditions as soon as possible. That is why we were
among the first to welcome the Partnership for Peace as an ideal, adaptable and
individualized concept, facilitating gradual political and military rapprochement
between the Czech Republic and NATO.<br><br>


    We are convinced that the extension of the zone of stability that our entry into
NATO will bring about is not only in the interest of the Czech Republic but also in the
interest of all of Europe and all members of the Alliance. And we would regard it as
an outright threat to the future of European democracy and stability if any third
country had a veto over our membership.<br><br>


L.adies and gentlemen,<br><br>


     In condusion, I would like to say a few words about the relations between the
Czech Republic and France.<br>
    We are pleased that at pnesent we can witness certain intensification of our
bilateral relations, not only in view of the existing tradition, but also because in
present-day Europe, marked by the ongoing re-definition of the priorities of
American foreign policy and the growing importance of Germany, we are also
interested in preserving the equilibrium and the dynamics of  European politics,
enforced by, among other things,  the post-war relation between Germany and
France.<br><br><br><br>


                       7<br><br>



    We particularly appreciate the fact that our, at times, somewhat different points
of view express shared or dosely related political interests of both parties, and thus
comprise a common opinion on the basic issues of Europe's present and future. The
current talks confirm our conviction that the French approach to the expansion of the
European Union and of  NATO is as open and active as the German one.<br><br>


    Regular political contacts between the Czech Republic and France should
compensate for a certain geographie dstance - which, by the way, is much shorter
than it may seem. How many French people actually realize that the distance
between Paris and Prague is not much greater than that between Paris and Nice?<br><br>


    The cultural and intellectual bonds between our two countries have been
traditionally strong since the period between the two world wars. Many Czech poets,
artists, writers and intellectuals were influenced by the French spiritual milieu, and
many of them sought long or short term refuge in France. I should mention at least
Milan Kundera, Jirt Kol r, and my colleague Pavel Tigrid, the present Czech
Minister of Culture, who has spent nearly half ot his life in France.<br><br>


    Today's military cooperation also continues the traditicn of the period
between the First and Second World Wars. The cooperation of our countries since
November 1989 confirms this: be it in the joint military exercises, or in the former
Yugoslavia.<br><br>


    Last but not least, I would like to mention the developing economic relations.
Some setbacks, greatly overstated by the media, should not conceal the growth of
economic cooperation between France and the Czech Republic in all areas, often at
a level that is more valuable from our point of view than mammoth projects and
investments.<br><br>


	Small and medium-sized businses in the food-processing industry, energy, cosmetics, construction, media and advertising, tte emcos and so on create a good basis for eal coopedration. In Pragued, as in Paris, you can Ilsten to "Europe 2" radio. whieh is one of the most popular stations in the Czech Republic and the French cars are spread all over Prague. I would be veryd happy it this conspi ous and welcome sign of the French presence in Central Europe and in the Czech Republic could becoms a symbol of further reduction of the already negligibie physical distance that separates us. If we manage to develop the politicai contacts between our two countries the same dynamic and fruitful way as this day-to-day business, it will be the most useful contribution to the common European future we can wish for.
<br><br>

   Thank you for attention.

<FONT SIZE=2>Investors expect governments to create a stable political
and economic environment and that is exactly what has happened
in the Czech Republic  the country's level of stability, both
political and with regard to rapid liberalisation and privatisation,
has no parallel in any of the post communist countries.  Launched
on January 1, 1991, the Czechoslovak economic reform has aimed
to re-integrate the national economy with those of the developed
world market through privatisation, liberalisation of prices and
foreign trade, the establishment of internal currency convertibility,
macro economic stabilisation, and the attraction of foreign direct
investment (FDI). <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2> With the government of Czech Prime Minister V&aacute;clav

Republic (CR) enjoys a high level of political stability.  Opinion
polls show that Klaus's Civic Democratic Party, closely identified
with the political and economic reforms of the last four years,
consistently sustains strong support.  The government currently

and productivity. The Czech Republic, with an average score of
9.5 for the above criteria, clearly emerged on top. The country&#180;s
top rating was repeated in a second review in December&#180;95/January
&#180;96.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Having already installed the essential legal and
institutional framework, the government is now focusing its efforts
on reorienting its economy toward the European Community market,
which currently represents over 50% of the country's trade.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>ECONOMIC STABILITY<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The CR's conservative fiscal policies have produced
a stable and reliable investment climate with the <B>lowest level
of inflation</B> in central and eastern Europe, <B>strong foreign
currency reserves</B>, the region's <B>lowest foreign debt per
capita</B>, and favourable exchange rates.  Strict economic policies
have sought to achieve a balanced budget, with an independent
central bank controlling the money supply.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Inflation rates</B> have continued to decrease
after the high 20.8% 1993 average inflation rate caused by introduction
of the value-added tax (VAT) in January 1993. Average inflation
in 1994 dropped to 10 %. The average inflation rate for the year
1995 is under 10%.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> For 1995, the CR's US $1 359 <B>national debt per
capita</B> is the region's lowest,  much less than its nearest
competitor, Hungary (with a per capita debt of $3 106).  This
low national debt illustrates the Czech government's rejection
of  such short-term measures as higher borrowing, which has increased
national debt in many Western economies.   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Signalling the country&#180;s return to the international
community of advance economies, <B>the Czech Republic</B> <B>joined
the OECD on 28 November 1995</B>. As the 26th member, the Czech
Republic is the first former European communist country to join
the organization of the world&#180;s most advanced economies.
Membership will enable the country to participate in political
dialogue lead by the most advanced market economies regarding
social, economic and financial affairs.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1/2</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Such economic policies have led to improved ratings
from <B>Moody's Investors' Service </B>and<B> Standard &amp; Poor's</B>,
making the CR the first post-communist country to be rated, respectively,
<B>Baa1 and A.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>OPTIONS FOR FDI<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>The inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI)
</B>reached almost <B>US$</B> <B>5.28 billion by September 1995</B>.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>       The most common forms of FDI are:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- <B>joint ventures</B> - to date, joint ventures
with recently privatised companies have been the dominant form
of foreign investment;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- <B>greenfield investments</B>;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- <B>participation in the privatisation process</B>
- although the deadline for submitting projects for the second
wave of privatisation has passed, many approved projects have
been designed to accommodate future foreign investors.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Investors can also acquire equity positions through
the <B>Prague Stock Exchange</B>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Czech legislation enables <U>foreign entrepreneurs
to conduct business in the CR under the same conditions as</U>
<U>Czech entrepreneurs</U>.  A foreigner may become either the
sole or co-founder of a company, and may also join an existing
Czech enterprise.  Foreigners who own businesses abroad may also
conduct business activities in the CR provided they own a branch
office within the CR.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> According to the Czech Commercial Code, the official
forms of business entities accepted by the Commercial Register
include: joint-stock; limited liability; limited partnership;
unlimited partnership; co-operative; silent partnership; and branch
office of a foreign company. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> There is <B>no upper limit</B> on the level of foreign
investment in the CR. <BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>ACCESS TO CREDITS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Foreign entrepreneurs can make use of credits granted
by both Czech and foreign banks.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As in other countries, <B>interest rates</B> vary
according to the duration of credit, and are expected to decrease
along with future economic development.  Czech banks offer credits
on short-term (up to one year)   average interest rate of 12.852
%, medium-term (1-4 years) for 14.384 % and long-term (over four
years) for 11.44 %.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>INVESTMENT PROTECTION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The protection of foreign investments is guaranteed
through a number of intergovernmental agreements signed by the
former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) and approximately
30 other countries; the CR continues to honour all such agreements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>BUSINESS  AUTHORISATION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> To engage in business, entrepreneurs must apply
to the respective business office for authorisation.  This may
come as a <B>business certificate</B> or a <B>business license</B>,
depending on the nature of the business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Persons having a domicile or seat outside the CR
must also establish a responsible representative to act in compliance
with business regulations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>FOREIGN EXCHANGE REGULATIONS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> On October 1, 1995 <B>full convertibilty</B> of
the Czech Crown was established by the Foreign Exchange Act. The
new law complies with Art. 8 of the International Monetary Fund
Charter, a pre-requisite for OECD membership. Ristrictions on
investing out of the country and borrowing limits have been removed.
  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The Czech National Bank&#180;s
<B>exchange rate</B> continues to weight the Crown 65% to the
D-Mark and 35% to the US dollar, allowing it to fluctuate by 0.5%
either side of parity. The central bank is presently reviewing
the possiblity of widening this band width.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A very significant foreign currency deposit scheme,
with extensive double taxation agreements existing with most major
countries, readily facilitates international trade.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>REPATRIATION OF PROFITS AND CAPITAL<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Czech foreign exchange regulations and investment
protection agreements guarantee the transfer of profits and capital
abroad.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>TAXATION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The current taxation system, introduced in January
1993, includes a value-added tax (<B>VAT</B>) <B>of 5% for</B></FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>       services and 22% for goods</FONT></B><U><FONT SIZE=2>,</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=2>
similar to those in most Western European countries.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Businesses in the Czech Republic are subject to
a <B>corporate income tax of 39%</B> from January 1996, regardless
of total income.  <B>Special tax rates</B> are set for certain
types of income (i.e. a rate of 25% for income derived from commercial,
engineering or other consulting services, intermediary services
rendered in the country by taxpayers having a seat outside the
CR, and earnings derived from the transfer and use of industrial
property rights).  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Those living in the Czech Republic for at least
183 days in one calendar year are subject to a <B>personal income
tax</B>.  Tax rates vary according to annual income, ranging from
<B>15-40%.</B>  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Future tax reform will result in a reduction of
direct taxes paid by companies as the Czech government aims at
shifting the tax burden away from enterprise onto indirect taxation.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1/4</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>PRICES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Prices were liberalised in the former CSFR on January
1, 1991.  Currently, only 5% of prices are regulated, (i.e. water,
certain medications and health care equipment, solid fuels).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>IMPORT AND EXPORT OF GOODS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As a founding member of GATT (the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade), the CR applies <B>import duties</B> according
to the valid and internationally recognised customs tariff.  
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As of July 21, 1993 joint venture or limited liability
companies in the CR with at least 30% foreign ownership (equalling
no less than US$1.7 million) are allowed one year of <B>exemption</B>
from customs duties on raw materials or semi-processed goods imported
through the foreign partner for further manufacturing in the CR.
 The law, intended to encourage new companies, is valid for established
enterprises until July 1994 or, in the case of new enterprises,
for one year after their foundation.  As a pro-export measure
the law also requires companies to then export an amount of the
resulting manufactured goods whose value at least equals that
of the imported materials.  The law is valid until the end of
1996.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Also exempt from import duties are certain selected
types of goods, goods not subject to customs clearance (for personal
use by diplomats, members of government, etc.), and goods located
in customs-free zones and storehouses. Since January 1,1996, the
customs duties on more than two thirds of items listed have been
reduced.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>LABOUR FORCE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A significant attraction for foreign investors is
the highly <B>cost-effective</B> Czech labour force.  Average
<B>wage rates</B>, according to JP Morgan's <I>Emerging Markets
Economic Weekly</I>, are 13.5% and 40.5% lower than in Poland
and Hungary, respectively.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Employer <B>&quot;add on costs&quot;</B> (i.e. payments
for social security and health insurance funds), according to
Price Waterhouse, are 25% and 32% lower than in Poland and Hungary,
respectively.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> With an outstanding 1991 literacy rate of 98.9%,
the Czech workforce is educated, skilled, and was ranked the highest
in Eastern Europe, surpassing Hungary in measures of managerial
skills.  According to a December 1993 OECD report on education,
the CR produces a higher percentage of science and engineering
graduates than any other country in the world.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Foreign citizens may be employed in Czech companies
provided they acquire a work permit from the respective labour
office and a residence permit from either the diplomatic or consular
office of the CR abroad, or from the Ministry of the Interior
in the CR.<BR>

<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Last update:  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>January,
1995  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Despite the division of the former CSFR on January
1, 1993 into the independent Czech Republic and Slovak Republic,
the introduction of a new Czech currency, tax reform and a continuing
world recession, the Czech government has continued its impressive
macro-economic development on a number of fronts:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Real GDP</B> grew 2.6% in 1994 and first half
results of 4.2% annual growth for 1995 exceeded J.P. Morgan&#180;s
estimate of 3.8 %, enhanced by increased domestic and foreign
investments and continued export growth. Preliminary data for
1995 according  the Czech Statistical Office is 5,2. The prognoses
of annual growth for 1996 is 5,6%.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Privatisation</B> is essentially complete with
over 80% of former state property transferred to private ownership
or the National Property Fund. Some large scale privatisation
projects remain, including the Czech rail service, certain health
care facilities and postal service. Remaining shares in privatized
companies held by the National Property Fund are to be sold off
in 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The average annual 1993 <B>inflation rate</B> of
20.8% reflected the price jump of 8.5% in January 1993 following
introduction of the new VAT. The average inflation in 1994 was
<B>10%</B> and <B>the estimation for 1995 is about 9%.<BR>
</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Export volume</B> grew 17% in 1993, mainly due
to the trade shift away from Slovakia toward the West, and has
continued to climb, reaching 10% growth in 1994.  Trade will continue
its reorientation toward the European Community, which now accounts
for over 50% of the Czech export market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Foreign Currency Reserves</B> reached the annual
target by April 1994 and continue to accumulate.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Inevitably, <B>real output</B> initially fell due
to the loss of trade with former Comecon markets.  After more
than four years of reform, however, there are now clear signs
of recovery. Retail sales increased 5.5% in 1994, the construction
sector recorded 7.5% growth and <B>industrial production</B> rose
by 2.1%. The first three quarters for 1995 recorded 7.8% and 7.6%
growth in industrial production and construction respectively
and retail sales increased by 3.5%.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Unemployment</B>, averaging 3.2% in 1994 and
3.0 in the first three quarters of 1995, coupled with continued
growth in consumer demand also confirm macroeconomic stability.

</FONT></U>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>OPTIONS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Czech law enables foreigners to conduct business
activities under the same conditions and to the same extent as
Czech entrepreneurs.  Foreigners may become founders or co-founders
of a company, or may join an existing Czech company.  <B>There
is no upper limit on foreign investment.<BR>
</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Foreigners with business operations abroad may also
run business activities in the Czech Republic (CR) provided they
own an enterprise or branch office in the CR.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Since April 1991, no formal approval is required
from the Czech Ministry of Finance for foreign investment except
when made through a large privatisation programme or when involving
the banking/financial and defence sectors.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Czech Commercial Code provides the following
options for business activities in the CR:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>-  limited liability company;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>-  joint stock company;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>-  co-operative; </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>-  various types of partnerships (i.e. limited, general
commercial - unlimited, silent); and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- branch office of a foreign company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The most common types are limited liability companies
and joint stock companies.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A limited liability company is a company the capital
whereof is made up of previously determined investments of its
partners. The company may be founded by a single person. The company
shall be liable for a breach of its obligations with all its assets.
The minimum capital of the company shall have the value of 100,000K&egrave;
(about USD3,450).  If non-monetary investments are to be contributed,
the articles of incorporation shall state the object of such investments,
the method of its appraisal in monetary terms, and the sum credited
to the partner's investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The deed of foundation shall include:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(in case of one partner the deed of foundation must
be obligatorily worked out by the notary office)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> the commercial name and the seat  of the company</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> specification of the partners, including the seat
of legal person (in case of the foreign legal person it is necessary
to present the extract of the Commercial  Register of the country
or of the town where the company was established)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> the object of business activity (based on the business
licence given by the Business Licensing Office to the responsible
representative - a person with permanent domicile in the Czech
Republic)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> the amount of capital and investment contributed
by each partner, and in the case of non-monetary investments also
their property</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> the names and places of residence of the initial
executives (statutory body) of the company and the manner whereby
they act on behalf of the company (statutory body) and if not
Czech a citizen, shall be required to present a document permitting
such person to reside in the Czech Republic.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When the company is established by a single founder,
it may be entered in the Commercial Register only when its capital
has been paid up in full. At least 30% of each partner's financial
contribution, totalling at least 50,000 K&egrave; (US$1,725),
must be paid on foundation. The application for entry of the company
in the Commercial Register shall be signed by all the executives.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4/2<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reserve fund:  Specifications to be outlined in the
partnership deed.  Must be supplemented annually with at least
5% of the company's net profits (10% in the first year the company
makes a profit) until a level specified in the partnership deed
(which must be at least 10% of the basic capital) is reached.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>JOINT STOCK COMPANY<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A joint stock company is the corporate form covered
by the Commercial Code in the greatest detail. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A shareholder is not liable for the company's obligations.
A joint stock company is founded by a founding contract and must
have its bylaws which form a part of the founding contract. If
a single legal person founds a joint stock company, it does so
by a founding charter. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Structure of the company:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
the company has a board of directors, which is elected by a general
meeting of share holders and has not less than three members.
The company must also have a board of supervisors and under its
bylaws it may be the board of supervisors which can also appoint
the board of directors. The board of supervisors, too, must have
at least three members. If the company has more than fifty employees,
at least one third of members of the board of supervisors must
be elected by the employees. The board of supervisors may include
more representatives of the company's employees, but their number
may not exceed half of the board's total membership. The board
of directors is the company's statutory body and decides on all
matters which are not reserved for decision by the general meeting.
Under the bylaws not all members of the board of directors may
act on behalf of the company. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A foreign natural person entered in the Commercial
Register as a person authorised to act on behalf of the respective
entrepreneur must have a residence permit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Employee shares may be issued only to the extent
where their unpaid-up nominal value does not exceed 5 per cent
of the capital stock. They may be transferred only between the
company's employees and retired workers. Preference shares are
defined rather briefly, only as shares to which relate preferences
regarding divided payment. The total nominal value of preference
shares may not exceed half of the capital stock.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A joint stock company may also issue bonds up to
half of its stock capital. The Commercial Code moreover provides
for increase and reduction of the capital stock.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>BRANCH OFFICE OF A FOREIGN COMPANY<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Foundation: </B>Czech law requires that branch
offices fully list their planned activities in their application
for entry in the Commercial Register as they are only allowed
to engage in those activities listed in their entry.  A director,
who may be either a Czech national or a foreigner with a valid
Czech residency permit, must be appointed to head the branch office.
 All laws under which the branch's parent entity was founded also
apply to the branch's internal dealings.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE COMMERCIAL REGISTER<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Under the new Commercial Code, all enterprises in
the CR, including representative offices, must be registered in
the Commercial Register.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Commercial Register is a public list kept by
district or regional courts.  To be included in the list, business
entities or individual entrepreneurs must submit a petition to
the court whose jurisdiction covers the entity's seat or the individual's
address.  The petition must contain officially authenticated signatures
of all founding partners, and must be accompanied by:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  - a business certificate and/or business license;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  - the entity's founding document (with officially
verified signatures) or a similarly verified    document establishing
the foreign entity's branch office in the CR;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  - confirmation that the initial capital has been
deposited with a Czech bank;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  - a lease or contract for the business' premises;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  - approval of the entity's location from the local
authorities; and </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  - foreigners must also obtain a residency permit
authorising residency in the CR in the case     that they are
the statutory body of the company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> All documents must be either originals or officially
verified copies, and are not returnable.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>BUSINESS AUTHORISATION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Under the Business Licensing Act, specified applicants

obtained from the Business Licensing Office appropriate to the
seat of the joint venture or branch office. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2> Foreigners employed in the CR must also obtain either
short-term, long-term, or permanent-stay residency permits.  <B>Short-term</B>

<P>
<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Last update:  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> December,
1995  <BR>
</FONT></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As of 1 January 1993, a new taxation system was introduced
in the Czech Republic (CR) to which several amendments became
effective on January 1, 1994.  With a combination of indirect
taxes, direct taxes and taxes on property, the system comprises
:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Value Added Tax (VAT)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Consumer taxes ( excise duties ) </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Income tax on corporations and individuals</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Tax on immovable property</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Road tax</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Inheritance, gift and immovable property transfer
tax</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Environmental protection taxes<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>VALUE ADDED TAX<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> All entrepreneurs whose turnover exceeds about US$
27,300 in three successive months must register as VAT payers
with the financial authorities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> There are <B>two VAT rates, 22% for goods and 5%
for certain selected goods and services</B> (i.e. specific agricultural
produce, essential food, coal and other sources of energy, pharmaceutical
products, paper products, books and electric-powered driven vehicles).
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The basic tax rate for <B>s</B>ervices is 5%, with
a rate of 22% for some selected services (i.e. restaurants, accommodation
services, tourism, trading and intermediary services, repair and
maintenance services for machines, vehicles, and tools).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The VAT is levied on all sales of goods and services
rendered in the CR.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The taxation period is one month or a quarter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The same VAT rates are applied to imported goods,
goods sent out of the country for processing and then returned,
and certain non-regular domestic bus transportation.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Goods exported from the CR are <B>tax exempt</B>,
except when previously released for temporary domestic circulation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Services rendered abroad are not taxable in the
CR, and certain domestic services are tax-exempt under the new
VAT law.  These include postal services, radio and television
broadcasting, financial services, insurance services, the transfer
and leasing of real estate, health services, social welfare services,
lotteries, recycling, the sale of enterprises, and non-profit
activities.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CONSUMPTION TAX<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This tax applies to hydrocarbon fuels and lubricants,
spirits and distilled liquors, beer, wine, and tobacco products
that are produced in or imported to the CR; the tax is set as
a fixed amount per unit of the product concerned.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CORPORATE INCOME TAX</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The tax is levied on all income of Czech legal
entities and on Czech-source income of foreign legal entities.
It is payable on the basis of profit reported in the enterprise's
financial statements as adjusted for certain deductible and non-deductible
items. No distinction is made between ordinary income and capital
gains for these purposes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>5/2<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The <B>standard rate</B> of corporate tax is<B>
39% in 1996</B>. It is anticipated it will be 30 % around the
year 2000.  It applies irrespective of whether the enterprise
is subject to Czech or foreign ownership.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  <B>Tax deductible expenditures</B> include: tax
depreciation; social security contributions; operating lease payments;
financial lease payments under special conditions; immovable property
tax; certain expenditures relating to health and safety at work
and environmental protection; travel allowances up to statutory
limits; value of a receivable from a debtor who cannot go through
bankruptcy proceedings due to lack of property; contractual fines
and interests on past amounts due; acquisition price of an ownership
interest in a business entity in the tax period of its disposal;
and gifts to Czech municipalities, legal entities and physical
persons for educational, cultural, environmental, charitable or
religious purposes (deductions must be more than 2,000 K&egrave;
(about $66) and cannot exceed 2% of the payer's tax base).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Taxpayers can deduct up to 10% of the value of new
<B>tangible fixed assets</B> acquired for consideration from their
tax base provided they are the first owners of these assets. 
The 10% deduction does not affect the assets' book value.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Starting on January 1, 1995, legal entities (with
the exception of investment funds) will be allowed to deduct from
their tax base one half of the withholding tax deducted from dividends
and other paid profit distributions. This was designed to moderate
the effect of double taxation on dividends.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  <B>Non-deductible items</B> include: entertainment;
travel allowances in excess of the statutory limits; reserves
unless specifically permitted by special regulations; directors'
fees; tax paid on behalf of another taxpayer; capital items; interests
and other yields paid by employers to their employees on deposits
exceeding the usual interest rate provided by banks at the same
location; interest arising from deferred tax payments; increased
tax liability; interest on loans for deferred customs duties;
and most fines and penalties.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>Withholding Tax<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Certain types of income -- whether received by Czech
or non-resident taxpayer -- are subject to withholding taxes as
follows:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>       - 25% on dividends, directors' fees*, profit
shares and other related distributions;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>       - 15% on bank deposit interest.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>*As of January 1, 1994, directors' fees paid to members
of statutory and other bodies of legal entities are not subject
to a 20% withholding tax as before, but are to be paid net of
a 25% tax prepayment.  Income from such directors' fees are now
included in the personal tax of a director and remain non-deductible
for the company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Incomes subject to withholding tax are (with some
exceptions) deductible for corporate tax purposes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Subject to the provisions of relevant double taxation
treaties, withholding taxes apply to Czech-source income and payments
to non-resident taxpayers as follows :</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>       - 25% on licence payments, royalties, rentals
and operating lease payments, copyright payments;</FONT>
<P>

<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As a founding member of GATT (the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade), the CR applies <B>import duties</B> according
to the valid and internationally recognised customs tariff.  
<BR>
</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>       In terms of customs duties, the CR is very
liberal. Czech customs duties have been brought into alignment
with the European Union customs framework, eliminating customs
duties payable on most goods destined to the EU. Further trade
benifits also exist through the Central European Free Trade Agreement,
to which the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia
are signatories. <BR>
</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As of July 21, 1993 joint venture or limited liability
companies in the CR with <B>at least 30% foreign</B> <B>ownership
</B>(equalling no less than US$1.7 million) are allowed <B>one
year</B> of <B>exemption</B> <B>from customs</B> <B>duties on
raw materials or semi-processed goods</B> imported through the
foreign partner for furthers manufacturing in the CR.  The law,
intended to encourage new companies, is valid for established
enterprises until July 1994 or, in the case of new enterprises,
for one year after their foundation.  As a pro-export measure
the law also requires companies to then export an amount of the
resulting manufactured goods whose value at least equals that
of the imported materials.  The law is valid until the end of
1996.  <BR>
</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Also exempt from import duties are certain selected
types of goods; goods not subject to customs clearance (for personal
use by diplomats, members of government, etc.) and goods located
in customs-free zones and storehouses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> Customs relief:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The
legal framework of the Czech Republic's customs law is, in essence,
the same as the European Union's. In view of the minimum use of
non-tariff barriers to trade, the import-export regime of the
Czech Republic can be described as very liberal and transparent.
Moreover, the extensive use of preferential rates brought the
average estimated customs rate for 1995 down to only 3.8%.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The basic terms of the customs law include the term
declarent, who must be a legal Czech subject ie:- a person permanently
residing in the country or a corporate body based in the territory.
As in other regimes the declarent can appoint a representative
to handle the customs declaration.<BR>

is available in respect of material, components and sub-assemblies
imported for processing and export. The &quot;Interim Agreement
on Trade and Related Matters&quot; between the Czech Republic
and the EU will lead to a genuine free trade zone covering the
Republic and the EU member states within five years.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Products made in the Czech Republic from components
imported from EU countries and then exported to the EU pay no
duty in the destination country.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Currently, import duty on general production equipment
and machinery is 4.2 % for Japanese and 1.68 % for EU products.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Where the &quot;the local (Czech) content&quot; value
added is at least 60 % there is often no import duty on products
manufactured and shipped from the Czech Republic into the EU countries.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Certification of products
originating in the CR for the purposes of customs relief is available
according to the following conditions. An EUR 1 certificate is
issued for products manufactured in the CR from materials and
components originating in the CR or EU and who's value must comprise
60% or more of the total value of the completed product. Products
certified EUR 1 for export to the particular destinations may

 </B></I>To determine foreign exchange entitlements of both physical
and legal persons involved in foreign exchange operations, the
law's decisive criterion is not citizenship but the possession
of a permanent residence permit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Protection of foreign investment. </B>The foreign
exchange law provides protection for the repatriation of capital
and profits. Investment protection and double taxation avoidance
treaties currently exist with many countries (a list of these
treaties is available at CzechInvest) and several more are being
negotiated.  Foreigners can also transfer or export foreign vouchers,
foreign securities and savings books in foreign currency.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>BANKING<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Prior to 1989, the Czechoslovak banking system was
highly centralised. The most important step was the abandoning
of the single-bank system and  the creation of the two-level banking
structure. Since the revolution, the banking sector has been fundamentally
restructured, with the number of banks increasing from only two
in 1989 to 57  in March 1994.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>7/2<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Central bank: </B>On January 1, 1993, the Czech
National Bank (&Egrave;esk&aacute; n&aacute;rodn&iacute; banka)
was formed from elements of the former Czechoslovak State Bank
to become the CR's central bank.  The Czech National Bank is by
law autonomous and can set interest rates, regulate money markets,
control the money supply and be responsible for exchange rates.
There are virtually no administrative ceilings on either the credit
supply or interest rates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Commercial banking: </B>Of the 59 commercial
banks currently in the CR, 15 are completely Czech-owned, 19 are
partially foreign-owned, 21 are completely foreign-owned and 4
banks with extraordinary regime. Apart from banks, there are several
specialised financial institutions such as investment companies
and the Prague Stock Exchange. Associations for banks, insurance
and other specialised institutions are similar to those abroad.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Banking products and services: </B>Most banks
are universal commercial banks that provide a variety of banking
products and services.  In addition to such typical products as
loans and transaction payments, most banks provide other services
such as trade promotion, consulting, guarantee and foreign exchange
operations, and stock market and foundation services. Each of
the larger banks has daughter companies that operate investment
and privatisation funds and are also active in leasing and consulting
enterprises. Most of the banks have connections to the international
banking industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Bank Accounts: </B>All Czech enterprises, including
those with 100% foreign ownership, must open a bank account as
part of the registration process. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Credits: </B>Foreign entrepreneurs can make use
of credits granted by both Czech and foreign banks. Czech banks
offer short-term (up to one year), medium-term (1-4 years) and
long-term (over four years) credit.  The rate of interest varies
according to the duration of credit and is expected to decrease
along with future economic development. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Entry of foreign banks : </B>Foreign banks are
not restricted from entering the CR. The same regulations apply
to foreign and domestic banks. The present minimum capital requirement
is 500 million K&egrave; (approximately US$16.7 million). Banking
licenses are granted by the Czech National Bank. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>INSURANCE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The legal framework governing insurance activities
allows insurance and re-insurance companies incorporated either
as a state corporation, joint-stock company, co-operative society
or co-operative enterprise. Other types of legal enterprises may
engage in insurance activities with permission of the Ministry
of Finance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Like any business in the Czech Republic, insurance
and re-insurance companies must register their representative
with the Commercial Registry and have a representative office
in the Czech Republic. Foreign persons may only establish an insurance
company with a seat in the Czech Republic in the form of a joint-stock
company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All domestic and foreign legal entities and natural
persons in the insurance business in the Czech Republic are subject
to state regulatory authorities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The number of insurance and reinsurance companies
presently operating in the insurance market in the CR has increased
to  about 30. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Czech Insurance Company</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The re-establishment of equity markets in the CR
has been designed to run parallel to the country's privatisation
programme, which aims to privatise more than USD33 billion worth
of property over a 5-6 year period.  Shares may be acquired in
the following ways:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- individually, through the voucher privatisation
programme;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- collectively, through the voucher privatisation
programme (via investment privatisation funds);</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- through direct purchases for cash by management
or other (i.e. foreign) investors.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> These elements of the shareholder base are supplemented
by shareholders purchasing shares for cash through the market,
either from earlier holders or through new public offerings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE PRAGUE STOCK EXCHANGE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Prague Stock Exchange opened in April 1993 with
12 monetary institutes and five brokerage firms as its founding
shareholders. The Exchange traded USD 0.3 billion between April
and December 1993, USD 2.3 billion in 1994 and USD 7.2 billion
in 1995. Average daily trading volume in 1993 was USD 8.1 million,
in 1994 USD 14,3 million and in 1995 USD 30.9 million. The Exchange
is chaired by Richard Salzmann with Ji&oslash;&iacute; Franc acting
as chief executive. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Exchange <B>trades daily</B> from 8am-4pm. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Trading System: </B>The trading and information
system is based on a central automated trading system. The automated
trading system is based on the concentration of,  and demand for,
securities up to a certain time-order-driven system. Market price
of all securities is set in this automated system once a day.
Except for this basic system, three other trading segments are
used at the Prague Stock Exchange: continuous trading at a fixed
price, direct trades in blocks of securities and automatized trades
in blocks of securities. Trading is organized five times a week.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>      </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Direct trades are concluded between members, recorded
in the automated trading system and settled through the Exchange
Register of Securities. Price of direct trade is not limited.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>       </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Only PSE members can be participants in automatized
trades in blocks of securities. A block of securities represents
the minimum value of one order. Presently it is set at K&egrave;500
000. Data on direct trades with blocks of securities are periodically
made public including the minimum and maximum prices attained.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The third method of trading
is the over-the-counter market which operates by directly accessing
the Securities Centre. Estimates for OTC activity range up to
about 45% of all capital market activity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Off-Stock Exchange Trading:  </B>The Securities
Act allows for off-exchange trading, primarily for the millions
of shareholders involved through voucher privatisation. The <B>RM-SYSTEM</B>,
a joint-stock company operating the &quot;RM-S&quot; system from
430 &quot;share shops&quot; throughout the CR, acts as an organiser
of the securities market and is independent of the Prague Stock
Exchange.  Individual investors and legal entities can buy and
sell shares of about 1,700 companies and investment funds through
these share shops which are connected to a central computer and
pricing mechanisms.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>8/2<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Clearing System:  </B>Concluded exchange deals
are cleared by the Securities Register Ltd., an offshoot of the
Prague Exchange, on the third day following conclusion of the
deal through the Czech National Bank's clearing centre.  All exchange
deals between members are guaranteed clearing; a Guarantee Fund
covers the risks and liabilities inherent in exchange trading.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Membership:</B> A<B> </B>precondition for exchange
membership is that the principal business activity is securities
trading on the basis of permission granted by the Ministry of
Finance of the Czech Republic. A member of the exchange can trade
on another person&#180;s or his own account or both concurrently.
 All major banks, as well as some non-bank brokers, are members
of the Exchange. The Czech National Bank and the National Property
Fund of the Czech Republic are PSE members by virtue of law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As in other foreign exchanges, PSE members give
investors advice and provide representation for a wide range of
security negotiations, including sales and purchases. As at December
31,1995 the Prague Stock Exchange had 102 members of which 63
are shareholders.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> <B>Regulation:  </B>Regulation of  exchange is conducted
according to the following laws:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- the <B>Stock Exchange Law</B> No. 214/1992 allows
authorisation of the Exchange under the Ministry of Finance;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- the <B>Investment Funds Law</B> outlines the legal
and supervisory arrangements for investment funds, particularly
those involved in the voucher privatisation process;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- the <B>Securities Law</B> outlines the basic legal
position of securities in the CR, arrangements for registration,
and the aforementioned &quot;off-exchange&quot; market; </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- the <B>Debenture Law</B> (1990) and the <B>Commercial
Code</B> (1991).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>- the new <B>Foreign Exchange/Currency Act</B> No.
219/95 -  approved in September 1995. The act provides for full
convertibility of the Czech crown for current account account
transactions and partial convertibility for capital account transactions.
Issue of foreign securities for public and non-public trading
in the domestic market is regulated by the Czech National Bank.
Permission of the Ministry of Finance is required for trading
bonds and securities in the public market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Fundamental to market supervision is a &quot;securities
commission&quot; set up within the Ministry of Finance.  This
commission is responsible for handling the authorisation of exchanges
through the Exchange commissioner, securities dealers, and investment
funds, for setting appropriate listings, and for reporting security
obligations.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the collapse of the COMECON trading zone, the
Czech Republic has successfully re-orientated its trade to its
traditional trading partners to the point where trade with the
advanced economies accounts for the largest share. In the first
half of 1995 trade with advanced market economies accounted for
61.4% of total exports and 65.1% of  total imports. Trade with
Germany has increased dramatically, making Germany the Czech Republic's
most important trading partner, accounting for 32,4% of Czech
exports and 26% of import. By contrast, the country's second largest
partner, Slovakia, accounts for 15% of exports and 13% for imports,
having greatly decreased since the division of Czechoslovakia.
This trend is expected to continue. Other important trading partners
include Austria, Italy and Poland.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Total exports for the first three quarters of 1995
amounted to $12.3 billion and imports $14.3 billion. This trade
imbalance is financed primarily by foreign currency reserves.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The most important export commodities are iron, steel,
textiles, cars and electrical engineering. Import were comprised
mostly of electrical engineering, iron and steel, office equipment
and data processing machines, raw materials, paper and paper products
and cars.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE CZECH PROPERTY MARKET<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The property market is still in the process of development,
but a viable occupational market has been established (especially
in the Prague area) since 1989 in response to high levels of tenant
demand. As foreign interest in the Czech Republic continues to
increase, a corresponding increase in construction and investment
opportunities is expected to raise the supply of available properties.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CzechInvest continues to develop its property database
to more effectively serve investors&#180; needs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The following information reflect CzechInvest&#180;s
experience based on co-operation with its regional representatives
and real estate agents.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>OFFICE AND COMMERCIAL SPACE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The office/ commercial space market continues to
make rapid strides on the path to maturity and the pace of development
has lost none of its momentum. Landlords and tenants have consistently
underestimated the capacity of Czech  companies to acquire areas
of space, for owner occupation or lease, and foreign companies
within Prague area continue to expand rapidly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Rental values vary depending on location and standards
of equipment. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE PRODUCTION SPACE/ WAREHOUSES.<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of existing industrial space available
for occupation in the Czech Republic was constructed prior to
1989. Available buildings  often form part of a larger complex,
are often multi-storey and are usually purpose built for a particular
use. As a result of the large scale of previous state operations,
buildings are often of considerable size (it is unusual to find
any available property in sizes less than 2,000m2). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Following the privatisation of state enterprises,
there are a number of properties on the market. The majority of
buildings which are in reasonable condition are disposed of leasehold
as companies seek to benefit from rental income combined with
anticipated capital appreciation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Leases are usually for terms between 5 and 10 years
and a break clause, or equivalent, is often incorporated if the
lease is longer. Assuming the units are between 2,000 and 5,000m2,
the pattern of rents for existing space is as follows:<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although the development cycle has not as yet provided
warehouse/ industrial accommodation on any great scale, more and
larger international and Czech developers are actively seeking
sites to create not only industrial parks but also business park
environments and appropriate facilities. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Presently no speculative industrial  buildings have
been constructed in the Czech Republic. There are, however, several
schemes in the pipeline which seek to remedy the imbalance between
supply and demand of quality accommodation. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2> Several projects are currently underway to improve
the Czech Republic's <B>road</B> network.  These include the improvement
of road surfaces on major transit routes (to be completed by 1996)
and the construction of by-pass roads around several cities. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In November 1993 the Czech government approved a
programme aimed at accelerating highway construction.  This 12-year
programme will provide for the commission of 987 km of new highways
to be linked to the European transportation network, increasing
truck transit capacity and connecting all major Czech cities with
high-quality roads.  In Prague, the city government has drafted
the construction of inner and outer ring roads to keep traffic
out of the city centre and create a direct link to highway junctions
for Brno, Vienna, Nuremberg, Dresden, and Berlin.  Plans are also
underway to expand Prague's metro system further into the suburbs.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>TELECOMMUNICATIONS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Due to the sudden increase in commercial activity,
Prague's telecommunications system is currently expanding to meet
demand.  It is anticipated that by the year 2000, there will be
a 35-40% increase in subscribers' lines, with 75% of the network
digitised, 70,000 data stations, 170,000 public radio-telephone
stations, and 165,000 fax subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>10/4<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Local telephone calls cost 1.6 K&egrave;, regardless
of time of day or length of call.  Cost varies for international
calls; for example, a one-minute call to the UK costs 32 K&egrave;
(about $1.00), and to the USA 63 K&egrave; (about $2.00) .<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Dutch/Swiss consortium aquired a share in the Czech
national telecommunications company  in July 1995 and will invest
approximately USD 131 million in modernization over the period
1995 - 2000. By the end of 1996, 400 000 new phone lines are to
be installed. The Czech Republic's SPT Telecom  plans to install
about one and a half million new telephone lines through to 1998.
It expects phone line penetration to reach 37 per 100 households
by 1998.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>ENERGY SOURCES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Prague is supplied with natural gas, electricity,
and solid and liquid fuel.  Its district heating system, using
solid fuel, is typical of most East European cities.  Future plans
to use natural gas allow for access to energy sources outside
the city.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A major nuclear power facility is being developed
at Temelin, in Southern Bohemia, which will complement the existing
4 x 440 MW nuclear plant at Dukovany in Southern Moravia.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND LEGISLATION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Czech government is currently addressing the
environmental difficulties associated with the former regime's
industries.  Proposals for environmental reform have been developed
to run parallel with economic reforms, including such incentives
as tax breaks, lower interest rates, and custom duty exemptions
for activities leading to environmental improvements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> For firms in which at least 40% of capital is owned
by foreign investors, there is no liability for environmental
damage caused prior to foreign investment in the firm.  In such
cases, the Czech National Property Fund will assume responsibility.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the foreign investor, the Czech Republic (CR)
can offer an increasingly large, highly skilled, and cost-effective
workforce.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> With an average monthly wage of about US$ 260 in
1995, the cost of labour is lower than in either Hungary or Poland.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> For foreign firms in the CR, payments for employee
insurance are lower than in either Hungary or Poland.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The movement toward a competitive free market economy
has encouraged efficiency measures and personnel streamlining,
creating a pool of available skilled labour.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The CR has a history of high industrial productivity,
having created the seventh largest GDP per capita in the world
prior to the ascension of  the Communist regime.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>AVAILABLE WORKFORCE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As industry continues to rationalise, more labour
will be released onto the labour market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The working age population will continue to increase,
from 51% of the population in 1993 to 53.7% in 1995.  The percentage
of people working past retirement age in the CR is among the highest
in the world, surpassing that of either Hungary or Poland.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Czech workforce is skilled and educated, with
a 1992 literacy level of 98.9%.  According to a December 1993
OECD report on education, the CR produces a higher percentage
of science and engineering graduates than any other country in
the world.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The CR's domestic workforce comprises 51% of the
10.33 million population - 5.3 million people.  The official working
age is 15-57 for women and 15-60 for men. <BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Over 70% of inward investors in the former CSFR
were able to establish incountry training programs, covering English
language, technical training, and management and finance skills.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Coopers &amp; Lybrand and KNO Worldwide study
identified a variety of approaches used to train (or retrain)
Czech employees in necessary job skills:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>On-the-job:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> this approach
was used among all companies in the study by pairing new (or promoted)
employees with experienced workers to learn while on the job.
 This is typically combined with periods of formal training.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Training classes abroad:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
although this approach introduces travel and lodging expenses,
it was found useful for training key staff with international
experience and company-specific technical or operations training.
 Almost always presented in English or German.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Corporate classes: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>as
a less expensive approach, many companies conducted these classes
incountry.  Generally, an instructor from a European branch office
customised the classes based on interviews with the trainees.
 The study found this approach most effective with technical subjects
that require small audiences.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Training internships abroad:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
found especially effective for training management or key professional
employees.  Usually held in a European facility for three to six
months, this approach gives the employee hands-on experience which
can then be brought back to the incountry office.  This approach
does involve travel expenses, however, and also requires participants
to have advanced language skills.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>University or technical institute:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
for vocational, technical, or university training.  The study
found this approach effective for securing literacy and mathematics
skills.  Also reliable for engineering and science training. 
Usually presented in Czech.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Management centres:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> sometimes
funded by western aid or government grants.  This approach often
teams Western and local teachers together as instructors, providing
everything from full MBA programs to company-specific classes.
 French food company BSN and its partner, Nestle, used this approach
after acquiring &Egrave;okoladovny, the formerly state-owned chocolate
company. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Contract training firms:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
private companies which develop either public or company-specific
programs.  Can run from one-day in-house sessions to two weeks
at an off-site facility.  These companies may also assist in translating
and modifying corporate programs to meet specific incountry needs.
 Prices vary greatly, and are not always indicative of corresponding
quality.  Sessions may be given in any language.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Public workshops:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> offered
as either conferences of single-topic workshops through a variety
of agencies.  Can focus on anything from secretarial skills to
finance and business strategies.  Vary greatly in price and can
be offered in any language.  Many companies found these to be
good supplements to company training programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Individual initiative:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
most companies in the study provided some tuition reimbursement
for classes taken after-hours to improve skills.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Since joined by Volkswagen, the Czech automobile
company Skoda has reoriented its management training procedure
towards new Western resources and demands.  Using a system called
&quot;tandem management&quot;, two managers of different nationality
- Czech, German, or English - are assigned to work together in
one position, thus exchanging knowledge and training.  Czech managers
are also exposed to several of the aforementioned approaches,
including training internships abroad, seminars at the European
Business School in Prague, and company-specific in-house courses.

<B>Health Care System in the Czech Republic<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CzechInvest Factsheet    No 12</FONT></B>
<P>
<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Last update:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> December
30, 1995         <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Total spending on health care in 1994 was over Kc
80 bn, about 8.3% of GDP. Health care is improving very quickly;
health care facilities are being modernized and equipped with
new technology.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With more than 37 000 doctors and 125 000 hospital
beds for its 10,3 million people, the Czech Republic has one of
the world's highest ratio of doctors and beds to population. According
to the long term programme of the Ministery of Health, which was
published in December 1995, both the number of doctors and hospital
beds should be reduced.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Due to the complexity of privatising the health care
system, privatisation has proceeded more slowly than in other
sectors. In 1995 the privatisation of all family doctors&#180;
and dental practices and out-patients clinics was completed. The
private sector now provides about 90% of out-patient care.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Privatisation plans for 136 of the country&#180;s
 188 hospitals, have been approved. Thirty four were privatised
through direct sale and 32 transfered free-of-charge to communities.
Only some ten smaller hospitals have been  completely privatised.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The remaining 70 hospitals are to be privatised,
but privatisation plans for these facilities have yet to be approved.
Privatisation will not limit the access of the population to health
care. Health care in the private sector will be provided to all
citizens and district aouthorities will be responsible for health
care in the regions.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Doctors and hospitals are paid through a fee for
service system by the insurance companies, which are in turn financed
by a mandatory 13.5% deduction from salaries and private income.
For pensioners, children and the unemployed, contributions are
paid by the state.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The General Health Insurance Company (VZP) is the
biggest health insurance company, covering about 75% of inhabitants.
It is guaranteed by the government. There are 26 other health
insurance companies operating in CR. This current number is not
sustainable for the size of the Czech market and the number of
health insurance operators is expected tobe reduced. New measures
are to be introduced by the Government, placing more stringent
controls over health insurnce companies, namely over their financing.
The introduction of individual accounts is planned for the future.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To limit the increasing expenditure on perscription
drugs through insurance payments, a new listing of drugs was created
in 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All these measures are intended to improve the effectivenes
of the Czech health care system and make the system financially
self-sufficient, securing the financial sources for increasing
health care personnel wage levels without resorting to increased
Government spending.<BR>

<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Last update:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  December
1995         <BR>
</FONT></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">The educational system in
the Czech Republic historically has always been highly developed.
The first university in Central Europe, Charles University, was
founded in Prague by the Czech king Charles IV. in 1348 .<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> The high level of general
education and long tradition in engineering and manufacturing
underpins the high quality of the labour force and its amenability
to training.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> For generations the Czech
education system has produced very high class, technical problem-solving
skills in environments which have not always enjoyed easy access
to standard solutions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> Prior to the Second World
War, Czechoslovakia was one of the key manufacturing centres in
Europe and that proud tradition is still apparent today. Engineering
and science is highly regarded in the country. In 1993, the OECD
was able to report that of total university graduate output, the
former Czechoslovakia produced the highest percentage of science
and technical graduates in the world with 50% graduating in those
fields. The emphasis on science and technical education continues
in the Czech Republic.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> Around 10% of the Czech population
is now highly computer literate largely on account of the educational
system  graduating some 5,000 computer-literate people every year.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> The Czech Republic has traditionally
been internationally strong in electrical engineering, electronics
and computing disciplines and the government is committed to sustaining
these skills by protected public funding in these areas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> The Czech education system,
due to its similarity with Germany's long standing Western European
education benchmark,  readily facilitates vocational education
and training.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">TECHNICAL EDUCATION - KEY
FACTS AND FIGURES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> There are three general levels
of technological education and training:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">- Basic workplace training
and education, through apprentice schools where young people study
for up to four years, passing out with a certificate.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">- Vocational education and
training through industrial colleges which take students  up to
&quot;master&quot; level, including experience in relatively advanced
work with computers and engineering design environments.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">- Advanced education in technical
universities, which award bachelor, masters and doctorate degrees.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> The Republic currently has
over 30,000 technological university students in total.  Bachelors
degrees are awarded after three years of study, but most students
stay for a further two years to take the masters degree. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> Prague CVUT, Europe's second
oldest technical university, is the largest with around 15,000
students.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman"> Besides CVUT Prague, there
are 3 more  technical universities  located in Plzen, Ostrava
and Brno.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">With 6,000 students, 500 academic
and 120 technical support staff and a Computing Department that
stands up well to international comparison in terms of hardware,
Electrical Engineering is the largest of CVUT&#180;s five faculties.
 Main area of studies include computer and information studies,
telecommunications and power electrical engineering  and all students
now must study two foreign languages as part of their bachelors
course. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">16/2<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">Research and publication have
consistently been very strong in the Electrical Engineering Faculty,
particularly in informatics, radioelectronics, cybernetics, telecommunications
techniques, electronic design (including VLSI), operating systems
and compilers. The Faculty has well-established links with many
other universities throughout Western Europe and the USA.  Recently
the Faculty was awarded IEEE/ACM approval by a visiting US academic
team and favourably benchmarked with MIT, Boston.<BR>
</FONT>

</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times New Roman">High standards of education
are not confined only to universities. The number of people who
successfully complete secondary level of education is also extremely
high. The combination of high skill levels and low labour costs
provide a powerful incentive to consider the Czech Republic as
an investment location.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Graduate output is normally a good barometer reflecting
the intellectual capital  that will enter the job market. Due
to the growth in demand for personnel in business, marketing,
financial and personnel management fields from new enterprises,
enrolment in technical programs has decreased since 1989. However,
the Czech Republic&#180;s technical and scientific graduate output
remains very high, comparativly higher than Germany and Japan
as a percentage of total graduate output. <I>(OECD &quot;Education
at a Glance&quot; 1995)<BR>
<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>GRADUATE OUTPUT<BR>
</FONT></B></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another plus point is that the student population
within institutes of higher learning increased by around 2000
between the academic year 1993/94 and 1994/95. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>     The largest and oldest school for English-speaking
children is the <B>International School of Prague</B>, where students
between the ages of 4-18 follow an American curriculum.  There
is also an English as a second language program for children not
already fluent.  <I>Mylnerovka 2, Prague 6 (tel,  fax: 2431 0223).

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The  <B>British International School of Prague</B>,
opened in 1992 as a pre-school, rapidly grew to a full British
nursery and primary school serving the needs of all children from
the international community between the ages of 3 and 13 and following
the National Curriculum for England and Wales. The language of
instruction is English, but extensive E.S.L. support is available
for non-native speakers. <I>Belgick&aacute; 25, 120 00  Praha

<FONT SIZE=2> The <B>English College</B> in Prague was opened
for children ages 13-18 in September 1994. It  provides a broad
and balanced education in English for 300 boys and girls of whom
over three-quarters are Czech nationals, the remainder being English-speaking
expatriates. Students at the English College can sit for the International
Baccalaureate, which is widely accepted at universities throughout
Europe.  Admission is on an academic basis, but scholarships are
available.  Facilities include a theatre/cinema, sports hall,
and tennis court. <I>Contact: Mr Hubert Ward MA, The English College

<P>
<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Last update: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>December
1995  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Foreign investors and indigenous investors are treated
equally in the establishment and development of a company in the
Czech Republic (CR). The government believes that sound economic
and political management are the most powerful incentives that
any government can give to industry. A balanced state budget,
stable currency and low inflation rate, are all results of the
government's prudent economic policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Nevertheless, <B>some specific  limited investment
incentives are in place</B>.  Topics in which the foreign investor
will be mostly interested from this point of view are listed below
( with no special order) :<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> Non-discrimination: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
Domestic law requires that foreign investor be treated equally
with local investors and  among themselves : the Government or
other state bodies are not in the position to make any concessions
to individual investors which might lead to unfair competitive
advantages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> Tax holiday:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> There are
no tax holidays in the Czech Republic at present and no changes
to the situation is anticipated in the near future. Rather, the
government will pursue the policy of decreasing the tax burden
on corporate and private individuals , VAT from 23% in 1994 to
22% in 1995, corporate income tax  from 45% in 1992 to 42% in
1994, 41% in 1995, and 39% from January 1996; the maximum personal
income tax rate follows the same regime - 47% to 44% in 1994,
43% in 1995 and 40% from January 1996. The government has committed
itself to continue with this trend in the future. By the year
2000 corporate income tax is expected to be around 30-32%.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> Tax consolidation:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> At
present, tax consolidation is not permitted by Czech law; individual
entities are taxed separately.  Recent changes have been introduced
providing a measure of relief from multiple taxation of dividend
flows passing up a chain of Czech companies. Although this may
be seen as the first recognition of group of companies by Czech
tax law, there is no sign of an immediate introduction of group
relief of losses or consolidated filings. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> Investment relief:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> From

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> CzechInvest was established by the Minister of Industry
and Trade in November 1992. As the country's  agency for attracting
foreign investment, <B>CzechInvest</B> aims to attract foreign
investments that increase capital formation and bring value-added
benefits to ensure the momentum created by privatisation is sustained.
 CzechInvest liaises closely with other government departments
and regions to provide decision-makers with quality data for accurate
investment appraisal, and can refer customers whose needs are
outside the scope of CzechInvest to relevant associations and
organisations. The agency was created with the express purpose
of assisting foreign investors to establish their operations as
quickly and as painlessly as possible in the Czech Republic. 
Such assistance can bring welcome relief to already over-burdened
managers seeking to establish a presence in the CR and, in saving
valuable executive time,  CzechInvest&#180;s  assistance equates
to a monetary value for the companies that work with it. The service,
however, is provided free of charge.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>     CzechInvest is committed to customer care and
service, and as such has established an effective network of 11
local representatives through-out  the  CR, and co-operates with
municipal offices to provide complete coverage of conditions in
the Czech Republic at the local level.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Within two years, CzechInvest established foreign
offices in London, D&uuml;sseldorf, and Paris. A US office is
expected to be opened in 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>      While CzechInvest can provide direction, guidance
and counselling throughout the search and negotiation process,
it cannot fund extensive market research or feasibility studies
which a foreign company may require.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>     CzechInvest can support the implementation of
such joint venture forms either directly or through a network
of external public and private organisations.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>GREENFIELD INVESTMENTS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> For investors seeking to operate their own production
facility, the Greenfields Project Department is dedicated to assist
in the location of an existing facility or building of a new factory
on a &quot;greenfield&quot; site. The Projects Department works
with the investor every step of the way using a Specifications
of Project form to first locate suitable site options for the
investor's selection, assist in the construction phase helping
with contractors and equipment suppliers to recruiting the work
force. CzechInvest remains on hand to help in any subsequent expansions.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>JOINT VENTURE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> For investors wishing to pursue co-operative efforts
with a local partner, the Joint Venture Department provides matching
services. CzechInvest will remain close throughout each stage
of the joint venture process, assisting the foreign company or
its professional advisers in partner search, choice of location
and negotiating procedures. To facilitate and target the process,
a standard registration form from each foreign company is requested.
This form provides a company status report, defines its aspirations
in the CR and determines the profile of suitable Czech partners.
For CzechInvest, it is a valuable management tool which is used
for the benefit of Czech and foreign companies alike.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>REGIONS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The regions department uses a network of representatives
throughout the Czech Republic to identify suitable sites and buildings
for inward investors and to assist with the  provision of regional
based information. It augments what CzechInvest provides to the
investor on the national level. CzechInvest is heavily involved
in training the regional staff and assisting them in setting up
local economic units which will help them not only in dealing
with CzechInvest&#180;s customers, but also form the basis for
broader-based economic initiatives in the regions.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="N1"></A>1) In the period from January to September 1994,
economic developments in the Czech Republic took place in a relatively
consolidated environment. Macroeconomic stabilisation continued,
enhancing the development of market conditions in the economy,
and, because of the world economic recovery, the external economic
environment created a better climate. According to available data,
levels of all kinds of demand increased, the most significant
being the formation of fixed capital. From the point of view of
aggregate demand, it is significant that for the first time since
the transformation process started, industrial production also
recovered, exceeding the level of the first nine months of last
year by 2.0%. A rapid increase in household consumption was matched
by dynamic retail sales. In contrast to this, agricultural production
continued to decline. The development of specific economic sectors
was reflected in GDP development which grew by approximately 2.1%
in constant prices according to CSO data. Inflation measured by
consumer price growth increased by 7.9% during the nine months
from December 1993 and by 10.5% compared to the same period last
year. The rise in average nominal wages is 16% over the first
nine months, compared to the same period last year, i.e. moving
within the upper limit of wage and salary regulations. With respect
to restructuring the economy, changes in the labour force structure
continued in the labour market. The unemployment rate was 3.2%
at the close-September, lower than at the end of 1993.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="N2"></A>2) Total industrial production (enterprises with
25 and more employees and an estimate of others) in constant prices
recorded an increase of 2.0% in goods production. Industrial development
can be characterised as stable with steady elements of recovery
due to the fact that, starting March this year, the volume of
daily industrial production in constant prices was generally higher
than that of previous year. Enterprises can be divided into two
groups according to production growth rate: enterprises with up
to 25 employees (mostly private) whose production in constant
prices was 23.2% higher against the same period last year, and
enterprises with 25 and more employees (accounting for approximately
89% of industrial production) whose production fell slightly (0.1%).
However, these enterprises also registered some trends of a steady
recovery, with growth in production during recent months compared
to the same period last year. A positive element in this development
was the fact that enterprises with more than 25 employees - where
the total volume of goods production in constant prices (99.9%)
and total sales in comparable prices (100%) were the same as last
year - recorded an increase in exports by 4.6% in comparable prices
confirming the competitiveness of domestic products in foreign
markets. Exports for the nine months accounted for 25.9% of the
total sales of industrial production in constant prices, 24.8%
a year ago.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="N3"></A>3) Construction output in constant prices rose
by 6.0% over nine months this year. The total growth in construction
output was particularly accounted for by small firms with up to
25 employees which recorded a total increase of 15.0%, while large
firms with 25 and more employees (making up approximately 78.5%
of the total output) increased by 3.7%.<A NAME="N4"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
4) According to preliminary CSO data, retail trade in constant
prices rose by 5.9% as of 30 September 1994 compared to the same
period last year. The share of imports of consumer goods in overall
retail sales was roughly 17% as of the end of Q3.<A NAME="N5">
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
5) In agricultural production, the decline of the previous years
continued. According to data on the sales of livestock products
from primary agricultural production, the decline in livestock
production is estimated to be 9 - 11% as of 30 September. Preliminary
data on vegetable production shows significant differences from
last year.<A NAME="N6"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
6) The share of the non-state sector in GDP formation increased
from 57.7% in Q2 to 62.0% in Q3. In industry, the non-state sector
accounted for 57% of goods production, in construction for 90.2%
of construction work, in trade for 87.5% of retail sales, in services
for 90% of revenues and in agriculture for 84.5% of gross production
(industry's share includes also a material component).<A NAME="N7">
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
7) According to statistical data, the structure of GDP expenditure
in constant prices experienced positive changes, i.e. an increased
share of household consumption and fixed capital of the gross
domestic product, see the following table. In contrast, the exports
share of GDP declined.<A NAME="N8"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
8) Household consumption increased by roughly 9% in constant prices.
This figure is based on the development in the balance of household
monetary incomes and expenditures where total monetary incomes
grew by 21.6% against the same period last year, due mostly to
a 20.4% rise in wage incomes. The increase in total monetary expenditures
by households is estimated at 18.5%, of which 15.8% on goods and
services.<A NAME="N9"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
9) Public consumption (Government consumption) fell by roughly
8.2%. This decline can be considered the result of a prudent budgetary
policy. It followed, however, also from a limited ability to compare
the year-to-year data (e.g. health service privatisation). State
budget expenditures in the public sector area were directed primarily
towards education, defence, security and health service.<A NAME="N10">
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
10) Investment demand (measured by the volume of work and deliveries)
increased by 4.1% as of 30 September 1994. The largest growth
in the volume of investments by sectors in the first nine months
of 1994 occurred in the sector of banks and savings banks (11.6%),
non-financial entrepreneurial sector (9.4%), and a smaller increase
was registered in the household sector (3.1%). In contrast to
this, the Government sector experienced a decline of 13.4%. According
to data on the 1st half of the year, in terms of volume most investments
were made in the non-financial entrepreneurial sector (61.3%),
the largest part being directed to the manufacturing industry.
As for the structure of financial resources for acquiring investments,
the non-financial entrepreneurial sector used predominantly its
own financial means (65.6%) and credits (24.2%).<A NAME="N11">
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
11) Foreign demand grew by 1.7% in current prices, the fastest
increase registered in exports to EFTA and the EU. Exports to
EFTA member-states increased primarily due to a high growth in
exports to Switzerland and Finland. In contrast, exports decreased
to Slovakia, developing countries and countries with a state trade
system. Moderate growth was registered in exports to states of
the former USSR. In the structure of exports by groups of goods,
the share increased of industrial consumer goods (by 1.9 percentage
points) and of fuels, materials and raw materials (by 1.0 percentage
point), while the share of machines and transportation means fell
by 1.7 percentage points and of foodstuffs by 1.2 percentage points.
Of total CR exports, 28.8% was directed to Germany, 15.5% to the
SR, 7.9% to Austria, 5.3% to Italy and 3.5% to Russia.<A NAME="N12">
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
12) Inflation, measured by the change in the consumer price index,
increased by 7.9% from the year-beginning to the end-September.
An increase of roughly 1.7% was due to changes in centrally regulated
prices, so that the average monthly growth in underlying inflation
was around 0.7%. The price increase was 10.5% compared to last
year; the annual moving average in index terms, 111.9%. The development
of inflation was affected primarily by a price increase of 11.2%
in foodstuffs (especially meat and meat products) and of 12.4%
in services (particularly due to price development in rents, heating,
water, sewerage, gas, electricity and bus transport). A more moderate
increase was registered in prices of non-food products (4.8%)
and catering (7.0%).<A NAME="N13"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
13) Industrial producer prices rose by 4.5% as of 30 September
compared to end-1993 (by 4.9% from the same period last year).
Agricultural producer prices jumped by 15.5% from the same period
last year, 16.9% for vegetable products and 14.6% for livestock
products; construction work prices grew by 11.5% and prices of
materials and products consumed in construction, by 5.8%.<A NAME="N14">
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
14) The growth in consumer prices entailed an increase in living
costs for households of employees, farmers and pensioners of 8.2%
, 6.8% and 9.8% respectively, compared to end-1993. Differences
between individual groups of households followed particularly
from different shares of expenditures on services and foodstuffs.
<A NAME="N15"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
15) In the first 9 months of 1994, compared to the same period
last year, average nominal wages increased in enterprises with
more than 25 employees by 14.9% in industry, 13.8% in construction,
14.2% in domestic trade and 15.3% in transport. This development
was in line with the main requirement of wage regulation (average
wages were allowed, without penalty, to increase by only 15.3%
- see the CR Government provision). In industry, growth of average
nominal wages (+14.9%) exceeded that of labour productivity (+10.6%),
while in construction the situation was different and respective
figures were 13.8% and 19.2%. All the above industries recorded
a moderate increase in real wages: 4.1% in industry, 3.1% in construction,
3.4% in domestic trade and 4.4% in transport.<A NAME="N16"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
16) The trends of previous months continued during Q3, reflecting
particularly changes in the size of organisations and the movement
of work activities to private business. Employment in organisations
with more than 25 employees continued to decline. In industry,
employment fell by approximately 5.3%, compared to the same period
last year.<A NAME="N17"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
17) Following January's increase in the number of registered unemployed
persons, the seasonal decrease in unemployment, recorded each
year, occurred again. In July, unemployment rose by approximately
5.1 thousand, fell in August by roughly 1.4 thousand and remained
at the same level in September. Compared to the year beginning,
unemployment decreased by approximately 21.3 thousand persons
and the total number of registered unemployed persons was 163.9
thousand as of 30 September, while the unemployment rate was 3.2%.
Since July, the labour market has been marked by stagnation of
the unemployment rate. In regional terms, some districts still
have a high unemployment rate. The number of vacancies was steadily
increasing throughout the year, but in September fell by roughly
4.9 thousand compared to the previous month. At present, labour
offices register about 82.2 thousand vacancies. Current developments
in registered unemployment are marked by a negative feature, i.e.
prolongation of the average time of unemployment, presently 5.3
months.<A NAME="N18"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
18) During Q3, the privatisation process (large-scale privatisation)
continued in all industries of the Czech economy. From the beginning
of privatisation to end-Q3 1994, 3,890 privatisation projects
representing assets worth CZK 898 bn were presented to the NPF
within the framework of the 1st and 2nd waves. As of 30 September,
privatisation of assets worth CZK 637 bn was completed. Of the
transformation methods, the most frequently used was that of converting
state-owned enterprises into joint stock companies through which
assets worth CZK 555.0 bn (87%) were privatised by the end of
Q3. This method was followed by direct sales worth CZK 90 bn,
public competitions worth CZK 14.0 bn, and public auctions worth
CZK 4.0 bn. The NPF effected free transfers of assets worth CZK
12.0 bn to cities and municipalities and restitutions accounted
for the same amount.<A NAME="N19"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
19) An assessment of financial performance was based on the latest
available CSO data, as of 30 June 1994, in current prices, for
non-financial organisations and enterprises with more than 25
employees. Pre-tax profit increased by 7.2% in Q2 1994, compared
to Q2 1993 (about 12% in the 1st half as a whole). Losses were
recorded in agriculture, transport and retail trade, but these
did not reach the levels of the 1st half of 1993. The insolvency
of organisations (measured by the indicator of overdue commitments)
slightly decreased in Q2 compared to Q1. In Q2 1994 overdue commitments
(CZK 132 bn) accounted for roughly 20.5% of total commitments
(21.7% in Q1); as of 30 June 1994, a decline was registered by
3.6% (by CZK 4.9 bn in absolute terms). Similar development was
seen with respect to overdue receivables.<A NAME="N20"></A>

<P>
20) Based on information acquired from individual organisations
(from CNB respondents) it can be said that the most significant
problems (restructuring, changes in production programmes and
in ownership) were solved during 1991-1993. Current changes are
predominantly focused on increasing economic profitability. Relations
between suppliers and customers are being gradually consolidated,
problems with the solvency of firms clarified and the economic
and financial positions of most organisations stabilised. Worse
economic results are due in some cases to excessive production
capacities (of equipment as well as labour), which cannot be utilised
because of insufficient domestic and foreign demand.

<P>
1) In the period January - September 1994, the CR balance of trade
(including Slovakia) showed a deficit of CZK 1.6 bn according
to the Czech Statistical Office. The main reason for this deficit
is a significant decline in exports to Slovakia and an increase
in imports from other countries.
<P>
The balance of trade in convertible currencies, including imports
under leasing arrangements according to IMF methodology, ran a
deficit of CZK 4.9 bn (USD 169.5 mil.); the balance of trade in
non-convertible currencies (government credit payments by means
of natural gas deliveries) registered a deficit of CZK 5.5 bn
(USD 190 mil.); the balance of trade with Slovakia recorded a
moderate deficit of CZK 0.6 bn (USD 23 mil.). According to CNB
calculations, the overall balance of trade of the Czech Republic
ran a deficit of CZK 11.0 bn (USD 381 mil.).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="N2"></A>2) Compared to the same period last year, trade
with Slovakia, the CR's second largest trading partner, fell by
CZK 13.6 bn. Exports dropped approximately by 25%, imports by
only 1%. This fall was due to several factors: a 15% exchange
rate difference on the new block, a 10% import surcharge, obligatory
provision of certificates for food imports, a restrictive monetary
policy directed at cutting the state budget deficit and reducing
demand in Slovakia.<A NAME="N3"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
3) Conversely, trade with other countries increased by 18%, of
which exports by 17% and imports by 20%. At the same time, larger
exports to these countries, generated by a moderate increase in
industrial production and continuing re-direction of former Czechoslovak
exports to other markets, offset the fall in trade with Slovakia.
In terms of turnover, the largest trading partners were Germany,
Austria, Russia and Italy.<A NAME="N4"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
4) An increase in terms of trade by 4.5 percentage points from
the same period last year was primarily the result of a 3.4% rise
in export prices of most export groups, particularly chemical
products, industrial and market products and machines. Import
prices fell by 0.6%, particularly for fuels (gas). The increase
in raw material prices in world markets was reflected in the raw
material price index HWWA, which is, due to its structure and
the number of items, a significant indicator of the average development
of world prices of raw materials. The HWWA index recorded an increase
in all three commodity groups (foodstuffs, raw materials, fuels)
from 138 points in September 1993 to 156 points in September 1994.
Czech import prices will be affected by this increase with a certain
delay.<A NAME="N5"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
5) The year-to-year increase in exports was accounted for mainly
by countries with advanced market economies whose share in Czech
exports had an upward trend. The greatest increase was recorded
in industrial products and market products classified by type
of material, i.e. the export structure inclined more strongly
towards higher value added exports.<A NAME="N6"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
6) These export results were aided by a relatively stable macroeconomic
environment, low labour costs and a pro-export foreign exchange
rate. In order to create conditions for Czech exporters similar
to those provided to their foreign competitors, Ceska exportni
banka, a.s. (Czech Export Bank) was established, which should,
after approval by Parliament, ensure the financing and insurance
of export credits. The network of Czech Centres Abroad, now being
founded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, should help to solve
the problem of providing information for Czech exporters. During
the year, another instrument was used to promote crediting of
Czech exporters under more advantageous conditions: the rediscount
by the CNB of export bills of exchange from commercial banks at
a discount rate.<A NAME="N7"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
7) Despite continuing growth in exports of raw materials, wood
in particular, it is obvious that the share of higher value added
products is increasing which is confirmed by a 40% growth in exports
of industrial products and an increase in the most important export
group of market products classified by type of material (glass
products and metal products). The export of engineering products
jumped by 8%. This, however, was not sufficient to maintain the
last year's share which dropped by two points. A negative effect
on exports could follow from anti-dumping procedures initiated
in April this year against cement exporters which have not yet
been completed.<A NAME="N8"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
8) An increase was recorded in all groups within the import commodity
structure, particularly in chemicals, foodstuffs and raw materials,
where a rise in import prices was also reflected. The volume of
imported fuels increased, the prices of natural gas fell and those
of oil grew moderately. A rise in imports of engineering products
indicates a strengthened trend toward demand for imports of new
technology which is extending outside the services sphere to some
manufacturing industries. A decrease in leasing imports was probably
effected by a temporary saturation of the market and a lower need
for imports.
<P>
Demand increased for imports of goods for personal consumption,
particularly foodstuffs, industrial products (clothing, footwear,
furniture), passenger cars, medical products and electrical appliances.
Their share of total imports rose by 2 points from the same period
last year, to 17%. Imports of consumer goods helped to enrich
the supply of goods, but in some cases it was to the detriment
of consumers and domestic firms, e.g. cheap, lower quality clothing
imported from Asian countries is displacing domestic clothing
from the market.

<P>
<A HREF="#MOPO9" >9) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE REMAINS UNCHANGED  
</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO1"></A>1) The basic aim of the CNB 1994 monetary
policy continues to be ensuring the internal and external stability
of the currency. Under 1994 conditions this means to keep the
inflation rate under 10% and maintain a stable exchange rate of
the Czech crown vis-a-vis freely convertible currencies as the
significant stabilising anchor of macroeconomic balance during
the transformation period. Monetary developments to date indicate
the accomplishment of these basic aims. Inflationary development
measured by the consumer price index amounted to 7.9% at the end
of September. The balance of payments development hitherto enables
continuation of the policy of a stable nominal exchange rate of
the Czech crown.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO2"></A>2) The 1994 CNB monetary policy is also founded
on the regulation of a basic monetary interim target - the money
supply as defined by the monetary aggregate M2. This year, estimates
of its growth are grounded on an anticipated slight increase in
the gross domestic product and an inflation rate under 10%. However,
money supply regulation is based only on indirect methods of management.
The methods of CNB monetary management include a stable foreign
exchange rate, CNB interest rates (discount and Lombard), minimum
reserves requirement, refinancing and open-market operations.
<P>
When evaluating the adequacy of the monetary development, the
CNB also considers supplementary monetary aggregates, especially
developments of credits, net foreign assets and net credit to
government. The overall developments of the economy and velocity
of money are significant criteria.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO3"></A>3) The monetary development in the monitored
period was especially influenced by a strong inflow of foreign
resources, which increased the liquidity of commercial banks and
their possibilities to issue credits. The CNB was forced to continue
to partially sterilise the free reserves in the banking system
in the interest of keeping the growth of the monetary aggregate
within the intentions of the CNB monetary programme. As in 1993,
sterilisation was carried out through the issue of CNB bills,
and through free-market operations with T-bills, NPF and CNB bills.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO4"></A>4) However, the growing inflow of foreign
resources continued to be accompanied by commercial banks' credit
activities driven by their shareholders' interests. This caused
the development of M2 to deviate from the monetary programme at
the close of the first six months. On the basis of an analysis
carried out, this development of the money supply, and especially,
fear for its continuation, appeared to be a possible spur to future
inflationary development. This led the CNB to change the amount
of minimum reserves requirement (MRR) for demand deposits from
9% to 12%, effective August 4, this year. The amount of minimum
reserves requirement for time deposits remained unchanged, i.e.
3%. This measure has drawn approximately CZK 10 bn from the banking
sector.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO5"></A>5) The Lombard rate was adjusted in the period
when money supply growth was slow. The rate was lowered from 11.5%
to 10.5% (effective April 8 this year) following stable price
development and the overall trend of interest rates on the money
market. The change in the Lombard rate was aimed at reducing the
difference between the two main rates, the discount and Lombard
rates.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO6"></A>6) In addition, further adjustments to the
monetary instruments were carried out to continue implementation
of CNB measures to gradually improve money market management.
Effective March 1 this year, the CNB shortened to 14 days the
cycle for maintaining the amount of minimum reserves requirement
in order to make them more even and indirectly reduce the fluctuation
of free reserves in the banking system and the volatility of interest
rates on the inter-bank deposit market. In June, a gradual increase
in the percentage of coverage by securities of drawn refinancing
credits was completed. This means that refinancing credits are
only extended against a 100% coverage by securities.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO7"></A>7) Development of short-term securities and
an increase in the volume of bond portfolios held by commercial
banks enabled restriction of CNB participation in this market.
The function of the CNB as a 100% guarantor of market liquidity
started to negatively affect the development of inter-bank trading
(pushing out other potential market makers) and make the CNB role
in influencing the liquidity of banks and interest rate levels
more difficult. With the aim to emphasise a systemic approach
towards liquidity management of the entire banking sector, in
accordance with decision-making criteria of the central bank,
the CNB role as a market maker on short-term securities was gradually
terminated starting August 18 this year. Quotation of the purchase
price was cancelled first, and then quotation of the sale price.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO8"></A>8) At the same time, a system of daily management
of banking sector liquidity was gradually implemented through
free-market operations based on the daily prediction of the supply
of reserves, and by a comparison of this prediction with the final
demand for reserves. The CNB decision whether to intervene is
based on strict systemic criteria - the banking system is assessed
as a whole, i.e. a deficit (or surplus) of reserves of an individual
bank provides no reason for supplementing (or withdrawing) liquidity,
provided the system as a whole is balanced. Daily operations are
aimed at enabling banks to even out the levels of their free reserves
so as to prevent large day-to-day fluctuations in the banks' liquidity.
The reduction of interest rates volatility on the money market,
CNB operations being consistent and transparent, is a further
target which is no less important.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="MOPO9"></A>9) Despite the fact the favourable price development
and ongoing inflow of foreign resources generate some expectations
of revaluation with the public, the CNB continues to maintain
the exchange rate of the Czech crown vis-a-vis freely convertible
currencies. The equilibrium of the balance of payments current
account is a basic starting point for a policy of maintaining
a stable nominal exchange rate of the Czech crown against freely
convertible currencies. The development of the capital account
is creating favourable preconditions for the liberalisation of
capital flows. February's relaxation of the obligation for foreign
exchange residents - juridical entities and entrepreneurs to offer
foreign exchange means was one of the gradual steps taken to expand
Czech crown convertibility. This measure liberalised entrepreneurs'
possibilities to establish foreign exchange accounts and led to
the expansion of commercial banks' services so as to hedge against
exchange rate risks.

<H1><A NAME="BEGIN"></A>DEVELOPMENT OF MONETARY AGGREGATES</H1>
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="#DE1" >1) Money supply growth continues to be significantly influenced by foreign resources inflow  
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#DE2" >2) M2 increased in 9 months by 9.8%  </A>
<P>
<A HREF="#DE3" >3) CNB provisions contribute to slow down M2 growth  
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#DE4" >4) M1 increased in nine months by 5.0%  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="DE1"></A>1) This year's development of the monetary aggregate
M2 is similar to that of a year ago, with the exception of Q1
when a slight increase was recorded in contrast to a decline last
year. The differences in money supply development in Q1 1994 and
Q1 1993 can be attributed to transformation shocks at the beginning
of 1993 (the implementation of a new tax system, the CRs
independence following the split of the CSFR, the currency separation),
requiring a restrictive character of the monetary policy during
this period.
<P>
A rapid increase in M2 started in Q1, caused by the continuing
strong inflow of foreign resources and growing domestic credit
issue. M2 increased by 6.7% at the end of the first half (the
year-to-year increase reached its highest level in March totalling
25.3%), thus signalling a deviation from the monetary programme.
The CNB responded to this development by taking measures to dampen
money supply growth.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="DE2"></A>2) In Q3 this year M2 growth gradually slowed
down. Its increase totalled 9.8% at the end of September in contrast
to the close-1993, the year-to- year increase amounting to 21.2%.
Over the entire period, the year-to-year increases fluctuated
above 20%.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="DE3"></A>3) Compared to the first half of this year,
Q3 development can be assessed as positive. The development in
the area of domestic credit issue is probably a result of CNB
measures taken to slacken the pace of money supply growth (i.e.
the increase in minimum reserves requirement, strengthening the
sterilisation of resources inflow to the banking system, etc.).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="DE4"></A>4) The pace of growth of the monetary aggregate
M1 continues to be slower than M2.
<P>
The development of particular money components provides evidence
of a rapid increase in currency in circulation (over 9 months
by 31.6%), time deposits (by 16.9%), moderate growth in foreign
currency deposits (by 2.1%) and stagnation of demand deposits
(a decline of 0.3%).
<P>
The development of currency in circulation is still partially
affected by the currency separation, however, it reflects particularly
an increase in cash payments to hedge against insolvency between
enterprises.
<P>
The growth in time deposits is connected to the creation of longer-term
financial reserves (especially by households) and the advantage
of time deposits' interest rates (this goes for both households
and enterprises). The development of household deposits also indicates
the growing income and property differentiation of households,
which may result in an increase in their share of large deposits
(time deposits being more advantageous) and in a decline in the
share of small deposits of total deposits.
<P>
Time deposits of enterprises are dominated by deposits up to one
year, which serve as operational reserves in case of an advantageous
financial or real investment. These deposits are stimulated by
the difference in interest rates on time and demand deposits (this
explains at the same time the development of demand deposits).
<P>
A slight increase (of CZK 2.8 bn) in foreign currency deposits
is the result of their growth in the enterprise sphere, while
households recorded a fall of CZK 1.6 bn. This provides evidence
of household confidence in the stable crown and confirms the orientation
towards the more advantageous interest rate on crown deposits.
The growth in foreign currency deposits by enterprises is a further
result of expanding the convertibility of the Czech crown (liberalising
the possibilities for entrepreneurs to establish foreign exchange
accounts).

<A NAME="CR1"></A>1) The total issue of domestic credits is affected
by a key item, i.e. credits to the enterprise sphere and households
which increased to CZK 78.5 bn during the period under review.
The total growth in domestic credits amounted to CZK 61.4 bn (+
8.6%), government indebtedness to the banking sector declining
by CZK 23.2 bn, and the NPF net position by CZK 6.1 bn.
<P>
Comparison of the same periods of 1994 and 1993 shows a difference
only in the NPF net position, when, in contrast to the growth
in 1993, its surplus declined this year. A lower increase in enterprise
indebtedness in 1994 affected the increased inflow of resources
from abroad.

are primarily motivated to draw credits abroad by the better availability,
particularly of long-term loans, lower interest and the poorly
developed capital market (more detailed information in the section
Balance of Payments).
<P>
<A HREF="#CR" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="CR3"></A>3) In a developing capital market, the issuance
of enterprise bonds will become a more and more significant form
of acquiring means for financing the entrepreneurial sector. At
present, it is not a serious competitor in the reallocation of
primary deposits. In January to September this year, the issue
of publicly tradable enterprise bonds amounted to CZK 7.8 bn (bonds
issued by banks and municipalities excluded) and publicly non-tradable
bonds amounted to CZK 2.1 bn. The volumes of individual issues
vary significantly, from several million to several billion crowns,
depending on the issuer.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="CR4"></A>4) Ongoing changes in ownership relations in
the economy, along with private sector support, continue to determine
the structure of credit recipients. The share of credits extended
to the private sector in total crown deposits , increased by 4.3
percentage points to a total of 56.8% over nine months. Private
non-financial institutions in particular rank among the most significant
recipients.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="CR5"></A>5) Changes in the allocation of credits to specific
industries have been influenced by the ongoing economic restructuring,
the development of the private sector, the sales and financial
situation of firms and, all the more significantly, by the development
of alternative forms of financing (credits drawn abroad, obtaining
financial means through bond issues). In the first nine months,
credits increased most rapidly in trade, sales, restaurants and
accommodation (by 18.0%), transport, storage, tourism and telecommunications
(by 16.9%), construction and building industries (by 11.4%), the
processing industry (by 8.9%). In the processing industry the
highest increase was recorded by the food industry (23.3%). A
decline of credits occurred in agriculture, hunting and fishing
(by 9.5%), mining of raw materials (by 1.7%), production and delivery
of electric power, gas and water and in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries (by 2.4%).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="CR6"></A>6) Credits to privatisation play a significant
role in property transformation, especially in small-scale privatisation.
The development of their structure affects the termination of
small-scale privatisation and the continuation of large-scale
privatisation. Given the restricted possibilities for long-term
resources needed for large-scale privatisation, participation
of banks in large-scale privatisation is weaker (in terms of property
privatised) than was the case in small-scale privatisation. The
shift of privatisation processes to large-scale privatisation
is reflected by the growing portion of long-term credits (by 17.8
percentage points in nine months) and the decline in medium-term
(by 17.7 percentage points) and short-term (by 0.1 percentage
point) credits of the total credits to privatisation. The share
of long-term credits amounts to half of all privatisation credits,
exceeding medium-term credits by the end of Q3.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="CR7"></A>7) Short-term credits prevail in the time structure
of credits to the enterprise sector. From a long term point of
view, there is a marked tendency to reduce the share of long-term
credits in favour of short and medium-term credits. This can be
attributed to a higher increase in short-term credits, which is
documented also by newly extended credits, where short-term credits
dominate (of the total increase in newly granted credits over
nine months this year, 3/4 were short-term credits). This is due
to an accumulation of factors by both enterprises and banks (the
limited long-term resources of banks and their precaution with
regard to further potential risky credits, the quality of projects
presented when applying for a credit, the unclear future of enterprises,
the level of management etc.).<A NAME="CR8"></A>
<P>
Due to problems of some banks at the year-beginning, increased
attention was paid to the quality of some commercial banks' portfolios,
particularly to the volume of risky credits. This problem relates
to both the state and private sectors. Besides the fact that this
partially involves leftovers from the past economic system, the
growth of risky credits is also connected to the lack of experience
of newly established banks and the formation of a private sector.
In July this year, the CNB established principles of credit classification,
creation of reserves and provisions for these loans. The growth
of these risky credits accelerated following the implementation
of the new classification.
<P>
The volume of loans granted to households fell by CZK 2.5 bn,
compared to the end of 1993. The lower number of long-term loans,
a key item of loans extended to households, is causing the downward
trend (so called &quot;social loans&quot; granted by a savings
bank for flat construction were halted and the limit for loans
to newly married couples reduced to CZK 10 thousand).

</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B1"></A>1) The continuous growth in the balance of payments
surplus in convertible currencies is more and more affected by
the net foreign capital inflow, while growth in the current account
surplus is slowing. Credits directly drawn by Czech firms from
foreign subjects and portfolio investments hold the leading position
in the foreign capital inflow. Their growth is stimulated by the
improved assessment of the CR's investment and the relatively
high differential between domestic and foreign interest rates
with the foreign exchange rate of the Czech crown remaining stable.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B2"></A>2) The growing surplus of the service balance,
amounting to CZK 25.7 bn (USD 885 mil.) during the monitored period,
is the main source of the current account surplus of CZK 19.1
bn (USD 657 mil.) in the first nine months. Receipts from international
travel which exceeded expenditures by CZK 17.9 bn (USD 615 mil.)
make up the commanding share of this current account surplus.
The second largest source of receipts is transport with a surplus
of CZK 11.6 bn (USD 397).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B3"></A>3) While in the first half of the year the balance
of trade ran a surplus of CZK 1.9 bn, in Q3 it shifted to a deficit
of CZK 4.9 bn (USD 170 mil.). This change was reflected in a halt
to the growth of the current account surplus. The increasing income
balance deficit caused by interest payments on the expanding volume
of credits drawn abroad and the volume of yields from securities
remitted to foreign countries contributed to this situation.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B4"></A>4) The growth in the net foreign capital inflow
on the capital account continued also in Q3 amounting to CZK 33.1
bn (USD 1,139 mil.), an increase of CZK 10 bn. The gross capital
inflow totaled CZK 93.1 bn (an outflow of CZK 60.0 bn). Credits
drawn by Czech firms abroad and portfolio investments were the
most widely used forms of gross capital inflow. Of this inflow
92% comprises long-term resources, which can be assessed positively
from the point of view of the future performance of the Czech
economy.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B5"></A>5) The net capital inflow in the form of foreign
credits drawn by domestic firms reached CZK 26.5 bn (USD 911 mil.)
for the period January to September, of which roughly CZK 10 bn
in Q3. Most credits were drawn from Great Britain (38%), Austria
(24%), and Germany (14%) and were used mainly for investments
(39%), purchase and reconstruction of real estate (33%) and operational
costs (24%). The share of short-term credits up to one year is
negligible, most credits coming due in more than five years.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B6"></A>6) Portfolio investments in the period under
review amounted to CZK 21.8 bn (USD 750 mil.), representing 66%
of the net capital inflow. The balance of purchases and sales
of Czech securities by foreign investors comprises more than half
of this amount. At close-September foreign investors held securities
worth CZK 23.9 bn (65% shares, 19% enterprise bonds and 16% state
bonds). The largest number of securities is owned by investors
from Great Britain, USA and Germany. Most capital was invested
in energy, finance and state bonds. Only approximately 35% of
portfolio investments is motivated by the interest rate differential
between domestic and foreign interest rates. Portfolio investments
also include an issue of City of Prague bonds worth USD 250 mil.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B7"></A>7) The inflow of direct foreign investments to
the CR amounted to CZK 13.9 bn (USD 478 mil.) between January
to September this year, and stood at CZK 75.4 bn (USD 2.7 bn)
as of September 30, 1994. Compared to the same period last year,
this year's figures on capital inflow in the form of direct foreign
investments are moderately higher. Capital inflow for Q3 alone
representing USD 178 mil., show a slight increase in foreign investor
interest in this form of investment. The slow pace of direct foreign
investments in the CR is connected to increased demand for quality
in investment intentions and with the clarification of ownership
relations within the ongoing privatization process.
<P>
Investments this year were directed particularly towards the banking
and insurance systems, and construction and foodstuff industries.
In terms of the origin of the inflow of direct foreign investment,
the leading position is held by Germany followed by Austria, France,
USA and Great Britain. As of 30.09.94, no changes have taken place
in the overall ranking of the strongest investor countries, which
has remained virtually unchanged since 1992.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B8"></A>8) The volume of Czech direct investments abroad
(excluding the SR) totaled CZK 1.7 bn (USD 58 mil.) in the monitored
period, CZK 411 mil. more than in the comparable period in 1993.
Capital exports were predominantly directed towards the service
sphere, to the support of exports and ensuring imports. Investments
in production abroad have so far been minimal.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B9"></A>9) As a result of the overall favorable development
of the balance of payments in convertible currencies, IMF credits
worth USD 1.1 bn were paid ahead of schedule. The Czech Republic
thereby ceased being in a debtor position vis-a-vis the IMF. Of
official sources, the CNB has drawn only USD 8 mil. out of the
total EIB loan worth ECU 57 mil. provided to the CR, which is
to finance projects involving small and middle-sized enterprises.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B10"></A>10) CNB foreign exchange reserves have increased
by USD 1,545 mil. since the beginning of the year, thus totaling
USD 5,417 mil. as of 30.09.94 which could cover more than four
months of imports of goods and services in convertible currencies.
Since the foreign exchange reserves of commercial banks throughout
the period under review more or less stagnated, reserves of the
entire banking system rose by USD 1,559 mil. to USD 7,804 mil.

<H1>TRADE AND PAYMENT RELATIONS WITH THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC</H1>
<HR>

<P>
In the first nine months of 1994 the payment system between the
CR and the SR continued on the basis of the Agreement on Clearing
Payment System between the SR and the CR signed after the termination
of the monetary union in 1993. Pursuant to this agreement, the
settlement of mutual payments is conducted through two clearing
accounts, the so called &quot;old and new blocks&quot;, which
differentiate between payments belonging to operations executed
prior to the monetary union and after its termination. A proposal
for canceling the old block has been submitted, but this issue
has not yet been resolved.
<P>
This year, the development of the total deficit on mutual settlement
was marked by a transition from a surplus to a deficit balance
to the CR's disadvantage. At the beginning of this year the CR's
surplus on the new block rapidly increased, thus causing the SR
to once again exceed the limit of marginal credit by ECU 46.1
mil. (at the close-1993 this amounted to ECU 38.9 mil.). However,
the second decade in February was a turning point in the development
of the mutual settlement, when the new block surplus plummeted,
and the CR ran a deficit on this block from mid-May. Since July
the CR has been exceeding the marginal credit, in July by ECU
0.6 mil., in August by ECU 78 mil. and in September by ECU 79.1
mil.
<P>
Due to the fact that since April the volume of collections on
the old block from the SR has also decreased, the remaining amount
on this account did not more substantially affect the level of
the total clearing settlement balance. In the first nine months
the balance on both blocks, excluding payments for exceeding the
marginal credit, ran a deficit of CZK 12.6 bn.
<P>
The consequent trend and the result of the clearing settlement
were not only influenced by movements of payments for goods, but
also by capital transactions and payments for services. However,
the cause for the basic reverse in the mutual settlement must
be sought in the movements of goods which were affected by a number
of measures particularly on the Slovak side. They had to prevent
repeated exceeding of the marginal credit on the mutual clearing
accounts (by the imposition of an import surcharge of 10%, the
requirement of certificates for imported foodstuffs and through
the difference between the Czech and Slovak crowns exchange rates
on the new block).

</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B1"></A>1) The main targets of the medium-term fiscal
policy are the maintenance of a stable economic environment, the
gradual reduction of direct taxation of entrepreneurs and households,
a lowering of the share by budgetary expenditures of the gross
domestic product and stabilization of the public debt in absolute
terms. The 1994 public budgets are balanced. As in 1993, part
of the budgetary expenditures is financed through funds from the
National Property Fund (debt service, restitution, damage to financial
institutions' property).
<P>
The economic development hitherto and the results of the budgetary
performance for January to September this year indicate that governmental
intentions in the fiscal area will be met by the end of 1994.
From an assessment of the key items making up government indebtedness
to banks it follows that the net credit to the government is significantly
affected by the performance of state and municipal budgets.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B2"></A>2) Government indebtedness to the banking sector
(net credit to government excluding foreign loans) showed a downward
tendency throughout the entire period under review. According
to CNB data this decline amounted to CZK 23.2 bn against the starting
point (clearing excluded). This relatively high rate of decline
can be attributed to the accumulated effects of a number of factors,
the most important being:
<P>
- the surplus in the state budget current performance
<P>
- the City of Prague bond issue
<P>
- operations with state securities issued for debt service.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B3"></A>3) The growing surplus in the state budget current
performance amounting to CZK 13.8 bn at the close-September, was
a key factor in the decline in the government indebtedness.
<P>
The budgetary deficit is influenced by a lower drawing on budgetary
expenditures than incomes collected which roughly correspond to
the aliquot portion of the budgetary intention. The primary reason
lies with the seasonally lower fulfillment of expenditures (especially
investment and non-investment expenditures of budgetary organizations),
the intensity of which increases at the year end.
<P>
The fulfillment of budgetary revenues and expenditures has been
uneven throughout the year (particularly in the first half). While
fluctuations in the increase in total revenues are modified particularly
by the collection of tax incomes, the level of drawing on total
expenditures is partially fine-tuned according to the inflow of
budgetary means acquired through the General Reserve Chapter (the
main part of the expenditures is obligatory).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B4"></A>4) The total tax incomes by the end of September
were fulfilled only to 73.0% of the budgetary intention due to
a lower volume of VAT and tax on juridical entities' incomes.
The fulfillment of tax on natural entities' incomes has exceeded
the budgetary amount (fulfillment of 106.8%), as the state budget
collected the key item of this tax (interests on natural entities
for 1993) as early as January. The collection of consumer taxes,
customs duties and social security contributions is problem-free.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B5"></A>5) The most significant revenue item, value added
tax (VAT) accounting for 39.8% of the budget of all taxes, is
lagging behind the budgetary intention. This budgeted amount was
based on revenues realized in 1993, reflecting an assumed GDP
increase in 1994, and legislative changes made since January 1994.
The fall in the fulfillment of this important income item amounted
to approximately CZK 11 bn as of 30.09.94. This was due to various
factors, in particular to an increase in exports (raising a claim
for deduction), or possibly through a shift in the structure of
tax rates emphasizing lower rates (for foodstuffs, etc.). A further
problem consists in tax arrears and evasions existing despite
more frequent controls, the reduction of receipts occurring especially
in stall sales which are difficult to verify. Collection of VAT
in particular months is largely unequal, due to seasonal influences
caused by pre-Christmas purchases or holidays, the payment schedule
of advances and the deduction of incomes. These facts contribute
to fluctuations of budgetary revenues.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B6"></A>6) The fulfillment of income tax of juridical
entities, where a relative fall at the close-September amounts
to approximately CZK 4 bn, is lagging behind the budgetary intention.
The high insolvency of enterprises and the slowing down in the
pace of privatization are considered the most significant causes.
Another negative factor is the actual postponement of tax obligation
for taxpayers (unrepeated creation of a fund of provisions for
several future years, an accelerated method of write-offs, etc.).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B7"></A>7) The drawing on total budgetary expenditures
(clearing excluded) has had a seasonal nature since August, manifested
in the traditional acceleration of the fulfillment of most items
during the final part of the year (additionally, approximately
20% of the total expenditures should be drawn for the past two
months). The fall hitherto in drawing on these expenditures against
the nine month aliquot portion is approximately CZK 16.5 bn.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B8"></A>8) The table illustrates a lower drawing on current
and capital expenditures against the nine month aliquot, caused
by the seasonal development of basic expenditure items. An overall
fulfillment of non-investments expenditures was reached with differing
levels of drawing on specific budgetary items. According to needs
proven by municipalities the state budget provided at the close-September
100% subsidies to municipal budgets. Drawings on subsidies for
heat, and contributions to subsidized organizations exceed the
aliquot portion (the effect of financial means granted to vocational
schools). Financial means earmarked for investments are purposely
directed towards the transport infrastructure, school system,
health services and ecology. Their fulfillment has a seasonal
nature and the financial means are usually additionally drawn
as late as at the year end (depending on invoicing).
<P>
One of the basic strategic targets of the fiscal policy emphasizing
a restriction of the state commitment to a market economy is the
gradual reduction of the share of budgetary expenditures of GDP.
In 1994, a decline of approximately 1.1 percentage point in the
share of public budgets is expected. The share of state budget
expenditures of GDP is illustrated by the graph on the previous
page.

</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B1"></A>1) Money market developments during the first
nine months of this year were affected mainly by the following
factors:
<P>
- a lasting increase in the inflow of foreign capital
<P>
- continuing overall high demand for loans by commercial banks
clients
<P>
- lasting uneven allocation of depository resources in the banking
system (major commercial banks are the dominant holders of the
non-banking sector's primary deposits).
<P>
- further measures by the CNB and commercial banks directed towards
ensuring more effective management of liquidity in the banking
sector and thus on the money market.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B2"></A>2) With regard to the monetary impacts and demands
on routine management of monetary development, the growing inflow
of foreign capital can be considered the key item in the list
of basic factors given above. The increase in foreign capital
inflow and its influence on the liquidity of commercial banks
is indirectly confirmed by higher sales volume in forex fixing
where monthly purchases of foreign exchange means ranged from
CZK 8 to 9 bn. 
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B3"></A>3) This trend in foreign fund inflow was one
of the main factors in the increase in trading volume on the money
market and the subsequent shift in the focus of trades on money
market into the area of transactions among commercial banks. A
lower quantity of refinancing of commercial banks by the CNB,
given the sufficient liquidity in the banking sector, contributed
to this movement. The most active banks on the money market were
thus major commercial banks with the greatest increase in foreign
exchange resources and domestic primary deposits.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B4"></A>4) In the interest of maintaining the development
of monetary aggregate M2 within the set limits under the given
conditions, the CNB had to continue to sterilise the increased
inflow of foreign resources throughout the entire period under
review. As in the previous year, the sterilisation of free liquidity
was carried out through the issue of CNB bills, T-bills (SPP)
and free market operations with these securities. The issue of
these securities proceeded under the joint issue programme of
the Ministry of Finance, the Czech National Bank and the National
Property Fund. 
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B5"></A>5) In line with this schedule, issues of T-bills
were gradually increased by CZK 5 bn in Q1, by CZK 2 bn in Q2
and CZK 1 bn in Q3, so that at the close-September they amounted
to CZK 31 bn. This growth trend in the volume of CNB bills issued
was faster, given the increasing foreign resources inflow. In
Q1, the increase in their volume reached CZK 22 bn; in Q2 issues
increased by another CZK 15 bn and in Q3 by a further CZK 10 bn,
thus totalling CZK 85 bn. However, on the other hand, this growing
amount of CNB bills, with the aim indicated above, negatively
influenced the CNB costs and the result of its overall performance.
The volume of NPF bills issued remained stable, CZK 16 bn. The
total increase in short-term securities in circulation thus amounted
to CZK 55 bn.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B6"></A>6) Interest rates attained in auctions of these
short-term securities, due to their minimal risk, ranged generally
below the discount rate with a moderate downward trend in the
first half, and a slight increase since July. This trend reflected
the overall development of liquidity and interest rates on the
inter-bank deposit market. Interest rates on T-bills with maturity
of up to one month ranged from 6.52 to 5.53%, for one-month bills
from 8.20 to 7.40%. The difference in interest rates is due to
SPP exemption from taxation.
<P>
In 1994, free market operations with these securities act as a
basic instrument for the management of banking system liquidity,
and are used to intervene in the development of interest rates
on the inter-bank money market. The CNB uses several instruments
for free market operations. They are as follows:
<P>
- the outright purchase and sale of securities were used in larger
volumes and more frequently up to mid-August this year. The CNB
in this period functioned as a market maker on the short-term
securities market. It continuously announced prices for the purchase
and sale of T-bills, CNB and NPF bills. This CNB role ensured
100% liquidity of the above mentioned instruments and positively
contributed to money market development, supported holdings of
these instruments by banks and enabled banks to observe the set
level of MRR as precisely as possible.
<P>
- both-sided repo operations. They were, throughout the entire
monitored period, used in the form of tenders and individual operations,
and gradually assumed the role of the main instrument of liquidity
management through free market operations. In the first half of
this year, the percentage increased of financing the auction credit
through short-term securities, and since June liquidity has been
fully provided through repo-operations. The maturity of repo-tenders
was from one to seven days, while individual repo maturity was
mostly one day.
<P>
The cancellation of the quotation of purchase prices eliminated
an automatic source of drawing liquidity from the CNB according
to the needs of individual banks, and was replaced by a system
of regular repo-operations, or reverse repo-tenders with maturity
of 3 to 4 days. These operations are supplemented by overnight
repo operations in order to fine-tune fluctuations in the development
of banks reserves and interest rates on the inter-bank market.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B7"></A>7) Refinancing credits were extended almost exclusively
in the form of re-discounted trade bills. The volume of refinancing
credit provided in this form showed only a very moderate growth
trend, although it was provided at a discount (average amounts
in various months ranged from CZK 5.3 bn to CZK 6.9 bn). The cause
can be seen particularly in CNB monetary intentions (stricter
conditions of bill trades and the introduction of contingents
for banks with a large volume of these credits) and partially
in the level of interest rates on the interbank deposit market.

<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B8"></A>8) Refinancing has also taken place, albeit to
a very small extent so far, in the form of discounted export bills
(CZK 0.7 bn as of 30.09.94). Auction refinancing credits were
provided only for a very short time in January in the form of
an overnight credit to address a structural insufficiency of funds
of a very small groups of banks (CZK 0.1 bn to CZK 3 bn at an
interest rate of 9.0 - 9.75%). Likewise, the possibility of drawing
Lombard credit was virtually unused. Only in three cases did the
CNB provide the so called &quot;last resort credit&quot;. This
involved commercial banks facing liquidity problems. 
<P>
The problems which arose in the functioning of three commercial
banks and the inflow of foreign funds to the benefit of major
banks further strengthened these major banks' position on the
interbank deposit market (MDT) as a dominant creditors subject
with respect to small commercial banks. With respect to interest
rate development, however, this factor was not significant, as
the factor of liquidity growth due to increasing foreign resources
regulated by CNB operations on this market acted here at the same
time.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B9"></A>9) The resulting trend of interest rates on the
inter-bank deposit market moved generally downward until June.
In contrast, since July, interest rates have been gradually increasing,
due, among other things, to the withdrawal of CZK 10 bn from the
banking sector through an MRR increase and the CNB more intensive
effort to sterilise capital inflow through market operations.
This development is illustrated in the graph of interest rate
development on the interbank deposit market on page 40 of this
report. 
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B10"></A>10) While interest rates with longer maturity
showed no significant fluctuations, with respect to short-term
interest rates the graph indicates greater volatility throughout
the entire period under review. The cause can be seen not only
in the nature and use of shorter-term funds, but also in the reduction
of the time period for balancing the minimum reserves requirement
to 14 days.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B11"></A>11) The development of interest rates on the
interbank deposit market and growing competition from foreign
banks on the domestic market, manifested in increased credit issue
at lower interest rates were also main factors influencing the
falling trend of interest rates on newly granted credits. While
the average interest rate on newly granted credits was 14.6% in
December 1993, it fell to 12.4% by June and in September again
slightly increased to 13.4%.

</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#B8" >8) Most trades are carried out outside official markets
</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B1"></A>1) In the Czech Republic two organisers of the
securities market exist: the Prague Stock Exchange (an automated
trade system and direct trades) and the RM-System (running and
periodical auctions). In addition, securities can be transferred
directly over the counter at the Securities Centre (SCP). These
markets differ in many ways: by the method and speed of settlement,
price setting, liquidity, costs, price levels and market breadth.
<P>
From the beginning of 1994, the capital market can be characterised,
until the beginning of February, as a market with an unambiguously
upward tendency (bull market). This was followed by a period of
stabilisation, and since the end of February and beginning of
March the market has been declining. The bottom was reached approximately
in the first half of June when a short recovery began, unaccompanied,
however, by a desired rise in liquidity. The price level remained
virtually unchanged until the close-September and only some prices
of individual securities fluctuated.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B2"></A>2) The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) has gradually
accelerated its trading frequency. In virtually one year it switched
from trading once a week to daily trading starting September 19,
1994. At the same time, the maximum price margin allowed was reduced
from +-10% to +-5%. More frequent trading, however, does not mean
that the system of settling transactions on the stock exchange
(T+3) has shortened. 
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B3"></A>3) On the stock market, the trend from the close
of last year continued until the beginning of March when prices
and volumes of trades significantly rose under the influence of
foreign demand. The CNB-120 Index, by which the central bank monitors
developments at the PSE, reached its maximum value of 1394 (the
index base of 1000 refers to values on December 16, 1993). At
that time it had already become apparent that the prices of many
shares were overvalued. The market turned around and fell at virtually
the same pace. However, the breadth of the market (number of issues
traded) did increase, but trading volumes fell sharply. The steep
fall in prices came to a halt at the beginning of June. The summer
months can be marked as a period of fluctuating rates in individual
sessions, the price levels remaining stagnant. The total capitalisation
of the share market reached CZK 395 bn as of 30.09.94.
<P>
Since August shares of funds have started to be very active. Prices
of many of these rose by the permitted maximum 10% in several
sessions in relatively good volumes. Nevertheless, most stock
exchange indexes stagnated, because important segments in the
composition of all the indexes belong to CEZ and banks, and these
recorded virtually no price movements.
<P>
On the advanced capital markets the so called &quot;discount&quot;
(difference between the market price of a fund share and the value
of property represented by this share) ranges from 10 to 20%.
However, in the case of fund shares traded on official markets
in the CR, the discount rate ranged from 50 to 80%, i.e. prices
were strongly undervalued. In outright trades they were virtually
untraded, since, due to scattered ownership, it is very difficult
to obtain a large package of these securities all at once.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B4"></A>4) The fall in total trades was manifested primarily
in low volumes of direct transactions. In an effort to change
this unfavourable situation, the PSE took several measures. The
original 10% margin of the final price of all securities in the
automated system was expanded first to +-20% and later to +-25%.
The minimum volume limit for a single transaction was lowered
to CZK 0.5 mil. for unquoted securities and CZK 1 mil. for quoted
securities. These measures however, were more noticeably felt
as late as September when trading was expanded to 5 days a week.

<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B5"></A>5) Due to the falling trend on the share market,
investors focused their attention on securities with fixed interest
rates, i.e. bonds. Following a relatively lengthy period in which
these securities were traded only in symbolic quantities, bonds
gained greater recognition. The credit for this goes mainly to
outright trades of quoted bonds (state bonds, CEZ and KB bonds).
However, an increased interest in debt securities also failed
to halt the overall decline in trades. 
<P>
Newly issued bonds carried an interest ranging from 2 to 3% above
the inflation rate expected in 1994. However, the market absorbed
the primary issues of these securities at prices above their nominal
value - explainable by the expectations of institutional investors
of a still lower inflationary rate (and therefore lower interests
on banking deposits).
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B6"></A>6) Several significant changes took place in
the RM-System in 1994. The periodic auction was shortened to 14-day
cycles, and since February 2 of this year transactions can be
made in the so called RM-S running auction. These auctions differ
from each other in the frequency they take place and also in the
method of price setting (periodical auction - fixing, running
auction - continuous trading).
<P>
The running auction has gradually begun to take over the role
of the periodical auction. Since September 1 this year, trading
in this auction has taken place five days a week. At the same
time, a new index for RM-S running auctions, the Index PK 30 has
been announced. The date of May 3, with a value of 1000 points
was established as the baseline. The main reason for its creation
was the fact that a periodical auction gradually loses its meaning
and its index, the RM-S 100, is not very precise. The fact that
trading in the running auction takes place in real time, i.e.
settlement takes place the same day, is very important for investors.
The RM-System also offers an interesting possibility of submitting
combined orders for both auctions.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B7"></A>7) The dependence of the Czech capital market
on foreign markets is clearly evidenced here. The fall in trades
and prices which hit most foreign stock exchanges took place at
the PSE as well. Besides the decline in foreign demand other facts
have also contributed to lower market liquidity. They were as
follows: the need to mobilise almost CZK 15 bn for the subscription
of new shares of banks and some enterprises, the ongoing second
wave of voucher privatisation, and above all, the possibility
of transferring securities directly at the Securities Centre counters.

<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B8"></A>8) According to some indications about 80% of
all trades are settled at the SCP where transactions are settled
the same day and trades thereby avoid the possibility of a delay
and the higher risk of a securities transfer through the stock
exchange and its register. The high percentage of trades carried
on outside official markets makes the Czech capital market largely
non-transparent, which is an unfavourable sign for potential foreign
investors.

<H1><A NAME="BEGIN"></A>THE INTER-BANK FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET
</H1>
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="#B1" >1) MDT rules in effect since 1992</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#B2" >2) Entrepreneuring subjects may establish foreign exchange accounts
</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#B3" >3) Wide range of use of means in foreign exchange accounts 
</A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B1"></A>1) Besides the central bank, foreign exchange
financial institutions also participate in the inter-bank foreign
exchange market (MDT). Their number remained unchanged during
the monitored period, i.e. 35 foreign exchange banks were registered
as of September 30.
<P>
The basic instrument on the MDT is the so called CNB &quot;fixing&quot;,
introduced in Q3 1992. The foreign exchange fixing rate is announced
daily on the basis of movements between the currencies included
in the currency basket; this rate may deviate within the range
of +- 0.5%. Since May 3, 1993, the currency basket has consisted
of the two currencies with the greatest share of the Czech Republic's
foreign trade: 65% DEM and 35% USD. Banks can even out their foreign
exchange position through the purchase or sale of foreign exchange
means at fixing or through mutual trades at the market rate.
<P>
In the area of regulating foreign exchange positions, the CNB
uses the principle of limiting the short crown position, i.e.
the limit of the amount of assets vis-a-vis liabilities. This
limit was introduced in Q2 1993 with the aim of restricting speculations
by commercial banks and having at its disposal an instrument regulating
the foreign exchange position of foreign banks' branch offices.
<P>
Most trades on the MDT are carried out mutually between banks.
Trades within the framework of foreign exchange fixing thus serve
only to even out open foreign exchange positions, whose purpose
is to maintain the foreign exchange liquidity of commercial banks.
The positive balance of purchases and sales in foreign exchange
fixing reflects the inflow of resources from abroad, primarily
on the capital account. On the MDT, predominantly spot, forward
and swap operations are executed. Lately, option operations have
also started to be used.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B2"></A>2) In accordance with the process of extending
the Czech crown's convertibility, the foreign exchange offer obligation
for foreign exchange residents- juridical entities and entrepreneurs
was eased in February. This measure significantly liberalises
the possibility for entrepreneurs to establish foreign exchange
accounts, but also brings a certain degree of risk. For this reason,
banks are beginning to offer various types of new operations to
hedge against exchange risk: prompt, time, swap and option operations.
<P>
These possibilities provided by this liberalisation were utilised
by virtually all types of entrepreneurial subjects without exception.
By the end of September enterprise deposits on foreign exchange
accounts rose by approximately CZK 3 bn.
<P>
<A HREF="#BEGIN" >Back to Contents  </A><HR>

<P>
<A NAME="B3"></A>3) All foreign exchange means accepted from foreign
exchange non-residents with the exception of receipts from exchange
office activities, i.e. collections on exports of goods, services,
capital receipts, etc. may be transferred to foreign exchange
accounts. Foreign exchange means from these accounts can be used
for the same purposes from which foreign exchange receipts derive.
At the same time, they can be used to finance expenses connected
with business trips abroad, to transfer gifts and inheritance
and to trade with foreign exchange banks. Under the new rules,
account holders may also remit payments due to other foreign exchange
residents; however, the recipient will receive the equivalent
in crowns of the amount paid in foreign currency.

1) During 1994, the increase in the number of banks in the Czech
Republic continued to slow considerably. The number of banks which
had obtained a license to operate as a bank or as a foreign bank
branch reached 58 by 30 September 1994. As a consequence of certain
problems in the banking sector, evaluation of new applications
for banking licenses has become significantly stricter and for
that reason only two building and loan associations were permitted.
Of the total number of 58 banks, one was under conservatorship
(Kreditni a prumyslova banka) and one undergoing liquidation (Banka
Bohemia).
<P>
Structure of the banking sector as of 30 September 1994
<P>
. 16 commercial banks without foreign participation
<P>
. 14 commercial banks with partial foreign participation
<P>
. 11 commercial banks with 100% foreign participation
<P>
. 10 foreign bank branches
<P>
. 6 building and loan associations with partial foreign participation
<P>
. 1 state-owned financial institution (Konsolidacni banka)
<P>
2) Developments in the banking sector as a whole are influenced
primarily by the activities of major banks (Ceska sporitelna,
Komercni banka, Investicni a Postovni banka, Ceskoslovenska obchodni
banka and Agrobanka). These banks hold a share of about 80% in
most basic indicators and more than 90% in reserves and reserve
funds. However, the share of foreign banks and foreign bank branches
is increasing because their wider activities are being affected
by the positive evaluation of economic development in the Czech
Republic. 
<P>
3) During 1994 to date, certain trends have appeared towards a
change in the structure of banks' asset and liability trading.
In spite of the fact that credit and deposit activities and inter-bank
deposits predominate in bank activities, a certain trend towards
investment banking (trading in securities on own account) can
be seen, the volume of highly liquid assets is strengthening (T-bills,
CNB bills and NPF bills) and banks can also offer operations securing
rate risks.
<P>
In the area of liability operations, a marked orientation toward
strengthening of primary deposit volumes in banks' structure of
resources is apparent, especially for small banks, in connection
with certain difficulties in obtaining funds on the inter-bank
market. In comparison with previous years, the share of refinancing
resources from the CNB has decreased considerably as a consequence
of principal changes in providing such resources. Gradually, some
banks are attempting to acquire additional resources to cover
their asset operations by issuing their own bonds.
<P>
4) Due to last year's stricter licensing conditions, banks are
gradually increasing their basic capital. A significant increase
in banks' capital had already occurred during 1993. In the monitored
period, underwritten capital and paid-up capital increased by
another 19.5% and 17.2% respectively, major banks being quicker
in repaying the basic capital. The total share of paid-up capital
accounted for 96% of the underwritten capital, which means that
in comparison with previous years, the level of paid-up capital
increased.
<P>
5) Given the relatively low quality of credit portfolios, most
banks concentrate on increasing their reserves to cover possible
losses. As of 30 September 1994, reserves earmarked to cover losses
on credits increased by 36%. The most dynamic growth (more than
double) was recorded by small banks; but this increase is from
a lower base. The volume of reserve funds dropped by CZK 6.9 bn,
primarily due to CSOBs coverage of some loss items, while
for other banks this type of reserves continued to rise. 
<P>
6) Risky credits are the greatest current problem of commercial
banks, especially small ones. Since they have not yet been classified
in a standardised fashion, the CNB has adopted a provision to
institute principles of credit classification and creation of
reserves and provisions for these credits. Under this provision,
the extended credits are grouped into five categories according
to the degree of depreciation: standard, watched, non-standard,
doubtful and loss.
<P>
7) In connection with this provision, the volume of classified
credits increased more than threefold compared to the year-beginning
and reached CZK 289 bn as of the end of September; classified
credits thus represented 35.7% of the total amount of granted
credits. The possible loss amount reflecting the degree of risk
for individual credits was CZK 167 bn (20.7% of the total amount).
<P>
About 50% of possible losses are covered by reserves and provisions;
when reserve funds are included, the coverage amounts to 80%.
This calculation, however, does not take into account possible
high-quality securing of receivables which can, to a certain extent,
decrease the amount of possible losses. The issue of risky credits
applies primarily to small banks, while in foreign banks, risky
credits virtually do not occur.
<P>
8) Conservatorship has continued in Kreditni a prumyslova
banka, imposed in September 1993 due to the fact that this bank
was unable to meet its commitments. A bankruptcy petition has
been filed, the protection period has expired, but the court has
not yet decided on composition. 
<P>
9) The grounds for placing Banka Bohemia under conservatorship
were the issuance by this bank of Prime Bank Guarantees and Bank
Guarantees by which it violated the Foreign Exchange Act, the
Act on Banks and the Act on Accounting. For that reason, Banka
Bohemia's foreign exchange license to carry out international
payments was withdrawn and measures ordered to remedy shortcomings
detected. The situation did not improve, however, and on 31 March
1994, Banka Bohemia was placed under conservatorship. Clients
of this bank were subsequently given the option of transferring
their deposits to Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka. An extraordinary
general meeting of Banka Bohemia's shareholders held on 28 June
1994 decided to liquidate the bank.
<P>
10) On 11 May 1994, the CNB initiated administrative procedures
to withdraw AB banka' s license to operate as a bank due to its
inability to meet its commitments. At the same time, all its asset
and liability transactions were frozen. Clients were given the
possibility to transfer all deposits below CZK 100 mil. to Eeska
sporitelna and 92% of them took advantage of this offer. An extraordinary
general meeting, held on 24 August 1994, decided to decrease AB
banka's basic assets and that Eeska sporitelna would
subsequently increase these assets thus becoming AB banka's major
shareholder. In addition, the bank management was changed, thus
creating prerequisites for Stabilisation, and administration procedures
were terminated. 
<P>
11) Despite these problems, the banking system as a whole is not
threatened. No loss of confidence in small and medium-sized banks
has occurred, on the contrary, deposits with these banks continue
to grow. The CNB has substantially tightened the conditions for
establishing new banks, emphasizing the quality of management.
The CNB also initiated amendments to bank laws which consider
new phenomena in the banking sector.
<P>
12) These amendments have strengthened the powers of the banking
supervision (to change bank management personnel, limit bank activities,
impose fines up to CZK 500 mil, etc.). The conservator's powers
have also been extended; at present he can assume even the function
of a general meeting.
<P>
13) Under these amendments, a system has been introduced of flat
insurance of natural persons' deposits in name. The deposits are
insured through the Deposit Insurance Fund up to 80% of the total
amount, the maximum amount payable being CZK 100,000. The Fund
provides compensations to owners of insured deposits in the case
of a bank's incapacity to meet its commitments. This eliminates
the unequal position of banks when the state had only guaranteed
deposits with four major financial institutions.

<H1>COMMENTARY ON MONETARY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 1994</H1>
<HR>

<P>
In 1994, the Czech Republic's favorable economic results corresponded
in their main parameters to the intentions of the CNN monetary
program and the state budget. The economy assumed an upward trajectory
and though final figures on GDP are as yet unknown, preliminary
calculations indicate that last year was the first year of growth
since economic reforms started. The average inflation rate was
under the 10% limit, unemployment just above 3%. The state budget
ran a surplus of about CZK 10 bn and municipal budgets more than
CZK 21 bn. These budget surpluses helped to significantly decrease
net Government debt with the banking system. The gross state debt
recorded slight growth in connection with the debtor position
of the Czech Republic in the clearing payment system with the
Slovak Republic, but its share of the anticipated GDP fell by
1.6 percentage points to approximately 16% at the end of 1994.
This is much less than allowed, e.g., by the convergence criterion
for EU countries set by Maastricht agreements (60%). CNB foreign
exchange reserves were more than USD 6 bn and the volume in the
entire banking system nearly USD 9 bn. The foreign exchange position
of the Czech Republic improved substantially. The nominal exchange
rate remained stable and throughout the year the Czech crown experienced
real appreciation against major foreign currencies. The money
supply did not stick to the limits set by the monetary program,
due particularly to strong foreign capital inflow, but its more
rapid growth rate has not yet directly influenced price levels.
<P>
In December, prices of meat and meat products were stable, price
movements of other foodstuffs were slower and the price of coffee
fell in comparison with November. The food market thereby positively
affected catering prices.
<P>
The year-to-year increase in consumer prices was 10.2% in December
and 10.0% for the whole year.
<P>
Last year, price growth on the producer market was about 50% lower
than the consumer market. Compared to 1993, production prices
increased :
<P>
-in industry by 5.3%,
<P>
-in construction, prices of material consumption by 6.1% and of
construction work by 14.0%,
<P>
-in agriculture by 4.7%, of which 11.5% for livestock products,
while for vegetable products, prices dropped by 4.4%.
<P>
The state budget ran a surplus of CZK 10.4 bn after accounting
for revenues and expenditures related to last year and booked
within the so called additional period as of 13 January 1995.
Central budget revenues were higher by CZK 8.6 bn, while drawing
on expenditures dropped by CZK 1.8 bn.
<P>
During the year, social insurance contributions were transferred
to the budget, their total exceeding the planned amount by CZK
8.6 bn. Consumer tax revenues were CZK 4.0 bn higher than planned
in the budget. Better fulfillment was recorded also for road tax
revenues (by CZK 1.4 bn) and customs duty revenues (by CZK 0.1
bn). In contrast, VAT revenues remained below the budget by CZK
10.6 bn. This was particularly effected by:
<P>
-a higher increase in deliveries to be exported for which tax
payers claimed deductions,
<P>
-shifts in the structure of economic activities towards those
with a lower taxation rate (services, food processing),
<P>
-a probable decrease, signaled by spot-checks, of market stallholder
receipts,
<P>
-in part also by delinquent taxes and tax evasions.
<P>
Tax revenues from incomes of juridical persons also lagged behind
budgetary expectations (-CZK 7.2 bn), reflecting the effects of
some firms' insolvency and some permitted tax payment deferments
for creating several years in advance a single repair fund and
implementing a more rapid writing-off of material fixed assets.
<P>
Last year, municipal budgets ran a surplus of CZK 21.3 bn. This
was particularly due to:
<P>
-strengthening of the financial self-sufficiency of district authorities
and municipalities following from their stable income base,
<P>
-yields from municipal bond issues amounting to, in the case of
the Municipal Authority of the City of Prague, CZK 7.4 bn.
<P>
In local authority revenues, an important role was played by income
taxes of natural persons, distinguished by a steadily high rate
of growth, and by collections from leasing, educational payments
and housing revenues.
<P>
The gross (internal and external) state indebtedness share of
the GDP fell from 19.8% in 1992 to 17.5% in 1993 and 15.9% in
1994 according to preliminary data. Issues of state securities
covered at the end of last year the debt service of the state,
budget deficits of 1991 and 1992 and expenditures connected with
financing housing construction and rehabilitation.
<P>
As of the end of December 1994, the unemployment rate was 3.2%,
higher by 0.1% than November. The annual average was 3.3%, i.e.
1.7% less than expected. A moderate increase in December resulted
from specific problems in some regions, particularly
<P>
-employee layoffs in Tatra Koprivnice in the district of Novy
Jicin,
<P>
-increase in the number of new job applicants who had worked in
coal mining in the Karvina district.
<P>
In regions with an above-average unemployment rate, conditions
for finding a new job or retraining unemployed persons are made
more difficult by, among other things, the fact that about 2/3
- 3/4 of them have low or no skills at all.
<P>
The GDP in constant prices grew by 2.1% for the first 9 months
of 1994 according to revised data. During the last three months
upward trends in the economy were further strengthened. Industrial
production in constant prices was higher by 3.5% in November compared
to last year and by 2.2% for the 11 months as a whole. November's
performance decline was offset by firms with 25 and more employees
where the 11-month production volume reached last year's level.
In construction, production in comparable prices increased by
12.6% in November and by 6.9% from the year-beginning. In both
sectors, the growth rate of labour productivity for the eleven
months of 1994 was higher than that of average real wages:
<P>
Labour productivity (Average,real wages)
<P>
Industry (5.2%, 4.6%)
<P>
Construction (5.7%, 3.6%)
<P>
Last year, the money supply increased by 18.7% according to preliminary
data and by 20.3% after seasonal adjustment. This development
was particularly effected by the external sector and domestic
credit issues.
<P>
The total yearly increase in net foreign assets was CZK 89.5 bn
and resulted from surpluses of the balance of payments current
and capital accounts in convertible currencies. The inflow of
foreign resources strengthened, especially during November and
December when the central bank purchased through foreign exchange
fixing about USD 1.0 bn. This was reflected by an increase in
CNB foreign exchange reserves (to USD 6.2 bn as of the end of
the year) in spite of the fact that during the last two months
of 1994 it was necessary to make payments to the SR for exceeding
the marginal credit (USD 93 mil. in November and USD 65 mil. in
December) and a bond payment to Nomura (USD 136 mil.). At the
same time, a repayment was effected of the CR share of 1991 Eurodollar
bonds of the former SBCS (USD 136 mil.).
<P>
The volume of domestic credits jumped last year by CZK 85.0 bn,
less than 1993 (CZK 105.1 bn). At the end of 1994, the domestic
credit issue slowed and the monthly increase in credits fell on
average to CZK 5.2 bn in Q4 compared with CZK 7.0 bn in Q3 (CZK
6.3 bn in Q1 and CZK 9.8 bn in Q2).

<H1>MONEY MARKET INTEREST RATES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1994</H1>
<HR>

<P>
The level of interest rates on the money market in the Czech Republic
is predetermined by the development of interest rates in two its
basic segments: the interbank deposit market and the short-term
bond market.
<P>
On the short-term bond market the CNB has dropped its role as
a market-maker and the new official market makers will be the
four major Czech banks (Komercni banka, Ceskoslovenska obchodni
banka, Ceska sporitelna and Investicni a Postovni banka). In line
with this strategy, the CNB first ceased quoting the bid price
and reduced the volume limits for selling bills and, effective
14 September, stopped publishing its quotations and the reference
yield curve. This curve was gradually losing significance and
this is why the CNB has used a market yield curve since October
derived from quotations of the above market makers. Official publishing
of this curve is planned from the time when these banks are granted
the status of acknowledged market makers. Since 5 December, the
CNB has stopped determining its own reference yield curve and
quoting sale prices. Henceforth, the CNB will conduct direct trades
only with the market makers on the basis of market prices. Market
prices are also the basis for determining yield limits in bill
auctions.
<P>
In September, in accordance with monetary policy intentions and
following agreement with the CR Ministry of Finance, a change
was made in the maturity structure of T-bills and CNB bills. The
MF changed standard maturities of 4 and 12 weeks to 13, 26, 39
and 52 weeks and of CNB bills to 13 and 26 weeks.
<P>
Although the turnover on the short-term bond market is gradually
increasing, it is far from this on the deposit market. At the
same time, however, the number of participants is growing, coming
from, besides banks, the ranks of financial institutions (funds,
insurance companies), large enterprises and security traders.
Foreign investors are also making use of high yields (usually
they are not subject to the 25% withdrawing tax) and low risk
(stable exchange rate) by investing in National Property Fund
(NPF) bills.
<P>
The CNB influences the level of interest rates through its monetary
policy measures. On 4 August, the CNB increased the percentage
rate for the minimum reserves requirement which banks are obliged
to maintain without interest (3% on time deposits and 12% on demand
deposits). The CNB increased the discount rate from 8% to 8.50%
on 24 October and the Lombard rate from 11% to 11.50% on 2 December.
A less obvious, but very significant measure consisted in defining
more precisely the operational objective of the monetary policy,
i.e. control over the amount of reserves of the banking sector.
For this reason, the CNB has been, since August, influencing the
amount of the banks' reserves by daily interventions to keep it
in harmony with the monetary program.
<P>
The CNB monitors both the development of interest rates (PRIBOR
and PRIBID) and the turnover on this market. Reference interest
curves are calculated on the basis of quotations of 10 reference
banks at 11 a.m. During the entire six months the reference banks
were Bayerische Vereinsbank, BNP-Dresdner, Citibank, Creditanstalt,
Credit Lyonnais, CSOB, Investicni a Postovni banka, Komercni banka
and Zivnostenska banka. Until 9 October, the tenth reference bank
was Agrobanka which was replaced by Ceska sporitelna on 10 October.
The improvement and development of the interbank market is confirmed
by both reduction of the spread (from 0.9% in June to 0.75-0.80%
in December) and the volume of traded interbank deposits which
continues to grow steadily (from CZK 132.3 bn in June to CZK 213.7
bn in November, and CZK 265.4 bn in December).
<P>
The development of PRIBOR for maturities of 1W, 1M, 6M and 1Y
in 1994 is shown in the graph which illustrates the impact of
the central bank policy on the amount of short-term rates. The
money supply growth at the beginning of the year did not demand
any significant correction and steady large surpluses of banks
on MRR accounts entailed a gradual reduction of rates. Due to
an increased rate of growth in the money supply in the 2nd half,
the CNB had to apply stricter policies on the money market. The
MRR increase in August, the termination of the function of a market
maker on the short-term bond market also in August, the increase
of the discount rate in October and the Lombard rate in December
and particularly the constant pressure on reducing the banks'
free reserves entailed a permanent growth in rates in the 2nd
half up to 11% - 12% for O/N, and 12% - 13% for longer maturities.
<P>
For foreign investors, the difference is significant in interbank
deposit interest rates (PRIBOR) on CZK in comparison with rates
on DEM and USD. With a fixed CZK linkage to the basket of these
currencies (approximately in a 2:1 ratio) it is, therefore, purposeful
to monitor the synthetic curve, created in this way, of interest
rates on this basket. The graph shows that the difference of this
&quot;synthetic&quot; interest curve was below the real CZK yield
curve at the end of July by 3.57% for short maturities and by
3.21% for long maturities. At the end of December, the differential
further increased to 7.16% and 6.35% for monthly and annual maturities
respectively. Due to this, the possibility of using short-term
instruments for investment in the Czech Republic increased significantly,
thereby helping to increase the inflow of foreign capital into
the Czech Republic.

<H1>COMMENTARY ON MONETARY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 1995</H1>
<HR>

<P>
The Czech economy entered 1995 with a surplus state budget, a
lower January inflation rate compared to the previous two years,
with a slight seasonal increase in unemployment, growing foreign
exchange reserves and with interest rates PRIBOR lower than recorded
on the interbank market at the end of last year.
<P>
Consumer prices in January grew by 1.4%. About two-thirds of this
increase was due to
<P>
- higher prices of foodstuffs, particularly milk and milk products,
vegetables and potatoes,
<P>
- centrally increased heat prices, where the top limit was moved
up by 10%.
<P>
In a year-to-year comparison consumer prices grew by 8.9%, thus
being below 9% for the first time since mid-1992.
<P>
The state budget for this year is drawn as balanced with revenues
and expenditures of CZK 411.7 bn. In January it ran a cash surplus
of CZK 6.7 bn.
<P>
Budgetary revenues were CZK 38.2 bn (9.3% of the planned annual
volume) and were CZK 3.9 bn higher than the average monthly aliquot
(8.3%). More favorable results were achieved particularly in
<P>
- value added tax - CZK 9.9 bn (11.3% of the annual amount),
<P>
- consumer taxes - CZK 5.0 bn (10.8% of the annual amount).
<P>
The budget was not fulfilled in the case of income taxes of natural
and juridical persons (6.8% of the annual amount) and customs
duty revenues (8.0% of the annual amount).
<P>
Budgetary expenditures ran to CZK 31.5 bn (7.7% of the annual
amount), which was CZK 2.8 bn less than the average monthly aliquot
(8.3%). While household transfers and expenditures for public
household consumption reached 13.1% of the annual amount, due
to seasonal influences a low fulfillment was recorded, especially
for expenditures on investments of budgetary and subsidized organizations
(2.1% of the annual amount) and for investment and non-investment
transfers to firms (2.6% of the annual amount).
<P>
Compared to December 1994, the January 1995 unemployment rate
rose by 0.2% to 3.4%. The number of new job applicants grew (+17.3
thousand persons), while the number of vacancies available was
unchanged. This is a consequence, among other things, of the seasonal
decline in job opportunities in construction, agriculture and
forestry.
<P>
The lowest unemployment rate continues to be registered in Prague
(0.3% in January). In the regions of Central Bohemia, South Bohemia,
West Bohemia and East Bohemia, the January unemployment rate was
below average (2.3%-3.0%). Three regions registered an above average
unemployment rate: South Moravia (3.6%), North Bohemia (4.7%)
and North Moravia (6.0%). 
<P>
The foreign exchange reserves of the banking system increased
to USD 9.2 bn as of the end of January, of which central bank
reserves total USD 6.7 bn.
<P>
In January the central bank repurchased USD 375 mil. from the
interbank market through fixing. Roughly 70% of these funds came
from foreign banks, the rest from an offer by Komercni banka resulting
from a syndicated loan taken out by this bank.
<P>
The foreign exchange reserves of commercial banks dropped by USD
83 mil. in January and amounted to USD 2.5 bn. Short-term liabilities
of commercial banks increased at the same time by USD 115 mil.
and were converted into crown and foreign exchange credits granted
to domestic clients.
<P>
The uninterrupted increase in interbank interest rates PRIBOR,
which lasted throughout the entire second half of last year, ended
in January and the rates fell compared to December. The reason
was predominantly the excessive liquidity in the banking system,
The rate of decline was different for individual rates, 0.25%
(O/N rate) and 1.19% (three-month rate).
<P>
For its interventions on the money market, the central bank used,
in particular, repo tenders or reverse repo tenders and on the
basis of their results then implemented individual repo operations,
or direct purchases or sales of short-term bonds.
<P>
On 14 February, the Prague Stock Exchange ended trading in shares
of companies introduced mainly after the first wave of voucher
privatization. After a one week break, the PSE will offer shares
to be traded, supplemented with items from the second wave of
voucher privatization.
<P>
Of this year's 29 sessions, only six registered a rising price
trend (three at the beginning of January, three at the beginning
of February) and during two sessions prices stagnated. In all
other sessions prices recorded a marked downward trend during
which the CNB-120 Index fell to its lowest level so far, 677 points
(February 1). Since the year beginning, the index has lost 72
points or 9.56%. As well, the main industries suffered losses:
<P>
( 95/01/16 - 95/02/14 - Change (%) )
<P>
CNB-120 Index ( 753 - 681 - 9,56 )
<P>
of which:
<P>
Food-processing industry ( 669 - 587 - 12,26 )
<P>
Construction and building
<P>
material production ( 1 414 - 1 330 - 5,94 )
<P>
Engineering and electrical
<P>
engineering ( 610 - 575 - 5,74 )
<P>
Energy (926 - 831 - 10,26 )
<P>
Financing ( 521 - 451 - 13,44 )
<P>
of which:
<P>
Monetary system ( 447 - 370 - 17,23 )
<P>
Trade and services ( 677 - 606 - 10,49 )
<P>
This year, trades in shares of firms making up the CNB-120 Index
have amounted to CZK 1 692.3 mil., i.e. CZK 58.4 mil. per session.
Three quarters of all trades were with shares of financial institutions
and energy-generating corporations.

<H1>PRINCIPLES OF THE NEW LEGISLATION IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE
AREA</H1>
<HR>

<P>
The Czech National Bank together with the Ministry of Finance
have presented to the government the draft principles of the new
legislation in the foreign exchange area. The government approved
these principles at its session on 22 February, 1995. The new
act will replace the existing Foreign Exchange Act No. 528/1990
of the Coll. This act specifies the Czech currency as the exclusively
domestic one, thus differentiating it from freely convertible
currencies.
<P>
The new legislation proposes to gradually implement full external
convertibility of the Czech crown, the first step being the convertibility
of operations on the balance of payments current account under
Article VIII of the Agreement on the International Monetary Fund.
<P>
If we compare the present legislation with these requirements,
the new act should cancel those restrictions still valid which
relate to:
<P>
payments connected with the export and import of goods and services,
thereby to also liberalise execution of these payments by natural
persons, unrequited transfers to foreign countries, e.g. meeting
alimony obligations, costs related to treatment, education, transfers
of salaries and wages, fees for participation in international
organisations, purchases, sales, exports and imports of financial
means in Czech and foreign currencies by residents and non-residents,
with the alternative to restrict cash transports across the border,
repurchases of Czech currency from non-residents' accounts.
<P>
However, outside the framework of the demands of Article VIII
of the Agreement on the International Monetary Fund, the new act
also proposes the liberalisation of some capital operations. They
are as follows:
<P>
direct investments abroad (establishment or participation in the
establishment of an enterprise with full or partial ownership
interest of 10% and more and credits due in 5 and more years connected
to direct investment), acquisition by residents of real estate
abroad.
<P>
The proposed legislation is based on the following:
<P>
faster liberalisation of capital imports than exports,
<P>
faster liberalisation of long-term capital movements against short-term
capital movements, so called 'hot money',
<P>
faster liberalisation of direct investments in foreign countries
than portfolio investments (purchases of securities).
<P>
The new legislation proposes the maintenance of foreign exchange
restrictions only on the most sensitive items. In terms of capital
outflow, the restriction would be in effect for the following
cases:
<P>
providing financial credit to a non-resident (this does not apply
to financial credits extended by the state, credits due in more
than five years, credits granted in connection with direct investments
and loans between natural persons),
<P>
providing securing instruments (guarantees in particular) to secure
a non-resident's commitment against another non-resident,
<P>
keeping financial means (in foreign and Czech currencies) in accounts
abroad,
<P>
issuing foreign securities in the domestic primary market or their
launching on the domestic secondary market (long-term securities
on the capital market and short-term securities on the money market),
<P>
purchase of foreign securities (their sale will be free) in a
way other than from licensed securities traders.
<P>
On the capital inflow side the restriction would only apply to
<P>
purchases of real estate in the CR by non-residents provided they
are not citizens of the CR. Free access to real estate would remain
in those cases stipulated by the act.
<P>
Regulation of the stated operations would be particularly through
direct instruments, i.e. their execution would be conditioned
by the granting of a foreign exchange license. It is assumed that
indirect instruments, which could be put into effect through a
CNB provision (issued in agreement with the MF) or through a decree
to the new act, will be used for some operations.
<P>
The draft law proposes the cancellation of the so called obligation
to offer foreign exchange means, however it strongly stresses
the obligation to report, which supplements the regulation and
should gradually replace it. Despite this, the extent of the reporting
obligation is, for virtual and organisational reasons, smaller
than, e.g., in Germany. The reporting obligation should be a source
of reliable information for the analysis of the balance of payments
and it should strengthen the effect of an act and mechanisms against
money laundering. At the same time, in some cases a link to financial
authorities is being proposed in the interest of acquiring basic
material for tax purposes.
<P>
The draft also proposes the obligation of banks and other locations
where foreign exchange operations are performed to examine whether
these operations are in line with the Foreign Exchange Act. According
to the International Monetary Fund's analysis, this is a common,
world-wide obligation.
<P>
The path to full convertibility of the Czech crown was started
by launching the economic reform in 1991. This involves a continuous
process which started with the implementation of the so called
internal convertibility and continued through the partial steps
of liberalisation. In fact, a relatively high level of convertibility
was achieved at that time. The proposed legislation, in this sense,
is legal confirmation of the position which the Czech crown convertibility
has attained. At the same time, some restrictions remain unchanged
which reduce the risk of instability of the Czech crown exchange
rate.
<P>
The new act on foreign exchange relations should be in effect
over a long period until the full convertibility of the Czech
crown has also been implemented in the area of capital operations.
A flexible formulation of the act should enable further liberalisation
steps to be taken in such a way that the act would not have to
be continually changed.

<H1>NEWSWORTHY NOTES</H1>
<HR>

<P>
In its session on 20 December 1994, the CNB Bank Board discussed
and approved the 1995 monetary program. The program is based on
a year-to-year GDP increase of 3-4%, on maintaining balanced public
budgets and on Government and CNB efforts to keep inflation rate
below 10%. The CNB will pursue such monetary policy that will
keep the existing exchange rate level, exert intensive pressure
against price growth and create monetary conditions for sustained
economic growth. For these purposes, it is considered appropriate
to manage the development of money supply (M2) so that it will
be 14-17% higher in Q4 1995 than Q4 1994.<HR>

<P>
The state budget ran a surplus of CZK 10.4 bn as of 31 December
1994. The CNB considers this surplus an important aid in the struggle
against inflation. On 14 December 1994, the Parliament adopted
the CR state budget for 1995 with expenditures and revenues of
CZK 411 746 bn, i.e. the budget is in balance and, in comparison
with the original Government draft, higher by CZK 200 mil. The
most significant public finance item will again be social transfers
(approximately CZK 161 bn). State subsidies to business entities
will be directed particularly towards transport and agriculture.
<HR>

<P>
From 1 January 1995, prices of household heat increased by 10%.
At the same time, new measures are reflected in the prices of
heat for other consumers (e.g. growth from 8% to 9% in the share
of profit earmarked for investment in heating). From 1 June 1995,
the prices of electricity and gas for households will be increased
by 12% and 10% respectively. This is an important step in equalizing
prices for households and other consumers, or, in other words,
eliminating state subsidies in this area. From 1 July 1995, rents
will increase by roughly 22 - 30% (in flats with rents still regulated
by the state) in a differentiated way with regard to the regional
situation and the size of municipalities. Rent prices will continue
to grow each year from 1 July depending on the development of
inflation.<HR>

<P>
One of the two VAT rates included in prices and therefore paid
by consumers decreased from 23% to 22% from 1 January 1995. At
the same time, customs duties were reduced on imports of some
kinds of goods (e.g. automobiles). The impact of these changes
on consumer prices has not yet been felt. From 1 January 1995,
the income tax rate of juridical persons fell from 42% to 41%
and the maximum rate of this tax for natural persons decreased
from 44% to 43%.<HR>

<P>
During 3 - 6 December 1994, Dr. W. R. White, the Director of the
Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS visited the CNB. His
discussions with the CNB Governor and Bank Board members dealt
with the issues of foreign capital inflows, the mechanism for
determining the foreign exchange rate and monetary policy management
by means of interest rates.<HR>

<P>
From 5 to 9 December 1995, the CNB in cooperation with the British
know-how Fund held another in the series of seminars for employees
of the Banking Supervision Department on the problems of the financial
analysis of banks. Lecturers were from the Bank of England. The
seminar helped to increase the skills of CNB banking supervision
employees.<HR>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation in its report, &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot;, ranked the CR in twelfth place amongst the world's
most economically liberal states and first amongst the European
countries in transition. This rating particularly applies to banking,
state regulation, investments, government consumption, ownership
rights, wage and salary control and prices.<HR>

<P>
On 14 December 1994, an agreement was signed between the European
Investment Bank and the Czech firm MERO CR on the extension of
a long-term credit worth ECU 125 mil. to complete financing of
the Ingolstadt - Kralupy oil pipe-line. The credit was arranged
by CSOB.<HR>

<P>
CSOB and the Rothschild Banking Group have established a joint-venture,
Consilium, to specialize in consultation on the finances of business
firms. The Rothschild Banking Group's share of Consilium is 40%.
<HR>

<P>
On 6 December 1994, the 7th issue of Agrobanka shares was completed.
The shares, whose nominal value was CZK 635 mil., were thus underwritten
and paid up a month before the planned date. Agrobanka's basic
assets thereby increased to CZK 3.175 bn and its capital adequacy
approached 4%. This complies with the intentions of the bank's
consolidation program for 1994. In December 1994, Ceska sporitelna
increased its assets from CZK 5.6 to 7.6 bn through underwriting
of new shares. The first and second rounds were reserved for the
present shareholders with first rights, the third round performed
in auction form.<HR>

<P>
At the end of December 1994, Ceska sporitelna and Banque Nationale
de Paris signed an agreement on a general credit worth FRF 50
mil. specifying the terms of financing imports of equipment, technologies,
services and industrial products of French origin by Ceska sporitelna's
clientele. Based on this agreement, Ceska sporitelna will finance
from this general credit 85% of the delivery's value.<HR>

<P>
On 16 December 1994, the issue was successfully concluded of Eurobonds
worth USD 150 mil. of the Netherlands company, CEZ Finance B.V.,
established by CEZ, the Czech power company. The primary manager
of this issue was the American investment bank, J.P. Morgan Securities.
In December 1994, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO Bank NV entered the
Czech capital market with an issue worth CZK 1 bn of three-year
bonds at an interest rate of 11%. This is the first issue of foreign
bank securities in the Czech capital market.<HR>

<P>
A general meeting of Czechoslovak Airlines decided that, effective
26 January 1995, its name will change to Czech Airlines. This
does not entail any changes in legal personality, organizational
structure, airline network, foreign representations, etc. As well,
the CSA logo and OK code will probably be retained. The construction
of the new Prague airport terminal will be secured by Ceska sprava
letist, a.s. (Czech Airports' Administration). Foreign firms -
the French firm Bouygues and British Aerospace - will participate
in the construction. Credits will be secured by Investicni a Postovni
banka. <HR>

<P>
On February 1, 1995, the Association Agreement between the CR
and the European Union took effect. This is the formal completion
of putting into practice the provision of the European Agreement
(particularly in trade relations) which has been going on between
the CR and the EU since 1992. In connection with this agreement
the CNB ceased regulating transfers of direct investments from
the CR to EU countries. Therefore, Czech citizens interested in
direct investments in EU countries need not apply for a foreign
exchange licence but only advise about a particular transaction.
Operations by foreign direct investors in the CR continue not
to be subject to a foreign exchange licence.<HR>

<P>
On January 4, 1995, Governor Josef Tosovsky received Mr. Alfons
Verplaetse, the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium. The
aim of this meeting was to exchange experiences of central bank
activities particularly in the area of banking trades. On January
17, 1995, Governor Josef Tosovsky received the President of the
Central Bank of Chile, Robert Zahler. During their meeting they
exchanged experience with foreign capital inflows to the Czech
and Chilean economies and discussed central bank regulatory measures
in this area. On January 27, 1995, Governor Tosovsky received
the new Dutch Ambassador to the CR, Mr. Peter F. C. Koch.<HR>

<P>
At its session on January 26, 1995, the CNB Bank Board assessed
positively an application for a banking licence for Ceska exportni
banka (Czech Export Bank), a.s., seated in Prague. Ceska exportni
banka is to extend more advantageous export credits, in the first
phase especially to banks for exporters. The basic capital of
this new bank is CZK 1.5 bn. However, the CEB will actually start
operations after the necessary legislation has been adopted, which
is expected in February this year.<HR>

<P>
Exportni garancni a pojistovaci spolecnost, a.s. (Export Guarantee
and Insurance Company - EGAP) has been providing services to exporters
for the third year. In 1995, because of deposits from the state
budget and premiums income, a further increase in EGAP's insurance
capacity is expected to such an extent that new export credits
amounting to CZK 10 bn could be insured. EGAP provides insurance
for short-term credits on a commercial basis against commercial
risks in OECD countries, where thus far, nearly 100 insurance
agreements have been concluded covering an export potential of
approximately CZK 13 bn. EGAP's entire insurance activities presently
cover territorial and commercial risks connected to 7.9% of the
CR's total exports.<HR>

<P>
In the CR, 30 pension funds have already been granted licences.
The following are among the newest funds: Sporitelni penzijni
fond established by Ceska sporitelna and Sporitelni penzijni spolecnost,
penzijni fond Thalia established by Dolte a.s., Cesky literarni
fond and Syndikat novinaru, Obcansky penzijni fond established
by Metrostav and a number of other firms, penzijni fond Slavia,
established by the firm Time Scale, Prumyslovy penzijni fond established
by Svaz prumyslu a dopravy and other institutions, and the fund
Fontana established in Ostrava.<HR>

<P>
Although legislative measures related to the terms of mortgage
bond issue are still under preparation, some banks commenced offering
mortgage credits as early as the beginning of 1995. Ceska sporitelna,
Komercni banka (which has established a Mortgage Institute for
this purpose), Ceskomoravska hypotecni banka (previously Regiobanka),
and a subsidiary of Investicni a Postovni banka are involved.
A mortgage credit is long-term and designed for specific purposes,
to finance housing needs and investments in real estate. It can
account for 60% of an estimated real estate price or a budget
for construction and reconstruction and is extended with preferential
interest.<HR>

<P>
SPT Telecom has acquired a three-year syndicated credit of USD
100 mil. from Credit Lyonnais Banka Praha and three other banks
(Fuji Bank, Bank of America and West LB). These financial means
will be used to finance the purchase of equipment from foreign
suppliers. This is the first syndicated credit for a Czech non-banking
company organised on the European financial market which is not
conditioned by a security or guarantee. The interest rate margin
is only 0.35% p.a. above the reference inter-bank rate LIBOR.
<HR>

<P>
In the CR, wage regulation based on monitoring the connection
between consumer price growth and wages continues to be in effect.
However, some rules of this regulation have been liberalised.
The fine (hitherto 200% or 100%) has been reduced to a unified
50% and the period for monitoring the development of enterprise
wages has been extended from 6 to 12 months. In 1994, only 5%
of enterprises did not observe the rules of wage regulation.<HR>

<P>
According to information from the German-Czech Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, trade between Germany and the CR has grown. From
1990 to 30.9.1994, the share of direct investments by German entrepreneurs
in the CR of overall investments by direct foreign investors increased
to 29.3%.

<H1>SUMMARY</H1>
<HR>

<P>
This year, the Czech Republic entered a phase distinguished by
a strengthening of the macroeconomic stability achieved earlier,
an improving and further reinforcing of the market environment,
while expecting a turning point in the development of economic
performance.
<P>
The first nine months of 1994 were marked by the fact that, in
contrast to the three previous years of transformation, this period
was free of any fundamental changes to the system and the Czech
economy developed in a relatively stable internal environment.
Neither did the external economic environment experience any significant
changes. The influence of the recovery beginning in western industrial
countries and the prospects of more liberal access to foreign
markets can be expected only on the long-term horizon. Problems
continued in trade with the Slovak Republic, which further declined.
<P>
The basic objective of the CNB monetary policy, a stable currency,
was accomplished during the period under review. The inflation
rate measured by the consumer price index corresponds essentially
to 1994's intentions. The year-to-year change in price levels
amounted to 10.5% at the close-September. The month-to-month increase
in price level following the usual more rapid growth in January
was moderate until July, accelerating, however, in August and
September, when the month-to-month index exceeded 1%. Consumer
prices in September this year, against December 1993, rose by
7.9%. The inflationary growth has especially affected the price
of foodstuffs (particularly meat and meat products) which, against
the end of last year, increased by 11.2%, and prices for services
which rose by 12.4% (influenced by prices for rent, heat, water
and sewage, gas, electric power and bus transport).
<P>
The development thus far of the balance of payments allows the
continuation of the policy of a stable nominal exchange rate of
the Czech crown which, vis-a-vis freely-convertible currencies,
has been stable since the beginning of 1991. CNB foreign exchange
reserves and those of the entire banking system had an upward
trend. Favorable development in the foreign exchange position
enabled repayment ahead of schedule of all CR credits from the
IMF. The position of CNB foreign exchange reserves at the close-September
is sufficient to cover imports of goods and services for four
months in freely convertible currencies.
<P>
Money supply measured by the monetary aggregate M2 further increased,
affected especially by a rapid inflow of foreign resources. Credits
drawn by Czech firms directly from foreign subjects, and portfolio
investments, are the dominant forms of capital inflow. The drawing
of credits abroad is significantly stimulated by positive ratings
of the CR (investment grade ratings of Baa2 or BBB+) manifested
in more advantageous conditions for entrepreneurial credits from
abroad. Domestic enterprises thus utilize the possibilities of
acquiring long-term resources which, with lower interest rates,
are better than those from domestic banks. The large demand for
credits by commercial banks' clientele continued. An increase
in domestic credits, compared to the end of 1993, was the result
of an increased number of credits to the enterprise sector, since
the net credit to government fell (particularly due to the favorable
state budget current performance). From a sectoral and time point
of view, changes continue in the structure of credits to enterprises
(an increase in credits to the private sector and a decline in
credits to the state sector). Short-term credits made up almost
3/4 of newly granted credits in the first half. The CNB resisted
this development by continuing free-market operations and issuing
its own bills. In addition to these operations, the CNB increased
in July the minimum reserves requirement for demand deposits of
commercial banks from 9% to 12%, and in October, the discount
rate from 8% to 8.5% and the Lombard rate from 10.5% to 11%. Money
supply growth slowed in Q3.
<P>
A certain stabilisation or slight decline in money market interest
rates in the first six months was followed by gradual growth in
interest rates in the inter-bank deposit market. In September,
interest rates on credits extended to clients increased.
<P>
The capital market continued to develop rapidly. The Prague Stock
Exchange and the RM-System began to offer new services and greater
convenience. However, some retarding influences, particularly
the lower liquidity of the capital market, remained in the period
under review. Trading volumes and prices of securities were marked
by fluctuations in particular periods for reasons both external
(smaller interest of foreign investors) and internal (investor
preparation for the second wave of voucher privatization, mobilization
of means for the subscription of new KB and IPB shares).
<P>
Bonds, as an alternative source of financing, especially the needs
of the entrepreneurial sphere, enjoy greater interest. This reduces
the shortage of good quality securities with sufficient liquidity
on the capital market, thereby creating the preconditions for
growth in trading in bonds which as yet constitutes a smaller
part of the capital market.
<P>
The results achieved document unequivocally the positive influence
of the ownership transformation on the economic performance. In
terms of demand, growing consumer demand accompanied by an increased
investment demand was apparent. Production by individual economic
industries documents the beginning of growth tendencies. The
<P>
figure of 2.1% growth in the gross domestic product, in constant
prices, in January to September this year against the same period
of last year, is based on the ongoing increase in services, construction
and industry (from January to September industrial production
rose by 2.0% and construction by 6.0% compared to the same period
last year).
<P>
Changes in the structure of the labour force denoting progressive
movements accompanying the restructuring of the economy, continued
in the labour market (development of the private and non-state
sectors, increasing importance of the service sector, etc.). Employment
in industry continues to decline. The unemployment rate remains
very low and at the close-September, amounted to 3.2% (3.5% a
year ago). The situation on the labour market is documented by
the fact that more than 50 thousand foreigners are working in
the CR.
<P>
The problems in which some small banks found themselves due to
the loss of liquidity; i.e. problems with risky credits which
became critical, the unbalanced time structure of assets and liabilities
and, last but not least, incompetent and unprofessional management,
were tackled in the banking sector during the first months of
the year. The period starting June was a phase of implementing
significant systemic elements into the life of the banking system
- an amendment to the Act on Banks and CNB provisions which introduced
a unified classification of credit portfolios. The amended Act
on Banks helped stabilize the banking sector by facilitating a
more efficient solving of unfavorable development in banks, and
increased public confidence in the banking sector through the
introduction of deposit insurance. Stricter credit classification
contributes to a more precise and realistic view of risky credits
as one of the most serious problems in the Czech banking system,
a problem emerging from both the inheritance of the past and the
lack of experience or limited competence of management, particularly
in newly established small banks. These moves made by the central
bank led to a consolidation of the situation and were positively
reflected throughout the entire banking system which presently
can be characterized as stable.
<P>
Economic and monetary developments in the first nine months of
this year can be assessed as positive. The phase of gradual recovery
in which the Czech economy finds itself, accompanied by a growing
demand for money, and persisting foreign capital inflow, increase
demands on a stabilizing character of the CNB monetary policy.

<H2>New Year's Address to the Nation</H2>

<H3>Prague, January 1, 1990</H3>

<P>
My dear fellow citizens,<BR>
For forty years you heard from my predecessors on this day different
variations on the same theme: how our country was flourishing,
how many million tons of steel we produced, how happy we all were,
how we trusted our government, and what bright perspectives were
unfolding in front of us.<BR>
I assume you did not propose me for this office so that I, too,
would lie to you.<BR>
Our country is not flourishing. The enormous creative and spiritual
potential of our nations is not being used sensibly. Entire branches
of industry are producing goods that are of no interest to anyone,
while we are lacking the things we need. A state which calls itself
a workers' state humiliates and exploits workers. Our obsolete
economy is wasting the little energy we have available. A country
that once could be proud of the educational level of its citizens
spends so little on education that it ranks today as seventy-second
in the world. We have polluted the soil, rivers and forests bequeathed
to us by our ancestors, and we have today the most contaminated
environment in Europe. Adults in our country die earlier than
in most other European countries.<BR>
Allow me a small personal observation. When I flew recently to
Bratislava, I found some time during discussions to look out of
the plane window. I saw the industrial complex of Slovnaft chemical
factory and the giant Petr_alka housing estate right behind it.
The view was enough for me to understand that for decades our
statesmen and political leaders did not look or did not want to
look out of the windows of their planes. No study of statistics
available to me would enable me to understand faster and better
the situation in which we find ourselves.<BR>
But all this is still not the main problem. The worst thing is
that we live in a contaminated moral environment. We fell morally
ill because we became used to saying something different from
what we thought. We learned not to believe in anything, to ignore
one another, to care only about ourselves. Concepts such as love,
friendship, compassion, humility or forgiveness lost their depth
and dimension, and for many of us they represented only psychological
peculiarities, or they resembled goneastray greetings from ancient
times, a little ridiculous in the era of computers and spaceships.
Only a few of us were able to cry out loudly that the powers that
be should not be allpowerful and that the special farms, which
produced ecologically pure and topquality food just for them,
should send their produce to schools, children's homes and hospitals
if our agriculture was unable to offer them to all.<BR>
The previous regime armed with its arrogant and intolerant ideology
reduced man to a force of production, and nature to a tool of
production. In this it attacked both their very substance and
their mutual relationship. It reduced gifted and autonomous people,
skillfully working in their own country, to the nuts and bolts
of some monstrously huge, noisy and stinking machine, whose real
meaning was not clear to anyone. It could not do more than slowly
but inexorably wear out itself and all its nuts and bolts. <BR>
When I talk about the contaminated moral atmosphere, I am not
talking just about the gentlemen who eat organic vegetables and
do not look out of the plane windows. I am talking about all of
us. We had all become used to the totalitarian system and accepted
it as an unchangeable fact and thus helped to perpetuate it. In
other words, we are all though naturally to differing extents
responsible for the operation of the totalitarian machinery. None
of us is just its victim. We are all also its cocreators. <BR>
Why do I say this? It would be very unreasonable to understand
the sad legacy of the last forty years as something alien, which
some distant relative bequeathed to us. On the contrary, we have
to accept this legacy as a sin we committed against ourselves.
If we accept it as such, we will understand that it is up to us
all, and up to us alone to do something about it. We cannot blame
the previous rulers for everything, not only because it would
be untrue, but also because it would blunt the duty that each
of us faces today: namely, the obligation to act independently,
freely, reasonably and quickly. Let us not be mistaken: the best
government in the world, the best parliament and the best president,
cannot achieve much on their own. And it would be wrong to expect
a general remedy from them alone. Freedom and democracy include
participation and therefore responsibility from us all.<BR>
If we realize this, then all the horrors that the new Czechoslovak
democracy inherited will cease to appear so terrible. If we realize
this, hope will return to our hearts.<BR>
In the effort to rectify matters of common concern, we have something
to lean on. The recent period and in particular the last six weeks
of our peaceful revolution has shown the enormous human, moral
and spiritual potential, and the civic culture that slumbered
in our society under the enforced mask of apathy. Whenever someone
categorically claimed that we were this or that, I always objected
that society is a very mysterious creature and that it is unwise
to trust only the face it presents to you. I am happy that I was
not mistaken. Everywhere in the world people wonder where those
meek, humiliated, skeptical and seemingly cynical citizens of
Czechoslovakia found the marvelous strength to shake the totalitarian
yoke from their shoulders in several weeks, and in a decent and
peaceful way. And let us ask: Where did the young people who never
knew another system get their desire for truth, their love of
free thought, their political ideas, their civic courage and civic
prudence? How did it happen that their parents the very generation
that had been considered lost joined them? How is it that so many
people immediately knew what to do and none needed any advice
or instruction?<BR>
I think there are two main reasons for the hopeful face of our
present situation. First of all, people are never just a product
of the external world; they are also able to relate themselves
to something superior, however systematically the external world
tries to kill that ability in them. Secondly, the humanistic and
democratic traditions, about which there had been so much idle
talk, did after all slumber in the unconsciousness of our nations
and ethnic minorities, and were inconspicuously passed from one
generation to another, so that each of us could discover them
at the right time and transform them into deeds.<BR>
We had to pay, however, for our present freedom. Many citizens
perished in jails in the 1950s, many were executed, thousands
of human lives were destroyed, hundreds of thousands of talented
people were forced to leave the country. Those who defended the
honor of our nations during the Second World War, those who rebelled
against totalitarian rule and those who simply managed to remain
themselves and think freely, were all persecuted. We should not
forget any of those who paid for our present freedom in one way
or another. Independent courts should impartially consider the
possible guilt of those who were responsible for the persecutions,
so that the truth about our recent past might be fully revealed.
<BR>
We must also bear in mind that other nations have paid even more
dearly for their present freedom, and that indirectly they have
also paid for ours. The rivers of blood that have flowed in Hungary,
Poland, Germany and recently in such a horrific manner in Romania,
as well as the sea of blood shed by the nations of the Soviet
Union, must not be forgotten. First of all because all human suffering
concerns every other human being. But more than this, they must
also not be forgotten because it is these great sacrifices that
form the tragic background of today's freedom or the gradual emancipation
of the nations of the Soviet Bloc, and thus the background of
our own newfound freedom. Without the changes in the Soviet Union,
Poland, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic, what has
happened in our country would have scarcely happened. And if it
did, it certainly would not have followed such a peaceful course.
<BR>
The fact that we enjoyed optimal international conditions does
not mean that anyone else has directly helped us during the recent
weeks. In fact, after hundreds of years, both our nations have
raised their heads high of their own initiative without relying
on the help of stronger nations or powers. It seems to me that
this constitutes the great moral asset of the present moment.
This moment holds within itself the hope that in the future we
will no longer suffer from the complex of those who must always
express their gratitude to somebody. It now depends only on us
whether this hope will be realized and whether our civic, national,
and political selfconfidence will be awakened in a historically
new way.<BR>
Selfconfidence is not pride. Just the contrary: only a person
or a nation that is selfconfident, in the best sense of the word,
is capable of listening to others, accepting them as equals, forgiving
its enemies and regretting its own guilt. Let us try to introduce
this kind of selfconfidence into the life of our community and,
as nations, into our behavior on the international stage. Only
thus can we restore our selfrespect and our respect for one another
as well as the respect of other nations.<BR>
Our state should never again be an appendage or a poor relative
of anyone else. It is true that we must accept and learn many
things from others, but we must do this in the future as their
equal partners, who also have something to offer.<BR>
Our first president wrote: &quot;Jesus, not Caesar.&quot; In this
he followed our philosophers Chel_icky and Komensky. I dare to
say that we may even have an opportunity to spread this idea further
and introduce a new element into European and global politics.
Our country, if that is what we want, can now permanently radiate
love, understanding, the power of the spirit and of ideas. It
is precisely this glow that we can offer as our specific contribution
to international politics.<BR>
Masaryk based his politics on morality. Let us try, in a new time
and in a new way, to restore this concept of politics. Let us
teach ourselves and others that politics should be an expression
of a desire to contribute to the happiness of the community rather
than of a need to cheat or rape the community. Let us teach ourselves
and others that politics can be not simply the art of the possible,
especially if this means the art of speculation, calculation,
intrigue, secret deals and pragmatic maneuvering, but that it
can also be the art of the impossible, that is, the art of improving
ourselves and the world.<BR>
We are a small country, yet at one time we were the spiritual
crossroads of Europe. Is there a reason why we could not again
become one? Would it not be another asset with which to repay
the help of others that we are going to need?<BR>
Our homegrown Mafia, those who do not look out of the plane windows
and who eat specially fed pigs, may still be around and at times
may muddy the waters, but they are no longer our main enemy. Even
less so is our main enemy any kind of international Mafia. Our
main enemy today is our own bad traits: indifference to the common
good, vanity, personal ambition, selfishness, and rivalry. The
main struggle will have to be fought on this field. <BR>
There are free elections and an election campaign ahead of us.
Let us not allow this struggle to dirty the sofar clean face of
our gentle revolution. Let us not allow the sympathies of the
world, which we have won so fast, to be equally rapidly lost through
our becoming entangled in the jungle of skirmishes for power.
Let us not allow the desire to serve oneself to bloom once again
under the stately garb of the desire to serve the common good.
It is not really important now which party, club or group prevails
in the elections. The important thing is that the winners will
be the best of us, in the moral, civic, political and professional
sense, regardless of their political affiliations. The future
policies and prestige of our state will depend on the personalities
we select, and later, elect to our representative bodies.<BR>
My dear fellow citizens!<BR>
Three days ago I became the president of the republic as a consequence
of your will, expressed through the deputies of the Federal Assembly.
You have a right to expect me to mention the tasks I see before
me as president.<BR>
The first of these is to use all my power and influence to ensure
that we soon step up to the ballot boxes in a free election, and
that our path toward this historic milestone will be dignified
and peaceful.<BR>
My second task is to guarantee that we approach these elections
as two self-governing nations who respect each other's interests,
national identity, religious traditions, and symbols. As a Czech
who has given his presidential oath to an important Slovak who
is personally close to him, I feel a special obligation -- after
the bitter experiences that Slovaks had in the past -- to see
that all the interests of the Slovak nation are respected and
that no state office, including the highest one, will ever be
barred to it in the future.<BR>
My third task is to support everything that will lead to better
circumstances for our children, the elderly, women, the sick,
the hardworking laborers, the national minorities and all citizens
who are for any reason worse off than others. High-quality food
or hospitals must no longer be a prerogative of the powerful;
they must be available to those who need them the most.<BR>
As supreme commander of the armed forces I want to guarantee that
the defensive capability of our country will no longer be used
as a pretext for anyone to stand in the way of courageous peace
initiatives, the reduction of military service, the establishment
of alternative military service and the overall humanization of
military life.<BR>
In our country there are many prisoners who, though they may have
committed serious crimes and have been punished for them, have
had to submit -- despite the goodwill of some investigators, judges
and above all defense lawyers -- to a debased judiciary process
that curtailed their rights. They now have to live in prisons
that do not strive to awaken the better qualities contained in
every person, but rather humiliate them and destroy them physically
and mentally. In a view of this fact, I have decided to declare
a relatively extensive amnesty. At the same time I call on the
prisoners to understand that forty years of unjust investigations,
trials and imprisonments cannot be put right overnight, and to
understand that the changes that are being speedily prepared still
require time to implement. By rebelling, the prisoners would help
neither society nor themselves. I also call on the public not
to fear the prisoners once they are released, not to make their
lives difficult, to help them, in the Christian spirit, after
their return among us to find within themselves that which jails
could not find in them: the capacity to repent and the desire
to live a respectable life.<BR>
My honorable task is to strengthen the authority of our country
in the world. I would be glad if other states respected us for
showing understanding, tolerance and love for peace. I would be
happy if Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama of Tibet could visit
our country before the elections, if only for a day. I would be
happy if our friendly relations with all nations were strengthened.
I would be happy if we succeeded before the elections in establishing
diplomatic relations with the Vatican and Israel. I would also
like to contribute to peace by briefly visiting our close neighbors,
the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Neither shall I forget our other neighbors -- fraternal Poland
and the ever-closer countries of Hungary and Austria.<BR>
In conclusion, I would like to say that I want to be a president
who will speak less and work more. To be a president who will
not only look out of the windows of his airplane but who, first
and foremost, will always be present among his fellow citizens
and listen to them well.<BR>
You may ask what kind of republic I dream of. Let me reply: I
dream of a republic independent, free, and democratic, of a republic
economically prosperous and yet socially just; in short, of a
humane republic that serves the individual and that therefore
holds the hope that the individual will serve it in turn. Of a
republic of wellrounded people, because without such people it
is impossible to solve any of our problems -- human, economic,
ecological, social, or political.<BR>
The most distinguished of my predecessors opened his first speech
with a quotation from the great Czech educator Komensky. Allow
me to conclude my first speech with my own paraphrase of the same
statement: <BR>
People, your government has returned to you!<BR>

The Polish Sejm and Senate
<H3>Warsaw, January 25, 1990</H3>

</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>
Mr. President,<BR>
Members of the General Staff,<BR>
Members of Parliament and senators,<BR>
Friends,<BR>

<P>
        I am very happy that the first foreign parliament in which
I have the honor to speak is the Polish Sejm. This is no mere
accident. It has special implications, and I assume you are aware
of them.<BR>
        Allow me a brief personal introduction: This is my second
visit to Poland. I was here first as a student in 1957. It was
after your wellknown <I>pazdziernik*, </I>when<I> </I>your country
was alive with joyous hopes, which were so often and so bitterly
disappointed later on. At the time, I was fascinated by everything
Polish. I read Hlasko, Milosz, Herbert, Kolakowski, Brandys and
Adolf Rudnicki, who wrote about the Holocaust, antiSemitism and
the curse of our part of Europe. I saw Wajda's <I>Kanal</I> several
times, and I admired the freethinking Polish spirit and the heroism
that emanated from Polish culture. Somewhere in the depths of
my soul that heroism was closer to me than the eternal skepticism
and, at times, the cult of mediocrity and the underdog that so
frequently surfaces in Czech literature. At that time I was beginning
to write what were referred to as absurd plays, plays full of
skepticism, ridiculous horrors and subtly unhappy endings. Oddly
enough, however, my admiration for the Polish ethos did not clash
with my literary vision of the world.<BR>
        Today  thirty years later  I am here for a second visit,
and moreover I come as the president of Czechoslovakia. This compels
me to ask the question: What has changed in those thirty years
in your country, in our country, and in our part of the world?
<BR>
        A great deal has changed. The most important change is
that the era in which hopes were periodically aroused and disappointed,
the merrygoround of eternal illusion and disillusion, the hellish
dance of freedom with death, has definitively come to an end.
For the first time it appears to be certain that democracy and
freedom, justice and national autonomy are winning, and that the
process taking us there is now irreversible. This certainty derives
chiefly from the fact that our efforts at selfliberation are not
isolated, surrounded by a sea of misunderstanding, but rather
flow together to form a single, common stream. The changes won
by the Polish nation despite all temporary setbacks, the important
changes in the Soviet Union, the attempt to create democratic
conditions in Hungary and the German Democratic Republic, followed
by our own peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia, the heroic and
costly victory of the Romanians over the autocracy of Dracula,
and finally, the changes we are witnessing today in Bulgaria 
all of this flows into a single river that no dam can stop.<BR>
        The idea of manufacturing a paradise on earth did not
triumph, and it will be very difficult now for it ever to do so.
Such a notion could only feed the arrogant minds of those who
are persuaded that they understand everything, that there are
no longer any higher, mysterious institutions above them, and
that they can give directives to history. The idea of a paradise
on earth failed, and there will be many difficult periods ahead
of us; but what has triumphed is the realistic hope that together
we can return to Europe as free, independent and democratic nations.
<BR>
        That too is good. Who among us could have imagined anything
like it a mere twelve years ago?<BR>
        Do you remember, Adam Michnik, Jacek Kuron and Jan Litynski,
our first secret meeting on the CzechoslovakPolish border? At
the time we were all socalled dissidents, that is, people hounded
by the police, arrested, locked up, ridiculed. It's true that
we laughed at our guardians and we delighted in giving them the
slip, but if anyone had told us then that twelve years later we
would be members of parliament, ministers and presidents, we might
have laughed even louder.<BR>
        And yet it happened.<BR>
        The totalitarian systems of the Soviet Bloc are collapsing
and we, who did no more than say aloud what we thought and get
ourselves locked up for it, have suddenly found ourselves in prominent
political positions and now, for the most part, we can laugh only
when the television cameras are not trained upon us.<BR>
        Our main role  and now I am no longer speaking about my
Polish and Czechoslovak friends, but our entire nations  is to
put our minds to what can be done with this freshly won freedom.
Before I try to say a few words about this, I must make a brief
aside.<BR>
        The Czechoslovak revolution, which began with the beating
of students in November but otherwise unfolded surprisingly peacefully
and swiftly, has been called a gentle, kindly, peaceful, and amiable
revolution. Naturally, we are glad that there was so little bloodshed,
but this is all the more reason for us not to forget the peoples
who had to pay for their freedom with blood, and without whose
sacrifices we ourselves could scarcely have awakened to freedom
so quickly and, on the whole, so painlessly. In my New Year's
speech, I have already emphasized  and I'm happy to repeat it
here  that the Hungarians and the Poles bled for us. We are well
aware of this and will not forget it. In a certain sense, the
Romanians paid for our freedom too, even though their revolution
came after ours. We have no way of knowing whether the dark forces
in our country might not have found a way to counterattack had
they not been paralyzed by the Romanian example, which demonstrated
that the population was capable of courageously defending itself.
<BR>
        In short, although no one gave us any direct help in our
revolution  which is a genuine historical novelty in our country
 we know that without the long years of struggle by the Poles,
without the efforts of the nations in the Soviet Union to liberate
themselves, without the memories of the German uprising of 1953
and the Hungarian revolt in 1956, our freshly won freedom and
the relative ease with which it was all carried off, would be
hard to imagine.<BR>
        We also know, of course, that the Polish Solidarity movement,
led by Lech Walesa, was the first to find a peaceful and effective
way to offer continuous resistance to the totalitarian system.
Nor will we forget that it was you, the Polish Senate and the
Sejm, who were the first  in the summer of last year  to condemn
the shameful invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.<BR>
        Allow me therefore to use this occasion to thank you and
the entire Polish nation.<BR>
        I promised to offer some brief thoughts on the tasks that
the new situation has placed before us. <BR>
        There are many of them.<BR>
        First of all, we must take advantage of the fact that
after many long years and decades, the prospect of a genuine friendship
between our nations now lies before us. Ancient conflicts, rivalries,
animosities are covered over by the common experience of totalitarianism.
The socalled &quot;<I>druzba</I>&quot;  that formal and stagemanaged
demonstration of friendship within the framework of the Warsaw
Pact and Comecon  is vanishing along with the totalitarian systems.
Along with them, the covert, quiet and malicious incitement of
nationalistic and selfish tendencies  carried out in the spirit
of &quot;divide and conquer&quot; -- is vanishing as well.<BR>
        The years of similar destinies and struggles for similar
ideals ought therefore to be assessed in the light of genuine
friendship and mutual respect; that is, precisely in the spirit
that dominated the years during which secret independent literature
was smuggled in rucksacks across our common mountain ranges, an
activity that ultimately led to the autumn Festival of Independent
Czechoslovak Culture in Wroclaw, which was such a marvelous success,
mainly thanks to the tireless members of the PolishCzechoslovak
Solidarity Committee led by Zbyszek Janas and Mirek Jasinski.
Unintentionally, this became one of the prologues to our Czechoslovak
revolution.<BR>
        This authentic friendship  based on a proper understanding
of the destiny imposed upon both our countries, on the common
lessons it taught us, and above all on the common ideals that
now unite us  should ultimately inform a proper coordination of
our policies in a process we both refer to as &quot;the return
to Europe.&quot; We should also coordinate our efforts as best
we can with Hungary  where I and my co-workers are going tomorrow
 and with other nations in our part of Europe.<BR>
        We should not compete with each other to gain admission
into the various European organizations. On the contrary, we should
assist each other in the same spirit of solidarity with which,
in darker days, you protested against our persecution as we did
against yours.<BR>
        It is too early to predict what institutional forms our
coordination in Eastern and Central Europe will take. Western
Europe is considerably ahead of us in the integrating processes,
and if each of us were to return to Europe separately, it could
take a great deal longer and would be far more complex a process
than if we proceed in a coordinated fashion. This concerns not
only economics; it concerns everything, including disarmament
talks. <BR>
         Very soon, I would like to invite various representatives
of the state and the public from Poland and Hungary, perhaps with
observers from other Central European countries, to a meeting
in the Bratislava Castle, where we could spend a day quietly talking
about these matters. Perhaps this would again make us somewhat
wiser.<BR>
        One way or the other, one thing is certain: For the first
time in history, we have a real opportunity to fill the great
political vacuum that appeared in Central Europe after the collapse
of the Hapsburg Empire with something genuinely meaningful. We
have an opportunity to transform Central Europe from what has
been a mainly historical and spiritual phenomenon into a political
phenomenon. We have an opportunity to take this wreath of European
states  so recently colonized by the Soviet Union and now attempting
to build a relationship with the nations of the Soviet Union based
on equality  and fashion it into a special body. Then we can approach
the richer nations of Western Europe, not as poor failures or
helpless, recently amnestied prisoners, but as countries that
can make a genuine contribution. What we have to offer are spiritual
and moral impulses, courageous peace initiatives, under-exploited
creative potential, and the special ethos created by our freshly
won freedom. We can offer the inspiration to consider swift and
daring solutions.<BR>
        We have awakened, and now we must arouse those in the
West who have slept through our awakening. The more coordinated
our approach, the better we will be able to achieve our ends.
<BR>
        If we are thinking of ways to synchronize or coordinate
our steps on the road to Europe, we must naturally be clear about
what ought to be at the end of that road. In other words, what
kind of Europe are we really heading toward?<BR>
        The general ideal is perhaps clear to all of us: We wish
to belong to a Europe that is an amicable community of independent
nations and democratic states, a Europe that is stabilized, not
divided into blocs and pacts, a Europe that does not need to be
defended by superpowers because it is capable of defending itself,
of building its own security system.<BR>
        There is hope that the Soviet Union  in the interests
of good relations with its former satellites  will gradually withdraw
its troops from our territories. The appropriate negotiations
are already under way, and they will sooner or later lead to success.
<BR>
        I believe that the Helsinki process provides us with a
rather good starting point. If it were to be accelerated and intensified
 along with various disarmament negotiations and unilateral disarmament
initiatives  it may grow in time into something that would serve
the function of a peace conference or a peace treaty to make a
definitive end to the Second World War, as well as to the Cold
War and the artificial division of Europe that grew out of the
Second World War. Then both military alliances could be dissolved,
and the process of panEuropean integration could be finally set
in motion.<BR>
        So far, Europe remains divided. Germany, too, is divided.
These are two sides of the same coin. It is hard to imagine an
undivided Europe containing a divided Germany, just as it is hard
to imagine a united Germany in a divided Europe. Obviously then,
both unification processes should take place at the same time
 and as quickly as possible.<BR>
        Thus one of the keys to a peaceful Europe lies at its
very center  in Germany. The Germans have done much for all of
us. It was they who began to tear down the wall that separated
us from the ideal we longed for, the ideal of a Europe without
any iron curtains or barbed-wire fences.<BR>
        Shortly after being elected president, aware of the current
significance that the German question has for all of us, and aware
at the same time that without peace in Germany none of us will
live in peace, I spent several hours in both German states to
determine how the Germans themselves see their situation and the
situation in Europe and, at the same time, to stress how closely
the future destiny of us all is linked with the future destiny
of Germany.<BR>
        I was favorably impressed. Reasonable people in both German
states want the same thing we all want: a peaceful evolution toward
a democratic and peaceful Europe.<BR>
        I believe this is also good news for you, who sacrificed
many more human lives in the Second World War than we did, and
are therefore justifiably less trusting of the Germans than I
am  even though, for the most part, they are now only the descendants
of the generation who murdered your people.<BR>
        Yet I cannot hide the fact that many of my Czechoslovak
compatriots are less trusting than I am, and it was for them,
too, that I went first to Germany. I resolved to try  within the
bounds of my modest possibilities  to spread trust in today's
distrustful world.<BR>
        On the subject of Germany, it is my pleasant duty to assure
you that democratic Czechoslovakia also considers the border on
the Oder and the Neisse rivers as final and inviolable.<BR>
        In general, I believe that borders in the future Europe
should become less and less important, that people should be able
to move freely from one country to another, and that this should
be true, first of all, of our common border.<BR>
        What should not flow across our borders is toxic smoke,
sulphur and acid clouds, whether it be from Stonava or Turoszow.
<BR>
        There are, however, walls more dangerous than those that
divide Europe. There are walls that divide individual people from
one another, and there are walls that divide our own souls. It
is against these walls above all that I would like to struggle,
and this concerns mainly my own country.<BR>
        The most dangerous enemies of a good cause today are no
longer the dark forces of totalitarianism, with its hostile and
plotting mafias, but our own bad qualities. My presidential program,
therefore, is to bring into politics a sense of culture, of moral
responsibility, of humanity, of humility and respect for the fact
that there is something higher above us, that our behavior is
not lost in the black hole of time but is written down and evaluated
somewhere, that we have neither the right nor the reason to think
that we understand everything and have license to do anything
we wish.<BR>
        I think that Poles, with your strong religiousness, embodied
in the marvelous personality of the Pope you have given to the
world, can have a special understanding of this modest presidential
intention of mine.<BR>
        Thirty years ago I spent two weeks on the north coast.
<BR>
        Today I find myself in Warsaw, the courageous heart of
Poland.<BR>
        I would be glad if this meant that not only I personally,
but above all the movements and the ideas I represent, are considerably
closer today to the Polish heart.<BR>
        I thank you for your attention.<BR>
        <BR>
        JESZCZE POLSKA NIE ZGINELA!**<BR>

<P>
Dear Mr. Speaker, <BR>
Dear Mr. President, <BR>
Dear senators and members of the House, <BR>
Ladies and gentlemen:<BR>
        <BR>
        My advisors have advised me, on this important occasion,
to speak in Czech. I don't know why. Perhaps they wanted you to
enjoy the sound of my mother tongue.<BR>
        The last time they arrested me, on October 27 of last
year, I didn't know whether it was for two days or two years.
Exactly one month later, when rock musician Michael Kocab told
me that I would probably be proposed as a presidential candidate,
I thought it was one of his usual jokes.<BR>
        On the 10th of December 1989, when my actor friend Ji_i
Bartoska, in the name of the Civic Forum, nominated me as a candidate
for the office of the president of the republic, I thought it
was out of the question that the Parliament we had inherited from
the previous regime would elect me.<BR>
        Twelve days later, when I was unanimously elected president
of my country, I had no idea that in two months I would be speaking
in front of this famous and powerful assembly, and that I would
be heard by millions of people who have never heard of me and
that hundreds of politicians and political scientists would study
every word I say.<BR>
        When they arrested me on October 27, I was living in a
country ruled by the most conservative Communist government in
Europe, and our society slumbered beneath the pall of a totalitarian
system. Today, less than four months later, I am speaking to you
as the representative of a country which has complete freedom
of speech, which is preparing for free elections, and which seeks
to establish a prosperous market economy and its own foreign policy.
<BR>
        It is all very extraordinary indeed.<BR>
        But I have not come here to speak about myself or my feelings,
or merely to talk about my own country. I have used this small
example of something I know well to illustrate something general
and important.<BR>
        We are living in extraordinary times. The human face of
the world is changing so rapidly that none of the familiar political
speedometers are adequate.<BR>
        We playwrights, who have to cram a whole human life or
an entire historical era into a twohour play, can scarcely understand
this rapidity ourselves. And if it gives us trouble, think of
the trouble it must give to political scientists, who spend their
whole lives studying the realm of the probable and have even less
experience with the realm of the improbable than playwrights.
<BR>
        Let me try to explain why I think the velocity of the
changes in my country, in Central and Eastern Europe, and of course
in the Soviet Union itself, has made such a significant impression
on the world today, and why it concerns the fate of us all, including
Americans. I would like to look at this, first from the political
point of view and then from a point of view we might call philosophical.
<BR>
        Twice in this century, the world has been threatened by
a catastrophe. Twice this catastrophe was born in Europe, and
twice Americans, along with others, were called upon to save Europe,
the whole world and yourselves. The first rescue provided significant
help to Czechs and Slovaks.<BR>
        Thanks to the great support of your President Wilson,
our first President, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, was able to found
a modern independent state. He founded it, as you know, on the
same principles on which the United States of America had been
founded, as Masaryk's manuscripts held by the Library of Congress
testify.<BR>
        At the same time, the United States made enormous strides.
It became the most powerful nation on earth, and it understood
the responsibility that flowed from this. Proof of this are the
hundreds of thousands of your young citizens who gave their lives
for the liberation of Europe, and the graves of American airmen
and soldiers on Czechoslovak soil.<BR>
        But something else was happening as well: The Soviet Union
appeared, grew, and transformed the enormous sacrifices of its
people suffering under totalitarian rule into a strength that,
after World War II, made it the second most powerful nation in
the world. It was a country that rightly gave people nightmares,
because no one knew what would happen and when to worsen the mood
of its rulers, and what country it would decide to conquer and
drag into its sphere of influence, as it is called in political
language.<BR>
        All of this taught us to see the world in bipolar terms,
as two enormous forces, one a defender of freedom, the other a
source of nightmares. Europe became the point of friction between
these two powers, and thus it turned into a single enormous arsenal
divided into two parts. In this process, one half of the arsenal
became part of that nightmarish power, while the other  the free
part  bordering on the ocean and having no wish to be driven into
it, was compelled, together with you, to build a complicated security
system, to which we probably owe the fact that we still exist.
<BR>
        So you may have contributed to the salvation of us Europeans,
of the world and thus of yourselves for a third time: You have
helped us to survive until today  without a hot war this time,
merely a cold one.<BR>
        And now the totalitarian system in the Soviet Union and
in most of its satellites is breaking down, and our nations are
looking for a way to democracy and independence. The first act
in this remarkable drama began when Mr. Gorbachev and those around
him, faced with the sad reality in their country, initiated the
policy of &quot;perestroika.&quot; Apparently they too had no
idea what they were setting in motion or how rapidly events would
unfold. We knew a great deal about the enormous number of growing
problems that slumbered beneath the honeyed, unchanging mask of
socialism. But I don't think any of us knew how little it would
take for these problems to manifest themselves in all their enormity,
and for the longings of these nations to emerge in all their strength.
The mask fell away so rapidly that, in the flood of work, we have
had literally no time even to be astonished.<BR>
        What does all this mean for the world in the long run?
Obviously a number of things. This is, I am firmly convinced,
a historically irreversible process, and as a result Europe will
begin again to seek its own identity without being compelled to
be a divided armory any longer. Perhaps this will create the hope
that sooner or later your young men will no longer have to stand
on guard for freedom in Europe or come to our rescue, because
Europe will at last be able to stand guard over itself.<BR>
        But that is still not the most important thing. The main
thing is, it seems to me, that these revolutionary changes will
enable us to escape from the rather antiquated straitjacket of
this bipolar view of the world, and to enter at last into an era
of multipolarity. That is, into an era in which all of us, large
and small, former slaves and former masters, will be able to create
what your great President Lincoln called &quot;the family of man&quot;.
Can you imagine what a relief this would be to that part of the
world which for some reason is called the Third World, even though
it is the largest?<BR>
        I don't think it's appropriate simply to generalize, so
let me be specific:<BR>
        1) As you certainly know, most of the big wars and other
European conflagrations over the centuries have traditionally
begun and ended on the territory of modern Czechoslovakia, or
else they were somehow related to that area. Let the Second World
War stand as the most recent example. This is understandable.
Whether we like it or not, we are located in the very heart of
Europe, and thanks to this, we have no view of the sea, and no
real navy. I mention this because political stability in our country
has traditionally been important for the whole of Europe. This
is still true today. Our government of national understanding,
our present Federal Assembly, the other bodies of the state, and
I myself, will personally guarantee this stability until we hold
free elections, planned for June.<BR>
        We understand the terribly complex reasons, domestic political
reasons above all, why the Soviet Union cannot withdraw its troops
from our territory as quickly as they arrived in 1968. We understand
that the arsenals built there over the past twenty years cannot
be dismantled and removed overnight. Nevertheless, in our bilateral
negotiations with the Soviet Union, we would like to have as many
Soviet units as possible moved out of our country before the elections,
in the interests of political stability. The more successful our
negotiations, the more those who are elected will be able to guarantee
political stability in our country even after the elections.<BR>
        2) I often hear the question: How can the United States
of America help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole
of my life has been: You can help us most of all if you help the
Soviet Union on its irreversible, but immensely complicated, road
to democracy. It is far more complicated than the road open to
its former European satellites. You yourselves probably know best
how to support, as rapidly as possible, the nonviolent evolution
of this enormous, multinational body politic toward democracy
and autonomy for all of its peoples. Therefore, it is not fitting
for me to offer you any advice. I can only say that the sooner,
the more quickly, and the more peacefully the Soviet Union begins
to move along the road toward genuine political pluralism, respect
for the rights of nations to their own integrity and to a working
 that is a market  economy, the better it will be, not just for
Czechs and Slovaks, but for the whole world. And the sooner you
yourselves will be able to reduce the burden of the military budget
born by the American people. To put it metaphorically, the millions
you give to the East today soon will return to you in the form
of billions in savings.<BR>
        3) It is not true that the Czech writer Vaclav Havel wishes
to dissolve the Warsaw Pact tomorrow and then NATO the day after
that, as some eager journalists have written. Vaclav Havel merely
thinks what he has already said here, that American soldiers shouldn't
have to be separated from their mothers for another hundred years
just because Europe is incapable of being a guarantor of world
peace, which it ought to be, to make at least some amends for
having given the world two world wars.<BR>
        Sooner or later Europe must recover and come into its
own, and decide for itself how many of those soldiers it needs,
so that its own security, and all the wider implications of security,
may radiate peace into the whole world. Vaclav Havel cannot make
decisions about things it is not proper for him to decide. He
is merely putting in a good word for genuine peace, and for achieving
it quickly.<BR>
        4) Czechoslovakia thinks that the planned summit of countries
participating in the Helsinki process should take place soon,
and that in addition to what it wants to accomplish, it should
aim to hold the socalled Helsinki II conference earlier than 1992,
as originally planned. Above all, we feel it could be something
far more significant than has so far seemed possible. We think
that Helsinki II should become something equivalent to a European
peace conference, which has not yet been held; one that would
finally put a formal end to the Second World War and all its unhappy
consequences. Such a conference would officially bring a future
democratic Germany, in the process of unifying itself, into a
new panEuropean structure which could decide about its own security
system. This would naturally require some connection with that
part of the globe we might label the &quot;Helsinki&quot; part,
stretching westward from Vladivostok and all the way to Alaska.
The borders of the European states, which by the way should become
gradually less important, should finally be legally guaranteed
by a common, regular treaty. It should be more than obvious that
the basis for such a treaty would have to be general respect for
human rights, genuine political pluralism and genuinely free elections.
<BR>
        5) Naturally, we welcome the initiative of President Bush,
which was essentially accepted by Mr. Gorbachev as well, according
to which the number of American and Soviet troops in Europe should
be radically reduced. It is a magnificent shot in the arm for
the Vienna disarmament talks and creates favorable conditions
not only for our own efforts to achieve the quickest possible
departure of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia, but, indirectly
as well, for our own intention to make considerable cuts in the
Czechoslovak army, which is disproportionately large in relation
to our population. If Czechoslovakia were forced to defend itself
against anyone, which we hope will not happen, then it would be
capable of doing so with a considerably smaller army, because
this time its defense would be  not only after decades but even
centuries  supported by the common and indivisible will of both
of its nations and its leadership. Our freedom, independence and
our newborn democracy have been purchased at great cost, and we
will not surrender them. For the sake of order, I should add that
whatever steps we take are not intended to complicate the Vienna
disarmament talks, but on the contrary, to facilitate them.<BR>
        6) Czechoslovakia is returning to Europe. In the general
interest and its own interest as well, it wants to coordinate
this return  both political and economic  with the other returnees,
which means, above all, with its neighbors the Poles and the Hungarians.
We are doing what we can to coordinate these returns. And at the
same time, we are doing what we can so that Europe will be capable
of really accepting us, its wayward children, which means that
it may open itself to us and may begin to transform its structures
 which are formally European but de facto Western European  in
that direction, but in such a way that it will not be to its detriment
but rather to its advantage.<BR>
        7) I have already said this in our Parliament, and I would
like to repeat it here, in this Congress, which is architecturally
far more attractive: For many years, Czechoslovakia  as someone's
meaningless satellite  has refused to face up honestly to its
co-responsibility for the world. It has a lot to make up for.
If I dwell on this and so many important things here, it is only
because I feel  along with my fellow citizens  a sense of culpability
for our former reprehensible passivity and a rather ordinary sense
of indebtedness.<BR>
        8) Last but not least, we are of course delighted that
your country is so readily lending its support to our fresh efforts
to renew democracy. Both our peoples were deeply moved by the
generous offers made a few days ago in Prague at the Charles University,
one of the oldest in Europe, by your secretary of state, Mr. James
Baker. We are ready to sit down and talk about them.<BR>
        Ladies and gentlemen, I've only been president for two
months, and I haven't attended any schools for presidents. My
only school was life itself. Therefore, I don't want to burden
you any longer with my political thoughts, but instead I will
move on to an area that is more familiar to me, to what I would
call the philosophical aspect of those changes that still concern
everyone, although they are taking place in our corner of the
world.<BR>
        As long as people are people, democracy in the full sense
of the word will always be no more than an ideal; one may approach
it as one would a horizon, in ways that may be better or worse,
but it can never be fully attained. In this sense you are also
merely approaching democracy. You have thousands of problems of
all kinds, as other countries do. But you have one great advantage:
You have been approaching democracy uninterruptedly for more than
200 years, and your journey toward that horizon has never been
disrupted by a totalitarian system. Czechs and Slovaks, despite
their humanistic traditions that go back to the first millennium,
have approached democracy for a mere twenty years, between the
two world wars, and now for three and a half months since the
17th of November of last year.<BR>
        The advantage that you have over us is obvious at once.
<BR>
        The Communist type of totalitarian system has left both
our nations, Czech and Slovaks  as it has all the nations of the
Soviet Union, and the other countries the Soviet Union subjugated
in its time  a legacy of countless dead, an infinite spectrum
of human suffering, profound economic decline, and above all enormous
human humiliation. It has brought us horrors that fortunately
you have not known.<BR>
        At the same time, however  unintentionally, of course
 it has given us something positive: a special capacity to look,
from time to time, somewhat further than someone who has not undergone
this bitter experience. A person who cannot move and live a normal
life because he is pinned under a boulder has more time to think
about his hopes than someone who is not trapped in this way.<BR>
        What I am trying to say is this: We must all learn many
things from you, from how to educate our offspring, how to elect
our representatives, all the way to how to organize our economic
life so that it will lead to prosperity and not poverty. But it
doesn't have to be merely assistance from the welleducated, the
powerful and the wealthy to someone who has nothing to offer in
return.<BR>
        We too can offer something to you: our experience and
the knowledge that has come from it.<BR>
        This is a subject for books, many of which have already
been written and many of which have yet to be written. I shall
therefore limit myself to a single idea.<BR>
        The specific experience I'm talking about has given me
one great certainty: Consciousness precedes Being, and not the
other way around, as Marxists claim.<BR>
        For this reason, the salvation of this human world lies
nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect,
in human humbleness and in human responsibility.<BR>
        Without a global revolution in the sphere of human consciousness,
nothing will change for the better in the sphere of our Being
as humans, and the catastrophe toward which this world is headed,
whether it be ecological, social, demographic or a general breakdown
of civilization, will be unavoidable. If we are no longer threatened
by world war or by the danger that the absurd mountains of accumulated
nuclear weapons might blow up the world, this does not mean that
we have definitively won. We are in fact far from definite victory.
<BR>
        We are still a long way from that &quot;family of man;&quot;
in fact, we seem to be receding from the ideal rather than drawing
closer to it. Interests of all kinds: personal, selfish, state,
national, group and, if you like, company interests still considerably
outweigh genuinely common and global interests. We are still under
the sway of the destructive and thoroughly vain belief that man
is the pinnacle of creation, and not just a part of it, and that
therefore everything is permitted. There are still many who say
they are concerned not for themselves but for the cause, while
they are demonstrably out for themselves and not for the cause
at all. We are still destroying the planet that was entrusted
to us, and its environment. We still close our eyes to the growing
social, ethnic and cultural conflicts in the world. From time
to time we say that the anonymous megamachinery we have created
for ourselves no longer serves us but rather has enslaved us,
yet we still fail to do anything about it.<BR>
        In other words, we still don't know how to put morality
ahead of politics, science and economics. We are still incapable
of understanding that the only genuine backbone of all our actions
 if they are to be moral  is responsibility. Responsibility to
something higher than my family, my country, my firm, my success.
Responsibility to the order of Being, where all our actions are
indelibly recorded and where, and only where, they will be properly
judged.<BR>
        The interpreter or mediator between us and this higher
authority is what is traditionally referred to as human conscience.
<BR>
        If I subordinate my political behavior to this imperative,
I can't go far wrong. If on the contrary I were not guided by
this voice, not even ten presidential schools with 2,000 of the
best political scientists in the world could help me.<BR>
        This is why I ultimately decided  after resisting for
a long time  to accept the burden of political responsibility.
<BR>
        I'm not the first nor will I be the last intellectual
to do this. On the contrary, my feeling is that there will be
more and more of them all the time. If the hope of the world lies
in human consciousness, then it is obvious that intellectuals
cannot go on forever avoiding their share of responsibility for
the world and hiding their distastes for politics under an alleged
need to be independent.<BR>
        It is easy to have independence in your program and then
leave others to carry out that program. If everyone thought that
way, soon no one would be independent.<BR>
        I think that Americans should understand this way of thinking.
Wasn't it the best minds of your country, people you could call
intellectuals, who wrote your famous Declaration of Independence,
your Bill of Rights and your Constitution and who  above all 
took upon themselves the practical responsibility for putting
them into practice? The worker from Branik in Prague, whom your
president referred to in his State of the Union message this year,
is far from being the only person in Czechoslovakia, let alone
in the world, to be inspired by those great documents. They inspire
us all. They inspire us despite the fact that they are over 200
years old. They inspire us to be citizens.<BR>
        When Thomas Jefferson wrote that &quot;Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the Consent
of the Governed,&quot; it was a simple and important act of the
human spirit.<BR>
        What gave meaning to that act, however, was the fact that
the author backed it up with his life. It was not just his words,
it was his deeds as well.<BR>
        I will end where I began. History has accelerated. I believe
that once again, it will be the human spirit that will notice
this acceleration, give it a name, and transform those words into
deeds.<BR>

The Visit of German President Richard von Weizs&auml;cker
<H4>Prague, March 15, 1990</H4>

</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Mr. President, <BR>
Ladies and gentlemen, <BR>
Dear friends,<BR>

<P>
        A certain madman in boots crushed our first attempt at
a democratic state when on March 15, 1939, he burst into this
castle to announce to the world that violence had triumphed over
freedom and human dignity.<BR>
        A herald of war burst in here. A herald of crudeness.
A herald of lies. A herald of pride and evil, lawlessness and
cruelty. A mass murderer burst in here. A murderer of nations.
<BR>
        Who let this interloper in? Who allowed him to desecrate
these venerable halls?<BR>
        Above all, it was some of his fellow citizens, who had
succumbed to his primitive appeal to the treacherous side of their
feelings, to archetypical visions and to their national and social
aspirations.<BR>
        Moreover, it was the infinite shortsightedness of the
governments of France and England at the time, which thought they
would preserve peace by opening the door to that herald of war.
<BR>
        And finally, it was our own leaders' fear of standing
up to a numerically superior force, their fear of risking great
misunderstanding and great sacrifice. Their fear was perhaps even
tinged with a vague sense of common responsibility for the belittling
attitude our former state had toward the rights of its national
minorities. This undoubtedly influenced the fact that so many
Czechoslovak citizens of German origin conspired with that madman
against their own state.<BR>
        His war against the civilized world did not begin until
September 2, 1939, but the proclamation of that war actually took
place on March 15. And it happened here, in the Prague Castle.
<BR>
        Today, as we stand at the beginning of our second attempt
at democracy, and recall what happened here fifty-one years ago,
we welcome a different guest to this castle.<BR>
        This guest is a representative of German democracy. A
herald of peace. A herald of decency. A herald of truth. A herald
of humanity. A bearer of the news that violence may never again
prevail over freedom, lies over truth, and evil over human life.
<BR>
        A man who said that nothing may be forgotten, because
memory is the source of belief in redemption.<BR>
        Fiftyone years ago, an enemy broke in uninvited. Today,
a friend is here at our invitation.<BR>
        That former visit brought the death of our prewar democracy.
Today's visit heralds our new democracy.<BR>
        That former visit marked the beginning of all our recent
misfortunes. Today's visit coincides with their end.<BR>
        The interloper opened the way to subjugation. Today's
guest is here to congratulate us on our freshly acquired freedom.
<BR>
        I believe this is an important day in several respects.
<BR>
        Above all, it could be the beginning of a new act in the
1,000year-old CzechGerman drama, in which the themes of tension,
discord and struggle have been constantly and indivisibly knit
together with the themes of fertile coexistence and deep mutual
influence. In this new act, the latter group of themes could finally
 after the bitter experience of the recent past  predominate over
the former.<BR>
        The time is ripe for us to shake hands at last with a
friendly smile, certain that we no longer have reason to fear
each other, because we are connected by mutual respect for human
life, human rights, civil liberties, and general peace, a respect
we have paid for dearly.<BR>
        This common starting point opens a great horizon of potential
cooperation. We can strive jointly for a democratic Europe, for
a Europe that represents unity in diversity, for a Europe that
does not give the world wars but radiates tolerance, for a Europe
that draws on its best cultural traditions, for a Europe that
no one will contaminate any longer with toxic fumes and poisoned
water.<BR>
        We agree that the basic prerequisite for a genuine friendship
between our nations is truth, a truth that is always expressed,
no matter how hard.<BR>
        Our guest has already spoken hard truths about the pain
that the world in general, and we in particular, have suffered
as a result of the Germans, or, more precisely, the forbear of
presentday Germans.<BR>
        Have we, too, managed to say everything that ought to
be said from our side? I am not sure.<BR>
        Six years of Nazi rule was enough, for example, for us
to allow ourselves be infected with the germ of evil. We informed
on one another, both during and after the war; we accepted  in
just, as well as exaggerated, indignation  the principle of collective
guilt. Instead of giving all those who betrayed this state a proper
trial, we drove them out of the country and punished them with
the kind of retribution that went beyond the rule of law. This
was not punishment. It was revenge.<BR>
        Moreover, we did not expel these people on the basis of
demonstrable individual guilt, but simply because they belonged
to a certain nation. And thus, on the assumption that we were
clearing the way for historical justice, we hurt many innocent
people, most of all women and children. And, as is usually the
case in history, we hurt ourselves even more: We settled accounts
with totalitarianism in a way that allowed totalitarianism into
our own activities and thus into our own souls. Shortly afterward,
it returned to us cruelly in the form of our inability to resist
a new totalitarianism imported from elsewhere. And what is more,
many of us actively helped it into the world.<BR>
        But in other respects, too, the decision of those days
after the war did not serve us well. We devastated large tracts
of our land, and let the weed of devastation into our whole country.
<BR>
        Sacrifices that will be demanded for redress will therefore
also be taxes for the errors and sins of our fathers.<BR>
        We cannot reverse history, and so, besides freely investigating
the truth, we can only do one thing. We can extend a friendly
welcome to those who come with peace in their hearts to bow before
the graves of their ancestors or to see what is left of the villages
where they were born.<BR>
        The relationship of Germany to the family of European
nations and the relationship of this family to Germany  if only
with respect to its size, strength, and central position  has
traditionally been the most important element of European stability.
<BR>
        This still holds true today. The whole of Europe must
be grateful to the Germans for beginning to tear down the wall
that divided them, because with that they also began tearing down
the wall that divides Europe.  Despite this, many Europeans still
fear a united Germany.<BR>
        This gives Germans, I believe, a great historical opportunity.
It is largely up to them to dispel the fears of other Europeans.
If, for instance, they unambiguously confirm the final validity
of all existing borders, including those with Poland, or if they
stand up to all those who still have the audacity to flirt with
Nazi ideology, they will do much to allay Europe's fears and encourage
its speedy unification.<BR>
        It is also incumbent upon the Germans to determine whether
their unification becomes the welcome engine of a panEuropean
unification, or whether, on the contrary, it slows the process
down. In their own interest, they ought to engage that famous
love of order. If they work in haste or confusion, especially
if this is merely the product of electoral politics, it will not
increase Germany's trustworthiness.<BR>
        If, on the other hand, the process unfolds rationally,
it will be possible to look forward to the day all of Europe has
been yearning to see for a long time: the day when the Second
World War and all its unfortunate consequences will finally be
put behind us  including the division of Europe into halves and
the two gigantic pyramids of weapons it became. If the process
unfolds rationally and in an atmosphere of mutual understanding,
this could even happen next year, and it will definitely be better
than the former settlement at Versailles. Europe will then, at
last, be set to realize its old dream: to be an amicable union
of free nations and democratic states, founded on mutual respect
for all human rights. The forty-five years since the end of the
war are a sufficiently long interval to make possible a genuinely
wise agreement, one no longer made in anger, regardless of how
understandable that anger may once have been.<BR>
        Clearly, the future fate of us all once more depends primarily
on German developments.<BR>
        Is it any wonder that the newly born, democratic Czechoslovakia
is so interested in events in both German states?<BR>
        Is it any wonder that on the third day after my election
as president, I visited both German states?<BR>
        Is it any wonder that we are so happy to welcome at the
Prague Castle a guest who embodies the best spiritual traditions
of Germany?<BR>
        Is it any wonder that we place such great importance on
this day, when two nations who lived for so long in mutual distrust
symbolically shake hands?<BR>
        I was speaking about the historic tasks facing Germany
today. I must also, therefore, say what we ourselves must do.
<BR>
        Even after everything that has happened, there is still
much fear of Germans and a greater Germany. There are people still
living who have experienced the war, lost their loved ones, suffered
in concentration camps, hid from the Gestapo. Their mistrust is
understandable, and it is completely natural that it has been
transferred to others.<BR>
        It follows that our task is to overcome this fear. We
have to understand that it was not the German nation that caused
our agony, but particular human individuals. Spite, blind obedience,
indifference to our fellow man - all these are characteristics
of people, not of nations. Were there not more than a few bad
Czechs and Slovaks? Were there not among us many who informed
to the Gestapo and, later, to the secret police? Was there not
in us a large degree of indifference and selfishness, in allowing
our country to be devastated over years and decades, while we
remained silent so as not to lose our bonuses and our peace and
quiet by the television screen even when there was no longer the
threat  at least in recent times  of death, or often, even of
prison! And when all is said and done, were we not actually the
very ones who performed this baneful work?<BR>
        It was, in fact, the Nazis who treacherously identified
their affairs with the affairs of Germany. We cannot follow in
their footsteps! If we accepted their lie as our own, we would
only be passing the torch of their destructive errors on to others.
<BR>
        People who speak a different language are occasionally
detestable to other nations, especially if it is the language
spoken by a tyrant. But a language cannot be blamed for the tyrant
who speaks it. To judge someone on the basis of his language,
the color of his skin, his origin, or the shape of his nose is
to be, consciously or unconsciously, a racist. To speak abusively
about Germans in general, about Vietnamese, or about members of
any other nation, is to condemn them merely for their nationality.
To fear them only for that reason is the same as being antiSemitic.
<BR>
        In other words, to accept the idea of collective guilt
and collective responsibility means directly or unwittingly to
weaken the guilt or the responsibility of individuals. And that
is very dangerous. Just remember how many of us evaded our individual
responsibility by saying that we Czechs are simply this way or
that way and will probably never change. This type of thinking
is the subtle embryo of nihilism.<BR>
        Obviously, there are things that differentiate Czechs
or Slovaks from others, as well as from ourselves. We have different
preferences, different tastes, different dreams, different memories,
and different experiences. Simply being Czech or Slovak or German
or Vietnamese or Jewish does not make us good or bad.<BR>
        To impose the guilt of some Germans upon the entire German
nation means absolving those particular individuals of their guilt
and, with a pessimistic fatalism, submerging them in an irresponsible
anonymity. And to take any kind of hope away from ourselves. It
would be the same if someone were to call us Stalinists, as a
nation. Suffering obliges one to practice justice, not injustice.
Those who have really suffered usually know that.<BR>
        The gift of forgiveness, and thus freedom from one's own
anger, can flourish only on the terrain of justice.<BR>
        This day strikes me as important for one more reason.
I do not know whether, in a future multipolar world, a unified
Germany will still be called a great power. In one sense it has
long been a potential great power: as one of the possible pillars
of European spirituality, which  if it wishes to  can help us
all withstand the destructive pressure of technological civilization,
with its stupefying dictatorship of consumerism and its omnipresent
commercialism, a pressure that leads precisely to the alienation
that German philosophers have so often analyzed.<BR>
        If Germany definitively builds and confirms its statehood,
to which it has traditionally exerted its systematic, hierarchymaking
spirit and with which has occupied itself for so long, then it
will be able, without inhibition, to devote its creative potential
to the renewal of global human responsibility, the only possible
salvation of the contemporary world, thus to a task to which the
spirit of the German intellectual tradition is so well-suited.
<BR>
        If today is another small step toward understanding in
the center of Europe, then at the same time it can be a small
step to awaken us all from the drugged sleep that unscrupulous
materialism throws us into daily, the consequence of which is
the feeling of indifference to what comes after us. <BR>
        Dear friends, <BR>
        I see today's visit of President Richard von Weizs&auml;cker
in Prague as the genuine opposite pole of that long-ago and painful
visit we recall today.<BR>
        While that visit portended approaching horror and intensifying
hopelessness, today's visit represents a great hope for us all.
Hope for a world whose center will be the individual human being
who fixes his searching gaze on the heavens to draw that mysterious
strength which alone is capable of bringing moral order to our
souls.<BR>
        This is the very thing that can be the main guarantee
of a meaningful, human future.<BR>

<H2>A Meeting of Leaders from Three Neighboring Countries</H2>

<H3>Bratislava Castle, April 9, 1990</H3>

<P>
Dear guests,<BR>
Dear friends,<BR>

<P>
      It is difficult for me to express how great a pleasure it
is for me today to welcome so many important people to this castle,
this wellknown historical site in Bratislava and the symbolic
center of Slovakia. You yourselves know best how complicated it
was for you to arrange to meet here, and I am sure, therefore,
that you can understand my pleasure.<BR>
        First of all, a few words about the composition of this
assembly. Present here are the highest representatives of three
neighboring countries: Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Representatives
of the important political forces of those three countries are
also present. Finally, the foreign ministers of three other countries
geographically and politically close to us  Austria, Italy, and
Yugoslavia  are here. Some of us here, public servants in Poland,
Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, hold high state office; others will
perhaps hold them after us. Because we are interested in the future
of our nations and states and not in personal political prospects,
this brutal assault on the usual diplomatic protocol will not
bother us.<BR>
        The newspapers say that I am an unconventional president.
If you like, you can attribute this assault on protocol to my
unconventionality. It doesn't bother me, of course, but may I
take the liberty of adding that a far more important reason for
this is what I would call the radical &quot;unconventionality&quot;
of this historic moment. It is a moment when history in our part
of the world has suddenly begun to rush forward with a speed that
has not only shocked politicians and political scientists, but
also demolished all &quot;protocol&quot; imposed upon history
by our common intellectual stereotypes. I feel that you all understand
these musings of mine, because I consider you my friends, regardless
of the fact that there are among you several individuals whom
I know only from their work.<BR>
        Let me first say a few things about the genesis of this
meeting. When I visited Hungary and Poland shortly after my election
and had the chance to speak with most of you, and after that,
when messrs. Mock, de Michelis, and Lon_ar each visited in quick
succession, I discovered two surprising things: first, that I
spoke with everyone, though in different variations, about the
same thing; and second, that whenever we were in the best part
of the conversation and I felt like talking on into the night,
the protocol people would come running up to me and say that I
had to leave immediately to resume a halffinished conversation
with someone else, someone who had not been present at the previous
discussion and who then had to waste his precious time listening
to a brief recapitulation of the preceding discussion.<BR>
        I had only been in so-called high politics a few days
and was still not accustomed to political and diplomatic protocol,
and I thought: How much more efficient it would be if we could
all continue the halffinished conversation together, without being
interrupted by the protocol people and their protocol. Many people
said it couldn't be done, and that I had gone mad. And look: it
can be done, and we are all sitting here together. Of course I
don't consider this the victory of an unconventional president
over conventions, but the victory of reason over the political
stereotypes to which inertia tries to fetter us.<BR>
        The mere fact that we are meeting like this is our first
success. I firmly believe that it will not be the only achievement
of today's meeting.<BR>
        The genesis of our meeting also reveals something about
its intention. That intention is simple: to continue our halffinished
discussion on how to keep pace with history.<BR>
        To further the discussion, I would like to introduce several
questions, because, as we have known since the time of Socrates,
the best way to open a debate is to ask a question.<BR>
        Before I pose these questions, however, there is one thing
I must say. If we come close to a single answer to any of the
questions I submit here, the meeting will have been a marvelous
success. If we come close to answers to all the questions, it
will have been an almost fantastic success. But  and this is the
most important thing  if we come to no conclusion at all, it will
in no way mean that our meeting was pointless or even a failure.
After all, we have not come together to draw up a declaration,
but to debate. If we do not find common answers now for any of
the questions, this will  paradoxically  be an achievement of
sorts. It will mean that we have come to the simple but important
realization that we are not yet able to come up with sensible
answers and, consequently, we will have to reconsider everything
we have said here, to debate it quickly and intensively with experts
and the public, and then, just as quickly  either this way, or
in some other modified arrangement  continue the halffinished
discussion, either here or in some other city, regardless of whether
or not there happens to be a castle in it.<BR>
        And now, finally, I will begin to pose my introductory
questions.<BR>
        We have given the task that faces Poles, Hungarians, Czechs,
and Slovaks today the working title &quot;The Return to Europe.&quot;
As my friend the Czech philosopher Ladislav Hejdanek correctly
pointed out a few days ago at a symposium on &quot;Ethics and
Politics,&quot; which also took place here in Bratislava, this
working title is not precise. After all, the verb &quot;to return&quot;
indicates a journey back, and what concerns us is not the road
back but the road forward. In practical or, if you like, in political
terms, it means that we don't want to, nor can we, go back to
the Europe of preceding decades, that is, to a Europe sharply
divided by high walls into two opposing power blocs. If we wish
to return to Europe, as it were, we must return to a Europe quite
different from the one in which, until recently, we all lived.
In other words, in thinking about our return we must think about
a whole Europe, the Europe of the future. Along with the thousands
of difficult internal problems that our countries must solve individually,
and the dozens of problems that the countries shaking off totalitarian
systems have to solve jointly, there is one task that still remains:
to do some hard thinking about the panEuropean situation. As you
probably know, Czechoslovakia is trying to do this.<BR>
        Confronting its opinions with those of many interested
partners, including those of you present in this hall, we are
beginning to form a definite idea about the timetable most likely
to achieve a general consensus, and at the same time we are trying
to draw this timetable up with more precision. One phase of this
process was the Czechoslovak initiative recently announced to
all countries participating in the Conference for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). We are convinced that it would be
realistic if this year's summit did something beyond the planned
agenda:<BR>
        1) Immediately establish a Commission for European Security
as the first seed of a new European security system.<BR>
        2) Decide that the conference called Helsinki II shall
take place next year and shall have the following historic task:
to lay the foundations of a new Europe as an amicable community
of independent nations and democratic states, forming a new unity
and an explicit treaty system of security, political, and economic
linkages. A rapidly uniting Germany ought to contribute to this
process. What President Gorbachev calls &quot;the European house&quot;
ought to be built on the ground plan of existing European borders.
Helsinki II could then be a kind of equivalent of the yet-to-be-held
peace conference in Europe and could contribute to the security
of the European countries. We know that it makes no sense to dissolve
the existing military pacts all at once. Nevertheless, it seems
to us that we must transform them gradually so that they can blend
smoothly into the new security system.<BR>
        They must, of course, be transformed in very distinct
ways, with regard for their distinct character, structures, aims,
and for the present situation. Within some kind of extensive Helsinki
security zone and the guarantee that it would provide, what President
Mitterand calls the European Confederation could quickly be created
and developed. Thus something that is undoubtedly the ideal of
us all, and the ancient dream of countless European intellectuals,
could finally make our continent a home of peace.<BR>
        My first question, therefore, is this: Are we or are we
not capable today of arriving at a position that expresses the
common direction of our thoughts on the future shape of Europe?
<BR>
        The successful Western European integration mechanisms
are predominantly referred to as European and not Western European,
which implies that the Western countries ought to be prepared
to accept, gradually, in varying degrees and in various ways,
the countries that were cut off from them decades ago.<BR>
        My second question is this: Are we or are we not capable
of agreeing that in the process of entering into these mechanisms,
we do not wish to obstruct or even to envy one another, but to
help one another? Can we even agree to help one another on the
road to full membership in the Council of Europe? Can we also
agree to support one another in solidarity on our difficult road
to increasing rapprochement with the European Community?<BR>
        The theme of our meditations today is &quot;coordination.&quot;
The third question I wish to pose is this: Can we take a common
position regarding the organizations of which we are members,
but whose potentials and tasks are now radically changing, namely
the Warsaw Treaty and the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance?
<BR>
        The answer to that question depends directly on the whole
concept of regional cooperation in our part of Europe. I would
therefore pose a fourth question: Can we find a common position
on a solution to our ecological, social, cultural, economic, political
and security problems? All these problems are in some way interconnected
and we cannot, therefore, solve them individually and separately.
Do we agree on that?<BR>
        Messrs. Mock, de Michelis, and Lon_ar represent the countries
united in the Adriatic community, of which Hungary is also a member
and which Czechoslovakia is supposed to join. Our brothers the
Poles know that they do not belong to the historic Danube region,
but at the same time they are, with reason, anxious not to be
pushed aside once more by a rapidly forming, integrated community
to become again that traditionally unfortunate zone between a
large Germany on the one hand and a still larger and dramatically
changing Soviet Union on the other. If we wish, as we must, to
think of one another in solidarity, then we must all jointly do
some hard thinking about the geopolitical position of Poland.
Ideas are emerging about some kind of Northern or Baltic equivalent
of the Adriatic alliance, and of Czechoslovakia as the logical
geographic link between both those provisional communities. <BR>
        That brings us to the fifth question: Are these ideas
going in the right direction or not? Does anyone present have
a meaningful alternative, and are we capable of reaching agreement
on it?<BR>
        The starting point of our struggle against the totalitarian
rule imposed upon us by the Stalinist Soviet Union after the Second
World War was the struggle for human rights. The sixth question,
arising from the very essence of the matter, is this: Are we capable,
even today, of declaring clearly and jointly that respect for
human rights in the widest sense of the word is the common starting
point of our policies?<BR>
        Central and Eastern Europe are special areas of continuous
and often dramatic interpenetration, influence, and oppression
of various nations, national minorities, ethnic groups, spiritual
and cultural initiatives and traditions. For many decades, this
super-diversified area was stitched together by the AustroHungarian
monarchy. After the fall of that monarchy, many of these nations
sought a new political identity of their own. Before they could
achieve this, however, the whirlwind of the Second World War swept
in, and we found ourselves in the grip of a new, longlasting and
unusually brutal totalitarianism.<BR>
        This totalitarianism solved none of nationalities' problems,
but rather repressed all nations to the same or a similar extent.
Only now, in the process of extricating ourselves from totalitarianism,
are we beginning to see in broad daylight the extent of the problems
we have accumulated during those long decades. The desire of nations
to give rapid political articulation to their autonomy and the
desire of minorities to demand their collective rights are just
and understandable desires. If we start with respect for human
rights and build democratic systems in our countries, it is an
indication that we intend to solve  in the best possible way 
all the accumulated nationality problems, were an integral part
of the sad legacy of the era of violence, contempt for individuality,
and compulsory uniformity.<BR>
        Many people who observe the thrilling events in our part
of Europe are asking whether the inexperienced and immature nascent
democracies of Central Europe are capable of managing their nationality
problems. Isn't this suffering and ethnically complex corner of
the world a powder keg that can explode at any moment and bring
on a new era of misery? All of us, of course, dismiss such anxieties.
<BR>
        My seventh question is this: Are we capable of articulating
a common will to do everything possible so that no one around
us will suffer only because he speaks another language or feels
he belongs to a particular nationality? Are we capable of creating
for all nations and national minorities the kind of environment
in which they will be able to develop their identity freely? Are
we capable of creating a system of effective guarantees that recognize
the collective rights of the various nations and ethnic groups
and will give us solid protection against all forms of nationalism
and chauvinism?<BR>
        Each of the questions raised could easily be the theme
of an international conference lasting several weeks. Nevertheless,
out of the dozens of additional questions that occur to me as
possible starting points for our deliberations, I must mention
at least three more:<BR>
        Question eight: Are we or are we not capable of formulating,
in at least a single sentence, our common concern that the nations
of the Soviet Union, which went through the same experience with
totalitarianism as we did, might quickly and peacefully recover
their lost autonomy and seek their own way to genuine democracy?
We all know how much harder our road to freedom would have been
if the great work of renewal in our society had not been linked
with the name of President Gorbachev. However, we also  though
to different degrees  share the fear that this work is losing
its necessary momentum, energy, and boldness, and that sometimes
the Soviet leadership cannot keep pace with the historical processes
for which it opened the way. Therefore I ask again: Are we also
capable of jointly addressing this matter?<BR>
        Question nine: The people of the People's Republic of
China long for freedom, and we who have extricated ourselves from
bondage must now properly understand their longing. Shouldn't
we in some way also address ourselves to the forthcoming anniversary
of the massacre on the Square of Heavenly Peace (Tiananmen Square),
where the purest things for which every young person strives 
freedom, peace, and humanity  were bloodily repressed? I would
go further and ask you and myself whether a voice in support of
the immeasurably reasonable and sober fivepoint program of the
Tibetan Dalai Lama should not also resound from our part of the
globe. After all, it was the People's Republic of China itself
that once was inclined to discuss this program. Do we have any
right to demand our own autonomy if we do not at the same time
demand it for all?<BR>
        Do we have any right at all to speak about good if we
are not bothered by evil elsewhere  and especially the kind of
evil that we ourselves know?<BR>
        And finally the tenth and last question: Are we capable
of expressing joint responsibility for the development of the
countries of the socalled Third World, which so often voice the
fear that the current integration process in Europe will endanger
their already difficult position in the world?<BR>
        The end of a good play, even the shortest one, in some
way refers to its beginning. Therefore permit me, dear friends,
to repeat what I have already said.<BR>
        If we do not reach a common answer to any of the questions
I have posed, it won't be a tragedy. It will merely mean either
that the questions weren't formulated correctly, or that we are
slow to think them all through. It will merely be a call for us
to think them through more precisely and quickly, and to continue
our debates as soon as possible. If we discover that the situation
is more complicated than we thought yesterday, that will also
be a kind of success. Any kind of knowledge, any kind of selfknowledge,
is better than ignorance, silence, and hiding one's head in the
sand.<BR>
        I firmly believe that my short, very general, and undoubtedly
oversimplified introduction can, for exactly those reasons, challenge
us to an immeasurably more concrete, complex, efficient and constructive
discussion.<BR>
        I thank you for your attention and hereby informally open
the informal debate.<BR>

A Welcoming Address to the Pope
<H3>Prague Castle, April 21, 1990</H3>

</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>
Your Holiness,<BR>

<P>
        In one of your poems you ask: &quot;Can history flow against
the current of conscience?&quot; It is obvious what you meant
by this question: History cannot flow against the current of conscience
forever. You were right, as were those who did not lose hope.
In our country  as in the countries of many of our neighbors and
brothers  history flowed against the current of conscience for
a long time. But that could not go on forever. That is the reason
I have the great honor to welcome you in this ancient seat of
Bohemian kings and later of Czechoslovak presidents.<BR>
        I welcome you here, first and foremost, as the head of
the Catholic Church and I rejoice, together with all Catholics,
that you have accepted our invitation.<BR>
        I welcome you as a Christian, whose coming is hailed not
only by Catholics but by all Christians. Not only that: I am strongly
convinced that all people of good will, will join in the joy that
Christians feel over your coming.<BR>
        I also welcome you here, Your Holiness, as a Slav who
understands our language and who speaks it; I welcome you as a
great son of the fraternal Polish nation.<BR>
        And perhaps because you also personally experienced the
inhuman character of a totalitarian system, you have linked your
papacy with the idea of human rights. Our struggle for freedom
also stemmed from this great idea, and our present policy avows
it. I welcome you here, therefore, also as our teacher and fellow
fighter, one who appreciates the value of peace, tolerance, freedom
and respect of man for man.<BR>
        Last but not least, I welcome you as a writer, an intellectual,
an educated man of culture. Our revolution has a clearly cultural
dimension and a cultural aspect that I am sure you feel close
to, as I do. I am glad, therefore, that you have found time to
meet here today with representatives from Czech and Slovak cultural
and educational life.<BR>
        And finally, I welcome you here  if you will permit me
 simply as a good man.<BR>
        You have come at a time when our country is preparing
for the first free elections in several decades. It is more than
understandable that the free space that has opened in front of
us so quickly gives rise in all of us  after so many years of
oppression and humiliation  to a natural aspiration for selfrealization
combined with an unlimited number of more dubious properties,
such as personal ambition, lust for power, vanity and jealous
rivalries. Many of us have quickly forgotten what united us only
several months ago, namely the public interest, the interest of
the country, an interest that exceeds all personal, group and
particular objectives. I strongly believe that your visit will
remind us all of the genuine source of real human responsibility,
its metaphysical source. I strongly believe that your visit will
remind us of what we need so much to be reminded of today: the
absolute horizon to which we must refer, that mysterious memory
of Being in which each of our acts is recorded and in which and
through which they finally acquire their true value. I strongly
believe that face to face with Your Holiness, we shall realize
that above our earthly world of daytoday toil there is something
which from time immemorial has been called heaven.<BR>
        More and more people are realizing that the future of
the human race on this earth rests increasingly in the hands of
those who manage to not think of themselves alone, who act with
regard for others. Yes, the future of humankind rests today with
the civilization of spirit, responsibility and love. All that
we know about you indicates that your charisma will remind us
exactly of that. You may not even realize how strongly we need
such a reminder in these dramatic days.<BR>
        History in our country ceased to flow against the current
of conscience. Let us not allow it  be it under whatever banner
 to flow that way again.<BR>
        I welcome you, Holy Father, among us sinners.

Speech by Vaclav Havel
<H3>President of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic<BR>
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem</H3>

<H4>April 26, 1990</H4>

<P>
First, I would like to thank you for the great honor of being
awarded an honorary doctorate from your university today. This
is far from the first honorary doctorate I have received, but
I accept it with the same sensation that I always do: with deep
shame. Because of my rather sporadic education, I suffer from
feelings of unworthiness , and so I accept this degree as a strange
gift, a continuing source of bewilderment. I can easily imagine
a familiarlooking gentleman appearing at any moment, snatching
the just-obtained diploma from my hands, taking me by the scruff
of my neck and throwing me out of the hall, because it has all
been just a mistake compounded by my own audacity.<BR>
I'm sure you can see where this odd expression of my gratitude
is leading: I want to take this opportunity to confess my long
and intimate affinity with one of the great sons of the Jewish
people, the Prague writer Franz Kafka. I'm not an expert on Kafka,
and I'm not eager to read the secondary literature on him. I can't
even say that I've read everything Kafka has written. I do, however,
have a rather special reason for my indifference to Kafka studies:
I sometimes feel I'm the only one who really understands Kafka,
and that no one else has any business trying to make his work
more accessible to me. And my somewhat desultory attitude about
studying his works comes from my vague feeling that I don't need
to read and re-read everything Kafka has written because I already
know what's there. I'm even secretly persuaded that if Kafka did
not exist, and if I were a better writer than I am, I would have
written his works myself.<BR>
What I've just said may sound odd, but I'm sure you understand
what I mean. All I'm really saying is that in Kafka I have found
a large portion of my own experience of the world, of myself,
and of my way of being in the world. I will try, briefly and in
broad terms, to name some of the more easily defined forms of
this experience.<BR>
One of them is a profound, banal, and therefore utterly vague
sensation of culpability, as though my very existence were a kind
of sin. Then there is a powerful feeling of general alienation,
both my own and relating to everything around me, which helps
to create such feelings; an experience of unbearable oppressiveness,
a need constantly to explain myself to someone, to defend myself,
a longing for an unattainable order of things, a longing that
increases as the terrain I walk through becomes more muddled and
confusing. I sometimes feel the need to confirm my identity by
sounding off at others and demanding my rights. Such outbursts,
of course, are quite unnecessary and the response fails to reach
the right ears, and vanishes into the black hole that surrounds
me. Everything I encounter displays to me its absurd aspect first.
I feel as though I am constantly lagging behind powerful, selfconfident
men whom I can never overtake, let alone emulate. I find myself
essentially hateful, deserving only mockery.<BR>
I can already hear your objections that I style myself in these
kafkaesque outlines only because in reality I'm entirely different:
someone who quietly and persistently fights for something, someone
whose idealism has carried him to the head of his nation. <BR>
Yes, I admit that superficially I may appear to be the precise
opposite of all those K.'s Josef K., the surveyor K., and Franz
K. although I stand behind everything I've said about myself.
I would only add that, in my opinion, the hidden motor driving
all my dogged efforts is precisely this innermost feeling of mine
of being excluded, of belonging nowhere, a state of disinheritance,
as it were, of fundamental nonbelonging. Moreover, I would say
that it's precisely my desperate longing for order that keeps
plunging me into the most improbable adventures. I would even
venture to say that everything worthwhile I've ever accomplished
I have done to conceal my almost metaphysical feeling of guilt.
The real reason I am always creating something, organizing something,
it would seem, is to defend my permanently questionable right
to exist.<BR>
You may well ask how someone who thinks of himself this way can
be the president of a country. It's a paradox, but I must admit
that if I am a better president than many others would be in my
place, then it is precisely because somewhere in the deepest substratum
of my work lies this constant doubt about myself and my right
to hold office. I am the kind of person who would not be in the
least surprised if, in the very middle of my presidency, I were
to be summoned and led off to stand trial before some shadowy
tribunal, or taken straight to a quarry to break rocks. Nor would
I be surprised if I were to suddenly hear the reveille and wake
up in my prison cell, and then, with great bemusement, proceed
to tell my fellow prisoners everything that had happened to me
in the past six months.<BR>
The lower I am, the more proper my place seems; and the higher
I am, the stronger my suspicion is that there has been some mistake.
And every step of the way, I feel what a great advantage it is
for doing a good job as president to know that I do not belong
in the position and that I can at any moment, and justifiably,
be removed from it.<BR>
This is not intended to be a lecture or an essay, merely a brief
comment on the subject of Franz Kafka and my presidency. I think
it is appropriate that these things be expressed here in Jerusalem,
at the Hebrew University, and by a Czech. Perhaps I have put more
of my cards on the table than I wanted to, and perhaps my advisers
will reprimand me for it. But I won't mind, because I expect it
and deserve it. My readiness for the anticipated reprimand is
just another example of what an advantage it is for doing my job
when I am prepared at all times for the worst. <BR>
Once more, I thank you for the honor, and after what I've said
here, I'm ashamed to repeat that I accept it with a sense of shame.
<BR>

SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CZECH AND SLOVAK<BR>
FEDERAL REPUBLIC<BR>

AT THE PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY<BR>
OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE
<H4>STRASBOURG, MAY 10, 1990</H4>

<P>
Mr. President, <BR>
Madam General Secretary,<BR>
Honored ministers, <BR>
Ladies and gentlemen,<BR>

<P>
        The twelve stars in the emblem of the Council of Europe
are a symbol of  among other things  the rhythmical passage of
time, with its twelve hours of the day and twelve months of the
year. The emblem of the institution in which I now have the honor
of speaking strengthens my conviction that I am speaking to people
who have a sensitive perception of the acceleration of European
time that we are witnessing today. People with an understanding
of someone like me, who not only desires but actually has the
duty to project this acceleration into political action.<BR>
        If you will bear with me, I shall once again attempt to
think aloud on this subject, in a place that is perhaps the most
suitable environment of all for such reflections.<BR>
        Let me start with a personal experience.<BR>
        Throughout my life, whenever I thought about public affairs,
about civic, political and moral matters, some reasonable person
would inevitably start very reasonably to point out, in the name
of reason, that I too should be reasonable, should cast aside
my eccentric ideas, and finally accept that nothing can change
for the better because the world is divided once and for all into
two worlds. Both of these halfworlds are content with this division
and neither wants to change anything. It is pointless to behave
according to one's conscience because no one can change anything,
and anyone who does not want war should just keep quiet. I often
had to listen to this &quot;voice of reason&quot; following Brezhnev's
invasion of Czechoslovakia, after which such so-called &quot;reasonable&quot;
people felt much revived because they had been given a new argument
for their indifference to public affairs. They could say: &quot;There
you are, that's the way it goes, they've written us off, nobody
cares, there is nothing we can do, everything's in vain, you'd
better learn your lesson and keep silent! Or do you want to go
to jail?&quot;<BR>
        I was far from the only one to disregard such wisdom and
continue to do what I thought right. There were many of us in
my country. We were not afraid of being considered fools. We went
on thinking about how to make the world a better place, and we
did not hide our ideas. Our efforts eventually merged into a single,
coordinated initiative which we called Charter 77. All of us in
the Charter, together and individually, thought about freedom
and injustice, about human rights, about democracy and political
pluralism, about a market economy and many other things. We thought,
and hence we also dreamed. We dreamed, both in and out of prison,
of a Europe without barbed wire, high walls, artificially separated
nations and gigantic stockpiles of weapons, of a Europe that had
discarded &quot;blocs,&quot; of a European policy based on a respect
for man and human rights, of a politics not subordinated to transient
and particular interests. Yes, we dreamed of a Europe that would
be an amicable community of independent nations and democratic
states. When I had the chance to snatch a quarter of an hour's
conversation with my friend Ji_i Dienstbier (now deputy prime
minister and minister of foreign affairs) as we changed machines
at the end of a shift in the He_manice prison, we sometimes dreamed
of these things aloud. Later, when he was working as a stoker,
Ji_i Dienstbier wrote a book called <U>Dreaming of Europe</U>.
&quot;What's the point of a stoker writing utopian notions of
the future when he can't exert the tiniest influence on this future
and can only bring more harassment upon himself?&quot; asked the
friends of reason, shaking their wise heads uncomprehendingly.
<BR>
        And then a strange thing happened. Time suddenly accelerated,
and what would otherwise have taken a year suddenly happened in
an hour. Everything started to change at a surprising speed, the
impossible suddenly became possible, and the dream became reality.
The stoker's dream became the daily routine of the minister of
foreign affairs. And the advocates of reason have now divided
into three groups. The first are quietly waiting for some bad
things to happen that will serve them as yet another argument
in support of their nihilistic ideology. The second are looking
for ways to push the dreamers out of government and replace them
again with &quot;reasonable&quot; pragmatists, and the third are
loudly proclaiming that, at last, what they have always known
would happen has come to pass.<BR>
        I am not telling you of this to ridicule my allegedly
reasonable fellow citizens, but for a very different reason: to
show that it is never pointless to think about alternatives that
may at the moment seem improbable, impossible, or simply fantastic.
<BR>
        We don't dream, of course, just because our dreams might
one day come in handy. We dream, as it were, as a matter of principle.
Yet it would now appear that there can be moments in history when
having &quot;dreamed on principle&quot; may in fact come in handy.
<HR>

<P>
        Time flies. It flies in this hall. I can therefore no
longer detain you with my literary reflections and must come to
the point.<BR>
        First a few words about my country.<BR>
        Following the attack against the students last November
17, our nations' patience finally gave out, and we quickly overthrew
the totalitarian system that had dominated our country for forty-two
years. We have set out on the road to democracy, to political
pluralism, and to a market economy. The press in our country is
free, and in a month's time we shall have our first free elections
in forty two years, with a broad range of political forces taking
part. I strongly believe that these elections will stand the test
in the eyes of all foreign observers as well. In our country there
is spiritual and intellectual freedom; once again, for the first
time since the Second World War, all the Catholic dioceses have
bishops, and the religious orders are functioning again.<BR>
        Our state has no ideology. The only idea it wants to instill
in its domestic and foreign policy is a respect for human rights
in the broadest sense of the word, and an esteem for the uniqueness
of every human being. Among many other laws, our Parliament has
passed some important economic legislation to enact the transition
to a market economy and put meaning back into human labor. We
are preparing democratic constitutions for our federation and
for both national republics. We want at last to give full legal
expression to the identity of our two nations and ensure the collective
rights of our national minorities. We are a sovereign state, we
want to live in friendship with all nations, but if need be, we
are determined to defend that sovereignty.<BR>
        I believe we have a right to the status of observer at
your Assembly, and I thank you on behalf of our people for having
granted us this status three days ago. I am firmly convinced that
the Council of Europe will understand and accept our application
for full membership.<BR>
        What I have told you of my country does not mean that
Czechoslovakia today is an oasis of harmony. Quite the opposite.
We are now going through an extremely difficult period because
we are awash in vast array of enormous problems that were latent
and have only now surfaced, following our newly won freedom. From
the former regime we have inherited a devastated landscape, a
disrupted economy and, above all, a mutilated moral awareness.
<BR>
        The overthrow of totalitarian power was an important first
step, but it was just the beginning of our journey. We shall have
rapid progress, but there are many pitfalls ahead.<BR>
        We find there is almost nothing we are good at and much
we have yet to learn. We must learn to create a political culture;
we must learn independent thinking and responsible civic behavior.
<BR>
        We are well aware of this, perhaps more so than many who
watch us from afar with concern and exasperation at our clumsiness.
<BR>
        I am not saying all this to gain an undeserved advantage,
or even to elicit your compassion, but because I am accustomed
to speaking the truth, even in a situation when it might seem
more advantageous to lie, or at least to keep silent. It is my
opinion that the advantage of a clear conscience cannot be eclipsed
by any other.
<HR>

<P>
        Now that I have briefly acquainted you with my country,
I can at last start thinking aloud about the Europe of today and
of tomorrow. These thoughts will not be simply a recapitulation
of some faroff dissident dreams. They also will reflect what I
have learned in office and from many conversations with the foreign
statesmen I have had the good fortune to meet.<BR>
        It would be pointless to repeat what everybody knows,
that today unprecedented prospects are opening up for Europe:
the possibility of becoming a continent of peaceful and amicable
cooperation among all its nations.<BR>
        I will therefore move directly to some specific measures
in the sphere of structures, institutions and treaties that must
be created and implemented, either at once or in some agreed-upon
sequence, if the newly emerging hope is to become a reality. I
shall start by assuming that the structures born of the old system
should either be smoothly transformed or merged into new structures,
or simply abolished and left to wither. Entirely new structures
should be created in parallel as starting points or seeds of a
future order. For the sake of clarity, let us divide this sphere
into four categories: security measures, and political, economic
and civic structures, institutions or mechanisms.
<HR>

<P>
        In the security and military sphere, the outward expression
of the postwar division of Europe, there are two existing pacts
-- the Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Pact. These are military
groupings of a rather different nature and history, and they have
different missions. While NATO was born as an instrument for the
defense of West European democracies against the danger of expansion
by the Stalinist Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact was conceived as
an offshoot of the Soviet Army and as an instrument for Soviet
policy. The aim was to confirm the satellite status of the European
countries over which Stalin had gained control after the Second
Word War. If we then consider the geopolitical context  namely
that the West European democracies adjoin the ocean in the West,
and the former Soviet satellites border upon the Soviet Union
in the East  we can easily grasp the asymmetry of the whole situation.
<BR>
        In spite of this, I believe that in this radically new
situation both groupings should gradually move toward the ideal
of an entirely new security system, one that would be a forerunner
of the future united Europe and would provide some sort of security
or security guarantees. It could be a security community involving
a large part of the Northern Hemisphere. Hence the guarantors
of the process of unification in Europe would have to include
not only the United States and Canada in the West, but also the
Soviet Union in the East. When I speak of the Soviet Union, I
am thinking of the community of nations that country is in the
process of becoming today.<BR>
        What are the implications of this for NATO and the Warsaw
Pact in the light of the asymmetry to which I have referred?<BR>
        For both pacts, it means considerably strengthening the
role they are already playing to some extent, the role of political
players in joint disarmament negotiations. It also means the diminution
of their former role as instruments of defense of one half of
Europe against a possible attack from the other half. In brief,
both pacts should function more clearly as instruments of disarmament
rather than instruments of armament.<BR>
        It seems that NATO, as a more meaningful, more democratic
and more effective structure, could become the seed of a new European
security system with less trouble than the Warsaw Pact. But NATO,
too, must change. Above all it should  in the face of today's
reality  transform its military doctrine. And it should soon 
in view of its changing role  change its name as well. This should
happen because of the victory of historical reason over historical
absurdity, and not because of a victory of the West over the East.
The present name is so closely linked to the era of the Cold War
that it would be a sign of a lack of understanding of presentday
developments if Europe were to unite under the NATO flag. If the
present structure of the West European security alliance can become
a precursor or a seed of a future panEuropean alliance, it is
certainly not because the West will have won the Third World War
but because historical justice has triumphed. A further reason
for changing the name is its obvious geographical inappropriateness.
In a future security system, only a minority of members would
border on the Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
        As far as the Warsaw Pact is concerned, it seems that
when it ends its role as the political instrument of European
disarmament, and as an escort of some countries in their return
to Europe, it will lose its purpose and dissolve. What originally
came into being as symbol of Stalinist expansion will, in time,
lose all its raison d'etre.<BR>
        The great &quot;Northern&quot; security zone, as is obvious
at first sight, may essentially be called the &quot;Helsinki&quot;
zone: The countries which could, and should, belong to it are
in fact the participants in the Helsinki process. And what this
implies is obvious enough. The new structures, which would emerge
in parallel with the transformation or gradual dissolution of
the old structures, could grow out of the foundations of the Helsinki
process. The Czechoslovak proposal to establish a European Commission
for Security as a starting point for a united &quot;Helsinki&quot;
security system and a guarantee of a united Europe stems from
this idea. The participating states in the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe have been informed of this initiative,
and I don't need to explain it here once again. As the Warsaw
Pact gradually dissolves or loses its purpose and as NATO gradually
transforms itself, the significance of this Commission would grow,
along with any new structures around it.<BR>
        Let me try to summarize these considerations. If the Helsinki
security process would start to expand from the field of recommendations
to participating states, to the sphere of joint treaty commitments,
a broad framework of guarantees could be created for the emerging
political unity of Europe.
<HR>

<P>
        The accelerated course of history compels us to immediately
project every political consideration into some comprehensive
timetable. I shall attempt to do this for the question at hand.
<BR>
        It is possible  and let us hope it will happen  that a
summit of the states participating in the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe will be convened in the course of this
year. I would like to assure those states proposing to hold it
in Prague that Czechoslovakia would consider this a great honor
and would do its utmost to ensure its success. However, more important
than the venue of this summit are its content and its purpose.
We have already suggested it could do more than is planned for
in the present agenda.<BR>
        In the first place, the summit could  if all the participating
states agreed  establish the proposed European Commission for
Security, which would begin working as of January 1, 1991. Czechoslovakia
proposes Prague as its headquarters. The Secretariat, or its representative
part, could have its headquarters in one of the beautiful Prague
palaces near the Prague Castle. Of course it would be gratifying
if the first of these European institutions were given a mandate
to be located in Prague by a summit held in Prague, but naturally
this is not a precondition. The summit could establish those headquarters
in Prague even if it were held somewhere else.<BR>
        This year's summit, should it be convened, could also
decide that the conference known under the working name of Helsinki
II and planned for 1992 would be held in the autumn of next year.
<BR>
        The third and most important decision that could be taken
at this year's summit would be one on the content and purpose
of Helsinki II and on the immediate start of its preparations,
for which purpose the proposed Commission also could serve. This
task would be the drafting and perhaps the signing of a new generation
of Helsinki Accords. The novelty of these Accords would be that
they would not merely consist of an extensive set of recommendations
to governments and states, but of a set of treaties on cooperation
and assistance in the sphere of security. In other words, there
would be some sort of obligation to provide mutual assistance
in the case of an attack from the outside and to submit to arbitration
in the case of local conflicts within the zone. Clearly, such
negotiations and accords would finally fix the existing European
borders and, through the system of treaties and guarantees, could
close the chapter on the Second World War and all its nefarious
consequences, mainly the prolonged and artificial division of
Europe.<BR>
        In conclusion, by the end of next year the foundations
of a new and united &quot;Helsinki&quot; security system could
be laid, providing all European states with the certainty that
they no longer have to fear one another because they are all part
of the same system of mutual guarantees, based on the principle
of the equality of all participants and their obligation to protect
the independence of each participating country.
<HR>

<P>
        Allow me one more remark, concerning nuclear weapons in
Europe. These weapons  produced never to be used  have become
in the postwar period part of a security model that, paradoxically,
ensured peace through a balance of fear. The nations of Central
and Eastern Europe, however, paid a heavy price for the efficiency
of this nuclear model by remaining in the grip of a totalitarian
straitjacket.<BR>
        An excessive quantity of any type of weapons, particularly
of the nuclear variety, inevitably disfigures the territory on
which it is deployed. This applies particularly to those that
can only reach beyond their backyards and which we call &quot;tactical.&quot;
<BR>
        We therefore welcome President Bush's proposal to abandon
the planned modernization of these weapons. Should the summer
NATO conference decide on the gradual elimination of these less-modern
missiles, now deployed in Central Europe, we would welcome this
move with a great sense of satisfaction. What justification is
there for the existence of weapons that can only strike Czechoslovakia,
the eastern part of Germany now in the process of unification,
and possibly Poland? Whom will they deter? The new governments
elected in the first free elections after several decades? The
new, democratically elected parliaments?<BR>
        I said in the Polish Parliament that our society sometimes
reminds me of freshly amnestied prisoners who have problems finding
their bearings under conditions of freedom. People are full of
prejudices, stereotypes and notions shaped by long years of totalitarianism.
Can they understand the purpose of weapons targeted at them? The
supporters of the former regimes in our country and elsewhere
are still lying in wait for their chance. It would be a historical
paradox if this chance were to be provided by those who helped
us in the past in our struggle against totalitarian regimes.
<HR>

<P>
        In my opinion, the main disaster of our modern world has
been its bipolarity, the fact that the tension between the two
main powers and their allies was indirectly transferred in one
way or another to the whole world. This situation persists to
this day. The world is constantly being torn apart by this tension
and stifled by the existing superpowers. The chief victims of
this unfortunate state of affairs are the one hundred or so states
inaccurately called the Third World, the developing world, or
the nonaligned world. The anxiety of this world over the possibility
that the emergence of a united &quot;Helsinki&quot; security zone
could only widen the gap between the North and the South is understandable
but groundless. The very opposite is true. It would be an important
step from bipolarity to multipolarity. In addition to the powerful
North American continent and the rapidly changing and liberating
community of nations of today's Soviet Union, we would have the
emergence of a large European connecting link. These three entities,
living in peace and mutual cooperation, would indirectly open
up new opportunities for a fully fledged existence to other countries,
other communities of countries. The entire international community
would start shifting from an arena of mutual competition, of direct
or indirect expansion of the two superpowers, into an arena of
peaceful cooperation among equal partners. The North would cease
to threaten the South through the export of its interests and
its supremacy. Instead it would radiate toward the South the idea
of equal cooperation for all.<BR>
        Against the massive background of this broad &quot;Northern&quot;
or &quot;Helsinki&quot; security zone, or simultaneously with
its emergence, Europe could relatively swiftly, and without the
obstacles that until recently seemed insurmountable, become politically
integrated as a democratic community of democratic states. This
process would no doubt go through several stages and be mediated
by several different mechanisms. It may be that in the first stage,
say within five years, a community could be established on European
soil that we might call the Organization of European States and,
with the beginning of the third millennium, God willing, we could
start to build the European Confederation proposed by President
Mitterrand. With the gradual consolidation, stabilization and
growing competence of the future Confederation, the whole &quot;Helsinki&quot;
security system would ultimately become capable of ensuring its
own security, at which point the last American soldier could leave
Europe, because Europe would have lost its reason to fear Soviet
military strength and the unpredictability of that powerful country's
foreign policy.<BR>
        Every move leading to this goal should be encouraged.
The more varied and parallel the attempts undertaken the better,
because the greater the chance will be that one of them will succeed.
Hence Czechoslovakia supports very different initiatives such
as various smaller, working regional communities as is Initiative
Four (the DanubianAdriatic Community), and is studying projects
such as Prime Minister Mazowiecki's idea for setting up a permanent
political body of the foreign ministers of all European states.
<HR>

<P>
        You will certainly understand why I have spoken so extensively
about these ideas here in this Assembly, before the representatives
of the oldest and largest political organization in Europe, one
that has such solid foundations and has already done so much useful
work. Yes, the spiritual and moral values on which the Council
of Europe is based, and which are the common heritage of all European
nations, are the best of all possible foundations for a future
integrated Europe. I can see no reason why your Parliamentary
Assembly and your executive bodies could not be the core around
which a future European Confederation would crystallize. Czechoslovakia
considers all the criteria for the admission of new states to
the Council of Europe as excellent: It accepts them without reservations
and rejoices that the Council of Europe is opening up to the emerging
democracies of the former Soviet satellites, which are now building
their relations with the Soviet Union on the principles of equality
and full respect of the sovereignty of individual states. I am
firmly convinced that the day will come when all European states
will fulfil your criteria and will become full members of the
Council. The Council of Europe was, after all, founded as a panEuropean
institution, and it was only the sad course of history that turned
it for so long into a merely West European institution.
<HR>

<P>
        Obviously, the states that had been ruled by a totalitarian
system and now are overcoming its consequences and want, so to
speak, to return to Europe, can most rapidly and efficiently do
so not by competing and contending against one another but by
helping one another in solidarity. If these countries want to
open up to the new Europe, they must first open to one another.
The new democratic government in Czechoslovakia, therefore, wants
to do everything in its power to contribute to the coordination
of efforts by the Central European countries to enter various
European institutions. That is why we so often appeal to different
institutions that are theoretically European but in fact are so
far only West European, to open more flexibly to those who for
long years were segregated and who logically belong in them.
<HR>

<P>
        The highest level of integration has no doubt been achieved
by the twelve countries of the European Economic Community. The
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, working on the transition
from a centralized &quot;noneconomy&quot; to a normal market economy
and trying to enter the world of normal economic relations and
achieve the convertibility of their currencies, now look upon
the EC as a distant and almost unattainable horizon they should
coordinate their journey toward the EC. On the other hand, the
EC should create some flexible transitional ground, on which the
economies of these states could more easily recover. This would
not only serve the interest of these countries, but it would serve
the interest of the EC itself and would further the ideal of an
integrated democratic Europe.
<HR>

<P>
        The harsh lesson of living under a totalitarian system
has taught us to respect human and civic rights, and it is no
accident that the emerging democracies in our countries have mostly
sprung from independent civic movements like the Czechoslovak
Charter 77. We cannot forget the soil out of which we have grown
and the principles that have governed our struggle for freedom.
We therefore realize how indispensable it is that the efforts
to integrate states, governments and parliaments be accompanied,
or even inspired, by parallel civic efforts. For this reason,
I have recently supported, along with Lech Walesa, a proposal
for a European Civic Assembly. I trust that the West European
governments will also demonstrate an understanding for this plan.
<HR>

<P>
        In conclusion, I should mention two topics that are of
interest to practically the whole world and closely related to
the future of Europe.<BR>
        The first is Germany. We have already formulated the Czechoslovak
viewpoint, but I will repeat it. It was always clear to us that
the artificially divided German nation would one day unite in
a single state. There were times when such a view  publicly proclaimed
 sounded like a provocation, and was considered as such by many
Germans. We are glad, not only because we are not in favor of
the artificial division of any nation, but also because we perceive
the fall of the Berlin Wall as the fall of the whole Iron Curtain
and hence as a liberating phenomenon for us all. As we have said
time and again, the unification of Germany in a single democratic
state is no obstacle to the European unification process but should
in fact be understood as its motivating force. Our thoughts and
actions toward the construction of a new European order should
keep step with the unification of Germany. Hence we welcome the
so called Four-Plus-Two plan. At the same time, we fully understand
our Polish brothers' concern over the Western border of their
state. We consider this border as final and support Poland's full
participation in all negotiations related to its borders. Such
negotiations could, in our view, wind up at the Helsinki II conference,
which should not only formally confirm existing borders, as did
the first Helsinki conference, but provide legal guarantees for
them as well.<BR>
        The second urgent theme is the future of the Soviet Union.
Czechoslovakia unreservedly recognizes every nation's right to
its own identity and to the free choice of its state and political
system. I am convinced that the present process of democratization
we are witnessing in the Soviet Union is irreversible. I am convinced
that all the nations of the Soviet Union will peacefully move
to the type of political sovereignty they desire, and that the
Soviet leadership will give precedence to the free transition
to this over the threat of a violent confrontation. The time is
not too distant when some republics will become completely independent
and others will establish a new type of community, whether a confederative
association or a looser type. In my view, there is no reason why,
against the background of an extensive &quot;Helsinki&quot; security
system, some or all of the European nations of the present Soviet
Union could not at the same time be members of a European confederation
and of some eventual &quot;postSoviet&quot; confederation. The
present Soviet leadership, which proclaims a scientific understanding
of historical processes, undoubtedly understands that all nations
naturally aspire to their own identity and that the present structure
of the Soviet state inherited from czarist, and later Stalinist,
hegemony is artificial. For all these reasons we believe that
the West should at last free itself from its traditional terror
of the Soviet Union. One can hardly admire Mr. Gorbachev and fear
him at the same time. We cannot endlessly scare one another with
the specter of hawkish, conservative forces poised to overthrow
Mr. Gorbachev and return the Soviet Union to the '50s. And in
no way can one cultivate this specter simply to provide the military
industry with work orders. There is no way back, and the future
of the world today no longer stands or falls with one person.
Nor is it any longer in anyone's power to stop this new and strikingly
forward-looking course of history.
<HR>

<P>
        In conclusion, allow me to mention an anxiety we frequently
meet with nowadays. The fear of national, ethnic and social conflicts
in the Central European arena, which might be fostered by long
unresolved and latently spreading problems. This fear leads to
the question as to whether our part of Europe will soon become
a powder keg of the Balkan type.<BR>
        It is our common task to exclude the possibility of such
a threat and render such fears immaterial. This is chiefly the
responsibility of our countries, which must proceed with speed,
coordination and complete mutual understanding to solve the problems
we have inherited. But it is also the responsibility of the West
European countries, which could help us a great deal by supporting
us in this complicated process.<BR>
Dear participants,<BR>
        In 1464 the Czech King George of Podebrady sent a momentous
message to the French King Louis XI, proposing that he preside
over a league of peace and invite Christian rulers to a convention
which, on the basis of binding international law, would prevent
war among members of the union and ensure their common defense.
It seems to me that it was no accident that one of the first serious
attempts toward a peaceful unification of Europe emerged from
Central Europe. As a traditional crossroads of all European conflicts,
this region has a particular interest in European peace and security.
I am happy to have been able to speak about these matters here
in Strasbourg, in a place that was once the symbol of traditional
conflicts and now is a symbol of European unity.
<HR>

<P>
        Honored by this opportunity to speak here at the most
important European political forum, I naturally devoted my attention
to political structures, systems, institutions and mechanisms,
but it doesn't mean I am not aware of the obvious  that no truly
new structures can be set up, nor existing structures daringly
altered, without radical changes in human thinking and behavior,
and in social consciousness. Without courageous people, courageous
structural changes are unthinkable.<BR>
        With this remark I come back to where I started  that
is, to dreams. Everything seems to indicate that we must not be
afraid of dreaming the seemingly impossible if we want the seemingly
impossible to become a reality. We shall never build a better
Europe if we cannot dream of a better Europe.<BR>
        I understand the twelve stars in your emblem not as the
proud conviction that the Council of Europe will build a heaven
on this earth. There will never be a heaven on earth. But I perceive
these twelve stars as a reminder that the world can become a better
place if we sometimes have the courage to look up at the stars.

THE SALZBURG FESTIVAL<BR>

<H4>SALZBURG JULY 26, 1990</H4>

<P>
        This June, our country held its first free elections in
many long decades. Demanding days of putting together a new coalition
government followed. On July 5, a freely elected Parliament reelected
me president of Czechoslovakia, and shortly thereafter approved
the new Cabinet. These events marked the culmination of one of
the most dramatic periods of our modern history: the shattering
of the totalitarian system. It was a time of excitement, swift
decision, and countless improvisations; an utterly thrilling,
even adventurous time. It was a little like a mildly bewildering,
but essentially wonderful, dream. It was, in a way, a fairy tale.
There were so many things that could have gone wrong. We were
traveling on totally unknown terrain, and none of us had any reason
to believe that it wouldn't collapse under our feet.<BR>
        It didn't, though. And now the time has come when there
is indeed reason to rejoice. The revolution, with all its perils,
is behind us, and the prospect of building a democratic state,
in peace, is before us. Could there be a happier moment in the
life of a land that has suffered so long under totalitarianism?
<BR>
        And yet precisely as that splendid historical moment dawned,
a peculiar thing happened to me: When I arrived at work for the
first time after my election, I found I was depressed. I was in
some sort of profoundly subdued state. I felt strangely paralyzed,
empty inside. I suddenly seemed to have lost all my ideas and
goals, my skills, hope, and resolve. I felt deflated, spent, lacking
in imagination. Even though just a few days earlier I had been
terribly busy, I suddenly had no idea what I was supposed to be
doing.<BR>
        The pressure of exhilarating events, which until then
had aroused in me a surprising level of energy, abruptly vanished,
and I found myself standing bewildered, lacking the inner motivation
for anything at all, feeling exhausted, almost irrelevant. It
was an extremely odd sensation, comparable to a bad hangover after
some wild binge, to awakening from a pleasant dream to the ugly
reality of cold daylight, to the shock of a man in love discovering
his sweetheart's treachery.<BR>
        I wasn't the only one with these strange feelings; many
of my colleagues at Prague Castle felt the very same way. We realized
that the poetry was over and the prose was beginning; that the
county fair had ended and everyday reality was back. It was only
then that we realized how challenging, and in many ways unrewarding,
was the work that lay ahead of us, how heavy a burden we had shouldered.
It was as if up to that moment the wild torrent of events had
not allowed us to step back and consider whether we were up to
the tasks we had undertaken. We had simply been tossed into the
current and forced to swim.<BR>
        It seemed to us that only now could we begin to appreciate
fully the weight of the destiny we had chosen. That realization
brought with it a sudden, and under the circumstances seemingly
illogical and groundless, sense of hopelessness.<BR>
        Somewhere in the depths of this feeling lay fear: fear
that we had taken on too much, fear that we wouldn't be up to
the job, fear of our own inadequacy; in short, fear of our very
selves.<BR>
        At the very deepest core of this feeling there was, ultimately,
a sensation of the absurd: what Sisyphus might have felt if one
fine day his boulder stopped, rested on the hilltop, and failed
to roll back down. It was the sensation of a Sisyphus mentally
unprepared for the possibility that his efforts might succeed,
a Sisyphus whose life had lost its old purpose and hadn't yet
developed a new one.<BR>
        About a year ago, when I was asked to launch this august
festival with a brief lecture, I never considered that I might
be able to attend in person. Still, I was pleased to accept the
offer and planned to submit my contribution in writing. During
the tranquil Christmas season I would calmly compose a little
essay on the theme of fear and the sense of danger in Central
European literature. But history got in my way, robbing me of
both time and concentration. So I decided to complete the task
after the elections; in fact, I was truly looking forward to it,
because it would allow me to enjoy a brief return to my original
profession as a writer and because I planned to use the occasion
as a dividing mark between the first, revolutionary, stage of
my political commitment and the second stage, a calmer one, which
involved building up rather than tearing down.<BR>
        I did, in fact, find the time to write. But the time I
found was the period of my peculiar political hangover. First
history got in my way; now I was getting in my own way: I was
simply unable to write anything; I was depleted, paralyzed, powerless.
<BR>
        What a paradox: I had wanted to write about fear, and
here it was fear that was incapacitating me in my writing. Fear
of my subject matter, fear of the act of writing itself, fear
of my own inadequacy, fear of myself.<BR>
        All I could do about this paradox was try to approach
the topic paradoxically: by describing the situation that led
to my inability to approach it. There is nothing new in that.
In fact, part of why most writers write is to divert their despair
into their work and thus overcome it. Perhaps this explains why
I am talking so much about myself here. It isn't out of any complacent
egocentrism but because, simply, I have no other options.<BR>
        No inventory of the various characteristics specific to
Central European culture and literature would be complete without
one particularly important one: an increased perception of danger,
a heightened sensitivity to the phenomenon of fear. It makes perfect
sense. In a place where history has always been so intricately
tangled, in a place with such complex cultural, ethnic, social,
and political structures, in a place that saw the origins of the
most varied of European catastrophes, fear and danger are the
very dimensions of human experience that must be felt and analyzed
most intensely.<BR>
        The heterogeneity of Central Europe explains clearly enough,
I think, the two characteristic poles of its life and thus of
its literature as well.  On the one hand history is miniaturized;
it becomes idyll, anecdote, an almost folkloric cult of locality.
On the other hand, there are obsessive and often quite terrifying
prescient fears of the dangers presented by the so-called great
movements of history.  A jovial neighbourliness typical of this
region has its inevitable counterpart, deriving precisely from
this heightened fear of history, in varieties of fanaticism and
nationalism.  At the same time, the nations and ethnic groups
living under this constant sensation of threat seek to defend
themselves by national or nationalistic self-affirmation. Ethnic
groups that could never develop politically in freedom wage a
constant struggle to affirm their identity, and one of the ways
they do this is by dwelling on their own differences and being
hypersensitive to the danger they feel from the differences of
others.<BR>
        I believe that even the kind of fear I experienced is
typical of the Central European spiritual and intellectual world,
or at least is understandable against its background. Certainly
it would be hard to imagine that in England, France, or the United
States a person could be depressed by his political victory. In
Central Europe, on the other hand, it seems perfectly natural.
<BR>
        For that matter, the experience of the hangoverlike void
is certainly not unique to me, nor is that odd sense of fear.
I have observed variations of that fear and emptiness quite often,
not only in Czechoslovakia but also in the other countries of
Central and Eastern Europe that have shaken off totalitarianism.
<BR>
        It was with a great deal of effort that people in these
lands attained the freedom they yearned for. The moment they gained
that freedom, however, it was as if they had been ambushed by
it. Unaccustomed to freedom, they now, suddenly, don't know what
to do with it; they are afraid of it; they don't know what to
fill it with. Their Sisyphean struggle for freedom has left a
vacuum; life seems to have lost its purpose.<BR>
        Similarly, in this part of the world we observe symptoms
of a new fear of the future. Unlike totalitarian times, when the
future, though wretched, was certain, today it is very unclear.
The single (if ubiquitous) familiar danger represented by totalitarian
oppression seems to have been replaced by an entire spectrum of
new and unfamiliar  or longforgotten  dangers: from the danger
of national conflicts to the danger of losing socialwelfare protection
to the danger of the new totalitarianism of consumption, commerce,
and money.<BR>
        We were very good at being persecuted and at losing. That
may be why we are so flustered by our victories and so disconcerted
that no one is persecuting us. Now and then I even encounter indications
of nostalgia for the time when life flowed between banks that,
true, were very narrow, but that were unchanging and apparent
to everyone. Today we don't know where the banks lie and are slightly
shocked by it.<BR>
        We are like prisoners who have grown used to their prisons
and, suddenly given their longed-for freedom, do not know what
to do with it, and are made desperate by the constant need to
think for themselves.<BR>
        I repeat that the existential situation I illustrated
for you from my own experience, and which I have also observed
in various forms in my fellow citizens, is, in my opinion, a particularly
Central European one. Our literature contains innumerable examples
of it in our not-too-distant past, in the atmosphere following
both World War I and World War II.<BR>
        In short, it seems that fate has ordained that we, more
frequently than others, and often in unexpected situations, shall
be afraid.<BR>
        For us, fear of history is not just fear of the future
but also fear of the past. I would even say that these two fears
are conditional, one on the other: A person who is afraid of what
is yet to come is generally also reluctant to look in the face
of what has been. And a person afraid to look at his own past
must fear what is to come.<BR>
        All too often in this part of the world, fear of one lie
gives birth to another lie, in the foolish hope that by protecting
ourselves from the first lie we will be protected from lies in
general. But a lie can never protect us from a lie. Just as in
Czechoslovakia, nothing protected us from the Stalinist lie about
the socialist paradise on earth, we will not be protected by the
lie about Hitler's racist allies as alleged inheritors of an ancient
princely throne. Those who falsify history do not protect the
freedom of a nation but rather constitute a threat to it.<BR>
        The idea that a person can rewrite his autobiography is
one of the traditional selfdeceptions of Central Europe. Trying
to do that means hurting oneself and one's fellow countrymen.
When a truth is not given complete freedom, freedom is not complete.
<BR>
        One way or another, many of us are guilty. But we cannot
be forgiven, nor can there be peace in our souls, until we at
least confess our guilt.<BR>
        Confession is liberating. I know how it once liberated
me when I found the strength to admit my own mistake. I have many
reasons for believing that truth purges one from fear. Many of
us who, in recent years, strove to speak the truth in spite of
everything were able to maintain an inner perspective, a willingness
to endure, a sense of proportion, an ability to understand and
forgive others, and a light heart only because we were speaking
the truth. Otherwise, we might have perished from despair.<BR>
        Our specific Central European fear has led to many a misfortune.
It could be shown that in it lies the primal origin of not only
countless local conflicts but also some global ones. Here, the
fear that possesses petty souls has often led to violence, brutality,
and fanatical hatred.<BR>
        But fear is not only a destructive condition. Fear of
our own incompetence can evoke new competency; fear of God or
of our own conscience can evoke courage; fear of defeat can make
us prevail. Fear of freedom can be the very thing that will ultimately
teach us to create a freedom of real value. And fear of the future
could be exactly what we need to bring about a better future.
<BR>
        The more sensitive a person is to all the dangers that
threaten him, the better able he is to defend against them. For
that matter, I have always thought that feeling empty and losing
touch with the meaning of life are in essence only a challenge
to seek new things to fill one's life, a new meaning for one's
existence and one's work. Isn't it the moment of most profound
doubt that gives birth to new certainties? Perhaps hopelessness
is the very soil that nourished human hope; perhaps one could
never find sense in life without first experiencing its absurdity.
<BR>
        In spite of having spoken in such an un-statesmanlike
manner about my moments of hopelessness, I will conclude on a
constructive note, that is, with an appeal to all of us, Central
Europeans. Let us endeavor to confront our traditional fears by
systematically eliminating every possible reason we might have
for harboring them. Let us try, quickly and together, to build
the kind system of mutual political, cultural, and economic ties
that will gradually, once and for all, eliminate all the potencial
dangers that lurk in our common future. Only thus will we eliminate
the reasons for our potential fears. <BR>
        Let us finally endeavor, in this sorely tried place, to
get rid of not only our fear of lies but also of our fear of truth.
Let us finally take a direct, calm, and unwavering look into our
own countenances: our past, our present, and our future. We will
only be able to escape their ambiguity when we understand them.
<BR>
     Let us try to delve into the core of our doubts, our fears,
and our despair to come up with the seeds of a new European selfconfidence
 the selfconfidence of those who are not afraid of looking beyond
the horizon of their personal and community interests, beyond
the horizon of this moment.

THE OSLO CONFERENCE ON &quot;THE ANATOMY OF HATE&quot;<BR>
</H3>

<H4>Oslo, August 28, 1990</H4>

</CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
Dear friends,<BR>
        As I look over this assembly, I don't imagine there are
many of us who could contemplate our theme  hate  from the inside,
almost as a kind of autopsy, as a state of the soul that we have
personally experienced. We are, rather, uneasy observers of this
phenomenon, and thus we try to reflect on it only from the outside.
This applies to me as well. Among my bad qualities  and there
are certainly enough of them  there is not, oddly enough, the
capacity to hate. So I too look at hatred only as an observer,
whose understanding of it is not profound, but whose concern about
it is.
<HR>

<P>
        When I think about the people who have hated me personally,
or still do, I realize that they share several characteristics
which  when you put them together and analyze them  suggest a
certain general interpretation of the origin of their hatred.
<BR>
        They are never hollow, empty, passive, indifferent, apathetic
people. Their hatred always seems to me the expression of a large
and unquenchable longing, a permanently unfulfilled and unfulfillable
desire, a kind of desperate ambition. In other words, it is an
active inner capacity that always leads the person to fixate on
something, always pushes him in a certain direction, and is in
a sense stronger than he is. I certainly don't think hatred is
the mere absence of love or humanity, a mere vacuum in the human
spirit. On the contrary, it has a lot in common with love, chiefly
with that selftranscending aspect of love, the fixation on others,
the dependence on them, and in fact, the delegation of a piece
of one's own identity to them. Just as a lover longs for the loved
one and cannot get along without him, the hater longs for the
object of his hatred. And like love, hatred is ultimately an expression
of longing for the absolute, albeit an expression that has become
tragically inverted.<BR>
        People who hate, at least those I have known, harbor a
permanent, irradicable feeling of injury, a feeling that is, of
course, out of all proportion to reality. It is as though these
people wanted to be endlessly honored, loved and respected, as
though they suffered from the chronic and painful awareness that
others are ungrateful and unforgivably unjust towards them, not
only because they don't honor and love them boundlessly, as they
ought, but because they even - or so it seems - ignore them.<BR>
        In the subconsciousness of haters there slumbers a perverse
feeling that they alone possess the truth, that they are some
kind of superhumans or even gods, and thus deserve the world's
complete recognition, even its complete submissiveness and loyalty,
if not its blind obedience. They want to be the center of the
world and are constantly frustrated and irritated because the
world does not accept and recognize them as such; indeed, it may
not even pay any attention to them, and perhaps it even ridicules
them.<BR>
        They are like spoiled or badly brought up children who
think their mother exists only to worship them, and who think
ill of her because she occasionally does something else, like
spending time with her other children, her husband, a book or
her work. They feel all this as an injustice, an injury, a personal
attack, a questioning of their own sense of selfworth. The inner
charge of energy, which might have been love, is perverted into
hatred toward the imputed source of injury.<BR>
        In hatred  just as in unhappy love  there is a desperate
kind of transcendentalism. People who hate wish to attain the
unattainable and are consumed by the impossibility of attaining
it. They see the cause of this in the shameful world that prevents
them from attaining their object. Hatred is a diabolical attribute
of the fallen angel. It is a state of the spirit that aspires
to be God, that may even think it is God, and is tormented by
evidence that it is not and cannot be. It is the attribute of
a creature who is jealous of God and eats his heart out because
the road to the throne of God, where he thinks he should be sitting,
is blocked by an unjust world that is conspiring against him.
<BR>
        The person who hates is never able to see the cause of
his metaphysical failure in himself and the way he so completely
overestimates his own worth. In his eyes, it is the surrounding
world that is to blame. The trouble is that this is too abstract,
vague and incomprehensible. It has to be personified because hatred
 as a very particular kind of tumescence of the soul  requires
a particular object. And so the person who hates seeks out a particular
offender. Of course this offender is merely a standin, arbitrarily
chosen and therefore easily interchangeable. I have observed that
for the hater, hatred is more important than its object; he can
rapidly change objects without changing anything essential in
the relationship. This is understandable. He does not harbor hatred
toward a particular person, but to what that person represents:
a complex of obstacles to the absolute, to absolute recognition,
absolute power, total identification with God, truth and the order
of the world. Hatred for one's neighbor, therefore, would seem
to be only a physiological embodiment of hatred for the universe
that is perceived to be the cause of one's own universal failure.
<BR>
        It is said that those who hate suffer from an inferiority
complex. This may not be the most precise way to put it. I would
rather say that they are people with a complex based on the fatal
perception that the world does not appreciate their true worth.
<BR>
        Another observation seems worth making here. The man who
hates does not smile, he merely smirks; he is incapable of making
a joke, only of bitter ridicule; he can't be genuinely ironic
because he can't be ironic about himself. Only those who can laugh
at themselves can laugh authentically. A serious face, quickness
to take offense, strong language, shouting, the inability to step
outside himself and see his own foolishness  these are typical
of one who hates.<BR>
        Such qualities reveal something very significant. The
hater utterly lacks a sense of belonging, of taste, of shame,
of objectivity. He lacks the capacity to doubt and ask questions,
the awareness of his own transience and transcience of all things,
he lacks the experience of genuine absurdity, that is the absurdity
of his own existence, the feeling of his own alienation, his awkwardness,
his failure, his limitations or his guilt. The common denominator
of all this is clearly a tragic, almost metaphysical lack of a
sense of proportion. The hateful person has not grasped the measure
of things, the measure of his own possibilities, the measure of
his rights, the measure of his own existence and the measure of
recognition and love that he can expect. He wants the world to
belong to him with no strings attached; that is, he wants the
world's recognition to be limitless. He does not understand that
the right to the miracle of his own existence and the recognition
of that miracle are things he must earn through his actions. He
sees them, on the contrary, as a right granted to him once and
for all, unlimited and never called into question. In short, he
believes that he has something like an unconditional free pass
anywhere, even to heaven. Anyone who dares to scrutinize his pass
is an enemy who does him wrong. If this is how he understands
his right to existence and recognition, then he must be constantly
angry at someone for not drawing the proper conclusions.<BR>
        I have noticed that all haters accuse their neighbors
 and through them the whole world  of being evil. The motive force
behind this wrath is the feeling that these evil people and the
evil world are denying them what is naturally theirs. In other
words, haters project their own anger onto others. Here too they
are like spoiled children. They don't see that they must sometimes
show themselves worthy of something and if they don't automatically
have everything they think they should, this is not because someone
is being nasty to them.<BR>
        In hatred there is great egocentrism and great selflove.
Because they long for absolute selfconfirmation and do not encounter
it, hating people feel that they are the victims of an insidious
evil, an omnipresent injustice that has to be eliminated to give
justice its due. But in their minds, justice is turned on its
head. They see it as a duty to grant them something that cannot
be granted: the whole world.<BR>
        The person who hates is unhappy, because whatever he does
to achieve full recognition and to destroy those he thinks are
responsible for his lack of recognition, he can never attain the
success he longs for, that is, the success of the absolute. The
full horror of his powerlessness, or rather his incapacity to
be God, always will burst through from somewhere -- perhaps from
the happy, conciliatory and forgiving smile of his victim.
<HR>

<P>
        There is only one hatred; there is no difference between
individual hatred and group hatred. Anyone who hates an individual
is almost always capable of succumbing to group hatred or even
of spreading it. I would even say that group hatred  be it religious,
ideological or doctrinal, social, national or any other kind 
is a kind of funnel that ultimately draws into itself everyone
disposed toward hatred. In other words, the most proper background
and human potential of all group hatred is a collection of people
who are capable of hating individuals.<BR>
        But more than that, collective hatred shared, spread and
deepened by people capable of hatred has a special magnetic attraction
and therefore has the power to draw countless other people into
its vortex, people who initially did not seem endowed with the
ability to hate. They are merely morally small and weak, selfish
people with lazy intellects, incapable of thinking for themselves
and therefore susceptible to the suggestive influence of those
who hate.<BR>
        The attraction of collective hatred - infinitely more
dangerous than the hatred of individuals for other individuals
-- derives from several apparent advantages.<BR>
        1) Collective hatred eliminates loneliness, weakness,
powerlessness, a sense of being ignored or abandoned. This, of
course, helps people deal with lack of recognition, lack of success,
because it offers them a sense of togetherness. It creates a strange
brotherhood, founded on a simple form of mutual understanding
that makes no demands whatsoever. The conditions of membership
are easily met, and no one need fear that he will not pass muster.
What could be simpler than sharing a common object of aversion
and accepting a common &quot;ideology of injury&quot; that justifies
the aversion expressed to that object? To say, for instance, that
Germans, Arabs, Blacks, Vietnamese, Hungarians, Czechs, Gypsies
or Jews are responsible for all the misery of the world, and above
all for the despair in every wronged soul, is so easy and so understandable!
You can always find enough Vietnamese, Hungarians, Czechs, Gypsies
or Jews whose behavior can be made to illustrate the notion that
they are responsible for everything.<BR>
        2) The community of those who hate offers another great
advantage to its members. They can endlessly reassure one another
of their own worth, either through exaggerated expressions of
hatred for the chosen group of offenders, or through a cult of
symbols and rituals that affirm the worth of the hating community.
Uniforms, common dress, insignia, flags and favorite songs bring
the participants closer together, confirm their identity, increase,
strengthen, and multiply their own value in their eyes.<BR>
        3) Whereas individual aggressiveness is always risky because
it raises the specter of individual responsibility, a society
of hating individuals in a sense legitimizes aggressiveness. Expressing
it as a group creates the illusion of legitimacy or at least the
sense of a &quot;common cover.&quot; Hidden within a group, a
pack or a mob, every potentially violent person can dare to do
more; each one eggs the other on, and all of them - precisely
because there are more of them - justify one another.<BR>
        4) Ultimately, the principle of group hatred considerably
simplifies the lives of all those who hate and all those who are
incapable of independent thinking, because it offers them a very
simple and, immediatelly recognizable object of hatred. The process
of manifesting the general injustice of the world in a particular
person who therefore must be hated is made wonderfully easier
if the &quot;offender&quot; is identifiable by the color of his
skin, his name, his language, his religion or where he lives.
<HR>

<P>
        Collective hatred has another insidious advantage: the
modest circumstances of its birth. There are many apparently innocent
and common states of mind that create the almost unnoticeable
antecedents to potential hatred, a wide and fertile field on which
the seeds of hatred will quickly germinate and take root.<BR>
        Let me at least give you three examples.<BR>
        Where can this particularizing feeling of universal injustice
flourish better than where genuine injustice has been done? Feelings
of not being appreciated, logically enough, grow best in a situation
where someone has been humiliated, insulted or cheated. The best
environment for a chronic feeling of injury is one of genuine
injury. In short, collective hatred gains its veracity and allure
most easily wherever a group of people lives in a genuine want,
that is, in an environment of human misery.<BR>
        A second example. The miracle of human thought and human
reason is bound up with the capacity to generalize. It is hard
to imagine the history of the human spirit without this great
power. In a sense, anyone who thinks generalizes. On the other
hand, the ability to generalize is a fragile gift that has to
be handled with great care. A less perceptive soul can easily
overlook the hidden seeds of injustice that may lie in the act
of generalization. We have all made observations or expressed
opinions of one kind or another about various peoples. We may
say that the French, the English, or Russians are like this or
that; we don't mean ill by it, we are only trying, through our
generalizations, to see reality better. But there is a grave danger
hidden in this kind of generalization. A group of people defined
in a certain way  in this case ethnically  is, in a sense, subtly
deprived of individual spirits and individual responsibilities,
and we endow it with an abstract, collective sense of responsibility.
Clearly, this is a wonderful starting point for collective hatred.
Individuals become a priori bad or evil simply because of their
origin. The evil of racism, one of the worst evils in the world
today, depends among other things directly on this type of careless
generalization.<BR>
        Finally, the third antecedent of collective hatred I want
to mention here is something I would call collective &quot;otherness.&quot;
One aspect of the immense and wonderful color and mystery of life
is not only that each person is different and that no one can
perfectly understand anyone else, but also that groups of people
differ from one another as groups: in their customs, their traditions,
their temperament, their way of life and thinking, their hierarchy
of values, and of course in their faith, the color of their skin,
their way of dressing and so on. This &quot;otherness&quot; is
truly collective. And it is quite understandable that the &quot;otherness&quot;
of one group can make it seem, to the group we belong to, surprising,
alien, and even ridiculous. And just as we are surprised at how
different others are, so others are surprised by how different
we are from them.<BR>
        This &quot;otherness&quot; of different communities can
of course be accepted with understanding and tolerance as something
that enriches life; it can be honored and respected, it can even
be enjoyed. But by the same token, it can also be a source of
misunderstanding and aversion toward others. And therefore  once
again  it is a fertile ground for future hatred.<BR>
        Few of those who move on the thin, ambiguous and dangerous
terrain created by the awareness of a genuine wrong, the ability
to generalize and that awareness of &quot;otherness&quot;, can
from the outset detect the presence of the cuckoo's eggs of collective
hatred that can be laid in this terrain or that already have been
laid there.
<HR>

<P>
        Some observers have described Central and Eastern Europe
today as a powder keg, an area of growing nationalism, ethnic
intolerance and expressions of collective hatred. This area is
even often described as a possible source of future European instability
and of a serious threat to peace. In the subtext of such pessimistic
reflections, one can sense, here and there, a kind of nostalgia
for the good old days of the Cold War, when the two halves of
Europe kept each other in check and produced a kind of peace.
<BR>
        I don't share the pessimism of such observers. Even so,
I admit that the corner of the world from which I come from could
become  if we do not maintain vigilance and common sense  fertile
soil in which collective hatred could grow. This is so for many
more or less understandable reasons.
<HR>

<P>
        In the first place, you have to realize that living in
Central and Eastern Europe are many nations and ethnic groups
that have blended together in various ways. It is almost impossible
to imagine an ideal border that would separate these nations and
ethnic groups into territories of their own. Thus, there are many
minorities, and minorities within minorities, and the existing
borders are sometimes rather artificial, so that in fact it is
a kind of international melting pot. At the same time, these nations
have had very few historic opportunities to seek their own political
identity and their own statehood. For centuries, they lived under
the shelter of the AustroHungarian monarchy and after a brief
pause between the wars they were, in one way or another, subjugated
by Hitler and then immediately, or shortly thereafter, by Stalin.
The nations of Western Europe had decades and centuries to develop
to where they are; the nations of Central Europe had only a few
years between the two world wars.<BR>
        Understandably, then, they carry within their collective
subconsciousness a feeling that history has done them wrong. An
exaggerated feeling of injustice -- a condition for hatred --
could quite logically find fertile ground for its birth and growth
here.<BR>
        The totalitarian system that held sway for so long in
most of these countries was outstanding, among other things, for
its tendency to make everything the same, to control and coordinate
things, to make them uniform. For decades, it harshly suppressed
whatever authenticity  or if you like &quot;otherness&quot;  the
subject nations had. From the structure of the state administrations
to the red stars on the rooftops, everything was the same -- that
is, imported from the Soviet Union. Is it any wonder then, that
the moment these countries rid themselves of the totalitarian
system, they suddenly perceived, with unusual clarity, their mutual
and suddenly liberated &quot;otherness&quot;? And would it be
any wonder if this long-invisible, and therefore necessarily untested
and intellectually undigested &quot;otherness&quot; did not cause
surprise? Rid of the uniforms and the masks that were imposed
on us, we are looking for the first time into one another's real
faces. Something has come about that might be called the &quot;shock
of otherness.&quot; And this has given rise to another favorable
condition for collective aversion, which in the right circumstances
could grow into collective hatred.<BR>
        The simple fact is that not only have the nations of this
area not had enough time to mature as states, they have not had
enough time to get used to one another's politically defined otherness.
<BR>
        Here we may once more invoke a comparison with children:
In many regards, these nations have simply not had enough time
to become political adults.<BR>
        After all they have gone through, they feel a natural
need to make their existence quickly visible and to achieve recognition
and acknowledgement. They simply wish to be known, to be consulted
along with the rest of the world. They want their special &quot;otherness&quot;
to be acknowledged. And at the same time, still full of inner
uncertainty about themselves and the degree of recognition they
enjoy, they look at one another somewhat nervously and ask whether
those other nations  which moreover have suddenly become as different
as themselves  are not stealing some of the attention that is
rightfully theirs.<BR>
        For years the totalitarian system in this part of Europe
suppressed civic autonomy and the rights of individuals, whom
they tried to turn into pliant cogs in its machine. The lack of
civic culture, which the system destroyed, and the general demoralizing
pressure ultimately can make possible the careless generalizing
that always goes along with national intolerance. Respect for
human rights, which rejects the principle of collective responsibility,
is always the result of a minimum level of civic culture.<BR>
        It may be clear, from this rather brief and thus necessarily
simplified account, that in our part of Europe, conditions are
relatively favorable for the rise of national intolerance or even
hatred.
<HR>

<P>
        There is one more important factor here. After the initial
joy about our own liberation comes the inevitable phase of disillusion
and depression. It is only now, when we can describe and name
everything truthfully, that we see the full extent of the awful
legacy left to us by the totalitarian system, and realize how
long and difficult will be the task of repairing all the damage.
<BR>
        This state of general frustration may provoke some to
vent their anger on substitute victims, who will stand as proxies
for the main and now liquidated offender, the totalitarian system.
Helpless rage seeks its lightning rod.
<HR>

<P>
        I repeat that if I speak of the nationalistic hatred in
Central and Eastern Europe, I'm not talking about it as our certain
future but as a potential threat.<BR>
        We must understand this threat in order to confront it
effectively. It is a task that faces all of us who live in the
former Soviet Bloc.<BR>
        We must struggle energetically against all the incipient
forms of collective hatred, not only on principle, because evil
must always be confronted, but in our own interests.<BR>
        The Hindus have a legend concerning a mythical bird called
Bherunda. The bird had a single body, but two necks, two heads
and two separate consciousnesses. After an eternity together,
these two heads began to hate each other and decided to harm each
other. Both of them swallowed pebbles and poison, and the result
was predictable: The whole Bherunda bird went into spasms and
died with loud cries of pain. It was brought back to life by the
infinite mercy of Krishna, to remind people forever how all hatred
ends up.<BR>
        We who live in the newly created democracies of Europe
should remind ourselves of this legend each day. As soon as one
of us succumbs to the temptation to hate another, we will all
end up like the Bherunda bird.<BR>
        With this difference. There will be no earthly Krishna
around to liberate us from our new misfortune.

<P>
Mr. Chairman, <BR>
Ladies and gentlemen,<BR>
        <BR>
        A thousand times over the past decades I have seen  backs
in my country bent allegedly in the interest of children. A thousand
times I have heard people defend their servitude to a hated regime
by arguing that they were only doing it for their children: so
they could feed them, make it possible for them to study, to afford
seaside vacations for them. A thousand times, both acquaintances
and strangers have confided to me that they were heart, mind,
and soul totally on our side, that is, on the side of the socalled
dissidents, but that they signed various petition campaigns aimed
against us, and organized by the totalitarian government, for
the sole reason that they had children and thus could not afford
the luxury of resistance. Immorality was committed in the name
of children, and evil was served for their alleged good.<BR>
        But I have seen even greater perversities, if only in
the movies or on television. I saw Hitler waving in a friendly
way to fanaticized little girls of Hitlerjugend*; I saw the mass
murderer Stalin kissing a child wearing the red Communist youth
organization scarf, a child whose parents ended up like so many
others in gulags; I saw Gottwald**, the Stalin of Czechoslovakia,
joking with young miners, the builders of socialism and later
to become cripples; I saw the Iraqi president Hussein patting
the children of his hostages on the head, hostages whom he now
says he is ready to have shot.<BR>
        I know and have experienced how in Czechoslovakia thousands
of people suffered in Communist concentration camps, how hundreds
of them were executed or tortured to death, and all this for the
false happiness of generations yet unborn in some false paradise.
       How much evil has already been committed in the name of
children!<BR>
        I have also experienced something very different, even
as recently as several months ago, a year ago, two years ago.
I have experienced a beautiful revolt of children against the
lie that their parents had served, allegedly in the interest of
those very children. Our anti-totalitarian revolution was  at
least in its beginnings  a children's revolution. It was high
school students and apprentices, adolescents, who marched in the
streets. They marched when their parents were still afraid, were
afraid for their children and for themselves. They locked their
children in at home, took them away from the cities on weekends.
Then they started marching in the streets with them. First out
of fear for their children, later because they became infected
by their enthusiasm. The children evoked from their parents their
better selves. They convinced them they were lying and forced
them to take a stand on the side of truth.<BR>
        And what about the children of dissidents? Although they
could not study and had to endure the arrests and persecutions
of their parents, they did not blame them but instead respected
them. They were more interested in a moral example than in the
advantages stemming from a bent back. <BR>
        Children in our country have proven that the ideology
of sacrificing truth for the alleged interest of children is false.
They revolted against parents who advocated this ideology, they
joined the few who had been convinced from the very beginning
that they would serve their children best if they did not look
for excuses and lie, but rather live in truth and thus give an
example to their children.<BR>
        The international community has achieved something unprecedented.
Most of the countries of the world have, within months, joined
an exceptionally good, precise and exhaustive international agreement
for the protection of children. I rejoice, as we all do, in this
achievement and am proud that I had the honor of signing the agreement
on behalf of my country this morning.<BR>
        At the same time, however, I believe that this agreement
 or any other conceivable international document  cannot protect
children from pseudoprotection, that is, from their parents committing
more evil in the name and in the interest of children  whether
in good faith, in selfdelusion or by deliberately lying  and from
hurting themselves more than they can hurt the children.<BR>
        As with any law, this one too can only acquire real meaning
and significance if it is accompanied by real moral selfawareness,
by which I mean the moral selfawareness of parents.<BR>
        You cannot put that into a law. However, if it were possible,
I would add another paragraph to the agreement I signed this morning.
This paragraph would say that it is forbidden for parents and
adults in general in the name and allegedly in the interest of
children, to lie, serve dictatorships, inform, bend their back,
be afraid of tyrants, and betray their friends and ideals. And
that it is forbidden for all murderers and dictators to pat children
on the head.<BR>

<P>
*  Hitlerjugend was a fascist youth organization in Germany intended
to train children in the spirit of Nazism. <BR>
** Klement Gottwald was a Czech Communist leader and president
of Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1953.

Your Magnificence,<BR>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>

<P>
Our generation is living at a time which may well be seen one
day as a time of a great historic change. It is a time when, not
without difficulty, a new international order is coming into being,
when many states are making efforts to redefine their character,
their identity and their position on the international scene,
when a quest for a whole new spirit of the coexistence of people,
nations, cultures and entire spheres of civilization on this planet
is under way. We can say that we have arrived at a crossroads
and find ourselves confronted with a great challenge. Inevitably,
the present is also a time of new reflections, including a review
of history, and a new stocktaking.<BR>
It is not only that the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the
end of World War II invites us to think about what conclusions
we can draw, in hindsight, from that war, the most atrocious one
in human history. Nor is it just that the fifth anniversary of
the fall of the Berlin Wall and of the end of the Cold War and
the bipolar division of the world makes us think what these recent
developments have brought, what they mean and what tasks they
set before us. More than that is needed now: we have to place
all these events in a broader and deeper historical context and
try to formulate the challenges of our time against the background
of such a fundamental reflection.<BR>
I should like to contribute to that with a few remarks on the
Czech-German relationship. I am happy to be able to do so on a
site which reminds us - more than any other place could - of the
centuries of intellectual coexistence of the Czechs and the Germans:
on the academic ground of Charles University.<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>

<P>
Our relationship to Germany and the Germans has been more than
merely one of the many themes of our diplomacy. It has been a
part of our destiny, even a part of our identity. Germany has
been our inspiration as well as our pain; a source of understandable
traumas, of many prejudices and misconceptions, as well as of
standards to which we turn; some regard Germany as our greatest
hope, others as our greatest peril. It can be said that the attitude
they take toward Germany and the Germans has been a factor through
which the Czechs define themselves, both politically and philosophically,
and that it is through the type of that attitude that they determine
not only their relationship to their own history but also the
type of their conception of themselves as a nation and a state.
Obviously, the relationship to the Czechs is not of the same kind
of fundamental importance to the Germans; nevertheless, it may
be more important to them than some Germans might be prepared
to admit: traditionally, this relationship has been one of the
tests revealing their own conception of themselves as well. Let
us recall that Germany's stand toward us has many times been a
mirror image of its stand toward Europe as a whole! At present,
as the newly united Germany tries to find its new identity and
a new position in Europe and the world, the significance of the
former has particularly increased.<BR>
What does this mean for us? No more and no less than that we should
talk about the Czech-German theme publicly, candidly, in a matter-of-fact
way and, in so doing, be fully conscious of the fact that as we
speak about it, we speak about ourselves. <BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>

<P>
The Czech-German or German-Czech relationship acquired its dramatic,
sometimes almost excruciating character only in a fairly recent
past, that is, during the last two centuries when a national dimension
began to carry an increasing weight in it. This modern experience
has often concealed or overshadowed the much longer experience
of our more ancient history which was characterized by a special
kind of creative coexistence of the Czechs and the Germans within
one state. It has to be admitted that even then the coexistence
was not always idyllic or easy, but in the various confrontations
that were later described as purely national confrontations the
points at issue were in reality other things than national affiliations.
Those disputes were about religion, ideas or ideologies, power,
social welfare or other matters, and while factors such as where
those concerned came from, or which languages they spoke, sometimes
played a role as well, differing national sentiments as we perceive
them today were not the driving force of the arguments then. The
two elements - combined also with the Jewish element - for centuries
mingled together here, inspiring and influencing one another in
a wide variety of ways; we can even say that they lived together
in a kind of symbiosis. Their various encounters never posed a
threat to that coexistence, nor did they augur its end; on the
contrary, they helped shape its history and more than once had
a stimulating effect on the political and cultural accomplishments
of the entire population of our country. In reality, this specific
community was the actual subject of Czech history, although the
Czechs always constituted the majority of the country's population.
For that matter, the international status of the Kingdom of Bohemia
was for a long time different from what would correspond to the
position of a national state at present: it was always a special,
influential entity within a universalistic Holy Roman Empire,
and the weight of that entity was not determined by the size of
the people that formed the majority of its population but by completely
different historical factors. Its multicultural character, to
put it in present-day language, undoubtedly played a role among
the latter; the prominent position held by the Kings of Bohemia
among the Electors who chose the Emperors clearly bears witness
to that.<BR>
The unique story of the life together of the Czechs and the Germans
in our country that lasted nearly a thousand years - notwithstanding
the fact that it became increasingly complicated in the last two
centuries, and was ultimately destroyed - remains an integral
part of our history, and thus also of our present identity as
citizens of the Czech Republic, and represents a value that we
must not forget. We must not forget it, among other things, because
it is - if we allow ourselves a little bit of an overstatement
- a very modern value that can inspire us as we build a new Czech-German
relationship now.<BR>

<P>
Volumes have already been written about the era of the increasingly
dramatic relationship between the Czechs and the Germans in our
country, as it began to develop from the beginning of the last
century due to the growing national consciousness in the modern
sense of the word. I shall therefore limit myself to recalling
just a few general facts that I find to be beyond dispute and
that, it appears, should be once again stressed from the Czech
side today.<BR>
1) If someone claims now and then that the Czechoslovak Republic
- as the fruit of the ripening self-consciousness and the self-liberation
efforts of the Czechs and the Slovaks and a product of the Peace
of Versailles - was an error and, as such, a cause of the subsequent
disasters, he or she only reveals his or her own ignorance. The
birth of the republic cannot be ascribed only to the realism that
paid regard to the desire of the Czechs and the Slovaks to develop
their identity, to free themselves from the rule of the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy that failed to offer them an appropriate status, and
to build their new, viable statehood on their association in one
common state. What was no less, if not even more important was
the fact that a modern, democratic, liberal state was purposefully
created here on the basis of the values to which the entire democratic
Europe of today is committed as well, and in which it sees its
future. Its founding fathers expected that - against the background
of a growing stability of both the domestic and the international
situation - it would develop into a true civil state, growing
out of a creative cooperation of all its citizens and of their
respect for one another's national character. It is true that
the Czechoslovak Republic had its weaknesses - among other things,
it never worked out a satisfactory solution to its nationalities
problems - but the roots of these weaknesses did not lie in the
values that marked its birth, and showed it the way to go. They
were the result of the inability of some of its political forces
to act in a broad-minded manner and in the spirit of those values
so as to solve the country's minor domestic problems before enemies
of freedom turned them into major international problems. All
that is well known and has been recorded, but it does not change
in any way the fact that Czechoslovakia - like France, today's
Benelux countries, Switzerland and the Nordic nations - was one
of the few truly democratic and well-ordered states of continental
Europe. Voices of personages such as Thomas Mann, whom - along
with thousands of other German democrats - Czechoslovakia granted
asylum after Hitler came to power, have testified to that. Thus,
when the Czech Republic acknowledges its ties of continuity with
Czechoslovakia this can only be to its credit.<BR>
2) It would be a dangerous oversimplification if the transfer
of the Germans from our country after the war were to be perceived
as the only item in the tragic coming to an end of the thousand
years of Czech-German coexistence here. Physically, the transfer
undoubtedly was the end of our life together in a common state,
because it was with the transfer that that coexistence was actually
terminated. But the lethal blow that caused its death was struck
by something else: the fatal failing of a great part of our country's
German-born citizens who gave preference to the dictatorship,
confrontation and violence embodied in Hitler's national socialism
over democracy, dialogue and tolerance, and while they were claiming
their right to their homeland, they in fact renounced their home
country. In so doing, they negated the outstanding accomplishments
of the many German democrats who had helped build Czechoslovakia
as their home. Whatever the deficiencies of the solution of the
nationalities issue in pre-war Czechoslovakia may have been, they
can never justify that failing. Those who committed it turned
not only against their fellow citizens, against Czechoslovakia
as a state and their own status as citizens of that state; they
turned against the very foundations of humanity itself. They embraced
a perverted racist ideology and began immediately to apply it
in practice. It is marvellous that many descendants of our former
German fellow citizens have understood that and are now working
selflessly and patiently for a reconciliation between our peoples.
<BR>
We can have different views on the post-war transfer of the German
population - my own critical opinion is widely known - but we
can never take that step out of its historical context, nor can
we fail to see the connection between the transfer and all the
preceding horrors that led to it. While until recently I believed
this to be self-evident and therefore felt no need to stress it,
I do have to say it clearly at present, now that people who ignore
this fact or even call it in question are again taking the floor
in Germany. I have already stated more than once in the past that
evil is of an infectious nature and that the evil of the transfer
was only a sad consequence of the evil which preceded it. There
can be no dispute about who was the first to let the genie of
national hatred out of the bottle. And if we, that is, the Czechs,
are to recognize our share of responsibility for the end of the
Czech-German coexistence in the Czech lands, we have to say, for
the sake of truth, that we let ourselves become infected by the
insidious virus of the ethnic concept of guilt and punishment
but that it was not us who brought that virus, at least not its
modern destructive form, into this country.<BR>
3) My third remark on the end of the Czech-German coexistence
concerns the Munich Agreement. I am not sure whether certain people,
especially on the German side, are sufficiently aware of the fact
that Munich was not simply an unjust solution of a disputable
minority issue but the last and, in a way, crucial confrontation
between democracy and the Nazi dictatorship. At that time, democracy
capitulated and thus paved the way for the dictatorship to launch
its inconceivable assault on all the fundamental values of civilization
and on the very essence of human coexistence - possibly the most
severe such assault ever made in human history. To Hitler Munich
was the final test of democracy and its ability to defend itself;
he took the Munich capitulation of the democrats as a sign that
he was free to unleash a war. His calculation proved to be wrong
and democracy prevailed in the end, but only at a great sacrifice
that could most probably have been avoided if democracy had not
given in to the delusion of appeasement and had resisted Hitler
at the time of the Munich crisis. Again, two different aspects
of the matter should be distinguished: while in military terms
World War II began with the attack on Poland, there is no doubt
that the Munich dictate was its political beginning. Did a great
German politician not say many years ago that Munich meant the
moment from which everything plunged into the abyss? The part
that many of our German-born fellow citizens played in the preparations
for Munich and in its aftermath cannot be narrowed to a struggle
for their minority rights. The issue then was not the Germans
from the Czech lands, nor merely the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia
as a prelude to its subsequent occupation. At that time, war was
declared, in no uncertain terms and at the international level,
upon human freedom and dignity. Were not the German opponents
of Nazism the first victims of Nazi vengeance in the Czech lands?
Even now, admitting this may not be easy for many Germans, especially
for those who were affected by the population transfer, just as
it is not easy for many Czechs, handicapped by the decades without
freedom when this subject was taboo, to admit the damage they
did to democracy and thus to themselves by adopting after the
war the idea of expelling the Germans from their home.<BR>
4) Nazism was once described as one of the most horrible manifestations
of the tribal concept of state as a blood community, in contradiction
to the idea of an open society that has for two and a half thousand
years been challenging the former and standing up to it. If we
accept this interpretation we should develop our thoughts about
the Czech-German past, present and future, including a Czech-German
understanding or conciliation, on the basis of an agreement to
the effect that the only alternative for the future, and the only
alternative that can lead to a final reconciliation, is to join
forces in building an open society and fighting for it against
all those who - despite all the horrifying experience of modern
tribalism - would wish to spread the spiritual fruits of nationalism
again. Such enemies of an open society can be found, regrettably,
on both sides of our frontier. The alternative which they offer
us would ultimately always result in a confrontation in which
everyone would suffer. The only way that the democratic Czech
Republic and the democratic Germany - and not just the two - can
go is not to be afraid of them, and not to yield. Occasionally,
even democrats have to say: &quot;That's enough!&quot;<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>

<P>
What should be our starting points as we build a new relationship
between our peoples ? What are the courses open to us ?<BR>
First and foremost, we should try to reach agreement on what place
we shall give to our past. There is no way we can forget it. Just
as a consistent personality that lives in harmony with itself
and takes responsibility for itself could never fail to be aware
of its own past and continuity and to take a responsible attitude
toward them, it would be equally unthinkable - even though in
a different manner - that a responsible community, be it defined
on a national or on a political basis, should lack this kind of
consciousness. We have to know our past history and form our opinions
on it. This does not mean, however, that we should move back into
our past, try to live the lives of our ancestors, time and again
reconstruct the situations which they were confronted with and
copy their behaviour, suffer their agonies or be moved by their
successes and draw political consequences from such sentiments.
The past cannot constitute our programme. If we were to transplant
ourselves into our past history forever and existentially identify
ourselves with it, we would lose the ability to look at it from
a distance, to judge it with the due sense of responsibility and
to learn from it. In the end, such a complete self-transplantation
into the past would amount to a specific way of restoring the
tribal concept of nation as an entity with its own &quot;superhistorical&quot;
collective &quot;supersubjectivity&quot;. We know full well what
the ultimate product of this concept is: the principle of a never-ending
blood vengeance which again and again drives generations of grandchildren
to punish other grandchildren for wrongs done by the grandfathers
of the latter to the grandfathers of the former.<BR>
Agreement on this would have many important effects. Primarily,
it would mean that the time of apologies is over and a time of
a matter-of-fact pursuit of the truth begins. The words of apology
which representatives of the democratic Germany offered to all
nations as well as to their own citizens for what Nazism had done
to them were of great significance and paved the way for a new
life together. All that we have said on the post-war population
transfer has been aimed to serve the same purpose. By now, I think,
we have progressed further than that. What is needed at present
is a substantive, unbiased analysis and the ability to gain useful
knowledge in this way.<BR>
In a word, it has to be said clearly, once for all, what belongs
to history and should be treated as such.<BR>
Our future really does not lie in our past. To reawaken the past
means to bring back to life all the demons that have lain dormant
there. That is not the way for us to go. The way is to recognize
at last how dangerous such demons are.<BR>
This attitude toward the past brings other practical results as
well.<BR>
From the Czech point of view, these include, as an important and
logical consequence, an unequivocal rejection of any attempts
to extract from long bygone events or injustices a whole set of
present-day political or legal demands or claims that call in
question the very ground on which the post-war order of Europe
has been built. The voices advocating that have been marginal
and not very numerous, but the Czech public has been very sensitive
to their emergence. I therefore deem it my duty to say here in
the clearest terms that the Czech Republic is a direct co-heir
of the Czechoslovak statehood born out of two dreadful wars in
the unleashing of which the Czechs had no part. Our republic will
therefore never negotiate about a revision of their outcome, about
any infringement of the continuity of its legal system, about
any corrections of history at the cost of our contemporaries.
<BR>
If there is a debt in the form of compensation for the surviving
victims of the Nazi tyranny, let it be paid. But no sum of money
in any currency will ever recompense all that we or our ancestors
had to go through because of Nazism. There is no compensation
for the tens of thousands of the murdered or those tortured to
death, or for the moral, political and economic losses that we
had to suffer as a result of Munich, the Nazi occupation, the
war and all its political consequences. And we are not so foolish
as to send the present generation in the democratic Germany bills
for all the wrongs committed long ago by some of their fathers,
grandfathers or great-grandfathers, just as we do not present
the nations of the former Soviet Union with bills for all the
damage done to our country as well as to our souls by the decades
of Communism. Consequently, we find all demands for either material
or other reparations for the post-war population transfer to be
all the more absurd. Nazism, Munich, the war and all its bitter
fruits belong to history, and all that we can and are prepared
to do is try to understand that history and do everything in our
power in order that it never happens again. Representatives of
the democratic Germany long ago publicly admitted the German guilt
for Nazism, without attempting the impossible, that is, to return
history somewhere before World War II. We too have made an effort
to describe our share of responsibility for all the bad things
done after the war, but we do not have the slightest intention
either to turn history backwards or to annul legal acts lawfully
approved by our parliament years ago - acts on which whole layers
of other acts have since been piled up. We are not prepared to
let new storms wreak havoc in the area of property rights, and
thus open the door to all the evil spirits of the past. The past
can never be changed, nor can we erase from our historical memory
the Thirty Years' War, the two World Wars or the consequences
of the last of these. It is, however, our duty to the world as
well as to ourselves to tell the truth about all these developments;
this is essential to our sanity as a nation and a state. As far
as the transfer of the German population is concerned, we must
also admit the inconvenient truth, regardless of any erratic conclusions
certain people might possibly draw from our words. Our self-reflection
is namely a further, even more consistent way of rejecting the
principles underlying the actions of all the present enemies of
an open society as they come up with claims in an effort to set
the vicious circle of never-ending tribal retaliation in motion
again.<BR>
Those who were once expelled or transferred from our country as
well as their descendants are welcome here now like all Germans
are. They are welcome as guests who esteem the lands where generations
of their forefathers once lived, who tend sites to which they
feel bound and work together with our citizens as friends. Perhaps
we are not so far away from the days when Czechs and Germans -
once they come together in the inwardly open land of the European
Union - will be free to settle anywhere in its territory and take
part in building the home of their choice. A good relationship
of nations, and thus also our reconciliation, can only be generated
by the cooperation of free citizens who resist the temptation
to rally under collectivist banners and, in the shadow thereof,
to call up the spirits of tribal feuds.<BR>
Just as the time of apologies and of sending bills for the past
should end, and a time of objective debate on the subject begin,
it is time that monologues and isolated proclamations give way
to dialogue. Actually, dialogue has already begun - among the
people, local self-government bodies, historians and even politicians.
I am an advocate of its constant widening and intensification.
However, it has to be a true dialogue. That is, we have to exchange
information, experience, knowledge, analyses, suggestions and
programmes, compare them, seek understanding and put into practice
whatever good things we shall agree upon, without either of us
feeling - not even by way of insinuation - like a hostage of the
other, or like a hostage of our sinister history.<BR>
In other words: the time of confrontation must end once and for
all, and be replaced by a time of cooperation. The more clearly
the parties to such joint efforts commit themselves to the idea
of a civil state and civil society, the better equipped they will
be to work together. Germany is way ahead, not only economically
but also because of the fact that at least its western part could
for years live in freedom and build a liberal democratic state
based on all the time-tested values of Western civilization while
pursuing a truly European course; that is, it has subscribed to
the ideal of Europe as a political body governed by the principle
of equality of large and small alike and their peaceful cooperation
on the basis of equal rights and in the spirit of their shared
respect for human rights and liberties, democracy, rule of law,
market economy and the concept of civil society. In the Czech
Republic, time stood still for many years, but we certainly can
make up for the delay quickly, especially if we draw on the potential
of our good traditions from the pre-war period that even fifty
seven years did not completely eradicate. Thus, the preconditions
for good cooperation are there. If disturbing tones, voices or
sentiments should make themselves felt, much more energy should
be given on both sides to efforts aimed at dealing with them.
On the German side, the former take the form of voices, fortunately
rather rare and isolated, that try to rehabilitate the intellectual
roots of the past German catastrophe, voices of secret nostalgics
who are unable to part with the concept of a national state as
the zenith of human endeavours and with the feeling that Germany
has been entrusted with a special mission that would entitle it
to a position of superiority vis-a-vis other nations. On the Czech
side, we find an awkward, essentially provincial combination of
fear of the Germans and servility to them, and also the inability
of a part of our population to cast off the straightjacket of
the prejudices that had so long been nurtured in our society.
Sometimes it seems to me as if the state of mind that was characteristic
of the period immediately after the war somehow persisted here,
strangely counterbalanced by a desire to &quot;get something out
of the Germans&quot;. Thus, we can meet people who - in the spirit
of the Communist propaganda - frighten those around them with
talk about the German threat but at the same time hang out signs
saying &quot;Zimmer frei&quot; on their houses and collect rent
in deutschmarks even from Czech tenants. On the one hand strong
words marked by a nationalist blindness of the mind and xenophobia,
on the other a total lack of an elementary civic pride.<BR>
It is the same thing again: the wish to replace the Communist
collectivism with a national one, to lie one's way out of one's
own civic responsibility and hide behind anonymity in a pack that
barks at all those who do not belong to it - this is one of the
variations of the phenomena we have to systematically combat.
The occasional signs of a subconscious belief in an infallible
voice of the blood, of fate, Providence and national myths, and
in a right to demand the impossible, that is, a correction of
history that is perceived as a continuous series of wrongs against
one's own tribe, are another variation of the same misconception.

<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>
Having mentioned all the various dangers lurking along the path
toward an auspicious future of the Czech-German relationship,
and described those who - possibly without being aware of it -
are enemies of such a future, I should like to profess my optimism.
<BR>
I believe in the democratic, liberal, European Germany. I believe
in the Germany of Theodor Heuss, Konrad Adenauer, Kurt Schumacher,
Ludwig Erhard, Willy Brandt and Richard von Weizs&auml;cker. I
believe in the millions of German democrats. I believe in Germany's
sincere desire to develop and intensify the process of European
unification based on the universal validity of the fundamental
values of Euro-American civilization, and I believe in its readiness
to work for Europe to be a continent of peace, freedom, cooperation,
security and just relations among all its states, nations and
regions. I therefore believe also in Germany's sincere readiness
to support a speedy integration of Central Europe into the North
Atlantic Alliance as well as into the European Union. I simply
believe in Germany's preparedness to be an influential party in
building an increasingly united Europe and, in this context, to
put its friendly relations with Poland, the Czech Republic and
other young democracies on a new footing, just as it once succeeded
in reshaping its relations with France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Denmark.<BR>
I am not alone among my fellow citizens in holding this belief.
The unequivocal support given by our state from the very beginning
- unreservedly and without suspicion - to Germany's democratic
reunification testifies to that. Already during our dissident
years many of us said - often meeting even among Germans with
a lack of understanding of this opinion - that there would be
no united Europe without a united Germany and that the Iron Curtain
would never fall unless the Berlin Wall collapsed first. <BR>
I also believe in the favourable development of the democratic
Czech Republic. I trust that it will speedily overcome the sad
legacy of Communism as well as of its more ancient historical
traumas and that it will gradually become a full-fledged and responsible
member of the family of European democracies.<BR>
I trust that already during this year many things will be done
in order to strengthen confidence between our countries and peoples,
gradually eliminating the obstacles and barriers that strain our
relations and helping to remove all the layers of prejudices,
misconceptions, illusions and suspicions we are confronted with.
I trust that we shall be able to build on the solid foundations
that we have laid for our coexistence since 1989, make use of
the opportunities offered by the Treaty between our states and
develop our cooperation with a renewed vigour and at all levels.
<BR>
I trust that our shared commitment to the fundamental values of
civilization on which the Europe of today is being built will
facilitate these endeavours and that we shall find within ourselves
enough courage to stand up against all those whose political orientation
draws on the calamitous past and who would wish to stroke out
our positive future.<BR>
I believe in the power of truth and good will as the principal
sources of our mutual understanding.<BR>
Thank you for your attention.

Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>

<P>
        Throughout my life I have held in high regard all those
who joined internal Resistance movements during World War II and
stood up to the preponderance of Nazi power. During my entire
life I have asked myself whether - if I were confronted with the
same situation as they were - I would be able to do what they
did: to risk my life every day for the values I believe in. To
me, Resistance fighters have always personified the highest standards
of moral strength, courage and faithfulness of a human being to
himself or herself - standards by which I have found myself permanently
challenged. Thus, I think there is no need for me to stress how
greatly honoured I am by the decoration I have received today.
This medal commemorates the Geuzen, the first group of brave Dutch
citizens who resisted evil, many paying for it with their lives.
The Geuzen - like other Dutch Resistance fighters, members of
the Resistance in my country and in all the other countries that
were occupied by the Nazis, as well as German Resistance fighters
- were not just accidental victims of despotism. They were well
aware what they were risking, but nevertheless chose to go into
battle, being deeply convinced that evil had to be combatted from
the very beginning, regardless of what the odds were for the immediate
success of their fight. It does not take that much of an effort
to arrive at the philosophic conviction that resistance against
evil is never pointless. But it is certainly not easy to put one's
own life at stake to prove that conviction and not retreat from
it even in the face of danger; in most cases, only a minority
are able to take that course.<BR>
        Thus, the significance of internal Resistance was not
only in the tangible results achieved by their efforts to thwart
the pernicious work of the Nazis. More importantly, the Resistance
was a phenomenon that time and again restored standards, pointed
out values that are worth fighting for under any circumstances,
maintained the continuity of respect for those values and carried
the torch of good through the dark night, so that those who lived
to see the dawn would have something to turn to, something on
which they could build a new life in freedom. Resistance fighters
were first and foremost bearers of light, founding fathers of
a better future. To me personally, their endeavour and the meaning
it has had in the long run have always represented proof of the
fact that the roots of a free, democratic and equitable society
lie deep in the sphere of morality, that such a society would
in fact be unthinkable without a moral anchor. I would even go
as far as to say that if someone is prepared to risk his or her
life in a fight whose outcome he or she cannot foresee, to risk
it not for his or her own sake but for the benefit that such an
action may possibly bring to posterity, for humankind and human
values as such, his or her decision to do so emanates not from
morality at the level of mere decency, but from morality as a
metaphysical phenomenon.<BR>
        In addition to that, Resistance against Nazism had another
dimension. It would not have been possible without a sense of
solidarity and togetherness among those who joined it, who more
than once hazarded or sacrificed their own lives rather than expose
their associates to detection, whose silence, maintained even
in the course of cruel interrogations, many times saved their
fellow fighters, who helped one another in many, often most risky
ways. The Resistance was a truly authentic human community, growing
out of the individual moral will of free human beings and based
on the best human qualities. Man is a sociable animal, but there
are different ways of associating. The most valuable type of human
togetherness is an association based on a free decision by each
of its members to work for certain universal human values, on
their conscious sharing of commitment to these values and their
determination to existentially vouch for them and to vouch for
one another's vouching. Such an attitude arises from openness
toward others, love for one's fellow humans, mutual respect and
trust, solidarity. A solidarity of free human beings.<BR>
        Nazism, too, had its conceptual roots in a certain kind
of togetherness. That, however, was a togetherness of so-called
tribesmen, people who were prepared to relinquish their own individual
responsibility for the sake of a collectivist notion of unity
of the blood and who let themselves be deluded by fanatic leaders
hypnotizing them with the perverted idea that collective responsibility
for the prosperity of their own tribe and for the expansion of
its state justified any betrayal of the elementary moral feeling
of the individual. People who are weak, who have no faith in themselves,
or who doubt themselves and therefore need some sort of collective
self-confirmation, those who prefer to dissolve in the anonymity
of a crowd, where a leader does the thinking for them, to carrying
the weight of their own responsible decision-making, who accept
the identity of a pack rather than engage in the difficult process
of seeking, building and defending their identity as individuals
- such people made possible the emergence of Nazism in Europe.
For that matter, Communist collectivism had a similar background.
Both inevitably produced totalitarian systems that trampled the
very foundations of humanity.<BR>
        We can therefore say that the confrontation of the Resistance
with Nazism was a confrontation of an authentic human togetherness
with a perverted, degenerate, false one, a confrontation of the
solidarity of responsible, moral beings capable of managing their
own affairs with a horrible conspiracy of people who abandoned
their individuality and exchanged their own responsibility for
obedience to a fanatic leader seeking to appeal principally to
one feature in them about which they had not decided themselves,
that is, to their national affiliation.<BR>
        We shall soon commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of
the end of World War II. This occasion will undoubtedly make us
 debate and reflect again and again on all aspects of that war
as we try to ascertain what message it holds for us fifty years
later.<BR>
        I believe that the victory over Nazism meant, among other
things, - at least for the western part of Europe - a victory
of respect for the individual human being, for his or her individual
rights and freedoms as well as individual responsibility. Thus,
it was also a victory of the concept of authentic human togetherness
over the destructive horror of another type of association, that
of the collectivist togetherness of unfree humans who resigned
their individual responsibility. It so happens that we shall observe
the fiftieth anniversary of this victory at a time when the sinister
historical role of Communist collectivism has been played out
as well.<BR>
        What the Resistance fighters, including the Geuzen, stood
for prevailed and became the starting point for the construction
of a democratic Europe and its unification on a civic basis. We
owe it, among other things, to the sacrifice made by the Resistance
that the values which the Resistance fighters were dying for have
become the cornerstones of a new Europe and new European institutions.
In this context, it is of particular significance that today's
democratic Germany, as an important partner in and co-author of
the process of European unification, is founded on these values
as well.<BR>
        While fifty years ago the Allies gained a victory over
Germany, today we can well say that Germany has gained a victory
over Germany - that is, the democratic and liberal Germany has
triumphed over both the nationalist and the Communist Germanies.
<BR>
        We are entering an era when we all have to join forces
in building a democratic Europe. In this era we - as nations -
no longer divide ourselves according to who were the victors and
who the vanquished back in the past. Now we all have the same
path before us. If there is anything that stands in the way of
our progress on that journey, it is but two dangerous phenomena.
One is the newly reviving activity of those who would wish to
raise the banner of national collectivism again in the new situation,
and thus, again, go against the course of history as well as the
interests of the individual human being. The other is weakness
and indifference on the part of democrats and their reluctance
to check the new nationalism, or signs thereof, in a timely and
resolute fashion. The hesitation of the democratic community vis-&agrave;-vis
the developments in the former Yugoslavia is the most visible
example of the latter today.<BR>
        I am confident that these obstacles, too, shall be gradually
overcome. I believe that the moral strength, solidarity, profound
responsibility for the fate of humankind and capability to resist
evil from the very beginning, in the name of the fundamental values
of humanity, manifested by all those who worked for domestic Resistance
movements in different European countries during the war shall
serve as a source of inspiration and strength as we continue to
pursue the struggle for a democratic Europe.<BR>
        I thank you for the Geuzenpenning, and also for the attention
with which you have listened to these remarks.

<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
Let me begin with a brief personal remark: for virtually my whole
life, with the exception of a short period in the late sixties,
I was barred from leaving my country. As the long decades went
by, I got so used to this absurd situation that I simply assumed
I would never ever get to see any other parts of the world. Needless
to say, visiting a continent as distant as Australia was, I thought,
absolutely impossible. In my mind, Australia was one of those
fabulous worlds beyond reach, worlds one cannot enter, just as
one cannot land on a far-away star, or step into another century.
<P>
A few years ago everything changed. The world opened up to us
all and I - as Head of State - began to travel all over the globe.
The most important thing I learned from this sweeping change was
how small our planet really is, and how much closer together places
are than I once believed. For this reason, I found it all the
more astonishing that the people living on this small planet are
incapable of living together, that they constantly wage countless
wars and have innumerable conflicts. Sometimes it took only a
few minutes to fly over a territory that has been the object of
strife for centuries. Though on my official trips I travel by
ordinary plane and not by spacecraft, I still feel I am beginning
to understand the experience of astronauts to whom all earthly
conflicts appear to be no more than trifles, incomprehensible,
petty and nonsensical, when they watch our planet from outer space.
<P>
Having said that, I should like - in my Czech accent which, I'm
afraid, is a far cry from the Australian one - to share with you
certain thoughts that come to my mind when I wonder about why
people behave so badly, and about where to look for the hope that
they might behave better in future.
<P>
______________________________________________________________

<P>
For thousands of years humans lived and evolved in different parts
of the Earth in fairly autonomous entities. Cultures and whole
civilizations appeared and disappeared, cultures that - seen from
a modern perspective - remained largely confined within their
own territories, isolated from one another. If they knew about
each other at all, their contacts were minimal. In those times,
few, if any, events in the human world could have had a substantial
and immediate impact on the world as a whole.
<P>
Nowadays, things are very different. Within a fairly brief period
of time - no more than a fraction of human history - a global
civilization has come into being and spread around the whole planet,
linking the different parts of it together, absorbing cultures
or spheres of civilization which had for so long developed as
autonomous units, and forcing them to adjust. A great many of
the conflicts or problems in our world today, it seems to me,
can be attributed to this new reality. They can be explained as
struggles of different cultural identities, not with this civilization,
but within themselves, for the survival or enhancement of what
they are and the ways in which they differ from each other - struggles
for what they appear to be losing. Some say we are living at a
time in which every valley wants to be independent. Sometimes
this really seems to be the case. This desire for independence
is an understandable reaction to the pressure to integrate and
unify exerted by our civilization. Cultural entities shaped by
thousands of years of history are resisting this, for fear that
within a few years they might dissolve in some global cultural
neutrality. If we mix all the colours together we get grey. Cultures
of different colours are apparently wrestling with the danger
of turning grey in the melting pot of a single civilization.
<P>
How can we overcome this contradiction? Where can we turn to for
hope?
<P>
The solution certainly does not lie in blindly putting our faith
in the essentially atheistic technological civilization of today.
We should not rely on the assumption that this civilization, supposedly
more progressive than all the multifarious cultures and civilizations
of the past, is more worthy than they are, or that it is justifiable
to suppress and annihilate traditions in its name because they
are believed to slow the victorious progress of history. Man is
also man's own past; fighting with the past would mean declaring
war on humanity itself. On the other hand, rejecting the present
civilization, abandoning all the good things it has brought and
attempting to return to some by-gone tribal life is not a solution
either.
<P>
The only wise course is the most demanding one: we must start
systematically to transform our civilization into a truly multicultural
civilization, one that will allow everyone to be themselves while
denying no one the opportunities it offers, one that strives for
the tolerant coexistence of different cultural identities, one
that clearly articulates the things that unite us and can develop
into a set of shared values and standards enabling us to lead
a creative life together. I am happy to be able to reiterate this
profound conviction here in Australia - a country that could serve
to many others as an example of a working multicultural democracy
that is trying to follow a course which can offer a way out of
the maze of pitfalls humankind currently finds itself lost in.
<P>
The main question is this: where we should look for sources of
a shared minimum that could serve as a framework for the tolerant
coexistence of different cultures within a single civilization.
It is not enough to take the set of imperatives, principles or
rules produced by the Euro-American world and mechanically declare
them binding for all. If anyone is to accept these principles,
identify with them and follow them, those principles will have
to appeal to something that has been present in him or her before,
to some of his or her inherent qualities. Different cultures or
spheres of civilization can share only what they perceive as genuine
common ground, not something that some simply offer to or even
force upon others. The rules of human coexistence on this Earth
can work only if they grow out of the deepest experience of everyone,
not just some. They have to be formulated so as to be in harmony
with what man - as a human being, not as a member of a particular
group - has learned, experienced, endured.
<P>
Every unbiased person will have no trouble knowing where to look.
If we examine the oldest moral canons, the commandments that prescribe
proper human conduct and the rules of human coexistence, we find
numerous essential similarities among them. It is often surprising
to discover that virtually identical moral norms arise in different
places and different times, largely independently of one another.
Another important thing is that the moral foundations upon which
different civilizations or cultures were built always had transcendental,
or metaphysical roots. It is scarcely possible to find a culture
that does not derive from the conviction that a higher, mysterious
order of the world exists beyond our reach, a higher intention
that is the source of all things, a higher memory recording everything,
a higher authority to which we are all accountable in one way
or another. That order has had a thousand faces. Human history
has known a vast array of gods and deities, religious and spiritual
beliefs, rituals and liturgies. Nevertheless, since time immemorial,
the key to the existence of the human race, of nature and of the
universe, as well as the key to what is required of human responsibility
has always been found in what transcends humanity, in what stands
above it. Humanity must respect this if the world is to survive.
To this day, this point of departure has been present in all our
archetypal notions and in our long-lost knowledge, despite the
obvious estrangement from these values that modern civilization
has brought with it. Yet, even as our respect for the mysteries
of the world dwindles, we can see for ourselves again and again
that such a lack of respect leads to ruin. All this clearly suggests
where we should look for what unites us: in an awareness of the
transcendental.
<P>
I possess no specific directions on how to revive this awareness
which was once common to the whole human race, on how to retrieve
it from the depths to which it has sunk, or how to do this in
a way that is appropriate for this era and at the same time universal,
acceptable to all. Yet, when thinking about it, no matter where
or in what context, I always - without intending to - come to
the conclusion that this is precisely where we should begin the
search for the means of coexistence on this planet, and for the
salvation of the human race from the many dangers to its existence
that civilization generates. We should seek new ways to restore
the feeling for what transcends humanity, for what gives a meaning
to the world surrounding it, as well as to human life itself.
<P>
Dostoyevsky wrote that if there were no God everything would be
permitted. To put it simply, it seems to me that our present civilization,
having lost the awareness that the world has a spirit, believes
that anything is permitted. The only spirit that we recognize
is our own.
<P>
However different the paths followed by different civilizations,
we can find the same basic message at the core of most religions
and cultures throughout history: people should revere God as a
phenomenon that transcends them; they should revere one another;
and they should not harm their fellow humans.
<P>
To my mind, reflecting on this message is the only way out of
the crisis the world finds itself in today. Of course, such a
reflection must be free of prejudice and it must be critical,
no matter who may turn out to be a target of that criticism.
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
Allow me to offer you a specific illustration of this general
idea.
<P>
The Euro-American world of modern times has developed a fairly
consistent system of values of human coexistence, which is now
accepted as a basis of international coexistence, too. These values
include the concept of human rights and liberties growing out
of respect for the individual human being and his or her dignity.
They include democracy which rests on separation of the legislative,
executive and judicial powers, on political pluralism and free
elections. And they include respect for private ownership of property
and the rules of the market economy. I unreservedly subscribe
to this system of values and so does the Czech Republic.
<P>
And yet, from different parts of the world, including the Pacific
region, we hear voices calling these values into question, arguing
that they are the creation of a single culture and cannot simply
be transferred to other cultures. Naturally, such voices point
out all the faults to be found in the West in order to make their
case that these values are faulty or inadequate. One typical argument
is that Western democracy is marked by a profound crisis of authority
and that without respect for authority as a means of ensuring
law and order, society is bound to fall apart.
<P>
The odd thing is, those who say this are right and wrong at the
same time.
<P>
They are certainly right in saying that the Western world is suffering
from a crisis of authority. As a man who is a fairly recent arrival
in the world of high politics, and who has suddenly seen it from
the inside, I have time and again experienced the odd fact that
the public, other politicians, and the media as well are far more
interested in casting doubt on the authority of a politician than
they are in whether it is desirable that he or she should wield
authority in the first place. This is not something I mind personally
- for one thing, nobody can have as many doubts about myself as
I can. But I am concerned about this phenomenon as a political
reality. If politicians have no authority at all, the state and
its various constituent parts cannot have any authority either.
This, in turn, has an adverse effect on society.
<P>
But is this crisis of authority a product of democracy? And if
so, does it not follow that an authoritarian regime, a dictatorship
or a totalitarian system are preferable to democracy after all?
<P>
That is certainly not the case.
<P>
The present crisis of authority is only one of a thousand consequences
of the general crisis of spirituality in the world at present.
Humankind, having lost its respect for a higher, superterrestrial
authority, has necessarily lost respect for any earthly authority,
too. Consequently, people also lose respect for their fellow humans
and eventually even for themselves. This loss of a transcendental
perspective, to which everything on this Earth relates, inevitably
leads to a collapse of earthly value systems as well. Humanity
has lost what I once privately described as the absolute horizon;
and as a result, everything in life has become relative. All sense
of responsibility disintegrates, including responsibility for
the human community and its authorities. This is a philosophical,
not a political problem. However, even a decaying or diminishing
democratic authority is a thousand times better than the thoroughly
artificial authority of a dictator imposed through violence or
brainwashing.
<P>
Democracy is an open system, and thus it is capable of improvement.
Among other things, freedom provides room for responsibility.
If that room is not sufficiently used, the fault does not lie
with democracy, but it does present democracy with a challenge.
Dictatorship offers no room for responsibility, and thus it can
generate no genuine authority. Instead, it fills all the available
space with the pseudoauthority of a dictator.
<P>
Potential dictators are well aware of the crisis of authority
in democracy. The less the atheistic man of today heeds the challenge
that democracy presents him, the less he succeeds in filling the
room it offers by taking genuine and unquestioned responsibility,
the faster a dictator, posing as the bearer of universal responsibility,
will proceed to occupy that room until finally he will occupy
it entirely. Hitler, Lenin or Mao were typical examples of this
species. Filling all the available room with a completely false
authority, they closed it off, destroyed it and eventually destroyed
democracy itself. We all know where this leads: to hecatombs of
the dead, the tortured or the humiliated. In a word: while democracy
paves the way to the creation of real authority, an authoritarian
regime blocks that path with a terrible barrier, with the caricature
of authority.
<P>
The chances for a successful existential revolution - as I once
metaphorically described the awakening of a deeper human responsibility
- are far better under freedom and democracy than under a dictatorship,
where the only room offered to anyone who wishes to take responsibility
is a prison cell.
<P>
The Western world cannot be faulted for sticking to democracy.
Though democracy may surely take different forms, it is, today,
the only way open to us all. What the West can be faulted for
is its failure to properly understand and safeguard this fantastic
accomplishment. Paralyzed by a general moral crisis, it has been
unable to make use of all the opportunities offered by this great
invention, and give a meaningful content to the space it has opened
up. It is because of these deficiencies that madmen have, again
and again, managed to devastate democracy and unleash a variety
of global horrors.
<P>
What conclusion should we draw from this? That there is no reason
to fear democracy, or to perceive it as a system that destroys
authority and tears everything apart. Another option is available
to those who wish to prevent this destruction: they can take democracy
as a challenge to demonstrate responsibility and to introduce,
or rather restore, the spirit and substance it once had when it
first came into being. This is a superhuman task; yet, in the
open system which democracy is, it can be accomplished.
<P>
In cultures where the roots of democracy are still shallow, or
where democracy has not taken root at all so far, and where a
free individual means virtually nothing while the leader is omnipotent,
leaders often appeal to the centuries-old traditions of authority
in their sphere, and seek to give legitimacy to their dictatorial
rule by claiming to continue these traditions.
<P>
Again, they are both right and wrong. They are wrong in that what
they present as the continuity of ancient traditions is in fact
their negation. While recalling the natural authority that leaders
may possess in their cultural systems, they replace it with an
unnatural authority. Instead of an authority emanating from charisma,
authority as an innerly perceived and widely accepted higher vocation,
authority marked by a high degree of responsibility toward their
self-imposed task, - instead of this, they establish the utterly
secularized authority of the whip.
<P>
Thus, - to put it in simplified terms - if the East can borrow
democracy and its inherent values from the West as a space in
which a reawakening sense of the transcendental can restore authority,
then the West can learn from the East what true authority is,
what it grows from, and how it conducts itself. It can then be
spread throughout the zone of human freedom which it has created.
I think in this context of Confucius, who so aptly described what
it means to wield genuine authority. His standards have very little
in common with the ideas of today's men of the whip. To him, authority
- be it in the father of a family or the ruler of a state - is
a metaphysically anchored gift whose strength derives from his
or her heightened responsibility, not from the might of the instruments
of power he or she may wield. Moreover, charisma is lost when
a person betrays it.
<P>
Though many see them as opposites, both East and West are in a
sense enmeshed in the same problem: both are betraying their own
deepest spiritual roots. If they were to look back and draw from
these roots more of their life-giving sap, each might not only
do better for itself, but they might immediately begin to understand
each other better than they do now.
<P>
This small example of what the West can give the East, and vice
versa, may perhaps illustrate that a search for common principles
and objectives can be useful for everyone, and that it may be
pursued without anyone losing their identity in the process. It
also shows that such a search would be unimaginable if we do not
make contact with the original, long-forgotten transcendental
roots of our cultures. In the moral world of Antiquity, of Judaism
and of Christianity, without which the West would hardly have
come to modern democracy, we can find more points of agreement
with Confucius than we would think, and more than is realized
by those who invoke the Confucian tradition to condemn Western
democracy.
<P>
Dear Friends,
<P>
I hope that you have understood what I meant to say, despite my
Czech accent and the simplified way I have attempted to condense,
in a few sentences, some of my thoughts about the present-day
world. I see the only chance for today's civilization in a clear
awareness of its multicultural character, in a radical enhancement
of its inner spirit and in an effort to find the shared spiritual
roots of all cultures, for they are what unites all people. It
is on this basis that we should articulate anew the standards
and practices that will enable us to live together in peace without
having to give up our identities. We have an opportunity now to
open up an entirely new era of mutual inspiration. The preconditions
for this are genuine openness, the will to understand each other,
and the ability to step beyond the confines of our own habits
and prejudices. Identity is not a prison, it is an appeal for
dialogue with others.
<P>
I invite you all most cordially to come to visit the Czech Republic,
a small country situated in the very centre of Europe. It is my
hope that you will not have to go through any battlefields on
the way, and that you will feel what I feel whenever I travel:
that our planet is small, and a rather nice place to live, and
that it would be the greatest absurdity of all if those destined
to live together on it were to fail to do so, despite the fact
that love for one's fellow humans is the central commandment of
all our contending cultures.
<P>
Thank you for your attention.

<P>
Your Magnificence,
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
Some time ago a wise old man came to see me in Prague and I listened
to him with admiration. Shortly afterwards I heard that this man
had died. His name was Karl Popper. He was a world traveller who
followed the biggest war ever waged by humankind - the war unleashed
by the tribal fury of Nazi ideology - from this country, from
New Zealand. It was here that he thought about the state of the
world, and it was here that he wrote his most important books.
Undoubtedly influenced by the harmonious coexistence of people
of different cultures on these islands, he posed the question
why it was so difficult for the idea of an open society to prevail
against wave after wave of tribalism, and inquired into the spiritual
background of all enemies of open society and into the patterns
of their thinking.
<P>
Addressing you on this ceremonial occasion, I should like to offer
a few remarks on Sir Karl Popper's thoughts and thus pay tribute
to the recently deceased thinker.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
One of the targets of Popper's profound criticism - which he supported
by ample evidence - was a phenomenon he called holistic social
engineering. He used this term to describe human attempts to change
the world for the better completely and globally, on the basis
of some preconceived ideology that purported to understand all
the laws of historical development and to describe inclusively,
comprehensively and holistically a state of affairs that would
be the ultimate realization of these laws. Popper clearly demonstrated
that this pattern of human thinking and behaviour can only lead
to a totalitarian system.
<P>
I come from a country that lived under a Communist regime for
several decades. On the basis of my own experience, I can therefore
confirm that Sir Karl Popper was right. In the beginning was an
allegedly scientific theory of historical laws; that Marxist theory
subsequently gave rise to the Communist utopia, the vision of
a paradise on Earth, and the latter eventually produced the gulags,
the endless suffering of many nations, the endless violation of
the human being. Anything that in any way opposed the vision of
the world offered by Communism, thus calling that vision into
question or actually proving it wrong, was mercilessly crushed.
Needless to say, life, with its unfathomable diversity and unpredictability,
never allowed itself to be squeezed into the crude Marxist cage.
All that the guardians of the cage could do was to suppress and
destroy whatever they could not make fit into it. Ultimately,
war had to be declared on life itself and its innermost essence.
I could give you thousands of concrete examples of how all the
natural manifestations of life were stifled in the name of an
abstract, theoretical vision of a better world. It was not just
that there were what we call human rights abuses. This enforced
vision led to the moral, political and economic devastation of
all of society.
<P>
Instead of such holistic engineering, Popper argued for a gradual
approach, an effort to improve incrementally the institutions,
mechanisms and techniques of human coexistence, to improve them
by remaining constantly in touch with life and constantly enriching
our experience. Improvements and changes must be made according
to whatever has proved to be good, practical, desirable and meaningful,
without the arrogant presumption that we have understood everything
about this world, and thus know everything there is to know about
how to change it for the better.
<P>
In my country, one of the understandable reactions to the tragic
experience of Communism is the opinion we sometimes encounter
that man should, if possible, refrain altogether from changing
or ameliorating the world, from devising long-range concepts,
strategic plans or visions. All this is seen as part of the armoury
of holistic social engineering. This opinion, of course, is a
grave error. Paradoxically, it has much in common with the fatalism
Popper finds in those who believe they have grasped the laws of
history and that they serve those laws. This fatalism takes the
form of the peculiar idea that society is no more than a machine
that, once properly set in motion, can then run on its own, automatically
and permanently.
<P>
I am opposed to holistic social engineering. I refuse, however,
to pour out the baby with the bathwater and I am a long way from
thinking that people should give up altogether on a constant search
for ways of improving the world in which they must live together.
It must be done even though they may never achieve more than partial
improvements in particular areas, will always have to wait to
see whether the change was the right thing to do, and must always
be prepared to rectify whatever life has shown to be wrong.
<P>
Recently I expressed this opinion in the presence of a philosopher
friend of mine. He looked somewhat puzzled at first, and then
began trying to persuade me of something I have never denied,
that the world, in its very essence, is a holistic entity; that
everything in it is interconnected; that whatever we do in any
one place has an unfathomable impact everywhere, though we may
not see the whole of it; that even the post-modern science of
these days supplies evidence of that.
<P>
With this remark, my friend has compelled me to supplement what
I said, and perhaps even what Popper wrote. Yes, it is true that
society, the world, the universe - Being itself - is a deeply
mysterious phenomenon, held together by billions of mysterious
interconnections. Knowing all this and humbly accepting it is
one thing; the arrogant belief that humanity, or the human spirit
or reason, can grasp and describe the world in its entirety and
derive from this description a vision of its improvement is something
else altogether. It is one thing to be aware of the interconnection
of all events; believing that we have fully understood this is
something completely different.
<P>
In other words: I believe, as Popper does, that neither politicians,
nor scientists, nor entrepreneurs, nor anyone else should fall
for the vain belief that they can grasp the world as a whole and
change it as a whole by one single action. Seeking to improve
it, people should proceed with utmost caution and sensitivity,
on a step-by-step basis, always paying attention to what each
change actually brings about. At the same time, however, I believe
- possibly differing from Popper's views to some extent - that
as they do so, they should constantly bear in mind all the global
interrelations that they are aware of, and know that beyond their
knowledge there exists an infinitely wider range of interrelations.
My relatively brief sojourn in the realm of so-called high politics
convinces me time and again of the need to take this very approach:
most of the threats hanging over the world now, as well as many
of the problems confronting it, could be handled much more effectively
if we were able to see past the ends of our noses and take into
consideration, to some extent at least, the broader interconnections
that go beyond the scope of our immediate or group interests.
This awareness, of course, should never become an arrogant utopian
conviction that we alone possess the whole truth about these interconnections.
On the contrary, it should emanate from a deep and humble respect
for them and for their mysterious order.
<P>

My country is now witnessing a debate about the role of intellectuals:
about how important or how dangerous they are, about the degree
to which they can be independent, about how much or in what ways
they should become engaged in politics. At times, the debate has
been confused, partly because the word &quot;intellectual&quot;
means different things to different people. This is closely related
to what I have just said here.
<P>
Let me try - just for the moment - to define an intellectual.
To me, an intellectual is a person who has devoted his or her
life to thinking in more general terms about the affairs of this
world and the broader context of things. Of course, it is not
only intellectuals who do this. Intellectuals, however, do it
- if I may use the word - professionally. That is, their principal
occupation is studying, reading, teaching, writing, publishing,
addressing the public. Often - though certainly not always! -
this makes them more receptive toward more general issues; often
- though by far not always! - it leads them to embrace a broader
sense of responsibility for the state of the world and its future.
<P>
If we accept this definition of an intellectual, then it will
come as no surprise that many an intellectual has done a great
deal of harm to the world. Taking an interest in the world as
a whole and feeling an increased sense of responsibility for it,
intellectuals often yield to the temptation to attempt grasping
the world as a whole, explaining it entirely and offering universal
solutions to its problems. An impatience of mind and a variety
of mental shortcuts are the usual reasons why intellectuals tend
to devise holistic ideologies and succumb to the seductive power
of holistic social engineering. For that matter - were not the
forerunners of Nazi ideology, the founders of Marxism, and the
first Communist leaders intellectuals par excellence? Did not
a number of dictators, and even some terrorists - from the leaders
of the former German Red Brigades to Pol Pot - start off as intellectuals?
Not to mention the many intellectuals who, though they neither
created nor introduced dictatorships, time and again failed to
stand up to them because they were more than others prone to accept
the delusion that there was a universal key to eliminating human
woes. It was to describe this phenomenon that the expression &quot;trahison
des clercs&quot; - &quot;the betrayal of the intellectuals&quot;
was coined. The many different anti-intellectual campaigns in
my country have always supported their case with reference to
this type of intellectuals. And it is from there that they derive
their belief that an intellectual is a biological species dangerous
to humankind.
<P>
Those who claim this are committing an error very similar to the
one committed by those whose utter rejection of socialist planning
leads them to reject any conceptual thinking whatsoever.
<P>
It would be nonsense to believe that all intellectuals have succumbed
to utopianism or holistic engineering. A great number of intellectuals
both past and present have done precisely what I think should
be done: they have perceived the broader context, seen things
in more global terms, recognized the mysterious nature of globality
and humbly deferred to it. Their increased sense of responsibility
for this world has not made such intellectuals identify with an
ideology; it has made them identify with humanity, its dignity
and its prospects. These intellectuals build people-to-people
solidarity. They foster tolerance, struggle against evil and violence,
promote human rights and argue for their indivisibility. In a
word, they represent what has been called &quot;the conscience
of society&quot;. They are not indifferent when people in an unknown
country on the other side of the planet are annihilated, or when
children starve there, nor are they unconcerned about global warming
and whether future generations will be able to lead an endurable
life. They care about the fate of virgin forests in faraway places,
about whether or not humankind will soon destroy all its non-renewable
resources or whether a global dictatorship of advertisement, consumerism
and blood-and-thunder stories on TV will ultimately lead the human
race to a state of complete idiocy.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
And where do intellectuals stand in relation to politics? There
have been many misunderstandings about that, too.
<P>
My opinion is simple: when meeting with utopian intellectuals,
we should make every effort not to give in to their siren calls.
If they enter politics, we should believe them even less. The
other type of intellectuals - those who know about the ties that
link everything in this world together, who approach the world
with humility, but also with an increased sense of responsibility,
who wage a struggle for every good thing - should be listened
to with the greatest attention, regardless of whether they work
as independent critics, holding up a much needed mirror to politics
and power, or are directly involved in politics. These two roles
are very different from each other. My friend Timothy Garton Ash,
with whom I have been discussing this subject for years, is certainly
right about that. But while this is clearly so, it does not follow
that we should bar such intellectuals from the realm of politics
on the pretext that they only belong at universities or in the
media. On the contrary: I am deeply convinced that the more such
people engage directly in practical politics, the better our world
will fare. By its very essence, politics induces those who work
in it to focus their attention on short-term issues that have
a direct bearing on the next elections instead of on what will
happen a hundred years from now. It compels them to pursue group
interests rather than the interests of the human community as
a whole, to say things that please everyone and not those which
people are not so happy to hear, to treat even truth itself with
caution. But this is not a sign that intellectuals have no place
in politics. It is instead a challenge to draw into it as many
of them as possible. After all, who is better equipped to decide
about the fate of this globally interconnected civilization than
someone who is most keenly aware of these interconnections, who
pays the greatest regard to them, who takes the most responsible
attitude toward the world as a whole?

Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
It is a magnificent feeling to know that a man can think about
the problems of our world and read works by an outstanding philosopher
in the Czech Republic, tens of thousands of kilometres away from
here, and then, just a few hours later, share his thoughts with
a receptive audience here in New Zealand, where that philosopher
once wrote his books. I am grateful to you for offering me this
opportunity and I am grateful to Victoria University for allowing
me to consider myself as of this day a New Zealand doctor.
<P>
Thank you for your attention.

<P>
General Joulwan,<BR>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>
        A few years ago, soon after my election as President of
the free Czechoslovakia, I had the honour to be the first representative
of a state that had shaken off Communism to address the North
Atlantic Council at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels. Shortly
afterwards I found myself entrusted with a very special, to my
mind almost incredible, task: at the last Warsaw Pact summit in
Prague it was me who announced to the world that the Pact had
just been dissolved. And today I am the first politician from
a country that is not a member of NATO who has the privilege to
speak before your assembly. I thank you for inviting me to do
so. To me, this opportunity to share my thoughts with you is yet
another link in the remarkable chain of events which fate would
have me experience.<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        When the Iron Curtain was torn down and the bipolar division
of Europe and the world began to fall apart, I believed - undoubtedly
influenced by the joyous climate of those times - that the North
Atlantic Alliance, as the most important security organization
defending the values of the Euro-Atlantic West, would soon grow
into a pan-European structure and thus become one of the building
blocks in the construction of an integrated Europe. The fall of
the Iron Curtain appeared to offer a chance that Europe would,
for the first time ever, begin to build its order on the principle
of cooperation in which all would be equal, that all would assume,
jointly and severally, responsibility for its democratic existence,
that it would finally become a continent emitting a spirit of
peace to the rest of the world instead of exporting conflicts
and wars.<BR>
        I soon learned how much more complicated life was than
it had seemed to be in those euphoric times, and realized that
it would take much more time and effort to attain the goal that
I had then thought to be but an inch away. Let there be no misunderstanding:
I am not at all disappointed, I just know more than I did before.
I simply cannot be disappointed because I am well aware that life
always surprises us in one way or another, never being exactly
what we would wish it to be, that unpredictability and dramatic
events are its inherent features and that the string of unpleasant
surprises and troubles that we may encounter is a part of life
as well. Of course, this awareness cannot relieve us of our duty
to constantly work - against the background of a reflection on
life's dramatic development - in order to make it better.<BR>
        It is a fact that the fall of the Iron Curtain was not
the end of history. It was neither the end of human suffering
or conflicts nor a beginning of a paradise on Earth. It was just
the end of one historical era, and our generation has been called
upon to build on its ruins the foundations of a new era with perseverance
and patience, using the best of our knowledge and conscience,
and with the boldness which this historic moment requires.<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        What kind of a world it is that we are now entering? What
kind of a new world order is emerging? What course should we take
in our endeavours?<BR>
        There is every indication that we find ourselves on the
threshold of a period which we might call the era of one single
global civilization. This civilization can only survive if it
perceives itself as multicultural and multipolar, and bases its
existence on the principle of cooperation, on an equal footing,
of all its spheres, of all the cultures, regions and continents
that it encompasses. In other words, it has to look for patterns
of coexistence that correspond with all the good things generated
throughout the history of human civilizations and with all the
good standards to be found in the roots of the cultures which
form it - patterns shared by all rather than imposed by some upon
others. I am putting this very briefly, and thus in a somewhat
simplified manner, but I hope you understand what I have meant
to say: that the salvation of this civilization can only be found
in a new type of universalism. Metaphorically, we might perhaps
call it ecumenical universalism. That means that everyone should
be allowed to be themselves and to maintain their unique identities
while, at the same time, all should be able to live together,
drawing on a shared minimum of universal values which they have
embraced not because someone has forced them to do so, but because
these values are a part of their primordial nature with which
they genuinely identify.<BR>
        It is a natural manifestation of this new era that the
world has seen the emergence and development of a variety of more
or less integrated groupings of states that share the same background
of civilization and are close to one another geographically, culturally,
historically, politically and economically. I believe that in
future these structures may well be instrumental in meeting the
very challenges which the multipolar and multicultural character
of this civilization puts before us. First, they can guarantee
the individuality of different parts of the world, cultivating
that which distinguishes them from other regions. Second, they
can serve as tools of peaceful cooperation inside those regions.
Third, they can facilitate and enhance cooperation of the regions
and their parts with other regions.<BR>
        During the past few centuries, Europe has exported to
the rest of the world many good things, and many bad ones as well.
Now, it apparently finds itself at a fateful juncture, and has
to decide which role it will be playing in the world in the decades
and centuries to come. There are many options it can choose from.
To my mind, one of the best courses open to it, and one that it
should pursue, is the role of an exemplary integrated body that
has no expansionist ambitions and therefore threatens no one,
but is able to defend itself against a potential threat, a body
that can resolve its various internal problems by peaceful means
without deviating from the values to which it has pledged allegiance
and that seeks to have the best possible cooperation with all
the other parts of the world. In this, the North American continent,
being closest to Europe in terms of civilization, will probably
always hold the most important position.<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        What role can the North Atlantic Alliance play in this
vision of a future Europe? What should it do to live up to the
historic tasks lying ahead of us?<BR>
        Now, all of you probably expect me to say that its most
important task is to boldly expand by admitting the new European
democracies. I apologize for disappointing your expectations:
I believe that the expansion of the Alliance, which I consider
to be vital not only to the interests of our countries, but first
and foremost to the interests of the Alliance itself and the whole
of Europe, should be preceded by another step, one that is even
more important: a new formulation of its raison d'&ecirc;tre,
its mission and its identity. The enlargement of NATO should come
as a natural consequence of its new self-definition; only then
can it make sense. If NATO were to be expanded just mechanically
- like a club that takes in new members - or merely out of courtesy
toward those who now find themselves in a security vacuum after
dismantling the Warsaw Pact, it would not be likely to do much
good. An enlarged NATO will necessarily be different from the
unenlarged one. This has to be clearly understood in advance,
and this knowledge should be reflected in its new self-definition.
In other words: a NATO that would expand physically while failing
to expand mentally and conceptually would hardly work too well.
<BR>
        NATO was originally established principally as a defence
alliance of the West in the face of the Communist threat. It was
thus a child of the bipolar division of the world. The danger
that once emanated from the Communist part is not there any more,
the bipolar world has ceased to exist and Europe is no longer
unnaturally cut in two by the Iron Curtain.<BR>
        What should NATO's new mission be under these circumstances?
Let me offer a few remarks on this subject:<BR>
        1) NATO should once again, in no uncertain terms, declare,
and translate into every aspect of its strategy, the fact that
it is before all else an instrument for the defence of the Euro-American
political and cultural realm and its values against any possible
threat, no matter where it might come from. The universality of
the values which it protects should make the Alliance feel duty-bound
not to a priori reject, for whatever reason, any nation of the
Euro-American area that demonstrably shares these values and wishes
to contribute to their defence. Doing so would amount to a virtual
negation of the universal nature of the protected values, gradually
reducing NATO to a mere sentimental memento of long bygone times,
something like a company of pals from younger days or Cold War
veterans, while others, including some NATO member states, would
proceed to set up the real European security balance on their
own. That would bring us precisely to the kind of situation which
we now have a chance of avoiding once and for all: a situation
in which the powerful ones divide spheres of influence between
themselves, negotiating about what order they will impose in which
part of Europe. We all know to what ends such practices usually
lead: to conflicts. NATO should therefore make it clear that it
is no longer a pact uniting certain states against a more or less
obvious enemy and that it wants instead to become one of the guarantors
of the secure existence of the Euro-American democracy as such.
<BR>
        2) Under certain conditions defined in the most precise
terms, a NATO based on this concept should be able to intervene
 even outside its own borders in order to defend the Euro-American
political realm and its values. And while it was originally built
so as to be fit to resist a global attack by a predictable enemy,
its new self-definition should logically lead it to focus much
more on its ability to effectively check largely unpredictable
particular threats to the area whose security, freedom and stability
it feels obligated to defend.<BR>
        3) With this new perception of itself, NATO should not
beat about the bush in relation to Russia. It should say clearly
that Russia is a power with which the Alliance wants to cooperate
on equal terms, regarding Russia not as an adversary but as a
country with which it needs to maintain a strategic partnership
that may, if necessary, be underpinned by a treaty arrangement.
In such an environment, the OSCE could also serve as an institutionalized
forum for NATO's dialogue and cooperation with Russia, the Commonwealth
of Independent States and other nations.<BR>
        4) Partnership for Peace should be neither an automatic
prelude to full membership nor a substitute for it. It should
be a space extending around the Alliance in which NATO spreads
its concepts, and thus a means through which the Alliance strengthens
pan-European peace, in effect directly responding to its primary
objective.<BR>
        It may sound somewhat harsh, but I will admit my feeling
that unless NATO finds soon the courage to clearly redefine its
mission, and to expand in keeping with this new definition, it
may within a few years become largely ineffectual. If that were
to happen the Alliance would miss the historic chance it now has:
the chance of gradually becoming the principal guarantor of security,
peace and democratic development in Europe.<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        Let me now finally turn to the subject which you probably
expected me to begin with - the expansion itself.<BR>
        The new European democracies that have emerged from the
ruins of the Communist world are seeking membership in the European
Union. Some have a chance of joining it sooner, others may become
ready later on, but the process is bound to be long and arduous
for all of them. It is not easy to make up for fifty years' delay.
Nevertheless, it is evidently in the interests of the whole of
Europe that these countries should progress toward membership
in the Union, which has been a cornerstone of European integration.
Throughout history, the price for any division of Europe has ultimately
been paid by the whole continent. It follows that its unification
is essential to the interests of all European countries.<BR>
        However, the road towards the European Union affords no
shortcuts.<BR>
        Consequently, the decision about whether NATO will begin
to expand soon, without making accession to membership in the
Alliance conditional upon EU membership, is all the more important.
Admission of the new democracies to NATO will make these countries
feel safer and more secure and enhance their awareness of their
European affiliation. It will erase the feeling that the West,
lacking the courage to take tangible action, has nothing but kind
words for us or that we shall be forever relegated to the position
of inferior democracies, unworthy of complete integration with
the full-fledged ones. I am certain that accession to NATO membership
would add to political stability in the new democracies, allaying
the natural nervousness of their populations, lessening the impact
of the voices of demagogues, populists and nationalists, and thus
creating favourable conditions for those countries to build ever
closer ties with the European Union and to work in peace and quiet
on all the things we have to do in order to become eligible to
actually join the Union. I do believe that an enlargement of NATO
carried out against the background of the Alliance's new self-definition
and of its strategic partnership with Russia could represent the
first major step towards a peaceful, increasingly united and truly
safe Europe. On the other hand, prolonged hesitation might generate
instability and the growth of nationalism. The most familiar psychological
source of such sentiments has always lain in the feeling of being
spurned, or of not having received adequate appreciation - to
put it simply, in the feeling of not being taken seriously by
the world, of being unwanted. If, God forbid, things were to go
that way it would inevitably unsettle the situation throughout
Europe sooner or later. The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia
provide a most powerful warning to all those who may think that
there are European developments that do not concern Europe as
a whole. With the city of Sarajevo being the focal point of the
Yugoslav tragedy, I can hardly imagine a more articulate or symbolic
historical warning signal than the one which is being sent to
Europe from there. In other words, it would be very short-sighted
indeed if NATO were to wait until such time when the whole of
Europe is perfectly stable before admitting new members. Such
a time might never occur, and eventually the Alliance itself might
have to pay a heavy price for its hesitation. As you can see,
I perceive NATO as an instrument to spread stability, not as a
body that just waits for it to somehow come. Didn't NATO play
an important stabilizing role in the very first years of its existence,
when it substantially contributed toward ending once and for all
conflicts between Western powers that had dragged on for centuries?
Doesn't this positive experience challenge the Alliance to make
an effort to contribute toward pan-European stability as well?
<BR>
        Lively discussions have been under way about the delicate
issue of who should be admitted sooner and who later, and who
should never become a member. Being a representative of one of
the nations aspiring to membership, I of course cannot advise
the Alliance on this matter. I shall therefore limit myself to
three general remarks:<BR>
        1) I think that every person of sound judgment who knows
European history and sees what the map of Europe looks like has
to understand that the process should begin in Central Europe.
That area, traditionally a neuralgic spot and a testing ground
of European security, is closest to NATO both geographically and
in terms of political culture.<BR>
        2) If some are admitted sooner than others it should be
made clear from the very beginning that it is not an act of distrust
towards those still awaiting admission, let alone a sign that
they are out for good. If there were some sort of a long-term,
though of course tentative, timetable of the enlargement, based
on understandable logic and laying down clearly formulated eligibility
requirements, everyone would undoubtedly be reassured.<BR>
        3) The expansion will obviously have to end somewhere;
NATO certainly does not intend to turn either into a new OSCE
or into a United Nations. But where does Europe end? Where is
the end of the Euro-American cultural realm? It surely is a difficult
question, but some things should nevertheless be said quite clearly
from the very outset. First of all: wherever NATO ends, there
will be no new Iron Curtain. There will simply be a natural border
between two regional groupings engaged in functional cooperation,
or a border of a grouping with an unaffiliated nation. Furthermore,
it should be said that for all countries, including the ones situated,
so to speak, on the boundary, the outcome will depend principally
on the decisions they take and on their political development.
It is these nations themselves that have to know best where they
should belong, and their choice must be demonstrated through their
policies and through the type of political culture which they
adopt. Another thing which seems obvious to me is that Russia
could hardly ever be a NATO member. Russia is a vast Euro-Asian
power, one of the largest states in the world, so specific and
influential that one could scarcely think of any reasonable way
in which it might be integrated into a security structure grown
out of different historical traditions and in a different spiritual
environment, or how it could adjust to the decision-making systems
or indeed to the working patterns of that structure without paralyzing
the Alliance by the sheer weight of its own interests and force
of its gravitational field. This makes it all the more important
that a balanced strategic partnership be built between NATO and
Russia.<BR>
______________________________________________________________
<BR>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>
        Let me conclude with a few remarks about the Czech Republic.
I once read somewhere that the Bohemian basin, surrounded by mountain
ranges, was of no military-strategic importance worth mentioning.
Unlike most of you, I am not a general, but only a private of
the reserve. Nevertheless, I will dare to say that looking back
at the history of my country, I find this statement very odd indeed.
Almost no major European war failed to leave a trace in the Czech
lands, and in fact many started or ended there. Bismarck himself
is even believed to have said that whoever controls Prague controls
Europe. It is not surprising at all that we have had such an eventful
history: situated in the very centre of Europe, our country has
- often to our detriment - always been a logical crossroads of
a variety of spiritual currents, power struggles and geopolitical
interests. The fact that a great part of our country is a basin
does not seem to have made any difference.<BR>
        Why am I bringing this up? Because I want to explain why
the Czechs are so sensitive about everything that concerns European
security, and why there is such a broad consensus among our population
with regard to the intention to join the Alliance. Our historical
experience with a network of bilateral treaties of alliance has
been bitter, and our national community remembers all too well
how in the past our fate was toyed with behind our backs.<BR>
        But all this has been just a remark on the margin. What
is much more important is the fact that our nation has for a thousand
years been an active part of the area now known as Western Europe
and has fully participated in shaping its values. You can find
in our country the same kind of cathedrals as in France, and town
centres similar to those in Germany; Charles University of Prague
was one of the focal points of European spiritual life in the
Middle Ages; the Reformation started in the Czech lands earlier
than in the big Western European countries; the first Czechoslovak
President was a European at heart whom all Europeans held in high
esteem. Thus, it is not just a desire to put our security on a
really firm footing that makes us wish to join NATO. Our motives
are deeper: we want to participate in the defence of the values
which we have for centuries helped to develop. We want to make
a real contribution to the defence effort, not just hope that
someone would come to our defence in the event of a threat. We
are simply acknowledging our share of responsibility for peace
in Europe and worldwide, no more and no less than that.<BR>
        I ask you to take these remarks - regardless of whether
you agree with what I have said here or not - as an expression
of this sense of responsibility.<BR>
        Thank you for your attention.
