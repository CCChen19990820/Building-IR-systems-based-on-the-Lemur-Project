<B><FONT SIZE=6>E</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>ducation vouchers were
the <I>enfant terrible</I> of recent school reforms. Yet the idea
seemed appealingly innocent: Instead of giving money to public
schools and thus requiring either mandatory attendance or additional
outlays for private schools, vouchers would directly aid families
so that they could enroll their children in schools of their own
choice. The idea of vouchers gained the attention of many reformers
in the 1960's because it promised to solve so many educational
problems. Christopher Jencks and other radical critics thought
vouchers would improve ghetto education by offering parents and
teachers alternatives to the failing public schools. The country's
impatient youth like the idea because it would enable more people
to afford their &quot;free&quot; schools. Some Catholics thought
vouchers might boost enrollments in parochial schools, which were
sagging under the pressure of rising costs and shifting values.
And Milton Friedman, searching everywhere for some vestige of
capitalism in mid-century America, discerned a market mechanism
in parent choice and promptly pronounced vouchers the only hope
for educational efficiency.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The idea was attractive partly because it seemed
to address such disparate hopes. But everyone agreed that vouchers
would promote &quot;competition,&quot; which would loosen up public
school systems grown rigid with age, size, and professional power.
The fear of losing students and revenues would move schools to
improve curricula and increase responsiveness.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One might think that a notion with such diverse appeal
would take the country by storm. Instead, it stirred up a hornets'
nest of opposition. Teacher organizations viewed competition among
schools as an invitation to union-busting - a fear that Professor
Friedman's endorsement did nothing to relieve. Administrators
were afraid of losing control over budgets and appointments. Civil
libertarians were apprehensive that the flow of public monies
to sectarian schools would represent a breach of the constitutional
separation between church and state - a concern that was not alleviated
by Catholic support for vouchers. Civil-rights advocates were
in favor of allowing urban blacks to choose their own schools,
but balked at the prospect of granting whites the same freedom
of choice - which, they held, would be a disaster for desegregation.
Finally, many thought that vouchers would eviscerate one of the
nation's few egalitarian institutions by paying for private education
at the taxpayers expense; public schools would then become the
alternative of last resort, reserved for those without the wit
to go elsewhere.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Whereas most federal education programs are launched
with Congressional hoopla and Presidential panagyrics, vouchers
were thus introduced in an angry political atmosphere. The idea
excited visions of change in the minds of both radical and conservative
theorists, but it produced only nightmares for the moderate masses
known despairingly as &quot;liberals&quot; six or eight years
ago. Given their fears, the wonder is that the idea of vouchers
was not stillborn.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It wasn't, partly because it was conceived in something
of a political vacuum. The idea had caught the fancy of the few
left-wing bureaucrats still remaining at the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO) while the Johnson Administration was coming
unstrung over Viet Nam. Partly as a result of their help, Jencks
and several of his Cambridge colleagues were awarded a grant to
study the feasibility of vouchers. The result was a thick report
that - like many studies - solemnly announced that the ideas of
its authors were indeed feasible. In fact, there was even a plan
describing how vouchers would work (<I>Education Vouchers: A Report
on Financing Elementary Education by Grants to Parents</I>, Center
for the Study of Public Policy, 1970), which was only dispatched
to Washington.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By that time the Nixon Administration had begun reshaping
OEO: Tired old liberal ideas and big give-away programs were out;
modest experiments were in. The new OEO staff knew the difference
between Milton Friendman and Christopher Jencks, but they read
the report, and after some exploration - and a bit of urging from
the authors and their friends in the Administration - decided
to give vouchers a try.<BR>
Support for vouchers by the Nixon OEO did not exactly assuage
the fears and suspicions of liberals, who responding with a barrage
of criticism delivered through the mails, the media, lobbyists,
and Members of Congress, and in some often nasty confrontations
often known as &quot;briefings.&quot; The new OEO staff were somewhat
taken aback by the ferocity of this response, but stuck to their
commitment to social-science experiments: All they sought, they
said, was a dispassionate test of the idea. They didn't favor
vouchers - just new alternatives. If vouchers were half as bad
as everyone said, then they would deservedly sink without a trace;
if not, then who knows - perhaps they merited consideration. A
curious collection of conservative theorists, radical reformers,
Republican politicians, and social experimenters thus managed
to persevere under the banner of science. In 1969 a federal effort
was launched to test education vouchers. It was a frail craft,
but it did float.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Eight years later, it still does. In the meantime
a good deal of evidence has been accumulated - some of it from
a single school district in Alum Rock, California, which has operated
a trial program for several years; some of it concerning the extensive
efforts to get other areas to try vouchers. One wonders what might
be learned from all this evidence. It would be a mistake to anticipate
a definitive verdict, for the experience has been limited. Anyway,
no decision could be conclusive about something as interesting
and problematic as education vouchers. But the experience so far
does illuminate several points of interest. Doest he diagnosis
of school problems still make sense now that the prescription
has been administered and the patient observed? And what has become
of the federal effort to improve education by experimenting with
political reforms? We will address these questions on the premise
that something may be learned - both about &quot;what is wrong
with schools&quot; and about federal efforts to &quot;set things
right.&quot;</FONT>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Education vouchers seemed an appealing way to correct
the balance of power in education, to reduce the sway of professionals
and increase the influence of parents. It was hoped that if parents
could exercise free choice, schools would compete by undertaking
new educational ventures, which would presumably succeed only
if they reflected the wishes of the parents. The mere existence
of competitors, it was reasoned, would weaken the monopoly in
education by encouraging schools to be responsive to the public.
<BR>
This idea made sense to both radical and conservative reformers
because it placed responsibility for school problems squarely
on the public education monopoly - a large, clumsy, and perverse
creature that had become by 1968 a popular political scapegoat.
Professionalized bureaucracies, it was held, had become calcified,
unresponsive, insensitive to cultural variations, and capable
only of do the same dreary things, year after year.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This was a trendy diagnosis of school problems, but
hardly a promising prognosis for a voucher test. After all, the
educational bureaucracy presumably was in charge everywhere, from
Albuquerque to Xenia. Why should the established authorities tolerate
an idea designed to diminish their power and make their lives
much more uncomfortably competitive? The federal sponsors of the
voucher test program never had a clear answer to this question,
but they began with efforts to organize local parents and citizens.
The notion was to pressure the local monopolists from below: It
was hoped that if enough grassroots support could be mustered,
school boards and professionals would have to cooperate with a
test.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But this approach didn't square with the reformers'
diagnosis of school problems; Local authorities could be expected
to resist such a challenge, and Nixon's OEO was in no position
to agitate against them. At that time, OEO was slathering itself
in social science; and besides, there was Daniel P. Moynihan,
then the President's counselor, who had just published a book
about how OEO had made social problems worse by stirring up local
communities. So organizing communities to force a voucher test
seemed uncomfortable in principle.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Worse yet, it did not work. The insurgent forces
were never powerful enough to produce a voucher experiment, and
as a result federal reformers began again at the top. Enlisting
administrators and board members seemed more appropriate, but
it did not help much either. Aside from the fact that educators
sympathetic to vouchers were hard to find, turning to them did
not solve the political problems, for in almost every case, local
administrators lacked the power to mount a test. After all, they
had boards, teachers, principals, and parents to worry about,
none of whom was ecstatic about vouchers. So the same difficulty
kept turning up in different forms. The federally organized local
forces were too weak to succeed without support from within the
school power structure, and administrators within the bureaucracy
were impotent because they lacked outside support. The ensuing
story illuminates a problem that has plagued so many federal agencies
and faddish foundations: how to produce political reforms in somebody
else's town with only bright ideas, some outside consultants,
and a little free cash.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The voucher plan drawn up by Jencks and his associates
at the Center for the Study of Public Policy (CSPP) was cautious
and carefully hedged. It favored individual choice, but in harmony
with several competing values. The plan sought to shield minority
and poor students from discrimination, to ensure maximum protection
for consumers against the claims or indifference of schools, and
to prevent public schools from becoming the alternative of last
resort. The resulting idea for a &quot;regulated compensatory
voucher&quot; was thus a complex and cumbersome creation - an
effort to promote freedom of choice, equality, and due process
all at once, while radically revising public schools.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The voucher plan was thus something of a Rube Goldberg
contraption. It supplied fiscal incentives for schools to enroll
poor children and to prevent economic discrimination. It provided
detailed admission policies permitting applicants their choice
of schools, schools their choice of applicants, and applicant
lotteries - all at once - to protect families' desires to select
schools, the schools' desires to select their students, and the
authors' desires to prevent discriminatory admissions. And the
scheme included an elaborate plan for an Educational Voucher Agency,
independent of the participating schools, to administer voucher
distribution and accounting, oversee school quality, and provide
consumers with information to make informed choices.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CSPP, then, did not propose a simple idea. Milton
Friedman had argued for simplicity, favoring a laissez-faire approach
on the view that regulation would interfere with operations. But
the authors of the CSPP plan demurred: They argued that vouchers
could take many forms, but nearly all would be an absolute &quot;disaster&quot;
for education. Besides, they were not convinced that operations
would ever get underway unless the plan included safeguards to
mollify angry opponents. Avoiding trouble, they said, would require
dispensing with the simplicities of Friedman's free market, and
faithfully following their plan. But as a result, the CSPP voucher
project embraced the worst of both worlds. On the one hand, although
the plan strained to protect equality and avoid discrimination,
these efforts neither appealed the liberals nor reduced their
opposition. On the other hand, making what had been a simple idea
infinitely complex impeded easy discussion, quick comprehension,
and local adaptation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>OEO hired CSPP to stimulate the local discussion
and adoption process, but there were two problems. First, the
CSPP staff was a rather implausible group for such work: Its members
were bright but few had been in a school since they were students
(several had been schooled at places such as Andover and Choate).
They were inclined to believe that the people who ran public schools
were either dim or nasty - or both. Second, although CSPP staffers
tended to be partisans of &quot;community organization,&quot;
they rather liked living in Cambridge. This posed a few difficulties
when it came to exciting the masses in Peoria.<BR>
The situation in Washington did not help. Vouchers were new and
controversial, and lacked a real constituency within government.
By contrast, the other big OEO experiment, the negative income
tax, had taken years to percolate through the higher civil service
in the 1960s; much of the bureaucracy remained intact and supportive
after the Republicans took over. In addition, there was Mr. Moynihan,
an articulate and powerful negative-income-tax advocate close
to a President who wanted to make something like the tax experiment
into law. Vouchers, however, had no such support. Moynihan more
or less liked the idea, and he liked the people in Cambridge who
liked it. But few others in Washington did, and many did not.
Vouchers were thus something of a political albatross for OEO.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a result of all these difficulties, voucher projects
did not take fire in local communities (1). The chief reason was
that no stable or cohesive source of support ever developed in
any of the cities. One possible source of support was the Catholics,
but they preferred other approaches to parochial-school aid. Worse
yet, most of the other local participants who favored vouchers
did not favor Catholics. The CSPP report was uneasy about the
Supreme Court decision permitting vouchers to church schools;
the CSPP organizing staff was reluctant to see its pet project
tainted by parochial affiliation. So even when Catholics were
supportive, they were encouraged to be discreet.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CSPP and OEO expected the poor and minorities to
be another natural interest group. Their children, after all,
were being so badly served by the schools; surely these parents
would welcome alternatives. But the poor were mostly unorganized;
any effort to turn them into an active interest group would have
required vastly more time, energy, and personnel than CSPP had.
Its part-time and episodic contact with local communities meant
that CSPP could deal only with organized groups, or coalitions
of such groups, or leaders who seemed likely to invent or recruit
groups for themselves.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Blacks were organized, but their ideas about school
reform had been shaped by decades of civil-rights struggle over
education. In seeking to desegregate schools they had learned
to distrust any scheme that either placed the burden on minority
choice or allowed whites not to choose minority schools. So when
a group of white academics proclaimed vouchers to be a new solution
to black school problems, established black organizations were
either hesitant or hostile. Local organizing on behalf of vouchers
quickly became entangled with local political conflicts over race
and education. In Seattle and Rochester, for example, integrationists
saw vouchers as a way out for whites; consequently they opposed
a test, which they regarded as either a racist trick or sabotage.
CSPP pleaded that its plan would protect integration, but local
civil-rights advocates - given their experience with &quot;freedom
of choice&quot; and their knowledge that vouchers were sponsored
by the same Nixon Administration that opposed busing and favored
neighborhood schools - were either hostile or skeptical. Worse
yet, although the pledges of CSPP failed to placate the integrationists,
they were sure to offend potential voucher supporters who opposed
integration. Either way, the organizers lost.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another reason for the lack of local enthusiasm was
the fragmentation of political power in the cities. The voucher-project
staff labored under a delusion widespread among recent school
reformers: that political power in urban education is centralized
and monolithic, and that organized grassroots power is needed
to overcome resistance. But although there was often little change
in city schools, this resulted more often from decentralized and
fragmented local power structures. The voucher field staff found
the power of urban superintendents seriously hampered by politically
divided boards, by the autonomy of principals and district administrators,
by the power of organized interests inside and outside the schools,
and by bureaucracies with powers and minds of their own. While
it was possible to keep school systems running through complicated
treaties among these groups, it was difficult to change the rules
in any important way without throwing the agreements into doubt
- and the parties in to a mild panic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Vouchers, of course, were not just any change: They
would have required the renegotiation of all treaties binding
a city school system together. The idea raised anxieties all around;
when vouchers appeared to cities like Seattle, San Francisco,
and Rochester, many principals were opposed , teacher organizations
were skeptical or hostile, most central administrators were dubious
or completely negative, and school boards were divided. The problem
was less monolithic resistance than decentralized uneasiness.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Working_from_within"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Working
from within</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since there was little indigenous support for education
vouchers, OEO and CSPP were gradually moved to try a different
tack - organizing a test by gaining the support of local boards
and superintendents. Several sites with interested administrators
or board members were duly found. These school districts were
much smaller and, for the most part, much more homogeneous than
the cities in which earlier work had been done.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But support from the top, even in such relatively
manageable places, was no more effective politically than pressure
from below had been elsewhere. Once again, a major problem was
the fragmentation of political power. The superintendent in East
Hartford, Connecticut, for example, was personally quite committed
to vouchers, but many teachers and principals were opposed. Given
the explosiveness of the voucher idea, the superintendent then
grew cautious. The chairman of the New Hampshire state board of
education , a devotee of Friedman's economics, was also a strong
supporter of vouchers. With a clear majority of the board, he
got a state planning grant for a &quot;free market&quot; voucher
test from an unwilling OEO (the Nixon White House helped), but
then had problems lining up local districts. Only after securing
extra federal money and promising local districts the chance either
to influence decisions or to bail out, did he manage to persuade
five districts in the southern part of the state to allow preliminary
planning. As time when ton, of course, even these districts became
aware of the practical implications of vouchers; finally, they
dug in their heels, and would not buy a test.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The other major reason that efforts to work down
from the top failed was that state and local leaders were committed
to vouchers because they liked the idea - not because there were
real local problems that vouchers might solve. It was easy to
favor competition and choice, and to oppose the bureaucracy, but
in practice choice and competition turned out to have hard and
nasty meanings: Parents could choose some local schools and not
others; some schools would be forced either to expand to meet
demand, or to turn away interested parents; other local schools
could shrink or close, costing the jobs of teachers and principals.
All this meant there would be some very angry teachers and principals
- and that meant trouble.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>None of these possibilities was entirely clear at
the outset. But as planning progressed, local administrators gradually
realized that they were being asked to sacrifice a fairly comfortable
situation in favor of a much more prickly and unsettled one. In
New Hampshire, the local administrators responded by trying to
remove the sting from vouchers by redefining the plan, removing
most of the choice and competition with engaging Yankee directness.
The superintendent in East Hartford also tried this, and avoided
decisions whenever possible. In both cases, local administrators
grew ever more unwilling to meet the bare minimums of a voucher
test: They became increasingly allergic to encouraging choice,
supporting new alternatives, allowing unchosen schools to fail,
or permitting a strong and independent voucher agency. Equivocation
and compromise took over. The more local leaders learned about
this dream of reform, the more nightmarish it seemed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a consequence, efforts to secure test sites were
often makeshift operations. Almost nothing ever happened on time;
almost nothing was done well. Indeed, it often seemed that almost
nothing would have happened at all had not CSPP and NIE kept up
a constant stream of bureaucratic and technical support. CSPP
wrote the local proposals to get the NIE money. In both new Hampshire
and East Hartford, CSPP helped to draw up schedules and then harassed
the locals into heeding them. CSPP designed training programs
for teachers, put together community information campaigns, wrote
letters for the administrators, and in many ways did the work
for the locals. Without such &quot;technical assistance&quot;
the local efforts would have fizzled out early on. As things turned
out, all that help only postponed the inevitable. By 1976 all
the potential test sites had failed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Working from within thus proved as unsuccessful as
groping at the grass roots. Insiders and intellectuals saw vouchers
as a solution to vague and abstract problems, such as monopoly
power in education - not as the solution to the day-to-day problems
of running a school system. But contrary to the received doctrine
of contemporary school reformers, local communities were not primarily
concerned with power, choice, and participation. As a result,
they did not work themselves into a sweat of enthusiasm for vouchers,
and there was thus no real pressure for change - even when the
opportunity fell into their laps.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But in Alum Rock, California, by contrast, administrators
at least fancied that there were real local problems that vouchers
would help to solve, which helped generate political and administrative
support for a test. The schools in Alum Rock were in poor financial
shape in 1971, and Superintendent William Jefferds thought they
had other shortcomings as well (3). They had long been run tightly
from the top; there had been little flexibility within the system
for some time; and the same old jobs were being done in the same
old way. Jefferds felt that the system was in danger of stagnating
and that education for the numerous black and Chicano students
needed to be improved.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The superintendent of this small district wanted
a voucher test because he wanted to decentralize the Alum Rock
schools and because he needed money. But if decentralizing the
schools struck top administrators as the right course, no one
knew how to pay for it. At the same time, OEO was fresh from several
stunning defeats in other cities, and feared that without a working
demonstration, the whole voucher project might soon sink. At first,
Alum Rock excited no one: It was a smallish district near San
Jose composed largely of minority and poor families, with little
promise of diversity in its schools or interest in its community.
But in the early discussions, Jefferds quickly learned that OEO
and CSPP needed him more than he needed them, and OEO and CSPP
found an avid enthusiast for parental involvement and innovation
at the school level.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ensuing negotiations were not easy. One reason
was that some Washington and Cambridge staffers still felt that
Alum Rock was a silly place to try anything. Another was that
Jefferds nearly lost to the local opponents of vouchers on one
occasion, and barely avoided defeat by postponing everything for
several months. A third reason was the failure of the California
legislature to pass quickly a bill permitting public monies to
flow to private schools, something everyone regarded as necessary
for a voucher demonstration.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The most important problem in negotiations, however,
involved differences between the priorities of OEO and Alum Rock.
OEO wanted a test of consumer sovereignty, while Alum Rock wanted
OEO support for its decentralization plan: OEO had the money,
and Alum Rock provided a potential test site. OEO didn't like
the idea of such an &quot;impure&quot; test, but OEO had to take
what it could get. Jefferd's superior bargaining position became
obvious when he got OEO to produce some money for his decentralization
program even before Alum Rock agreed to the voucher test. As is
so often the case with professional reforms, the only way to get
anything done is to let the locals do what they like - as long
as they say they are doing what the reformers like. The reformers
are really at the mercy of those they are reforming.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Cooking up the voucher test thus began with one small
and dusty California school district, poor and discontented. To
this were added two rather different recipes for political reform,
a dollop of federal dollars, and intermittent doses of outside
advice. With such ingredients and so many contending cooks, it
is no surprise that the result was eventually something of a stew.
But if Alum Rock did not test a single clear plan, its experience
does throw some light on how vouchers worked in practice - if
not how they might have worked in principle.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>What happens when Alum Rock tried to reform its schools?
Did more diverse educational offerings result? Did schools become
much more responsive to parents? Did the power of professionals
wane while that of parents waxed? Were families more satisfied?
Was schooling improved?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The central theme in our answer to these questions
is that the Alum Rock voucher test confounded almost all expectations
- from cautious hopes of Christopher Jencks to the dire warnings
of Albert Shanker. There was indeed more consumer choice, but
not consumer sovereignty. Parents had more freedom to choose among
more varied educational offerings, but as far as anyone can tell,
they gained little power. Not only did teachers and principals
inherit power from the central office as a result of decentralization,
but they also acquired influence from the greater flexibility,
uncertainty, and fiscal leeway that followed from parental choice.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="OLE_LINK3"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Limiting choice and
restricting competition</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One point of the reforms in Alum Rock was to offer
families more options for their children and to give professionals
more latitude in defining school programs. But these choices created
uncertainty, and unsettled parents and professionals. In a meeting
to discuss proposals called by the district in the spring of 1971,
parent representatives worried that children might not be able
to attend their neighborhood schools. They sought and obtained
a &quot;squatters' rights&quot; agreement whereby children already
enrolled could attend neighborhood schools if they liked. Parent
representatives also saw to it that every voucher school would
offer at least two alternative programs, to prevent children from
being forced out of a local school by distaste for the programs
offered. (OEO sought a compromise after the first year of the
demonstration, guaranteeing everyone his first-choice school for
the following September - if he signed up before May.) Thus rather
than seizing the initiative to expand choice or to enhance power,
parents tried to make sure that neighborhood attendance was secure
and that neighborhood schools would not be overly innovative.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>It was expected that once parents were given the
wherewithal to choose among schools, educators would vie to expand
their enrollments and incomes. School professionals, however,
were concerned with protecting their jobs. It was thus agreed
that teachers who left a voucher school for reasons associated
with the demonstration would be given priority in assignments
to other schools or that OEO would cover their salaries while
they were assigned to headquarters. No one was to be put on the
street by consumer preferences.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This eased things for teachers who did not succeed,
and at the outset no one worried about those who did. As it turned
out, however, even success was no bed of roses. Teachers in schools
that recruited more students were not rewarded with higher salaries:
Although their school would receive more in tuitions, the money
was to be spent for more teachers or materials. As a result, competitive
success only produced more of the problems teachers struggled
with every day: more children, more planning, more meetings, more
colleagues, more noise at recess, more disruptions at lunch-time,
and so on. Success brought more bother than benefit.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This nicely illuminates the great discrepancy between
the ways teachers and voucher advocates thought of school problems.
Teachers wanted better working conditions: room to breathe, to
prepare, to teach, perhaps even to invent. Voucher advocates wanted
better market conditions: to improve educational performance by
turning up the competitive heat. Although teachers were hungry
for more of the things professionals habitually crave - autonomy,
more resources, and less pressure - reformers thought they already
had a surfeit.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is hard to imagine more of a mismatch. Had anyone
noticed it, he might have suspected that competition would fail,
or would have crazy consequences. But the reformers scored low
on both sociology and school experience. The real surprise is
that they scored so high on economic mythology. It is quite a
testament to the continuing power of capitalism in American culture
that liberal reformers not only failed to notice the obvious in
education, but so thoroughly ignored the evidence concerning the
effects of economic competition that littered the social landscape.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In any event, Alum Rock professionals were under
no such illusions. Before the demonstration was half over they
changed the market aspects of the voucher scheme to suit their
purposes. The first step was to restrict demand by making it impossible
for schools to expand indefinitely to meet enrollment pressures.
After a year's trial with such expansion, teachers and administrators
insisted that each school be given enrollment limits. From that
point on, schools only needed to maintain enrollments at capacity
levels, which assured the usual income without producing more
than the usual strain. And since such limits meant that the less
appealing schools would get the overflow from the more appealing
schools, the chances for &quot;success&quot; - measured by enrollment
- increased vastly all around.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, the mere fact that public schools agreed
to ease competition among themselves did not mean that nonpublic
schools could not seek a share of the market. OEO had expected
nonpublic school participation, but as first the California legislature
would not permit it. OEO and Alum Rock therefore agreed to begin
the demonstration as a &quot;public-school-only&quot; effort.
Initial work focused on creating diversity within the public sector
by encouraging differentiation and competition among &quot;mini-schools&quot;
within existing buildings.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the fall of 1973, the legislature finally enabled
nonpublic schools to enter the demonstration. But partly because
of the efforts of such public-spirited groups as the California
Teachers Association, the legislation was quite restrictive. It
permitted public monies to flow only to schools under the &quot;exclusive
control&quot; of the local authorities, and it provided that the
local certified employee councils (the professionals' bargaining
agent) could formally review all policies in each voucher demonstration.
In addition, it required that all participating schools be subject
to district rules concerning teacher certification, curriculum
standards, and student discipline, as well as other general rules
and regulations.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since Alum Rock was a poor district, it had no established
private schools, an there were thus no disappointed private educational
entrepreneurs. But a few months before the enabling legislation
was passed, a group of four young teachers interested in &quot;free
schools&quot; set out to organize an alternative school within
the demonstration. The prospective school (called &quot;Gro-Kids&quot;)
got a small planning grant in the spring of 1973, and operated
an afterschool program the following fall.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The omens were not auspicious for Gro-Kids, however;
the district leadership was ambivalent, and the teachers' organization
was hostile. As a result, the certified employee council took
the view that private schools could enter only if they met most
of the operating standards of the public schools. This meant that
Gro-Kids would be obliged to hire certified teachers and provide
roughly the same staff/student ratios, salaries, and fringe benefits.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>These conditions meant that private voucher schools
in Alum Rock could differ from public voucher schools only in
the ways public schools differ from one another. This left room
for important differences, but they would be pedagogical and philosophical.
The voucher idea had once again been radically revised. Although
the organizers of Gro-Kids persisted and the school board voted
to admit the new school in the winter of 1974, momentum had been
lost. When parent choices for the following year were made, no
one selected Gro-Kids. It promptly vanished.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Alum Rock professionals thus sharply reduced the
scope of economic competition, making life hard for private schools,
eliminating school expansion, and protecting individual teachers
from competitive failure. The voucher plan was drastically modified
because schools are presently governed more by political than
market forces; in Alum Rock, economic competition had no effective
advocates. Such competition might have had a chance if it offered
something to at least some of the participants, but it didn't.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Protecting_roles_and_power"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Protecting
roles and power</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The failure to promote economic competition among
Alum Rock schools still left plenty of room for other kinds of
competition. But there was less than might have been expected,
largely because of the effects of the district decentralization
program. Some time before the voucher demonstration, decentralization
had begun in six schools whose principals had expressed a desire
for more authority. Superintendent Jefferds had procured OEO funds
to prepare six principals for more power through team-building
and sensitivity training. The principals went into the training
with a common interest in more authority, but they came out of
it with a strong sense of group identity and an even stronger
desire to get more power from the central office.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It was in precisely these six schools that the voucher
experiment began. Conflicts between the goals of vouchers and
decentralization - between parent power and principal power -
developed almost instantly. The principals were extremely sensitive
to anything that might tend to divide them, and competition among
schools was exactly such a policy. They could accept programmatic
differences, but they resisted such competitive devices as advertising,
comparative evaluations, and the like, which would draw attention
to the differences and encourage parents to act on them. Thus,
the commitment by the district to increase the power of the principals
through decentralization was in conflict with the commitment by
OEO to encourage parent power by extending choice.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Sequoia Institute was one focus of this conflict.
Sequoia was directed by a former CSPP staffer, and the rest of
its top staff were either Chicano or black. It was a bastard child
of the Education Voucher Agency proposed by CSPP, an independent
non-profit organization under contract to the school district,
which Jefferds and OEO agreed would help set voucher policy and
manage certain aspects of the demonstration. From Jefferds' point
of view, Sequoia would legally be part of the district and under
his control, even through it was an autonomous organization. But
OEO hoped it would be more independent, effectively acting as
an advocate for vouchers and parents: to provide parents with
counselling and information, to speak for parents at all levels
of the demonstration, to evaluate the performance of schools and
students and disseminate the information so that parents could
make informed choices, and to help monitor the project and insure
that vouchers were not abused or misused.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sequoia and the principals were incompatible from
the start. The principals began by opposing the mere existence
of the institute on the grounds that any addition to the bureaucracy
would erode decentralization. They also objected to its view of
parent advocacy and evaluation, and vigorously resisted publishing
comparative information that might encourage competition among
schools.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When Sequoia tried to press ahead with evaluations
in the first year, the principals blocked the effort. During the
second year, the Sequoia staff counterattacked and won permission
to proceed, but by then it was so late that the information could
only be used in the third year. And even then the principals made
sure that parents were only provided information on the mini-schools
attended by their own children. Information on other mini-schools
- necessary to make comparisons - would have to be requested by
each parent.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar struggle took place over the effort by
Sequoia to provide counselors to help parents make choices and
deal with school staff. The principals argued that if parents
wanted information or help they should come to the schools' professional
staff members, not some outside group. For the first year the
Sequoia counselors thus lived in limbo; then they were assigned
to individual schools as principals had demanded. Their advocacy
role was redefined by changing the job description, the place
of work, and the chain of command.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In fact, this was the pattern throughout the history
of Sequoia: New roles were redefined and transformed into old
ones. Sequoia's assistant director for evaluation became the district's
director of evaluation; Sequoia's director became a district administrator;
the parent counselors became school registrars (some said clerks);
and Sequoia became part of the district administration. In each
case, the role that had initially been conceived as a reform was
progressively redefined until it was hardly distinguishable from
long-established and accepted practice. Not surprisingly, Sequoia
did not work as OEO hoped. The reform that Alum Rock administrators
wanted proved more durable than the reform they were paid to adopt.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Parent_power"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Parent power</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar story can be told about parent power. Parent
advocacy groups were established for each mini-school and an overall
Education Voucher Advisory Committee (EVAC) was created at the
district level. These groups were purely advisory, having neither
resources nor any formal role in decision-making. By contrast,
EVAC had not only legitimacy but visibility, its own budget, defined
powers, and potential for affecting the conduct of the experiment.
Still, its parent members were neither aggressive nor particularly
effective. They took an active role only on matters that directly
and obviously affected them, such as neighborhood attendance,
and even then they were far from consistent. The parent members
generally tended to be absent, poorly informed, and deferential
to the professionals holding EVAC seats. Parents simply did not
take advantage of the opportunities for gaining power. Like the
district professionals, they accepted existing roles.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This might be explained by the fact that parents
were at a real disadvantage in EVAC; expecting them to act effectively
in such circumstances may be foolish. Evidence of how parents
used the voucher scheme to become more powerful might better be
found in areas more familiar to them - choosing schools, discovering
the available options, negotiating transfers, and the like. There
is, for example, the encouraging fact that all parents in the
voucher demonstration made choices. But the trouble is that the
project was organized to force choices upon everyone: Even parents
whose children remained in a neighborhood school had to choose
a mini-school within it.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Something can be learned, though, from the proportions
of parents who chose schools outside their neighborhoods. In the
first year, a negligible fraction did so, but this probably can
be ascribed to the late state of the demonstration. During the
second year, about 10 percent chose non-neighborhood schools,
and after that the proportion rose again to about 18 percent -
a distinct increase in parent initiative, but involving only a
modest number of parents.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The choices parents made within schools are also
quite illuminating. One might expect that high transfer rates
among mini-schools signaled parent initiative or discontent, or
both. The transfer rate within schools, for example, rose by about
11 percent between 1973 and 1974 - not astronomical, but clear
evidence that a modest proportion of parents did exercise choice.
Likewise, a fair proportion of parents chose innovative min-school
programs. At first, most chose traditional programs; among those
who selected the more modish programs, higher income families
were considerably over-represented. The proportion of children
in traditional programs did decrease by about 18 percent, however,
between 1972 and 1975.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar pattern characterized parents' knowledge
about schools. During the first year a modest fraction did not
even know which min-school their children were enrolled in, and
many more who did know nothing else about it. In the course of
the demonstration parents learned more about their children's
programs, but their knowledge about the system remained fairly
shallow. Most parents learned about schools from official communications,
a small fraction gained information on their own, and almost all
reported satisfaction with what they knew. With a few exceptions,
parents involved in the Alum Rock demonstration were content to
learn just as most parents do - by being told by professionals.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is reasonably typical of American education.
A small proportion of parents are active, but most are not. The
voucher demonstration appreciably increased parent choice among
educational alternatives, but most parents failed to become more
autonomous, powerful, or involved. The existing roles may not
have been entirely satisfactory, but they seem to have been sufficient
to forestall much of a search for alternatives.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Programs_and_pedagogy"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Programs
and pedagogy</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It would be a great mistake, however, to imagine
that nothing happened in the voucher schools. This would make
sense only if one believed that schools suffer the blahs because
they are not sufficiently accountable. The absence of increased
accountability did not imply stagnation; considerable change seemed
to take place in many Alum Rock voucher schools.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The most obvious change was more diversity. Where
before a uniform curriculum had lain over all the schools, there
were now Spanish-English bilingual programs, an arts-and-crafts
mini-school, several &quot;open classroom&quot; mini-schools,
and a number of innovative approaches to reading. Some of these
programs retained the regular grade-level organization of elementary
schools, but others were more flexible. While some schools made
few curriculum changes, others made modest revisions and still
others made more serious departures. Three years after the demonstration
began, voucher classrooms were certainly more different than they
initially had been.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Probably the most striking change in the voucher
schools was the increase in the independence of the teachers.
The curriculum had previously been set by the central-office staff,
but with vouchers decisions were primarily made by teachers, who
even had the resources (thanks to the extra funds provided by
compensatory vouchers) to support their choices. Administrators
were no longer quite as important; teachers had more freedom to
arrange their working conditions than before; more flexibility
in grouping students was possible; and teachers could create smaller
working groups for themselves. The program was thus easier to
revise and adapt as teachers went along.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Innovation at the school level was thereby supported
and encouraged by decentralization, the mini-schools, and the
compensatory-voucher monies -- not by competition. If one were
to speculate about innovation based on the Alum Rock experience,
one would have to say that social and economic encouragement were
more important than competition or political power.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But the voucher demonstration was not exactly easy
for Alum Rock professionals. For one thing, it was temporary.
Everyone knew things would revert to the old system in a few years,
which did nothing to ease the problems of change. For another,
the demonstration meant much more work: Administrative and fiscal
procedures were redesigned, new budgeting systems were created;
and mini-schools curriculums were established, placing greater
burdens on teachers and principals. Many teachers reported they
had never worked so hard and had not expected that the demonstration
would require so much effort. Especially in the early stages,
there was an avalanche of meetings, and many teachers felt overwhelmed
and exhausted.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus although the working conditions of the teachers
improved in some respects, in others they declined. There was
more work and more worry, but no less teaching, nor more hours
in the day. And while there was more money to spend on materials
and resources, teachers were not paid much more for their extra
duties. They received some compensation for in-service training,
but it amounted to a very modest annual salary increase over the
course of the demonstration. If this was an incentive, it certainly
was not awfully enticing. Indeed, the whole demonstration was
a terrible tease: It offered some opportunities and encouragements
to teachers, but made only marginal allowances for the personal
and professional sacrifices involved.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It was no surprise, then, that as the demonstration
progressed energy flagged. Teachers had less time for meetings,
less patience for the demands of innovation, less desire for the
rigors of collaboration, and more appreciation of the lives they
could once again lead separately and individually behind classroom
doors. Because the voucher demonstration offered some encouragements
for innovation, and because many professionals desired change,
things began with energy, hasty improvisation, and excitement.
But because the scheme had not been designed with much appreciation
of the classroom experience of teachers - because it assumed that
teachers should be reshaped by a stiff dose of competition - there
were only partial and sometimes accidental incentives for professionals.
As the demonstration moves toward a close, many innovations have
begun to slip away.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Confusing_symptoms_with_causes"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Confusing
symptoms with causes</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One lesson of the voucher saga seems to be that if
parent choice and educational alternatives make sense for public
schools, it is not for the reasons contemplated by the reformers.
The assumption underlying the original scheme was that schools
were bad because parents were powerless, and that parents were
powerless because they had been excluded by professionals anxious
to protect themselves from popular control. If parents had more
power - which in this case was to be granted by control of school
funding - it was expected that the professionals would then be
accountable and that schools would thereby be better places for
children. But when some barriers to parental involvement were
removed, power distribution did not change appreciably.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One explanation for this may be that the existing
power imbalance between parents and professionals is great enough
to require even more support for parents before they can participate
effectively. If this is correct, it raises questions about participatory
reforms that assume that parents have been excluded and that given
the opportunity to use power, they will. When they failed to,
as in the case of EVAC, some observers argued that even more training,
support, and professional advocacy were needed. But this argument
redefines citizen participation: It no longer involves releasing
the political energies of excluded citizens by providing greater
access to power; it now consists of paying professionals to train,
speak for, and support citizens. This view seems both plausible
and puzzling. One is not sure whether to agree because implementation
was only partial, to wonder why a larger dose would do more when
a partial dose failed to help much at all, or to marvel at the
need for even more professional help in the effort to overcome
professional power.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The chief defect of this analysis is a confusion
of symptoms and causes. There are real political imbalances in
the governance of American schools, which contribute to the poor
performance of political reforms to increase participation. But
the real imbalance is not political in origin. It results from
a social division of labor that encourages the specialization
of work, the professionalization of roles, and the partitioning
of authority. In advanced industrial societies this solidifies
professional power in education, as well as discouraging active
parental involvement. Parents used to have more to do with education
simply because there often was not much formal schooling available.
It was not uncommon in the 18<SUP>th</SUP> and 19<SUP>th</SUP>
centuries for children to get much of their education from a parent
- or from a job, in church, in an apprenticeship, or in other
informal settings.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With the rise of schooling, education increasingly
became the province of trained specialists. Professionals gain
economic returns, social satisfaction, personal status, individual
identity, and group power from their roles. And parents, most
of whom have occupations providing similar rewards, have seen
their educational role narrowed and redefined. It still involves
early childhood education and help with homework in the elementary
grades, but increasingly centers on insuring that children receive
the right professional attention.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The growth of this division of labor had political
consequences. In the early and middle 19<SUP>th</SUP> century,
when public schools began, teachers had little status and less
power: They were at the mercies of their communities. But the
growth of a complex industrial division of labor weakened the
bonds connecting work, family, school, and community, and eroded
the forces that kept teachers in a subordinate and dependent position.
Gradually, teaching -- like many other occupations - has gained
social definition, autonomy, and political power; community power
over schools has correspondingly attenuated.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the imbalance in school power does not have
political roots, political remedies, may be marginal. Vouchers
turned out so peculiarly in Alum Rock because the scheme fundamentally
misconstrued the reason that power is so lopsidedly distributed
in public education. As one might expect from such a misdiagnosis,
the effects of the reform were perverse: Professionals gained
power from an experiment in which they were supposed to lose it.
Vouchers opened the door for power shifts, but they did not affect
the ways in which work, authority, and child-rearing are apportioned
in society. Because social realities were undisturbed by merely
loosening up the political structure, the changes only enhanced
the power of those who had it already.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Given this analysis, it is not surprising that all
these changes occurred with little political conflict between
parents and professionals. Predictably, most of the conflict was
between professionals who advocated greater parent power and professionals
who did not. That, after all, is what one would expect in an &quot;expert
society.&quot; The struggles were enough to make for several lively
years in this small California city, but not enough to work basic
changes in the distribution of political power.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="More_than_meets_the_eye"><B><FONT SIZE=2>More
than meets the eye</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At the same time, Alum Rock parents were more satisfied
with their schools. This would seem perverse if one subscribed
to the theory of parent power associated with vouchers: Why should
parents' satisfaction increase if their power didn't? The answer,
we think, is that vouchers in Alum Rock did offer benefits many
parents desired, benefits that are consistent with the existing
social division of labor. One of these was a somewhat greater
range of educational alternatives. Some parents have strong views
on the relative importance of language and culture, or on the
balance among discipline, fundamentals, and individual discovery,
or on the comparative significance of algebra and art. Although
the mini-schools seemed to vary little in basic instruction patterns
- most teachers spent about the same proportion of their time
on reading and math - they did seem to offer diverse programs,
thus more nearly corresponding with varieties of educational opinion.
It Is hardly surprising that parents with views hitherto unrepresented
in the curriculum appreciated the new alternatives. Their appreciation
may have followed from the substance of the new programs - or
simply from being offered a choice. But whatever the reason, the
opportunity to choose seems to have been welcomed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another benefit of the Alum Rock demonstration was
that these alternatives were offered by professionals. Parents
had the freedom to choose from a fairly conventional range of
educational possibilities, but teachers defined, devised, and
implemented them. The demonstration also tended to make professionals
more visible and accessible to the parents. Most important, it
did all this within the limits of established roles.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This helps to explain why parents in Alum Rock were
more satisfied without being more powerful: They had more alternatives
and more freedom to choose, but these were provided by professionals
in authoritative and familiar ways - without much work for parents.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This points to a second lesson of the demonstration:
It was hard to mount a voucher test because almost everyone ignored
the considerable possibilities it offered teachers. Instead, vouchers
were advertised as a sort of radical social surgery to improve
things for students and parents at the expense of the professionals.
This approach to change was certain to flop unless a substantial
proportion of teachers found vouchers attractive. But the project
was promoted in such a way as to suggest that vouchers would punish
professionals into better performance. So it is not surprising
that OEO found few volunteers for a demonstration, or that professionals
in Alum Rock responded with such caution. One political consequence
of the social division of labor in advanced industrial societies
is that the reform of social services is unlikely to succeed unless
many professionals find it attractive. Because vouchers presented
a rather threatening prospect, they had few takers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The third lesson of the Alum Rock venture is that,
ironically, there is more in the idea of choice for parents and
professionals than the advertising suggested. Many teachers are
strongly attracted by the prospect of choosing the sort of classroom
they would work in, of shaping the curriculum they would use,
and of working with students who find their style attractive.
There is some evidence that when teachers exercise such choices
- when they are able to create alternatives within the public
schools - both parents and professionals are pleased with the
results. Such efforts are underway in some cities (among them,
Minneapolis and Cincinnati) and the reports seem encouraging.
These professionally defined alternatives embody most of the main
currents of thought about schooling and offer many of the specializations
families desire - science, the arts, culture and language, and
so on. If the voucher reform had been conceived and promoted differently,
it might have met with somewhat greater enthusiasm among professionals.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Evaluating_the_scheme"><B><FONT SIZE=2>Evaluating
the scheme</FONT></B></A></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This hardly exhausts the lessons of the voucher story,
nor does it finish the tale itself. One fascinating item concerns
the effort to evaluate vouchers effectively. A major justification
for the federal program in the first place was the search for
scientific results to support policy decisions about whether vouchers
should be expanded or discarded. Large sums of money were spent
in search of the answer, but the evaluation itself seems to have
played no role in decisions about the future of vouchers. Experience
provided more decisive and timely evidence. But the final evaluation
does offer rich testimony concerning the difficulties involved
in such scientific endeavors, and it might reveal something about
their potential usefulness.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly, there is still a question about the impact
of the voucher program beyond Alum Rock. OEO and NIE tried to
organize demonstrations in school districts all over the country;
although all but one of these failed, promoting vouchers may have
stimulated attempts to promote diversity within the public schools,
to show that alternatives were possible without resorting to nonpublic
education. And all the publicity from Washington during the last
five or six years may well have helped to legitimize diversity
and choice, and create a climate of opinion in which they are
more possible. It would be ironic if the primary impact of federal
efforts to promote vouchers was indirect, but it would not be
the first time in the history of social reform that unintended
results were so significant.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Nor has this article fully probed some of the more
programmatic issues raised by the voucher saga - for example,
the federal role in school reform. There is certainly a need for
reflection concerning how federal agencies might deal with reforms
like vouchers that have ore appeal than support. And what of the
broader implications for participatory reforms? If, as we have
argued, the sorts of participation most parents desire are different
than those advocated by reformers, one wonders whether there are
better ways to redress the imbalance of political power in education.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>These and other questions are important, but must
wait for a more detailed treatment of this fascinating episode
in school reform. For now, it is enough to note that this scheme
to promote parent power produced mixed results, and that several
views are plausible. As an effort to reform the nation's schools,
the voucher demonstration left much to be desired; it was an administrator's
innovation, not a popular movement. Its only resources were its
appeal and the ingenuity and money its advocates could produce.
These were enough to keep the advocates busy, but not enough to
foment a social experiment. Vouchers were intended to overturn
the political power structure in local schools and put parents
in the driver's seat, but the absence of popular support meant
that there was really hope for success only when the opposition
- the education establishment - also liked the idea. There was
only one actual test, and even there local forces tended to overwhelm
federal priorities. The moral, we suppose, is that bright ideas,
advice, and federal funds are no substitute for political power.
Reforms spun from such political gossamer have similarly fragile
prospects.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But vouchers can also be viewed as an attempt to
change the balance of power within schools, and in this regard
we think they produced both more and less than expected. As nearly
as can be discerned, parents in Alum Rock have little more power
now than before the test. The promise of parent choice and power
rather unsettled teachers and principals, who promptly took steps
to protect their interests. The ensuing story was enough to bring
tears of joy to the eyes of the most hardened political observers:
Professionals in Alum Rock emerged with undiminished and probably
increased power - all this resulting form innovation designed
to boost the political fortunes of parents at the expense of professionals.
The voucher idea was simply based on a serious overestimate of
popular discontent and the demand for change in education. The
moral is that reforms designed to &quot;loosen up&quot; school
systems often succeed - but with perverse political effects. This
is partly because the intended victims of reforms begin with much
more organization and power than the intended beneficiaries; few
of the beneficiaries have the time, energy or resources to seize
the opportunities presented by the reformers. The victims naturally
use their superior power and organization not just to neutralize
change but also to turn it to their own advantage. Similarly,
the efforts of the Ford Foundation to loosen up the schools in
New York through community control enhanced the political fortunes
of the United Federation of Teachers. It often helps to loosen
things up, but in the ensuing looseness, those with power get
more.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From the perspective of promoting diversity, the
story is less gloomy: The voucher demonstration in Alum Rock increased
professionals' ability to choose and design their work settings,
and made it possible for parents to select among alternatives.
If choice and diversity are good, then schools in Alum Rock were
better places.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, the Alum Rock demonstration has provided
an opportunity to learn a good deal about the possibilities for
alternative programs, as well as helpful evidence concerning the
likely roles of parents and professionals. Some of these lessons
may be indirect and perverse, but they are instructive nonetheless.
The experience with vouchers points to some ways in which diversity
in education can be further explored and encouraged, even though
it suggests other ways that seem barren. If the voucher plan is
narrowly assessed in terms of its assumptions about political
participation and school reform, it must be judged something less
than a resounding success. But viewed as an exploration of educational
alternatives, it may prove a source of suggestive ideas and lessons.</FONT>

<TITLE>Why the Catholic School Model is Taboo, by Sol Stern, WSJ, July 17, 1996</TITLE>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Why the Catholic School Model Is Taboo</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>By Sol Stern, reprinted from the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>,
July 17, 1996</CENTER>
<P>
New York City's Cardinal John J. O'Connor has repeatedly made
the city an extraordinary offer: Send me the lowest-performing
5% of children presently in the public schools, and I will put
them in Catholic schools - where they will succeed. The city's
response: silence.
<P>
In a more rational world, city officials would have jumped at
the cardinal's invitation. It would have been a huge financial
plus for the city. The annual per-pupil cost of Catholic elementary
schools is $2,500 per year, about a third of what taxpayers now
spend for the city's public schools.
<P>
<B>No Idle Boast</B>
<P>
More important, thousands more disadvantaged children would finish
school and become productive citizens. For Cardinal O'Connor's
claim that Catholic schools would do a better job than public
schools is no idle boast. In 1990 the RAND Corporation compared
the performance of children from New York City's public and Catholic
high schools. Only 25% of the public-school students graduated
at all, and only 16% took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, vs. 95%
and 75% of the Catholic-school students, respectively. Catholic-school
students scored an average of 815 on the SAT. By shameful contrast,
the small &quot;elite&quot; of public-school students who graduated
and took the SAT averaged only 642 for those in neighborhood schools
and 715 for those in magnet schools.
<P>
In 1993 the New York State Department of Education compared city
schools with the highest levels of minority enrollment. Conclusion:
&quot;Catholic schools with 81% to 100% minority composition outscored
New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority
enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17%), Grade 3 mathematics (+10%),
Grade 5 writing (+6%), Grade 6 reading (+10%), and Grade 6 mathematics
(+11%).&quot;
<P>
Yet most of the elite, in New York and elsewhere, is resolutely
uninterested in the Catholic schools' success. In part this reflects
the enormous power of teacher unions, fierce opponents of anything
that threatens their monopoly in education. In part it reflects
a secular discomfort with religious institutions.
<P>
I myself have felt this discomfort over the years, walking past
Catholic schools like St. Gregory the Great, near my Manhattan
home. Every morning, as I took my sons to public school, I couldn't
help noticing the well-behaved black and Hispanic children in
their neat uniforms entering the drab parish building. But my
curiosity never led me past the imposing crucifix looking down
from the roof, which evoked childhood images of Catholic anti-Semitism
and clerical obscurantism.
<P>
Finally, earlier this year, I ventured in, and I was impressed.
I sat in, for example, as fourth-grade teacher Susan Viti conducted
a review lesson on the geography of the Western United States.
All the children were completely engaged and had obviously done
their homework. They were able to answer each of her questions
about the principal cities and capitals of the Western states
- some of which I couldn't name - and the topography and natural
resources of the region. &quot;Which minerals would be found in
the Rocky Mountains?&quot; Miss Viti asked. Eager hands shot up.
Miss Viti used the lesson to expand the students' vocabulary;
when the children wrote things down, she insisted on proper grammar
and spelling.
<P>
I found myself wishing that my own son's fourth-grade teachers
at nearby Public School 87, reputedly one of the best public schools
in the city, were anywhere near as productive and as focused on
basic skills as Miss Viti. Both my boys' teachers have wasted
an enormous amount of time with empty verbiage about the evils
of racism and sexism. By contrast, in Miss Viti's class and in
all the other Catholic-school classes I visited, it was taken
for granted that real education is the best antidote to prejudice.
<P>
Miss Viti earns $21,000 a year, $8,000 less than a first-year
public-school teacher. &quot;I've taught in an all-white, affluent
suburban school, where I made over $40,000,&quot; she says. &quot;This
time I wanted to do something good for society, and I am lucky
enough to be able to afford to do it. I am trying to instill in
my students that whatever their life situation is now, they can
succeed if they work hard and study.&quot;
<P>
You might expect liberals, self-styled champions of disadvantaged
children, to applaud the commitment and sacrifice of educators
like Susan Viti. You might even expect them to look for ways of
getting government money to these underfunded schools. Instead,
they've done their best to make sure that wall of separation between
church and state remains impenetrable. Liberal child-advocacy
groups tout an endless array of &quot;prevention&quot; programs
that are supposed to stave off delinquency, dropping out of school
and teen pregnancy - yet they consistently ignore Catholic schools,
which nearly always succeed in preventing these pathologies.
<P>
Read the chapter on education in Hillary Clinton's &quot;It Takes
a Village.&quot; Mrs. Clinton advocates and alphabet soup of education
programs for poor kids, but says not a word about Catholic schools.
Similarly, in his books on education and inner-city ghettos, Jonathan
Kozol offers vivid tours of decrepit public schools in places
like South Bronx, but he never stops at the many Catholic schools
that are succeeding a few blocks away.
<P>
Why are Catholic schools taboo among those who talk loudest about
compassion for the downtrodden? It's hard to escape the conclusion
that one of the most powerful reasons is the liberals' alliance
with the teachers' unions, which have poured hundreds of millions
of dollars into the campaign coffers of liberal candidates around
the country. Two weeks ago I attended the National Education Association
convention in Washington, a week-long pep rally for Bill Clinton
punctuated by ritual denunciations of privatization.
<P>
Before the teachers' unions rise to political power, it was not
unusual to see urban-Democrats like former new York Gov. Mario
Cuomo support government aid to Catholic schools. Mr. Cuomo's
flip-flop on this issue is especially revealing. In 1974, when
he first ran for public office, Mr. Cuomo wrote a letter to potential
supports: &quot;I've spent more than 15 years&#133; arguing for
aid to private schools,&quot; he wrote. &quot;If you believe aid
is a good thing, then you are the good people. If you believe
it, then it's your moral obligation, as it is my own, to do something
about it&#133; Let's try tax credit plans and anything else that
offers any help.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Cuomo soon learned his lesson. In his published diaries he
wrote: &quot;Teachers are perhaps the most effective of all the
state's unions. If they go all-out, it will mean telephones and
vigorous state-wide support. It will also mean some money.&quot;
In his 1982 campaign for governor, Mr. Cuomo gave a speech trumpeting
the primacy of public education and the rights of teachers. He
won the union's enthusiastic endorsement against Ed Koch in the
Democratic primary. Over the next 12 years in private meetings
with Catholic leaders, Gov. Cuomo would declare that he still
supported tax relief for parochial school parents. Then he would
take a completely different position in public. For example, in
1984 he acknowledged that giving tax-credits for parochial-school
tuition was &quot;clearly constitutional&quot; under a recent
Supreme Court decision - but he refused to support such a plan.
<P>
Politically controlled schools are unlikely to improve much without
strong pressure from outside. Thus, the case for government aid
to catholic schools is now more compelling than ever, if only
to provide the competitive pressure to force state schools to
change. And the conventional wisdom that government is constitutionally
prohibited from aiding Catholic schools has been undermined by
several recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions.
<P>
<B>Sucker's Trap</B>
<P>
Since the powerful teachers' unions vehemently oppose any form
of government aid to Catholic schools, reformers are often skittish
about advocating vouchers or tuition tax credits, fearing that
they will end the public-school reform conversation before it
begins. But to abandon aid to Catholic schools in the name of
public-school reform is a sucker's trap. We have ended up with
no aid to Catholic schools and no real public-school reform either.
<P>
Catholic schools are a valuable public resource not just because
they profoundly benefit the children who enroll in them. They
also challenge the public-school monopoly, constantly reminding
us that the neediest kids are educable and that spending extravagant
sums of money isn't the answer. No one who cares about reviving
our failing public schools can afford to ignore this inspiring
laboratory of reform.

<img src="armstr.gif" align=left alt="Armstrong Williams"><B>Armstrong Williams</B>: Good morning and welcome.  We have gathered here this morning
as the National Education Association convenes in this city for
its 1996 Convention in order to illustrate not just locally, but
nationally, the complete and utter hypocrisy that the NEA represents.
 In fact, many have labeled the NEA, the National Extortionist
Association.  In fact, you will be hearing from a number of individuals
who represent not only the field of education, but administrators
and parents as well.  Each one of them will describe, in no uncertain
terms, how an organization, whose initial purpose was to work
toward improving public education in America but in reality has
only served its only self-serving, plundering interests, destroying
our public schools and leaving them in a tragic state of ruin.
 <BR>

<P>
You know, in all fairness, when I was asked to make a few remarks
to kick off this press conference, I remember thinking to myself,
in the name of fairness and objectivity, &quot;How can I introduce
an aspect of impartiality into the subject of the National Education
Association.&quot;  &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I thought, &quot;I would
tell the American people how successfully the NEA works with low-income
families to help better educate their children to ensure them
the best possible start in life.&quot;  But of course, that would
not be true, since the NEA has recently helped strike down measures
such as school voucher programs that would allow less fortunate
children to attend private schools, vaguely claiming that the
programs violate the Constitution.  Well, then I said &quot;Well&#133;
think some more, there's <I>got</I> to be something there.&quot;
 I thought, &quot;Surely, I can mention how the NEA cooperates
with parents to develop the best possible curriculum, for intellectually
stimulating our children.&quot;  But once again, I had to come
to the realization that this too, is not true. For in all honesty,
the NEA has time and time again, illustrated its reluctance to
cooperate with parents, allowing them little say and involvement
in educating their children.<BR>

<P>
Suddenly, I really had to face the hard core facts, that no matter
how hard I tried to find some positive aspect in regards to the
NEA, it just could not be done.  However, what I did find, was
this organization has cleverly pulled the wool over the eyes of
America, causing us to turn a blind eye towards an organization
that thinks that it, and it alone, knows what is best when it
comes for the education of your children.  <BR>

<P>
What is even more interesting is that the two corners of the blanket
are being securely gripped by the two occupants of the White House.
 And I don't say that lightly.  What else is new?  After all,
their daughter does not attend public school.<BR>

<P>
What this press conference truly is, is a call to arms.  A call
to parents across this country, to stand together in order to
put an end to the self-serving interest of the NEA, and to bring
education and school choice back where it belongs: with the parents.
 Let's stop being walked on, and let's start doing the walking.
<BR>

<P>
It is my pleasure (applause).  And by the way, those of you who
don't know, I am Armstrong Williams, syndicated talk-show host
and columnist, but just an ordinary American who is concerned
about where education is headed in this country.  It's because
I love our children and the future that they could have in this
country, that I stand here today, with the forces that are here,
to see if we cannot change the educational system in this country
and change the NEA, once and for all.<BR>

<P>
Now, here's the format for this morning.  We have assembled some
very distinguished speakers.  I will introduce each speaker, and
the speakers have prepared remarks.  For those of you who are
members of the media, you can read their remarks in their entirety
out on the table.  We will ask that each speaker take 2-3 minutes
of opening remarks and then participate in an exchange with the
media.<BR>
<P>
Our first speaker, is Charlene Haar.  Ms. Haar is the co-author
of the 1994 book, <I>The NEA and the AFT: Teacher Unions in Power
and Politics</I>, with Dr. Myron Lieberman and Leo Troy.  A winner
of the distinguished South Dakota Teacher of the Year (<I>corrected</I>)
award, she currently serves as the President of the non-profit,
Education Policy Institute. Ms. Haar has written several articles
on the teacher unions and the national PTA.  Her book on the National
PTA will be published next year.  It is my distinct pleasure to
welcome you to this very important forum and I extend to you Ms.
Charlene Haar.  It's yours&#133; (applause)<BR>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P>
<img src="haar2.gif" align=right alt="Charlene Haar"><B>Charlene Haar:</B>Thank you Armstrong.  Good morning.<BR>

<P>
Our meeting this morning is on the 2nd day of the 75th annual
convention of the NEA.  Amid all the praises, talk and press releases,
the public, the media and yes, even the delegates are likely to
miss the tremendous gap between NEA rhetoric and the reality of
what the NEA and its state and local affiliates are doing.  The
most urgent need at this convention is for <I>scrutiny</I> of
this huge teacher union conglomerate.  <BR>

<P>
Before you hear from several experts, who are especially knowledgeable
about various aspects of the National Education Association, 
I want to make three points.<BR>

<P>
First, the NEA is a huge <U>political</U> machine - far larger
and more powerful than most people know.
<P>
Second, The NEA uses deceptive tactics to make policy-makers and
members of the public accept their agenda.
<P>
Third, Despite their rhetoric about &quot;restructuring,&quot;
the NEA routinely blocks and sabotages efforts for meaningful
reform in education.<BR>

<P>
NEA has written the book - excuse me books on political action
(<I>shows NEA political manuals</I>).  Thousands of NEA-paid,
full-time political organizers are at work in every Congressional
District in America.  School boards, judges, county officials,
state legislators and of course federal candidates are elected
with the help of the National Education Association and its affiliates.
 The NEA employs more full time political operatives than our
two major political parties combined.<BR>
<img src="haar.gif" align=left>
<P>
At the local, state and national level, NEA revenues are about
$1 billion every year and it spends most of that money on political
programs, political consulting, communications with political
messages, and various campaign activities.<BR>

<P>
NEA-PAC is nearly a $6 million operation; in addition, a network
of NEA state and local affiliate political action committees (PACs),
pour millions into races at every level of our government; after
all buying allegiances pays off.<BR>

<P>
Second:  NEA is deceitful even to its own members.  Catchy advertising
and warm fuzzy pictures are paid-for-images which create another
myth, that unions care about kids.  Unions don't care for children!
 If you doubt this, look at the new business items - review the
candidate questionnaires.  They are all about MONEY - how to get
more.<BR>

<P>
And third:  What hypocrites the NEA are!   It publishes two manuals
on how to sabotage school board efforts to contract out services.
 Meanwhile, the NEA itself contracts out services - about 17%.
 The NEA's assertion that &quot;efficiency,&quot; &quot;competition,&quot;
 &quot;productivity,&quot; and &quot;accountability,&quot; would
hurt children is false; their concern is to protect the union
bureaucracy.<BR>

<P>
And here's a stack of teacher union/school district contracts
- noticeably absent are provisions for improving education for
our children.<BR>

<P>
NEA is now in the process of deunionizing its own terminology
while tightening its grip on American education.  New NEA convention
materials emphasize partnerships - expect your pockets to be picked
in any partnership with the NEA. <BR>

<P>
 By successfully defining the education reform debate in &quot;care-more
pay-more&quot; terms instead of outcomes and accountability, the
NEA is trying to convince politicians and the public, that more
money must be spent for education.  In fact, thousands of NEA
officers and staff are paid over $100,000 a year in salary and
benefits.  <U>They</U> are the beneficiaries of NEA programs;
the children of the United States are the losers. (applause)<BR>

<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P><B>Armstrong Williams:</B> Our next speaker is John Berthoud.  John Berthoud is Vice President
of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in Alexandria Virginia.
 Mr. Berthoud is also an adjunct lecturer at George Washington
University here in the nation's capitol where he teaches graduate
level courses on budgetary politics.  His works and writings have
appeared in publications such as the <I>Wall Street Journal, The
Washington Post, Investor's Business Daily, The Washington Times,
Public Interest, and Human Events</I>.  I very balanced gentleman,
I would say.  Mr. Berthoud holds a Ph.D. from Yale University,
an MA in International Affairs from Columbia, and a BA from Georgetown.
 Let us welcome our next speaker, John Berthoud. (applause)<BR>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P>
<img src="berth2.gif" align=right alt="John Berthoud"><B>John Berthoud:</B> Thank you very much, Armstrong.  Good morning.  <BR>

<P>
One would be hard-pressed to find a legislative and political
agenda more damaging to the interests of America's children than
that of the National Education Association.  This is the clear
conclusion of three Tocqueville Institution studies of the NEA.
<BR>

<P>
We have conducted a detailed fiscal review of the NEA's <I>Legislative
Program for the 104<SUP>th</SUP> Congress</I> and this morning,
I'd like to outline the <I>Legislative Program's</I> impact on
1) deficits and 2) entitlements - two obvious areas of concern
for children.  We have also done two fiscal profiles of the Members
of Congress that NEA-PAC is supporting and opposing and I'll provide
a summary of these findings.<BR>

<P>
In our analysis of the <I>NEA Legislative Program</I>, we matched
the proposals in their wish list to CBO cost estimates of corresponding
bills and came to several stunning conclusions.  Most significantly,
we found that if every item was enacted, federal spending would
increase by at least $702 billion per year.<BR>

<P>
I should stress that we believe this figure is a conservative
estimate.<BR>

<P>
If not funded by deficits, the NEA agenda would translate into
an annual tax increase of $10,554 on a family of four.  The tax
increase would be 13 times the size of that in the 1993 budget
package.<BR>

<P>
While the NEA claims they'd like to lower the federal deficit,
given the magnitude of the funds required, we believe that the
much more likely result of adoption of the NEA Agenda would be
a) a large tax increase <I>and</I> b) a substantial increase in
the federal deficit.<BR>

<P>
The NEA of course tries to claim that it is more than a mere union
- they argue that much of its agenda is driven by the best interests
of children.  This contention however, is completely contradicted
by analyzing their entitlements agenda.  On issues like Social
Security and Medicare, their <I>Legislative Program</I> again
is diametrically opposed to the interests of America's kids. 
Let me give you several examples:<BR>

<P>
All told, the NEA would expand Social Security benefits for today's
retirees by $126.8 billion per year.<BR>

<P>
For each dollar in new spending on children and education that
the NEA proposes (over $24 billion annually), it advocates $5.24
in new spending on Social Security.<BR>

<P>
While the debate in Washington is (correctly, I'd argue) about
how much and how fast to raise the Social Security retirement
age, NEA is advocating lowering the retirement age.<BR>

<P>
For Medicare, they oppose many common-sense reforms such as means-testing.
<BR>

<P>
In sum, our major entitlement programs face grave fiscal imbalances
in the coming years which will require big sacrifices by today's
children and the NEA not only is doing nothing to correct these
problems but is seriously adding to them.<BR>

<P>
The NEA backs up their advocacy of big government with their campaign
contributions.  The Tocqueville Institution has done two analyses
on this issue - one which we just released last week.<BR>

<P>
In our new study, we have looked at NEA-PAC contributions to 1996
House and Senate candidates.  From January 1995 through the end
of April 1996, the NEA's Political Action Committee has contributed
$643,030 to Congressional candidates.<BR>

<P>
Analyzing the Members running in 1996 who have served in the 104<SUP>th</SUP>
Congress, it is clear that the NEA is financing candidates who
have voted to expand government, while opposing those who have
voted to cut it.  NEA-backed Senate and the House candidates on
average voted during the first session of the 104<SUP>th</SUP>
Congress to increase annual federal spending by $30.4 billion
and $28.9 billion respectively.  The Senate and House candidates
that the NEA is opposing voted to cut government by $31.8 billion
and $32.4 billion respectively.<BR>

<P>
Clearly, despite the NEA's rhetoric that their fiscal agenda is
just to stop draconian cuts in government, in reality the net
cuts made by the Members they are working to defeat have been
modest - about 2 percent of total federal spending.<BR>

<P>
While NEA-backed Members have voted for increases about as big
as the cuts voted for by NEA-opposed Members, there is more to
the story.  Of course, many NEA-supported Members did not have
an opportunity to vote for the spending increase legislation they
are espousing.<BR>

<P>
We can get a better idea of the real agendas of NEA-backed Members
by looking at their legislative wish lists - the bills these Members
are sponsoring and cosponsoring.  We have done that in an earlier
study of NEA-PAC contributions to House Members running for re-election
in 1994 and found that the average NEA-backed Member had an agenda
to increase federal spending by $302 billion per year.<BR>

<P>
Thus, the NEA is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in
PAC money to a) defeat Members who have voted for modest cuts
in the size of government, and b) support Members who have voted
for modest increases, but who if given control of the legislative
agenda would radically expand government - by about 20 percent.
<BR>

<P>
This portrait of the NEA is not pretty, but this is what the numbers
tell us.  The political and legislative agenda of the NEA would
a) increase taxes, b) increase deficits, and c) greatly add to
the coming crises of our major entitlement programs.  The net
result is devastation for America's children. (applause)<BR>

Our next speaker, is Otis Troupe. Currently, Mr. Troupe is Executive
Director of Otis Troupe and Associates, a consulting firm that
specializes in the design and development of government programs.
 He was auditor of this city, of Washington D.C., for 13 years.
 Quite controversial, I would say, but honest, always had integrity,
and always told it exactly how he saw it, and reported it that
way. Now Mr. Troupe holds an MBA from Columbia University, JD
from Boston College Law, and a Bachelors from Yale.  Mr. Troupe
is a product of the D.C. schools. A &quot;product,&quot; I emphasize,
and comes from a family of school teachers.  He now serves on
the board of directors for FOCUS, Friends of Choice in Urban Schools,
a local group dedicated to bringing choice to the District of
Columbia.   It is my pleasure to welcome Otis Troupe. (applause)
<BR>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P>
<img src="troupe.gif" align=left alt="Otis Troupe"><B>Otis Troupe:</B>Thank you very much Mr. Williams.  As you noted, I am a product
of the D.C. public school system.  In September of 1962, D.C.
public schools, public education in Washington D.C., put me on
the campus of Yale University.  I would entreat each of you to
think of the most inspiring, up the economic up the social ladder,
story of America, story of your own ethnicity perhaps, of your
own background in a big city.  Think of the most inspiring story
you have ever heard, and I will guarantee you that a clean, efficient,
uncorrupted, unmeddled with public school system was part of that
experience.  As I think of great numbers of my own group, Thurgood
Marshall, Ralph Bunche, all owe the things that they were able
to accomplish, to a strong program of public education. <BR>

<P>
That brings me now, to my particular posture.  I am very active
on the local level.  I will say to you that what I see on the
local level in my analysis of D.C. public schools strikes me as
a microcosm of what is going on nationally. What we have is a
failing system of delivery of education.  We have high parental
confusion and disenchantment. We have very, very low teacher morale.
We have a widespread, widespread perception, negative perception
of personal honesty and political motivations of both the superintendent
and the elected board, and the D.C. public school system, regrettably,
 is characterized by a bloated, administrative layer, whose only
priority is its own continuation.  I offer you this as a parallel
to the public education quandary in deliverance that we have here
in this country today.  We are putting entirely too many dollars
into areas that do not put the dollars directly to the children.
 And the waste is documentable.  I say to you that the reason
I offer my background as the auditor in my bio is that I reviewed
the numbers for these people for 12, 13 years.  The level of self-dealing,
the level of empire building, the level of political chicanery,
the level of application of dollars for personal, political agendas,
is nothing short of criminal.<BR>

<P>
I say to you that what was brought into the dialogue on voucher
schools and independent schools recently, by the NEA, regrettably,
they weighed in on the side of the people who frankly were holding
our children hostage to our own tax dollars.<BR>

<P>
If you look at the opponents to independent reform schools in
D.C., what you see is the NEA nationally, the Teamsters nationally,
the elected body of school officials, much of the elected body
of municipal officials, and the Washington teachers union.  Quite
frankly, very few of those people have any of their children in
public education in Washington D.C.  Fully 80 percent of our own
teachers' union sends their children elsewhere.  Let me say also,
let me direct you to one chilling statistic.  In our own University
of the District of Columbia, the level of remediation, in other
words, the time it takes an incoming freshman from our own public
school system to stop doing remedial and pre-college work, increased
in the past 10 years from 1 year, 1 month to 2 years, 9 months.
 What that says, ladies and gentleman, is that the public university
is doing the job of the public schools.  Every year we graduate
9,200-9,300 young people.  Believe me, 8,000 of them read below
the seventh grade level, do math below the fifth grade level.
 <BR>

<P>
To this, we offer, that there is a widespread disenchantment and
frankly disrespect for the leadership and output of D.C. public
schools. And out of this, is an increasing disposition by parents
groups, groups of concerned citizens groups to create an atmosphere
where any good-faith experiment in alternative education ought
to be given a chance.  I am very happy to talk to you on a number
of subjects having to do with vouchers and independents, that's
my committee.  What I will say, however, is that one of the things
we are trying to put in place in Washington D.C., and then also
was fought by the NEA and the education establishment, is that
we want to give a priority to new schools, publicly funded non-profit
academies, started up around partnerships between veteran and
big-city school teachers, administratively sophisticated churches,
and perhaps other sorts of citizens' groups.  This will move the
dollars from our tax payers to our principals and teachers, our
educators,  our troops in the trenches, and officially, what it
does, is bypasses the existence of the centralized, wasteful,
down-town, administrative bloat.<BR>

<P>
The standard party-line from the NEA is that these sorts of schools
will destroy public education as we know it.  I offer you just
this one thing to think about, and that is, that the only way
this program of alternative schools, whether vouchers, whether
 charters, whether any other financial construct; the only way
that they will work is if parents see the success and continue
to make those choices.  And that's what my organization works
for. (applause)<BR>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P>
<B>Armstrong Williams:</B> Man&#133; Was that compelling or what?  This man spoke not only
from experience, but from the heart.  And I was just captivated
to think that our public universities are doing the jobs of the
high schools.  Two and a half years to nine months remedial courses.
 You think about that.  The answer is right here.  <BR>

<P>
Our next speaker is Clint Bolick.  Clint Bolick is the Vice President
and Director of Litigation for the Institute for Justice.  Mr.
Bolick successfully defended the nation's first school voucher
program in Milwaukee and while he continues to fight for Milwaukee's
expanded choice program, he litigates for school choice in Cleveland,
our nation's second school voucher program.  Mr. Bolick, someone
I know and respect, know well and consider a friend, has authored
several books and articles including the recently published <I>Affirmative
Action Fraud</I>, and what a fraud it is, <I>Can We Restore The
American Civil Rights Vision</I>, and <I>Grassroots Tyranny: The
Limits of Federalism</I>. It is now my pleasure to introduce Clint
Bolick.<BR>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P>
<img src="bolick.gif" align=right alt="Clint Bolick"><B>Clint Bolick:</B> Thank you Armstrong.  I am predicting a sudden surge in C-SPAN's
ratings for having him as master of ceremonies.  And Charlene,
congratulations on an outstanding event.<BR>

<P>
I am here because I represent school children; little children
in Cleveland and Milwaukee, two of the nation's worst urban school
systems. I represent low-income children in those two cities.
 Those systems, the statistics are just staggering.  They are
beyond the ordinary person's comprehension.  In Milwaukee, for
parents, excuse me, for families on public assistance, 15 percent
graduate the Milwaukee public schools.<BR>

<P>
Cleveland recently became the largest school district in the United
States to be ordered by a federal court to be placed under the
supervision of the state. In Cleveland, 7 percent of the school
district students graduate on time and pass the senior proficiency
examination; a 1 in 14 ratio.  The same ratio, I might add, of
students in the Cleveland public schools who were victimized by
crime every year.  So you have an even chance to be a crime victim
or a proficient graduate. Pretty pathetic. In fact, there were
twice as many assault victims in the Cleveland public schools
last year as there were proficient graduates.  <BR>

<P>
These kids need help, they need it now, and they need it desperately.
 And happily, in both places, there are school choice programs
that are allowing these little kids to take a share, a share of
their public funds to private schools that have been chosen for
them by their parents. The program has been operational since
1990 in Milwaukee. It was expanded by a bipartisan majority of
the legislature last year fifteen fold, and to include religious
schools.  In Cleveland, the scholarship program was legislated
to begin this November, and 6,500 hundred families applied for
1,500 low-income scholarships for Cleveland's schools.<BR>

<P>
These are the programs that offer the greatest promise of educational
reform in the United States.  &quot;Why,&quot; you might ask,
&quot;do these little kids need a lawyer?&quot; It seems that
they need teachers, they need parents, they need a caring community.
They have all of those things, but unfortunately, they need a
lawyer because they are being subjected to harassment and to challenge
by the most reactionary and powerful special interest in America,
the National Education Association.  If there was a truth in advertising
law in the United States, the NEA would be going down in flames
right now because this group has become the school-yard bullies
of the 1990s.  For the first time in their lives, these little
kids have the chance to go to good schools, to safe schools, to
schools chosen for them by their parents, and these thugs are
absolutely dead set to make sure these kids never get there.<BR>

<P>
We're slugging these cases our in the Ohio and Wisconsin courts
right now and the statements of the unions are extremely revealing.
 In the Cleveland case, which I argued last week in Columbus Ohio,
last Monday, a week ago today, the NEA brief said that these school
choice programs were really a &quot;money laundering scheme,&quot;
the money going from the state to the religious schools.  The
sister organization, the American Federation of Teachers, described
parents as quote, &quot;inconsequential conduits,&quot; end quote,
for the transmission of aid from the state to the religious schools.
 Well I have this to say to the AFT and the NEA: these parents
are not conduits and they are <B>emphatically</B> not inconsequential
because if this reform succeeds, their vice-grip monopoly over
public education is going to be broken and parents, rather than
bureaucrats, will be the primary determinants of where low-income
children will go to school.<BR>

<P>
It is going to be a long fight. It is a David verses Goliath fight,
but Goliath was slayed in the bible and so too will he be slayed
in the court-room.  And I have just one final word to say to the
NEA.  On behalf of low-income families across the United States,
&quot;Let Our Children Go.&quot; Thank you. (applause)<BR>

<P>
<HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>
<P>
<B>Armstrong Williams: </B>You know, you really have to wonder, and hopefully we can get
into this during the Q and A, how this organization has been allowed
to destroy so much of this country.  Who are those in Washington
that continue to support what is detrimental to our children and
our parents? Those questions need to be addressed. How did the
NEA become so bloated, so powerful?  And whose interests is it
supporting if it is not the interests of families and America?
 Those are questions that need to be asked and addressed.  <BR>

<P>
Listen to this&#133; I don't know about you, but it makes me furious,
it makes me very angry, and it makes me want to do something.
 This meeting today should be a call to action by decent people
who are sick and tired, sick and tired of this disgusting educational
system. And hopefully, from this meeting today, we will not just
sit around and talk about it, we will do something about it.<BR>

<P>
We've already heard several myths that the NEA spreads about itself;
another is that it is a democratic organization. Democratic organizations,
however, do not coerce individuals into subsidizing their political
and ideological activities.  As Thomas Jefferson said, quote,
&quot;To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the
propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.&quot;
(Quoted in I. Brant, <I>James Madison: The Nationalist</I>, p.354
(1948)).<BR>

<P>
The NEA coerces financial support of its political and ideological
activities in two ways. First, the NEA has a standing policy that
its affiliates should negotiate agreements that include &quot;[m]embership
in the association or the payment of a fair -share fee as a condition
of employment&quot;  (National Education Association, <I>NEA Handbook
1994-1995</I>,  p. 303). Twenty-one states and the District of
Columbia have laws that permit such compulsory unionism agreements.
According to the NEA's own figures, approximately 23,000 teachers
and educational support personnel are compelled to pay its so-called
&quot;agency fees&quot; to keep their jobs (National Education
Association, <I>Strategic Plan and Budget Fiscal Year: 1995-1996
</I>iii (1995)).<BR>

<P>
Until the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation successfully
sued for teachers  challenging that practice (<I>Abood v. Detroit
Board of Education, </I>431 U.S. 209 (1977); <I>Lehnert v. Ferris
Faculty Association</I> - MEA-NEA, 500 U.S. 507 (1991)), the NEA
and its affiliates with impunity spent the compulsory dues and
agency fees of objecting members and nonmembers on its political,
lobbying , and other ideological activities. These expenditures
were beyond the direct contributions to candidates from the NEA's
voluntary political action funds.<BR>

<P>
Since the Foundation was established in 1968, it has brought some
668 cases for teachers against the teachers' unions. Of those
cases, 365 are still open and 303 are closed. Of the closed cases,
270 have resulted in a fee reduction for the plaintiff teachers.
In one of those cases, the NEA and its state and local affiliates
were only able to prove that less than 10% of their expenditures
from general treasury funds was for lawfully chargeable bargaining
activities (<I>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association</I> - MEA-NEA,
643 F. Supp. 1306 (W.D. Mich 1986), <I>aff'd</I>, 881 F.2d 1388
(6<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1989), <I>aff'd in part, rev'd in part, </I>500
U.S. 507 (1991)). Even today, after all this litigation, the NEA
uses a phony &quot;arbitration&quot; scheme to prevent objecting
agency-fee payers from finding out exactly how their coerced fees
are spent (<I>See Bromley v. Michigan Education Association -
NEA</I>, 82 F.3d 686 (6<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1996).<BR>

<P>
The second way in which the NEA coerces financial support of its
political and ideological activities is through the fine print
in its membership applications. The membership application form
used by most, if not all, NEA state affiliates contains fine print
in which the teacher signing it agrees that &quot;[m]embership
is continued unless I reverse this authorization in writing between
August 1 and August 31, of any year.&quot; Union members, of course,
have no right to obtain a dues reduction if they object to the
purposes for which their dues are spent. Moreover, rank-and-file
members of the NEA do not decide how dues are spent. The officers
and professional staff of the NEA and its affiliates make those
decisions.<BR>

<P>
Hundreds of teachers who contacted the Foundation for assistance
have told us that the NEA's locals do not point out the fine print
in the membership applications when they sign up new members.
Moreover, where agency fees are an option, local NEA officials
- and, sadly, school management - often fail to tell teachers
that they have any option other than full membership, misleading
them into signing membership applications. Teachers are not told
how their dues will be spent before they sign these applications.
After teachers find out that their dues are being used for purposes
they oppose, the union tells them that they cannot resign until
the following August.<BR>

<P>
For example, in late 1994 the Michigan Education Association imposed
a 3-year, $30 a year assessment on its members for an image building
program. When members tried to resign to avoid paying the first
year's assessment, the MEA told them, &quot;sorry, you have to
pay it, because you can't resign until next August.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation does its best
to help teachers in fighting and correcting these pernicious,
undemocratic practices. However, our financial and staff resources
are limited. Moreover, we help not just teachers, but workers
in all professions and industries whose rights are violated by
compulsory unionism arrangements.<BR>

<P>
Litigation is expensive. The Foundation is a &quot;David&quot;
compared with the NEA's &quot;Goliath.&quot; The Foundation's
annual budget of almost $200 million, and each of its state affiliates
has a budget of almost $200 million, and each of its state affiliates
has a budget of millions or tens of millions of dollars. Consequently,
the Foundation cannot possibly provide legal assistance to every
teacher who asks for our help. Public exposure of the NEA's &quot;dirty
little secrets&quot; is necessary - to get the word out to teachers
that they do not have subsidize the NEA's political and ideological
activities - and to inform the public that the NEA is not the
democracy it pretends to be. (applause) <BR>

I am here as a guest to dispel another NEA myth and that myth
is that the NEA supports charter schools. Throughout the NEA convention,
you are going to hear this week that the NEA is launching a new
project, and that project is their Charter School Initiative.
 <BR>

<P>
The Charter School Initiative is a five year, and I quote, &quot;exploration
into the concept of whether charter schools can contribute to
the improvement of our nation's schools.&quot;  And it's gotten
a lot of press&#133; we support charter schools and we're all
in favor of them and we're doing everything we can to help. This
is simply not the case, and I'm here to explain to you why this
is not the case.<BR>

<P>
A charter school, for anyone who doesn't know, is a public school
created by different teachers, parents or otherwise qualified
individuals, and is largely free from state and district oversight.
 Charter schools create an alternative for public schooling where
schools are granted significant autonomy and are held accountable
for results.  The charter is essentially a contract negotiated
between the individuals starting the school and the special body
authorized to approve the charter.  The charter specifies how
the schools are to be run, what will be taught, how success will
be measured, and what students will achieve.<BR>

<P>
Unlike other public schools, parents specifically request the
charter schools and if the school fails to attract students or
if the charter fails to meet the terms of the charter, the charter
school can be closed and the charter can be revoked.<BR>

<P>
The charter school phenomenon has been sweeping the nation and
transforming America's schools. In the little over four years
since the first charter school law was passed in 1991, twenty-four
states have enacted some from of charter school legislation. As
of the beginning of the 1995-96 school year, over 290 charter
schools have opened their doors to students from across the socio-economic
spectrum. The educational results in states with strong charter
school provisions are astounding. States with well-crafted legislation
have experienced enhanced educational opportunities for poor and
minority children, distinctive and innovative educational programs,
enthusiastic responses from teachers flourishing in their new
found freedom from bureaucratic red tape, remarkable commitment
from parents, long waiting lists to get into the charter schools,
and unusual educational partnerships.<BR>

<P>
Minnesota enacted the first charter school law followed in rapid
succession by California in 1993; Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts,
New Mexico, and Wisconsin in 1993; Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, and
Michigan in 1994; Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, Rhode Island, Texas and Wyoming in 1995, and, most
recently, New Jersey in 1996. Six of the states, including Arizona,
California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan and Minnesota have
strong charter school provisions, and not surprisingly, host over
95% of the charter schools up and running, serving more than 30,000
students. By contrast, in the ten states with the weakest charter
school provisions, there are a total of less than 50 charter schools
up and operating.<BR>

<P>
The states with weak or ineffective bills can largely blame the
NEA, AFT and the educational special interests. From 1991-1993
these groups simply opposed charter school bills when they appeared.
In 1994 and 1995, these groups, seeing the tremendous effect of
charter schools and decentralized education, switched tactics.
They began a dual course of voicing support for charters yet destroying
the concept through the legislation, which they agreed to &quot;help
draft.&quot; Thus, the states with educational establishment support
enacted almost meaningless laws and the charter school debate
became centered not on the charter school concept itself, but
instead on specific provisions in each particular piece of legislation.
<BR>

<P>
Several factors make a charter school bill effective. These factors
include the ability of two or more official governing bodies to
approve the charter; the authorization of any individual or group,
including religious groups or parents, to attempt to organize
a charter proposal; automatic exemption from state and local regulations
(as opposed to case-by-case or individual  appeals processes);
fiscal autonomy for the school, essentially giving the school
complete control of the funding allocated for the particular school;
legal autonomy, no or high limits on the number of charter schools
that can be created; and the ability of the charter school to
hire non-certified teachers and other employees.<BR>

<P>
For years, the NEA adamantly opposed any educational reform, like
charter schools, that put control of their children's education
into the hands of parents. They ran negative advertisements in
states with legislatures debating charter schools, threatened
and sanctioned legislators who voted for charter school legislation,
and led campaigns warning voters that charter schools would destroy
public education. States continued to pass strong legislation
that created autonomous charter schools and the proven benefits
of charter schools turned out to be substantial. Realizing that
they could not defeat the revolutionary charter school concept,
the NEA about face - they now claim to support charter school
legislation as long as it is &quot;properly crafted.&quot; What
the NEA considers to be a properly crafted charter school law
in reality is weak legislation that does little or nothing to
create strong, autonomous charter schools that offer children
real options.  The NEA's tactic was brilliant - because of the
NEA's alleged support for the idea, the statement &quot;I now
support charter schools&quot; now means nothing.<BR>

<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) was founded in 1986 to study, promote, and extend
the principles of classical liberalism: political equality, civil liberty, and economic freedom.

<p>AdTI  conducts research on five key areas of concern to policy makers: 1) education, 2)
immigration, 3) national defense, 4) taxes &amp; economic growth, and 5) deregulation. 
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3 align="center"><em><font color="#800080"><u>Accomplishments/Publications</font></em></u></h3>

<p>AdTI publishes numerous studies along with articles and op-eds.  Recent research and writing by
Tocqueville scholars include:

<ul>
  <li>a study of the role of immigrants in patents and inventions in the American economy,</li>
  <li>a study of the impact of immigrants on American cities,</li>
  <li>analysis of the fiscal impact of the legislative agenda of the National Education Association
(NEA),</li>
  <li>analysis of the cost of federal education mandates,</li>
  <li>analysis of PAC activity by the NEA and other major unions,</li>
  <li>assessment of the experience of states with a flat tax,</li>
  <li>assessment of the need for a federal tax cut,</li>
  <li>assessment of trends in the federal work force,</li>
  <li>a study of the 10 Worst Regulations of the federal government,</li>
  <li>analysis of the possibilities for privatization in the Department of Defense.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the variety and quality of AdTI's activities, it is not surprising that the Institution is getting
more acclaim in the press and the halls of Congress.  AdTI was recently named by <em>The National
Journal</em> as one of five "up-and-coming" think tanks in Washington, D.C.

<P>In 1986 I published <I>Beyond Public Education</I>, a book that argues that the educational  reform movement in the United States is essentially a futilitarian effort. Nothing that has happened since then has led me to change this conclusion; if anything,  subsequent developments have led to widespread albeit not unanimous agreement with this point of view.</P>
<P> In that book, my contention was that schools for profit could avoid the obstacles that frustrate conventional school reform. Although this conclusion still seems valid, I have come to realize that such schools are not the only way, or necessarily the best way to all circumstances, to utilize the for-profit sector to provide educational services. This realization was partly a consequence of a more intensive analysis of the privatization and educational choice movements. Eventually I recognized a need to assess educational reform from a broader perspective than characterized earlier publications. For example, discussions of educational choice typically treat it as an isolated phenomenon and rarely consider the underlying social forces that generate pressures for more differentiation among products and services.</P>
<P>  This book, then, constitutes an effort to relate educational improvement to the privatization movement and to certain broad social changes as well as to circumstances within the field of education itself. Regardless of whether readers agree or disagree with my resolution of various issues, the book is intended to generate discussion of several neglected issues in educational policy and practice.</P>

<P>This book is an effort to describe the structure, operations, and influence of teacher unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). The context should make it clear whether the organization titles include their state and local affiliates. The authors believe that an NEA/AFT merger will take place in the 1990s, but whether or not this happens, the emergence of strong teacher unions is an important development in education, in the labor movement, in the economy, and in American politics. Because their role is so pervasive but also so widely overlooked, a brief comment on the subject may serve as an introduction to this book.</P>
<P>Ostensibly, school boards formulate educational policy, whereas terms and conditions of teacher employment are negotiated with teacher unions.  In the real world, however, employment terms and conditions inevitably impact educational policy; indeed, in many situations, a term or condition of teacher employment is simply an educational policy viewed from an employment perspective. For instance, suppose a school board decides to assign its most experienced teachers to schools in which pupil achievement is especially low. The board may characterize this as an educational policy; to the teacher union, however, the board would be changing transfer and/or assignment policies, matters normally considered terms and conditions of employment. As such, the school board is required to bargain with the teacher union over the change, which frequently does not materialize as a result of teacher union opposition to it. Thus the unions play a critical role with respect to educational policy, and they do so even when such policies can be distinguished from terms and conditions of teacher employment. Most school district expenditures are for teacher compensation, and collective bargaining contracts set forth the policies under which teachers are employed and compensated. With over 70 percent of the nation&#146;s 2.9 million public school teachers employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, teacher unions clearly play important roles in making and implementing educational policies.</P>
<P>The educational importance of teacher unions is especially evident in controversies over educational vouchers, privatization, and efforts to introduce market-oriented reforms in public education. Indisputably, the teacher unions are the major obstacles to such efforts. Despite their pivotal role in such controversies, there is little public awareness of the dynamics and modus operandi of teacher unions; their critics especially reveal a remarkable lack of sophistication about how and why they function as they do.</P>
<P>The unionization of teachers also marks a basic change in the character of the American labor movement. For instance, in 1953, public employees constituted only six percent of union membership. By 1994, approximately 40 percent of union members were public employees, and we anticipate that the public sector unions will soon enroll a majority of union members in the United States. Actually, public sector unions will be predominant in the AFL-CIO if and when the NEA, the nation&#146;s largest public sector union, becomes affiliated with the Federation. As will be explained shortly, however, it is a fundamental mistake to think of public sector bargaining and public sector unions as merely an extension of private sector concepts to the public sector.</P>
<P>Politically, teacher unions are major players at all levels of government. One of every ten delegates to the 1992 Democratic National Convention was a member of the NEA or the AFT, and no serious observer doubts their important role in state and local politics. Inasmuch as elected officials shape policy on noneducational as well as educational issues, the political influence of teacher unions extends far beyond the field of education. Although teacher unions are usually the most influential interest group on educational issues, their impact on noneducational issues may be even more important from a public policy perspective.</P>
<P>To illustrate, the teacher unions play a pivotal role in the politics of health care. First, they were a key element of the coalition that carried Bill Clinton to victory in the 1992 Democratic primaries and in the general election. Not surprisingly, the Clinton administration&#146;s emphasis on health care is also a major union interest. Unfortunately, the media treatment of health care often fails to reveal the union stake in the issue; a casual observer might think that the union&#146;s interests are concern for the poor or the uninsured or some other humanitarian concern. In the real world, however, the union interest is a practical one, based on union interests as perceived by the unions. As they consider health care, they see the following union benefits in government&#146;s absorption of a larger share of its costs and of forcing all employees to share the costs:</P>
<P>1. To the extent that government spends more and employers spend less on health care, more funds would be available for wages and other economic benefits. If the federal government absorbed some of the costs of health care that are currently paid by school districts, the teacher unions could negotiate for the savings to be distributed to teachers&#146; salaries.</P>
<P>2. Privatization would be less attractive because contractors could not    offer fewer benefits to their employees. All employers would have to share whatever costs of health care devolve on employers per se. Employers would be required to pay for health care for employees of independent contractors working for a single employer.</P>
<P>3. Unions could bargain for the employer to pay for any costs of health care not included in the federally subsidized plan (<I>AFL-CIO News,</I> 1993).</P>
<P>Citizens not familiar with collective bargaining often fail to appreciate the importance of health care issues to unions and employers. At the present time, health care is a frequent obstacle to agreement in both the private and public sectors. Disagreements over who should pay for the rising costs of health care sometimes lead to impasse or even strikes. The point here is not whether the Clinton administration&#146;s health care policies are good or bad public policy; it is that teacher unions play a critical role in how the health care issues are resolved. By the same token, the teacher unions play a major role on other domestic policies as well.</P>
<P>Because of their educational and political roles, teacher unions inescapably play a major role in our nation&#146;s economy. The sheer size of our educational system means that every major educational interest group is also an economic actor of some importance. More importantly, many educational issues are also economic issues, or should be so regarded. For example, the maximum age of compulsory education affects the extent of public and private expenditures, the level of taxation, lifetime earnings, social security funding and benefits, and labor markets, to cite just a few of its economic aspects. The field of education involves scores of such issues; their economic ramifications are often more important than their educational ones. In short, the teacher unions are major actors in the nation&#146;s economy, and like all such actors, should be subject to critical analysis.</P>
<P>Needless to say, the influence of teacher unions, as distinguished from the rationale for their positions, can be a controversial issue in its own right. Quite often, it is impossible to characterize the unions&#146; influence with any degree of confidence. Nonetheless, uncertainty over their role in specific situations does not invalidate the rationale for this book; the latter is based on what is known, not what is uncertain.</P>

<B> The point of view</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The authors&#146; point of view toward teacher unions should be laid on the table at the outset. We believe that the absence of competitive markets in K-12 education is a major weakness of our educational system. The teacher unions are opposed to competitive markets in education; they could hardly do otherwise and remain viable unions. Consequently, we are at times critical of union positions; the positions and our criticism of them are not always articulated in this book. In some instances, our criticisms are not limited to union efforts to stifle competitive markets in education.</P>
<P>Despite our objections to the anticompetitive policies espoused by teacher unions, we recognize that organizations that represent public employees have a legitimate role to play. Public employees need an organization to protect themselves against unjust government action. In totalitarian socie-</P>
<P>ties, governments control the organizations that represent public employees. Consequently, the latter are unable to resist unjust government action, whether directed against themselves or others. In a democratic society, the problem is that the power to oppose government action for legitimate reasons is or becomes the power to promote the interests of public employees for indefensible objectives. Our view is that teacher unions illustrate both the positive and negative aspects of public employee organizations. The discussion of one aspect is not a denial of the existence of the other.</P>
<P>Has our point of view resulted in a biased treatment of teacher unions? We define &#147;bias&#148; as the omission of data and arguments that might reasonably be expected to influence the conclusions of a reasonable person on the issues at stake. While recognizing the possibility of bias, we have tried to consider the data and arguments that support conclusions different from our own. Of course, bias may be reflected in what issues are selected to analyze as well as the way issues are discussed; we have tried to avoid both kinds of bias. Of course, readers must decide for themselves whether we have succeeded in doing so. </P>
<P>Throughout this book, we use the term &#147;NEA/AFT&#148; (1) to refer to the organization that results or would result from a merger of the NEA and AFT, or (2) as a term applicable to both unions. Thus &#147;the NEA/AFT&#148; position on contracting out is the position taken by both unions. In some contexts, both meanings are appropriate because the positions the unions have adopted separately will be the positions adopted by the merged organization. Where only one meaning is intended, the context should clarify any ambiguity in the meaning. </P>
<P>Readers who are familiar with previous books about teacher unions will be aware that we have not relied heavily on them. One reason is that their data are no longer accurate or fail to take account of recent developments that are critical to a realistic assessment of the issues. In addition, we believe that several of these earlier books are characterized by a naive point of view that impedes an objective analysis; this is true for favorable as well as unfavorable books about the teacher unions (Berube, 1988; Blumenfield 1985; Donley, 1976; Johnson, 1984; Kerchner, 1988; Lieberman, 1956; McDonnell, 1988; Reed, 1980; Selden, 1985; and West, 1980). In addition to the fact that such matters as membership, revenues, and organizational structure have changed considerably, changes in the political and demographic context impact several organizational issues in unprecedented ways. Our analysis is more akin to a sketch than a comprehensive analysis; indeed, one of our objectives is to call attention to various dimensions of the teacher unions that deserve intensive research and analysis. </P>

<B> NEA/AFT merger</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>In view of the influence of the teacher unions, the possibility of their merger is not to be taken lightly. It would be overly optimistic to treat merger as a fait accompli; at the same time, an analysis that assumed that the NEA and AFT will continue as separate organizations might be out of date when published. Our solution to this dilemma is to describe the status of merger in early 1994 as best we can, and leave it to the reader to assess the likelihood that it will materialize. We will offer our assessments of both the issues in the merger talks and the prospects for merger, but reiterate the importance of teacher unions, merger or no merger.</P>
<P>For present purposes, the critical event relating to merger is the NEA&#146;s invitation to the AFT to engage in merger talks. This invitation was included in New Business Items 1993-A and 1993-B, adopted by the NEA&#146;s Representative Assembly (RA) on July 2, 1993. In our view, the adoption of these items, especially since it was by a substantial margin, renders it likely that an NEA/AFT merger will take place in the next three to five years.</P>
<P>The size and resources of a merged organization would be awesome, yet retain the potential for substantial growth. Table 1.1 provides some idea of the membership and revenues that would result from an NEA/AFT merger.</P>

<P>The figures in Table 1.1 overestimate the membership and underestimate the revenues of the merged organization; since the revenues will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, we will comment here only on the membership figures.</P>
<P>From its <I>Strategic Plan and Budget, Fiscal Year 1993-94</I>, the total NEA 1993-94 membership figures includes the following:</P>

<P>For some purposes, these categories differ from the regular full-time teachers who constitute the overwhelming majority of NEA members. In addition, it should be noted that the NEA does not categorize its membership publicly into &#147;professional&#148; or &#147;teacher&#148; on the one hand, and educational support personnel on the other, although the distinction is made in the NEA budget.</P>
<P>The AFT membership figures must be interpreted even more cautiously. As shown in Table 1.1, the AFT claimed a membership of 820,000 in 1993. The Federation also stated that its members are in one of five divisions. Although the AFT did not provide an official breakdown, its informal breakdown to one of the authors was as follows:</P>

<P>Nevertheless, just prior to the October 1993 AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting in San Francisco, the AFL-CIO released a report that showed the AFT with 574,000 paid up members, a gain of only 1000 over 1992. Meanwhile the AFT was claiming that its membership was 796,000, a gain of 50,000 over 1990-92.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, some of the discrepancy is due to the fact that the AFL-CIO</P>
<P>counts only fully paid up members who are included in the count for determining union representation at the AFL-CIO convention; in contrast, the AFT is counting all members, whether or not they are included in the membership count for convention purposes. Furthermore, the AFT does not pay the full per capita tax on certain categories of membership, such as associate members. This is another reason why the AFT membership figures released for public relations purposes are much greater than the AFT membership figures cited by the AFL-CIO. It is possible, however, that the AFT&#146;s larger membership figures may be a more accurate guide to its political influence, since the Federation is often successful in persuading retirees to be campaign activists for union candidates and causes. It should also be noted that a small number of teachers are members of both the NEA and AFT, hence the memberships and revenues of both groups would have to be adjusted downward to reflect this fact if and when an NEA/AFT merger materializes. Nonetheless, even on the most conservative estimates of membership and revenues, the NEA and AFT would constitute a towering presence in education, the labor movement, politics, and the economy.</P>

<B> Differences between the NEA and AFT:</B>
<BR><B>Do they matter?</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>At various times, we refer to &#147;teacher unions.&#148; This usage implies that there are no significant differences between the NEA and AFT on the issues under discussion. Elsewhere, the analysis points out how the NEA and AFT differ in some way. To avoid any misunderstanding, let us explain our perspective on the similarities and differences between the two national unions.</P>
<P>Clearly, the NEA and AFT differ in membership, resources, governance structure, and leadership personnel, to cite some of the more obvious differences. In addition, the demographics of the two unions differ considerably; the AFT&#146;s strength is more concentrated in large urban centers; the NEA is much stronger in suburban and rural areas. These demographic dif-ferences sometimes result in policy differences that are erroneously viewed as different concepts of unions or union objectives. Also, the AFT is af-filiated with the AFL-CIO; the NEA is not, although its policies on noneducational issues are invariably supportive of or consistent with AFL-CIO policies.</P>
<P>Some differences between the NEA and AFT are important, but they are not necessarily the ones that receive the most attention in the media or among academicians. Generally speaking, the NEA is perceived as the more conservative in terms of teacher militancy but the more liberal in terms of social policy generally. In our view, this perception is unwarranted, or at least requires significant modification.</P>
<P>At the district level, the local affiliate of either union bargains for the objectives of its membership. To illustrate, suppose the teaching staff is composed predominantly of senior teachers dissatisfied because the salary schedule does not offer high maximum salaries for teachers with many years of experience. These senior teachers will seek higher maximum salaries, regardless of whether they are represented by an NEA or an AFT affiliate. Younger teachers are more likely to emphasize reducing the number of steps required to reach the maximum salary. If and when they reach the maximum, their bargaining objectives will change, but at any given time, the bargaining objectives of a local union are a compromise between such conflicting interests. Similarly, if most teachers are concerned about extra- duty pay or school safety, the local union that represents them will emphasize these objectives. These objectives are not affected by whether the union is an NEA or AFT affiliate. Inasmuch as the demographics will be the same, willingness to engage in hard bargaining or strike action is likely to be the same or very similar, regardless of national affiliation. In short, the local union&#146;s national affiliation rarely plays a significant role at the bargaining table.</P>
<P>Of course, the NEA and AFT assert that their affiliates are more effective than their rivals. The NEA claims that its support services are superior to the AFT&#146;s; the AFT asserts that its affiliation with the AFL-CIO enables AFT locals to gain labor support for teacher objectives. Neither reason is very persuasive.Teacher salaries and benefits are public information; in any given district, an AFT negotiator is as likely as an NEA negotiator to know how much teachers in comparable districts are being paid. As for AFL-CIO affiliation, many AFT locals are in districts where there is no AFL-CIO organization; even where there is, its active support cannot be taken for granted. In short, from a bargaining standpoint, it makes little or no difference in theory or practice whether teachers are represented by an NEA or AFT affiliate.</P>
<P>In the era when the NEA and AFT were competing for bargaining rights, their rhetoric greatly exaggerated the differences between the unions from a bargaining perspective. Today, however, displacement of an NEA affiliate by an AFT local (or vice versa) is relatively rare, and neither national union is making a systematic effort to replace the other at the local level. This truce would not continue to exist if either union were superior to the other in achieving benefits in the bargaining process.</P>
<P>Although not critical from a bargaining standpoint, NEA/AFT differences are important from other standpoints. We shall discuss these differences, but one caveat should be emphasized at the outset; the differences are not necessarily a guide to which union is &#147;better&#148; from either a teacher or public interest point of view. These are complicated issues that must often be resolved on the basis of the circumstances facing the decisionmaker. Furthermore, the NEA and AFT, like other unions, constantly undergo changes that might affect one&#146;s assessment of them.</P>

At the same time, the Legislature ensured that Texas would not give up on expelled students by turning them out on the streets with no chance to continue their education in academics and responsibility.  <br>The result of these efforts are the Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs. Under the new law, students in the 22 largest Texas counties are automatically suspended from traditional school for certain offenses, including weapons  violations.  It is the responsibility of the county, however, to educate these children. Funds are provided by the school district which would have paid for their education if the kids were still in school.<br>In most of the counties, juvenile probation departments have arranged with the school districts themselves to provide this education in a separate setting.  However, 8 counties have decided to contract with private vendors to educate these young people. These include Dallas, Travis, Bexar and Harris counties. These large counties solicited bids from service providers similar to the way the Houston ISD solicited schools to relieve its overcrowding problem in a particular neighborhood.<p>Currently the largest JJAEP has 121 students, but is conceivable that large counties could be looking to place as many as 5-700 juveniles in the near future.  This growing population will provide an opportunity for private entities to provide academic (and potentially vocational) training to this important population. In addition, 25 smaller counties have voluntarily started JJAEPs.  As more counties provide such programs, it is likely the private sector will increasingly be called upon to participate in educating this group of teenagers.<p><B> Charter school directory now available</B><p>The Center for Education Reform is publishing its third edition of the National Charter School Directory. For the 1996-97 school year, charter schools will serve more than 100,000 children in 480 schools.  The directory is a comprehensive listing of charter schools nationwide.  Call 202 822-9000 to order a copy.<p><B> New Jersey counts on math committees</B><p>According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, New Jersey has decided to replace teaching of math by repetition with a program that encourages problem solving and math by group. Other goals include: Use a variety of estimation strategies and recognize situations in which estimation is appropriate.  The National Council of Teachers of Math is responsible for these new benchmarks which will serve to lower standards of competency.<p><B> Washington DC schools - a national embarrassment</B><br> <br>The Washington, DC school system has been given an F by the DC Financial Control Board which called the capitals school district an utter failure.  In addition to the poor performance by DC students, area new media estimate the DC  system has wasted $50 million in taxpayer money. <p><br>

The students selected for interview reflected students in grades 6-12 nationally.  The survey, undertaken in 1993,  asked students about violence, including attacks robberies, and bullying in school.  The surveyors asked students if they had been victims or witnessed violent acts.  The researchers concluded:<p><B> Younger students are more likely to be victimized and to worry about crime</B><br>Fifteen percent of students in grades 6-8 reported being victims of violence vs. 8% of students in grades 9-12.  Almost one in three (32%) of students in grades 6-8 worried about becoming a victim vs. 20% of older students.<p><B> Students at large schools more likely to experience violence</B><br>An incredible 75% of students at schools with 600 or more students were aware of violence in their school. Three in five students in schools with fewer than 300 students reported knowing of such incidents.<p><B> Females are almost as likely to carry weapons as males</B><br>The 1993 survey revealed that 3% of students carried some weapon to school to protect themselves vs.  2% in 1989 (according to an unrelated prior survey). Both surveys found that males are only slightly more prone to carry a weapon than females.<p><B> Gang presence results in more weapons in school</B><br>Thirty-one percent of students in grades 6-12 who knew of no gangs in school reported knowing of weapons in school.  Sixty-two percent of students who knew of gangs in school said they knew of weapons in school. <p><B> Violence is more likely in schools with drug dealers</B><br>One-quarter of students said it was easy to get controlled substances at school including alcohol and marijuana.  Students who said there were drug dealers on campus were far more likely to report incidents of physical attack (61% vs. 39%), robbery (23% vs. 9%) and bullying (73% vs. 53%).<p>

Dallas ISD approves district charter for low income families. Dont feel good about flagging academics.</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> Austin area district wants private schools to help ease overcrowding</B><p>The Lake Travis school board has approved a plan where students could use vouchers to attend the public or private school of their choice.  The Lake Travis school district lies west of Austin and has  2,900 students enrolled.  The district was one of only 37 school districts in Texas to earn an exemplary ranking from the Texas Education Agency.  <p>Under the Lake Travis plan, a portion of the per student funding from state and local sources would follow students to schools they select.  Lake Travis board members have said the plan is necessary because residents recently voted down a bond issue to be used for additional school facilities.  The vouchers would allow the district to educate its students at a lower cost per pupil without new capital expenditures.  <p>Initially, the amount of the voucher was set at $3,750, well below the $4,800 the Lake Travis school district currently spends per  student, excluding debt service.  In approving the plan,  however, the board agreed to set the level of the voucher at a later date.   The school board has asked Education Commissioner Mike Moses to approve the plan.  <p><B> Dallas ISD approves district charter for low income families</B><p>The slots for all 20 Open Enrollment charter schools have already been filled.  In the last legislative session, lawmakers approved the establishment of a maximum of 20 such schools chartered by the state.  Legislators also gave school districts the authority to charter an unlimited number of schools at the local level.  The Prairie Creek Academy may be the first Texas school to be chartered in this manner.  Prairie Creek is designed to help low-income children with limited English speaking ability.  Prairie Creek kids will attend school three weeks longer than other DISD children, and will be taught in class rooms limited to 15 students.<p><B> Dont feel good about flagging academics</B><p>Psychologist William Coulson, one of the founders of the self-esteem movement, is recanting.  Today, Coulson is encouraging teachers to emphasize academics over feeling good about themselves.  Recent research shows this about-face is a smart move.<p>A review of classroom techniques that tracked 7,000 students at 139 schools across the country revealed that models focusing on self-esteem resulted in lower academic scores than any other models. The best instructional methods, the study found, stressed effective teaching of academics. These successful strategies did not attempt to make children feel good except by rewarding good work.<p>Apart from the study, leading researchers on self-esteem including Morris Rosenburg, Thomas Moeller and Alfie Kohn, conclude that self-esteem does nothing to enhance academic success. Worse, according to a 1996 study in Psychological Review, an artificial emphasis on self-esteem can increase anti-social behavior, including violence.  In fact, the study refutes the commonly held belief that low-self esteem is a contributor to violence, contending that violence may be caused when real life events contradict highly favorable views of oneself.<br>

Watts touts CEF at Dallas luncheon.</B><p>Oklahoma Congressman J.C. Watts, Jr. served as keynote speaker at a fund-raiser for the Childrens Education Fund on Oct. 24.   Rep. Watts was a featured speaker at the 1996 Republican Convention in San Diego and is the first African-American Republican to be elected south the Mason-Dixon line since Reconstruction.  Watts called school choice simply common sense and praised the efforts of the CEF to help low income children in Dallas County.  The CEF thanks Rep. Watts and all attendees for their participation.<p><B> Charter schools are on the move</B><br>This fall more than 80,000 children are attending more than 400 charter schools in 13 states.  According to a survey by the Hudson Institute, most of the children attending these new schools are those who generally do not succeed in a traditional setting.  Most children are minority students, 20% have limited English proficiency and many are disabled.<p>As expected, charter schools are serving a variety of students and meeting a variety of needs. Among the news on charters: <p>Bostons Pioneer Institute found that charters are reaching kids dismissed as difficult to teach. Massachusetts charters schools are serving a higher percentage of minority students, low income children and bilingual kids than the average public school.<p>Formerly Mean Joe Green wants to start a charter school in Florida for troubled black males.<p><B> Private market filling educational void</B><p>According to Montgomery Securities, an investment banking and securities firm, publicly traded education-oriented companies provide a classic investment opportunity.  Montgomery bases this bullishness on what it calls an all-time high in dissatisfaction with traditional public schools. This sentiment is heightened, the firms analysts say, because down-sized parents realize now more than ever that superior education is the key to economic opportunity.  <p>According to Montgomery, the U.S. education system compares poorly against its competitors globally. Montgomerys research reveals that the U.S. spends more than $600 billion on education annually, more than is spent on national defense.  This figure is larger than the GDP of Spain, Canada or Brazil.  About 75% of the cost of the countrys education is funded publicly, although only half of all public funds are directed to classroom employees and 3% are spent on texts and materials. <p>Montgomery knows of  no other service industry spending 50% of every dollar outside of where the service is being rendered, unless it is subsidized by the government. <p><B> Quotable</B><br>I am fascinated by (your school choice bill) and am having my staff analyze it.  Im concerned the traditional Democratic party establishment has not given you more encouragement.  The visionary is rarely embraced by the status quo.<br>Gov. Bill Clinton in a letter to Wisconsin State Rep. Polly Williams, Oct. 10, 1990.<br>

Don't let the new SAT scores fool you.  Union magazine addresses charter schools.  Dallas schools most in need of improvement are in inner-city.</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> Houston ISD sets ground breaking contract with private school.</B><p>In a move that could have implications for taxpayers statewide, the Houston school district is paying a private school to educate 200 of its students. The arrangement, in the form of a contract, was undertaken because H.I.S.D. could not provide facilities for the 200 school children.  The Varnett School, which is located in southwest Houston, has agreed to teach the children for $3,575 per student.  Average tuition at the school is currently $4,050 per student.  It cost the H.I.S.D. $4,677 to teach a single student during the 1994-95 school year.  This cost excludes capital expenditures and debt service.  <p>By allowing Varnett to teach 200 of the districts children, the H.I.S.D. is saving money for each student in the contract while avoiding the capital and financing costs associated with a new or renovated school.<p>The Houston teachers union, however, has yet to see the silver lining.  They damn well better have certified teachers over there, the Houston Chronicle quoted the president of the Houston Federation of Teachers as saying.<br>So while union leaders worry about losing their grip over 200 children, teachers at Varnett will be placing fewer than 20 students in each classroom, and doing it cheaper than the H.I.S.D.^ <p>Don't let the new SAT scores fool you<p><B> Thanks to what the College Board calls recentering, SAT scores are both higher and more confusing.  Due to tinkering by the purveyors of the exam, last years average score of 428 verbal and 482 math will this year result in scores of 504 and 506.  The new recentering not only inflates these mediocre scores, it gives the appearance students are doing equally well in reading and math.  This hocus-pocus makes it impossible to compare historical scores with the new and improved recentered figures. Furthermore, the new test is easier, calculators are permitted and students have longer to complete the exam.<br>And if that wasnt enough, the College Board has made it possible to have a perfect score while missing four questions.  Prior to this finagling, a perfect score meant perfect - missing zero questions.  It sounds like the College Board needs tutoring in each of its own subjects.</B><p><B> Union magazine addresses charter schools</B><p>Charter schools are the cover story in the Fall 1996 issue of ATPE News, the magazine of the Association of Professional Educators.  The ATPE has generally supported charter schools in Texas, and the story provides an interesting insight into two charter schools opening this year.  All 20 slots for Open Enrollment charter schools have been filled, although not every school will open this year.  Removing the cap on the number of these innovative schools the state allows could revolutionize education in Texas.<p><B> Dallas schools most in need of improvement are in inner-city</B><p>A 1995 study of community needs revealed that the quality of pubic schools was of more concern to inner-city residents than residents in any other section of the county.  The study was prepared by the University of Texas at Dallas in conjunction with several area non-profit agencies.  For example, in West Dallas and  neighborhoods south of the Trinity, 12.5%, 15.5% and 13.1% of residents respectively identified the quality of public schools as a major problem.  Only 9.7% of Dallas County residents as whole viewed public schools as a big problem. <p>The number of high school drop outs was also viewed as a major problem in the three communities, with responses of 21.2%, 29.6% and 28%.  Other problems viewed as major by the three impoverished neighborhoods included access to good jobs, teenage substance abuse, unsupervised children and unemployment.<p>

New Yorkers start CEF-style program.</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> CEF starts school with 314 kids!</B><p>This fall, more than 300 low-income children are attending schools their parents selected with help from the CEF.  This is an increase in enrollment of 40% over last year! Thanks to all supporters of CEF for opening doors for children in our community. <p><B> Houston school superintendent finds solution to overcrowding</B> <p>Houston voters tired of rising property taxes last month rejected a $390 million bond issue. Meanwhile, school administrators have been mulling over plans to relieve overcrowding in Houston schools. According to the Houston Chronicle, one of the ideas proposed by Houston Superintendent Rod Paige is to contract with non-district schools to teach H.I.S.D. children.  Under the plan, students who could not attend their assigned school because of overcrowding would have the option of attending a private school. <p>Superintendent Paige notes the district already is engaged in such contract for service.  For example, the district pays non-district schools to teach special education children and students who have been expelled. The proposal has not been acted upon. Whether or not the school board adopts the superintendents idea, the innovative proposal is sure should get administrators in  Texas school districts thinking. Expensive new construction at taxpayer expense is not the only answer to overcrowding.<p><B> Milwaukees choice program helps narrow learning gap for minority students</B><p>According to a study by Harvard University and the University of Houston, Milwaukees publicly funded pilot choice program provides tangible benefits to urban school children. The study discovered that after three years in the program, students scored higher on reading and math tests than comparable public school students.  The gap was wider for fourth year students.  According to Jay Greene, the UH assistant professor who co-authored the study, the difference in academic performance is substantial.  According to Greene, if similar success was achieved by all minority students nationwide, the gap in test scores between whites and minorities students would be narrowed by one-third to one-half. <p>The study compared students who were accepted into the program with those who applied but were turned down due to a lack of space. The Harvard-UH study refutes a prior study which concluded there was no difference in performance between students in and out of the program. The former study, however, compared the low-income minority students in the choice program with a cross-section of Milwaukee students more than twice as wealthy.  The latest study provides a more accurate comparison.<p><B> New Yorkers start CEF-style program</B><p>Low-income parents in Albany, Schenectady and Troy are the latest to have the power to select schools they want their children to attend. A group aligned with Change-NY is funding the program called A Better Choice. <p>There are more than 30 privately funded tuition assistance programs in America. Like the CEF, they all depend on you!<br>

Is emphasis on TAAS at the expense of learning? Semi-frugality in school budgets. Punishing unhappy parents. Making the grade regardless.</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> Charter schools are happening in Texas</B><p>The Renaissance Charter School in Irving has opened its doors as the first school of its kind in Texas. Four hundred students are enrolled in this school, a population which includes special education, at-risk, low-income and ESL students.  More than 85% of the educators at Renaissance have Masters degrees and 30% are doctorates or doctoral candidates. Each student at Renaissance is a career and technology student.  Children from seven districts will attend the new school. The Dallas CAN! Academy, is scheduled to open in September.  Dallas CAN! already operates a half-day program for dropouts<br>Starting a charter school in Texas is not easy.  The timing of funding makes it difficult to secure leases and have equipment and supplies ready for students.  Furthermore, there is no provision in Texas law to pay for capital costs related to charter schools. Charter schools are public school free to be managed at the campus level.<p><B> Is emphasis on TAAS at the expense of learning?</B><p>Reading scores of  Dallas school district students taking the Iowa Basic Skills Test declined in every grade but one last year.  Only sixth graders showed year-over-year improvement in reading on the national test.  No DISD grade level scored above 50 in 1996, the national average for the Iowa test. Math scores were mixed with some grades showing improvement, however, the highest score in math was 54.4 by Dallas 4th graders. <br>According to a newspaper report, even district researchers admitted that an accountability system which focuses solely on the TAAS test results in the TAAS being heavily emphasized.  Some Texas parents have been critical of time spent on preparing for the TAAS test at the expense of other studies.<br> <br><B> Semi-frugality in school budgets</B><p>The Dallas Catholic Diocese employs about 8 part time and full workers to oversee its school district of 14,000 students.  Recently, the Dallas public school system announced it was cutting 62 central administrative positions in the interest of fiscal responsibility. The DISD has 10 times as many students as the Catholic schools, indicating that the district would employ 80 central office personnel if the district was as efficient as the Diocese.  Yet, the DISD cuts alone involve 8 times as many positions as required to operate the entire Catholic Diocese.<br>Offsetting part of the districts savings is the hiring of a deputy superintendent, a chief of staff and the re-assignment of two high level administrators, actions that will cost taxpayers more than $400,000.  Some board members told the Dallas Morning News they believed central administrative costs could be cut further. <br>Are big city school districts simply too large to be efficient and accountable?<p><B> Punishing unhappy parents</B><p>Parents caught intentionally enrolling their children in the wrong school district are subject to a $500 fine in Illinois.  Have Illinois politicians considered what is causing such widespread dissatisfaction that it takes a law to make parents behave?<p><B> Making the grade regardless</B><p>School officials in Summerville, Mass. are proposing eliminating failing grades and converting numerical grades to A,B and C. Under the proposal even letter grades would be downplayed  and more weight placed on progress reports. Such thinking runs counter to Americans thirst for more, not less, accountability from school officials, teachers and students. <br>

George Bush is taking Texans' pulse on how we feel about property taxes.  Because property taxes have been increasingly relied upon to pay for government schooling in Texas, any change in the property tax structure will likely impact public education in some way.  While we are reconsidering the property tax, why not consider other topics relating to education?  For example:<p><LI>Is a school system which ignores the realities of modern life such as dual working parents and single parents adequate for the 21st Century?<br><LI>Is a centralized, bureaucratic management style appropriate for a system that exhibits few if any economies of scale?<br><LI>Is such a system equipped to manage the varied needs of individual campuses within its district?  <br><LI>If we know that children learn differently, why are all schools structured the same?<br><LI>Based on the rewards offered, why is there a much stronger incentive for a teacher to be an administrator than to be an excellent teacher?<br><LI>Are the primary beneficiaries of education policy the employees or the customers?<br><LI>Is a state funded system equipped to adequately assess the performance of its own schools?<br><LI>Are "inputs" such as number of counselors, student to teacher ratios, and content of  textbooks emphasized at the expense of results?<br><LI>Based on the track record of the last 40 years, to what degree should decisions regarding education be divided among appointed and elected officials versus teachers and parents?<br><LI>Can the performance of Texas public school children be readily compared with children in private schools or in other states?<br><LI>Are athletics emphasized at the expense of academics?<br><LI>Is the traditional model of the large junior high and even larger high school effective today?   <P>Based on a speech by Chester E.

Demand swamps supply for Cleveland voucher program. Change in the wind?</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> Local enrollment growth serves as reminder alternatives are available</B><p>The eight new schools in Dallas largest school district will not be enough to house all new incoming students this year.  The Dallas ISD enrolled 149,000 students last year, but expects 5,000 more in the fall.  To handle the influx of students the district plans to install 46 portable classrooms to supplement capacity from the new schools.  Another 76 portables will be moved to other campuses. As bond issues are proving increasingly unpopular with voters, school districts will be called upon to manage resources more efficiently. As schools become larger, some big city school districts are learning that breaking large schools into smaller schools can improve results.  In addition, new Texas law allows the formation of charter schools on or off of existing campuses. One unexpected result of the charter movement could be to effectively increase the capacity of their school districts.  As more charter schools form away from existing campuses, more spots open up in traditional public schools.<p><B> Clevelands pilot vouchers awarded to low-income applicants as demand swamps supply for state funded program</B><p>Fifteen percent of eligible Cleveland elementary students applied for state vouchers available under a new pilot program.  Under the new plan, 27,500 students entering grades K-3 could apply for 1,500 vouchers worth $2,250 each.  The 1,500 students receiving the vouchers can use them to attend the school of their choice. Of the more than 6,200 students applying for the program, 3,423 applicants were considered economically disadvantaged.  Because Ohio law requires low-income students to be given priority in the lottery for vouchers, all students receiving vouchers were from low -income families. Half of low-income applicants did not receive a voucher. The pilot program is the first time publicly funded vouchers have been available in Ohio.  <p><B> Change in the wind?</B><p>The number of children being home schooled has jumped from 15-20,000 in the 1970s to an estimated 600,000 today.  This willingness to try a radical new approach to education coupled with inexpensive and powerful educational technology leads Britton Manasco of Reason magazine to believe traditional, one-size-fits-all education is growing obsolete.  Whether more families home school or not, the author believes enhanced technologies such as the Internet, educational software and easy access to research material will continue to encourage alternatives to traditional government-run schools. Manasco also submits that these new technologies are not destined to isolate children. If appropriately used, he believes, technology can bring children and families together to form dance clubs, sports leagues, study groups and specialized classes. The author concludes that as alternatives to traditional schooling become cheaper and more popular, the education establishment will have no alternative but to change.<br>

Research highlights benefits of New York privately funded tuition assistance program.</FONT></A></H3><HR>  <p><B> Study reveals urban minorities benefit most from Catholic schools.</B><p>A November 1995 report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research reveals that those most likely to benefit from a Catholic school education are minorities attending big-city schools.  The papers author, Derek Neal of the University of Chicago, used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and National Catholic Education Association to examine what influence Catholic secondary schools had on graduation rates and subsequent wages.  <p>Mr. Neal concludes there is evidence that while urban whites and suburban students can benefit from secondary Catholic schools in terms of future wages and graduation prospects, benefits are measurably greater for urban minorities.  Among urban blacks and Hispanics the probability of graduating from high school rises from .62 to at least .88 when the representative public school student is placed in a Catholic secondary school.   Also, urban minorities attending Catholic schools experience higher college graduation rates and higher future wages.  Such results, the author concludes, indicate there is larger disparity between the quality of urban public and Catholic schools than between public and Catholic schools in rural areas or suburbs.<p>The study also found that Catholic secondary schools are already concentrated in urban areas, indicating that resources are already in place to assist urban school children.<p><B> Research highlights benefits of New York privately funded tuition assistance program</B><p>In the June edition of the Phi Delta Kappan a research professor at the University of Washingtons School of Public Affairs discusses his study of the Student-Sponsor Partnership Program in New York City.  Under the program, sponsors pay the tuition for low-income minority students to attend New Yorks Catholic high schools. The study compared the educational experiences of these students with those enrolled in traditional New York City public schools. Among the findings: <p><UL><LI>Partnership  schools (the private schools) have a strong incentive to have a clear mission statement which is easy to explain to parents.  This requires campus administrators to focus on what children will experience rather than subtleties of education technique.<br><LI>Once a Partnership school has established an identity, the staff has strong incentive to avoid upheaval.<br><LI>Demands of economic survival make teachers concerned about performance of the school as a whole.<br><LI>Staff members know keeping their jobs depends on their own performance, making them quick to seek advice from co-workers.<br><LI>Most children have a strong incentive to succeed in school to avoid upheaval at home (due to the inconvenience of changing schools).<br><LI>Parents who choose a school implicitly give that school a grant of parental authority which increases the schools leverage over its students.</UL><br>Likewise, Partnership schools have leverage in dealing with parents.<br>Bullet^<LI>Partnership schools have no reluctance to make demands on parents.<br><LI>Partnership schools are confident in calling upon parents to play an important role in their childrens lives.<br><LI>Higher income parents who have the capacity to remove their children from public schools are most likely to develop close relationships with teachers and administrators.  Low-income parents who have little choice over schools seldom have strong feelings of loyalty toward compulsory attendance schools. Partnership schools, however, often provide a sense of commitment enabling them to earn loyalty.<br><LI>Students in Partnership schools often benefit from the schools need to create a defined image and reputation.<br><LI>Students gain from being a situation requiring them to make commitments. <br><LI>Students are more susceptible to being influenced by a chosen school.<br><LI>Partnership schools gain leverage over students as they accept the schools demands.<br><LI>For the majority of Partnership school students, the need to stick to their commitments influenced their behavior and changed their attitudes.^<br>For students who seldom observe any adults other than teachers at work, the message these adults send is a powerful one. Teachers in compulsory attendance schools who feel they have little control over conditions of their work send a far different message than teachers linked in a common enterprise.<br>

Mandates up, state support down </FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B>  American mayors enter fight to improve schools. Tired of watching middle-class flee, mayors seek solutions.</B>  <p>Understanding that urban problems such as juvenile crime, unemployment and economic development are not unrelated to sub-par urban schools, mayors are taking action.  Although school boards  are traditionally in charge of these vast big city school systems, some urban leaders are no longer content to watch from the sidelines. In fact, those attending a recent mayors conference in Cleveland vowed to concentrate more on school-related problems including crime, truancy, discipline, job training and even changes in curriculum.<br>Cleveland Mayor Michael White, tired of being foiled by the elected school board ran a slate of candidates to gain more control over school policies. Chicago Mayor Richard Dailey has been the most aggressive of his peers in addressing school-related problems. Last year he received the go-ahead from the legislature to take over Chicagos schools.  Today that school system is being run by a board appointed by (and accountable to) the mayor. Mayor Dailey believes good schools will bring Chicago a competitive advantage over other big cities.<p><B> NBA support is a slam dunk for inner-city kids</B><p>Representatives from four NBA basketball teams have helped expand opportunity for urban school children.  The Orlando Magic Youth Foundation recently committed $30,000 for tuition assistance in Central Florida.  In San Antonio, the foundation of Spur star David Robinson presented the San Antonio private scholarship plan with a check for $20,000.  Meanwhile, in Arizona, the Phoenix Suns Charities pledged $20,000 for privately funded scholarships in Phoenix.  Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkins was one of the original board members of Atlantas Childrens Education Foundation. The coachs fervent support for academic excellence helped the Atlanta program become a success.  Coach Wilkens recently retired from the Atlanta foundations board.<p><B> Mandates up, state support down</B><p>Local school districts have been increasingly forced to comply with the state unfunded mandates which have helped drive the cost of public education higher in Texas.  As state mandates have increased, however, the states share of total school funding has been reduced.<br>

Homeowners share of school taxes continues to grow.</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> Good news, bad news and cooking the books</B><p>First the good news.   Fewer students in Texas are failing the state-mandated TAAS exam these days, and improvement is being made in Dallas schools as well.  A couple of years ago more than half of DISD students in grades 3-8 failed the TAAS.  The latest results show that more than half of Dallas students are now passing the exam, including 70% of sixth graders and 54% of eighth graders.  The bad news is that given the emphasis placed on the TAAS, too many students are still failing the test.  Only 53% of eighth graders passed the social studies exam.  Meanwhile, third and fourth grade reading scores actually fell.  Perhaps most troubling of all, a whopping 16,000 Dallas students have not taken (and will not take) the 1996 TAAS. Thats 25% percent of DISD students who are exempt from the TAAS.  Such a large number of exemptions distorts TAAS results and sends the wrong message to children who are told not to bother with the states exam. <p><B> Homeowners share of school taxes continues to grow</B><p>In fiscal 1992 taxes on residential property accounted for 37.72%of all school taxes.  By fiscal 1995, residential property taxes represented 43.52% percent of the total. The Citizens Commission on Property Tax Relief is holding hearings across the state on the subject of property tax relief.<br>Not only is the homeowner (who is responsible for about 90% of all residential property taxes) paying a larger share of property taxes, the property tax itself has been increasingly relied upon to fund school district budgets.  For example, in the 1984-85 school year, state aid represented 52.2% of state and local school revenues.  But by 1995-96, the states share of funding fell to 46.8%.  While this shift in funding has occurred, total spending for education has grown rapidly.  State and local spending on education totaled $8.7 billion in 1984-85 but will rise to an expected $17.9 billion by 1996-97.  Property taxes per student have also grown rapidly, especially in the 1980s.<p><br>

Ex-superintendent starts institute for education reform. Teachers say Feds dont know best about special needs children. Is violence on the increase? Ask the teachers.</FONT></A></H3><HR> <p><B> U.S. produces the worlds least efficient schools</B><p>Based on money spent and results obtained, America is the least efficient of the industrialized nations in teaching reading. This is the conclusion reached by education professor Herbert J. Walberg of the University of Illinois and Joseph L. Bast, president of the Heartland Institute. According to the pair, the U.S. does a good job of getting children ready for school.  The language mastery of Americas preschool students has steadily improved over the years.  Even 9-year-old American students are second only to children from Finland in their ability to read.  The bad news is, the longer the U.S. education system has our children the further they lag behind our international competitors. <p>For example, American students progress in reading between the age of  9 and 14 was the worst among 16 nations based on a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Despite their slow progress, the U.S. spends more per primary school student than 13 other countries (Cost data were not available for three nations). This combination of high spending and slow improvement makes the U.S. school system the least efficient of those studied.<p><B> Ex-superintendent starts institute for education reform</B><p>Former Milwaukee school superintendent Howard Fuller has opened the Institute for the Transformation of Learning at Marquette University.  The institutes goal is to fundamentally change the way learning is approached in the United States.  According to Fuller, Americas current education system is designed to serve the needs of 19th Century industrial America. The institute will promote a re-thinking of the entire system.  This summer the institute will open two neighborhood-based learning centers in Milwaukee inner-city churches.  These neighborhood centers will make information technology available to many of the citys poorest children.<p><B> Teachers say Feds dont know best about special needs children.</B><p>Once again, teachers know one policy doesnt suit every child A survey of 1,500 teachers by a leading Texas teacher association revealed that 68% of teachers with special education children in their classrooms dont believe the federally mandated practice of "inclusion" is working.   Inclusion means placing special education children in the traditional classroom regardless of a childs particular needs or the teachers abilities and training.  Unfortunately, what benefits some children has been imposed universally. Teachers say they are not trained to teach these children and that inclusion takes teaching time away from traditional classroom activities. <p>Certainly, for too long children with special needs were completely isolated from other children, often to their determent.  But now the pendulum has swung too far the other direction, thanks to federal government intervention.  The new policy pays no heed to parents wishes or school resources and capabilities.  And paperwork pertaining to special education students is never-ending.   Parents who want their children "mainstreamed" in the regular classroom should be paired with teachers who are gifted (and trained) in that area. Parents who understand that their child needs to spend as much time as possible with a special education professional should have that option as well.  That means less attention should be placed on rigidity, attendance zones and one-size-fits-all policies.  More emphasis  should be put on doing what works to educate our children.<p><B> Is violence on the increase? Ask the teachers</B><p>Almost three quarters of Texas teachers say violence is on the increase in their districts.  This 72% figure has not changed since teachers were asked the same question in 1994.<br>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15>  June 7, 1996 -- New math subtracts from educational excellence. New solutions not higher taxes. Is &quot;site-based decision making&quot; a hoax?</FONT></A></H3></A>
<H4><B>New math subtracts from educational excellence</B></H4>
<P> Math instruction isn't adding up in California.  In 1994, more than 50 percent of freshmen in California state universities needed remedial help in the subject, up from about 30 percent in 1989.  This in part reflects the long term downward trend in math aptitude nationally.  SAT math scores in the U.S. have fallen from 492 to 478 over three decades.  Half of math students in Japan do as well as the top 5 percent of math students in America.  </P>
<P>California has long tried to boost student performance by tinkering with curriculum. The latest change was undertaken in 1992.  But the new standards do not add up.  Rather than emphasizing competence in math, the new math focuses on cooperative work, discussion groups, exploration of chance of use of calculators and computers.  Whatever happened to multiplication and fractions?  </P>
<P>Proponents of the new math argue that the approach beats the old school of drill, drill, drill.  The problem with that argument, however,  is that California's math curriculum has been moving away from, not towards, old fashioned ciphering for years.</P>
<P>Some parents who are finding that their children can't do math without a calculator are fed up.  In Vista, Calfornia parents protested when the new math books emphasized group work over simple problem solving.   But at least one text book publisher is investing in back to basics.  Saxon Publishers is giving away $10 million in text books in an attempt to promote real math instead of the squishy stuff.  Thus far, those who use the Saxon texts are getting results.  A Georgia school system jumped from 53rd in the state in math to first using books from the old fasioned publisher.   Yet, in the Golden State, all math books must meet the new criteria, so Saxon's books are banned. This combination of watered down curriculum and centralized (vs. local) decision-making regarding text book selection is a great way to ensure failure.</P>
<H4><B>New solutions not higher taxes</B></H4>
<P> Although the total property tax levy has increased from $3.6 billion in 1984 to $9.0 billion in 1995, a leading teachers' association is calling for members to be vocal in their support of further tax increases and new bond issues (ATPE News, Summer 1996).  The group has legitimate concerns about classroom overcrowding but is relying on the same old solutions for improvement.   </P>
<P>Education reforms which encourage the private sector to absorb the increasing student populations can ease the burden on overtaxed Texans while providing expanding educational opportunities for all children. </P>
<H4><B>Is &quot;site-based decision making&quot; a hoax?</B></H4>
<P>&quot;Site-based decision making&quot; is all the rage.  The idea is to allow those closest to the children - parents, teachers and principals - the freedom to run their own public schools. That's  a great idea if those concerned have real ability to make decisions that matter.</P>
<P>Site-based decision making was born in 1993 in a bit of legislative irony. That's when  Texas lawmakers mandated that schools run their own show. Almost half of teachers, however, say the idea is not working.  Forty-five percent of teachers in a recent poll said they did not think site-based decision making is, or will be effective.  This makes the idea suspect that teachers and parents are suddenly empowered. </P>
<P>It is more effective to remove constraints than legislate freedom. </P>

<H4><B>New charter schools don&#146;t fit the traditional mold (That&#146;s the point, of course</B></H4>
<P>The State Board of Education has approved 20 Open Enrollment charter schools.  Under the new legislation, 20 such schools are allowed to open their doors in Texas.  All 20 openings have now been filled.  There were at least 14 schools competing for the final four slots. </P>
<P>Charter schools are public schools which are allowed to be managed at the campus level.  Charter schools can be authorized by the local school district (local charters) or by the state (Open Enrollment). </P>
<P>Here&#146;s some information about some of these new schools.  These are by no means traditional &quot;one size fits all&quot; campuses.</P>
<P>George I. Sanchez Charter School -Houston.  Will serve 300 students in grades 9-12 in an area where 80 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch, and where 50 percent of ninth graders drop out before graduating. </P>
<P>&#149; Raul Yzaquirre&#146;s School for Success - Houston. Students in grades 7 and 8 will be taught in one classroom rather than changing classes several times each day.  A minimum of 90 minutes each day will be spent on reading, language arts and grammar.  Community members will serve as mentors for students.</P>
<P>&#149; One-Stop Multi-service Charter School - Mission.  The school is for children in grades 7-12  who will be referred to the school through the local juvenile probation system.</P>
<P>&#149; Academy of Transitional Studies - Corpus Christi.  Students will include high school students who are discipline problems and are behind academically.</P>
<P>&#149; Girls and Boys Prep School - Houston.  Boys and girls will be taught in separate classrooms and there will be no competitive sports with outside campuses.  Academic courses will allow for competition in debate, journalism, dance, theater and arts.</P>
<P>&#149; Genesis Charter High School - Dallas. In addition to their studies, students will have to complete 100 hours of community service.</P>
<H4><B>Half of Texas freshman lack basic skills</B></H4>
<P>Almost 50 percent of college freshmen in state schools failed the Texas Academic Skills Program test last year.  The test, which measures basic academic skills, was administered to 132,000 students in state universities and community colleges in Texas.  The passing rate of 51.6 percent for the 1994-95 school year compares to a passing rate of 65.1 percent in the prior year. Because of the poor results, the Texas Higher Education Commission has postponed making the test more difficult. The TASP test was mandated by the Texas Legislature after a study showed that one in four college freshmen lacked the skills necessary to take college courses. The Texas Higher Education Commission is considering releasing the names of school districts whose graduates are failing the TASP in large numbers.</P>
<H4><B>Fort Worth group advocates forming black-only school district </B></H4>
<P>Frustrated with the performance of black students in Fort Worth schools, a group working under the name of Operation Home School Rule wants to form a separate school district. The move is possible under a new state law if 10 percent registered voters approve the split and a special election okays the plan.  Only 32 percent of African-American school children in Fort Worth passed all sections of the TAAS in 1995. Disappointed with these results, the organizers vow to seek an alternative. </P>

<H4><B>Today Foundation recognizes innovative public schools</B></H4>
<P>The Today Foundation (the parent organization of the Children&#146;s Education Fund) has chosen  five winners for its Innovative Public School Award.  This award is designed to recognized those campuses, districts and communities that have found solutions at the local level to their own particular problems.  The winners will receive a certificate and a cash award of $1,000.  </P>
<P>The winners are presented below:  </P>
<P>1.  Allison Elementary School - Austin ISD A group of teachers organized the Early Bird Reading Club to address the problem of students arriving early while improving reading skills.  Often, these working parents had no choice but to drop their kids off at school before the doors opened. The school has in effect added a half hour to an hour to the school day, and students have become hooked on reading as well.   </P>
<P>2.  Lazbuddie High School - Lazbuddie ISD Although academics should be the number one priority at every school, all too often athletics come first.   Lazbuddie High School started an organization called CLASS to recognize high achieving students in academics. More than a program, CLASS is school wide effort to make scholastics a priorty. As a result of CLASS, the school became the Regional Literary Champion, and by 1993 Lazbuddie was the Runner-Up State Champion.  The school has had the State Champion Accounting Team and Computer Team for the last three years. Prior to CLASS, the school entered only four students in UIL competitions. In the last two years, students have earned more than $165,000 in scholarships and this year they have already earned $127,000.  And this is for a graduating class of 28. </P>
<P>3.  Pearsall Summer Youth Program - Pearsall ISD A major problem in the city was increasing gang membership and influx of drugs from nearby Mexico.  The problem was exacerbated in the summer months when young people were left unsupervised.  To address these problems, a cross section of the community including ministers, school officials, probation officers and police created the Pearsall Summer Youth Program. The program takes advantage of resources already existing in the community, such as the library, churches and schools, and serves students from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 6 days a week. The summer program provides a variety of activities, including classroom instruction.  Last summer participation was high, crime was down and attention to academics was up. </P>
<P>4.  Coyote Club, Carl Schurz Elementary - New Braunfels ISD One school  teacher began coaching kids who could not afford to participate in Little League baseball.  But Craig soon discovered these boys needed to learn more than how to swing a bat.  He began &#147;coaching&#148; them in academics after school as well.   Eventually Craig and his wife Vicky began to regularly help a group of boys in grades 4-8 with homework.  They provided them with equipment to play sports as well.  This shoe string program has grown to the extent that the local Chamber of Commerce is taking over the program four days each week. </P>
<P>5.  Puppy P.A.W.S. Child Development Center - Bosqueville ISD (Waco) This program is the brainchild of a Home Economics teacher who saw the need for more child care facilities and the need for more opportunities in vocational education.  The result is pre-school open to the community that also serves as a lab for students who want to pursue a career in early childhood development. </P>
<P>The Center provides a preschool program for all students regardless of income or disability from 8 to noon.  The Center also provides an enrichment program from noon to 3:30 and extended day care to 5:30.  Parents pay a fee for extended services. </P>
<P>The opening of the Center coincided with student training in the area of Early Childhood Professions.  It was offered as an elective to juniors and seniors in high school.  Students who receive credit in the class can continue the program at the local college. Plans are for the Center to serve 60 kids in the fall of 1996.  </P>

<H4><B>Huge gap exists between administrative and teacher salaries  </B></H4>
<P>The average central office administrator in Texas major urban school districts makes 96 percent more than those on the front lines of education.  This information is from the publication of school district profiles produced by the Texas Education Association which covers the 1994-95 school year.   In that edition, the average salary of urban central office administrators was $61,221 vs. $31,095 for teachers.  Average salaries of teachers were also below those of professional support staff.  In Dallas, central office administrators recently received a pay hike averaging 9 percent compared to a 4 percent raise approved for other school employees.  Some administrators recently received raises of as much as 20 percent.  These raises put the salaries of top DISD administrators well above $80,000 annually.  Meanwhile, average hourly earnings for all Americans rose 3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.   </P>

<H4><B>Catholic school district manages to avoid bureaucracy</B></H4>
<P>Schools in the Dallas Diocese teach approximately 14,000 student, more than many school districts in Texas.  Because individual Catholic campuses operate with significant autonomy, there is no need for large centralized management.  In fact, only five full-time central office administrators are required to oversee the education of 14,000 students.  Additional central office help includes 3 consultants and three secretaries (one of them part time).  The Dallas School District has approximately 10 times as many students as the Catholic Diocese.  However, there are about 175 central office professionals in the D.I.S.D., or 22 times as many central office professionals.   In other words, including consultants, there are 0.57 central office professionals per 1,000 Catholic students in the Dallas Diocese.  In the D.I.S.D. there are about 1.2 central office professionals per 1,000 D.I.S.D. students. </P>
<P>Perhaps because principals at Catholic campuses, not central administrators, make most campus decisions, it costs less to educate a child attending a Dallas Diocese school.  For example, it costs $2,000 to $2,500 to educate a student at a Dallas Catholic school.  (This is actual cost, not tuition, which is generally set below the actual cost.)  The total operating cost at D.I.S.D., however, is $4,659 per student.  </P>

<H4><B>Teachers&#146; being overruled </B></H4>
<P>A survey by a Texas teachers group reveals that school administrators continue to &#147;socially promote&#148; students that teachers have failed.  Almost 40 percent of the 2,132 teachers who responded to the survey reported such promotions.   The teachers group, the Texas Federation of Teachers, estimates that 130,000 Texas public school students were sent to the next grade level despite failing grades.</P>
<H4><B>From the bookshelf</B></H4>
<P>&#147;Dumbing Down Our Kids&#148; by Charles J. Sykes explains why American children feel good about themselves but can&#146;t read or write.  The book documents the collapse of standards in American schools, details the consequences of educational fads and tracks the &#147;dumbing down&#148; of curriculum during a period of expanding school budgets.  But &#147;Dumbing Down&#148; is not an indictment of American education, or a condemnation of teachers.  The book explains the educational philosophies which have led American students down a path of limited learning.  The author also praises schools that work and discusses</P>
<P>the coming (and on-going) revolution in education.</P>
<P>Facts from &#147;Dumbing Down Our Kids&#148;:</P>
<P>&#149; One-third of American 17-year-olds are not required to do homework on a daily basis.</P>
<P>&#149; Only one in five 9-year-olds can perform basic mathematical computations.</P>
<P>&#149; Fifteen percent of college faculty say their students are adequately prepared for their math courses.</P>
<P>&#149; American businesses spend $30 billion a year on worker training.</P>
<P>&#149; American productivity and test scores have declined almost simultaneously. The author also claims that Goals 2000, which was signed into law in 1994, creates new layers of bureaucracy, including the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, the National Skills Standards Board, the National Occupational Information Coordination Committee, and the National Education Dissemination System.  In addition, many of the goals are non-academic, including new national standards for spending levels, teacher salaries and other mandates or &#147;in-puts.&#148;  </P>
<P>Sykes claims schools that work have a campus-wide concern about reading skills, use reading specialists, emphasize a phonics-based curriculum, pay close attention to individual student reading interests, and carefully evaluate progress of their pupils.</P>
<H4><B>U.S. News investigates low education standards</B></H4>
<P>In the April 1 edition of U.S. News and World Report, the magazine takes a look at education and standards.  The recent interest in higher standards comes from widespread conviction that students can do better.  Only one-third of high school seniors mastered the NAEP reading test in 1994. Only 11 percent had a good grasp of history.  Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, says students are performing far below their capabilities.  Three quarters of respondents to a U.S. News poll said standards should be raised.  The unresolved question is how.  National standards are fraught with political agendas and watering down of curriculum.  State standards have given us an unhealthy focus on the TAAS test.</P>
<P>Other U.S. News findings:</P>
<P>&#149; High school students in Japan, France and Germany spend twice as many hours</P>
<P>&#149; studying math, history and science as U.S. kids.</P>
<P>&#149; 78% of high school seniors spend less than 5 hours per week on homework.</P>
<P>&#149; Only one-third of Japanese students spend so little time studying.</P>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15>  March 20, 1996 -- News on charter schools </FONT></A></H3></A>
<H4><B>News on charter schools </B></H4>
<P>Data gathered from charter schools in Michigan indicates that these new kinds of schools are expanding educational opportunities for minority children.  Thirty-one percent of recently opened charter schools in the state were started by African-Americans.   Blacks represent almost 40 percent of students in charter schools,  versus 16 percent of public school enrollment.</P>
<P>One example of these locally managed charters is Sankofa Shule in Lansing. The school was founded by a former public school teacher who acts as the new school&#146;s principal, language arts teacher, and janitor.   The school has 132 students.  One of the many unique features about the school is the way they</P>
<P>handle discipline problems.  Instead of sending students home, they &#147;suspend&#148; parents from work.  When the student misbehaves, the parent must spend an entire day with their child at school. It is estimated that there are about 400 private, religious and charter schools created by African-Americans.</P>
<P>Study reveals privately funded choice succeeding in Indiana The Educational Choice Charitable Trust in Indiannapolis was the first privately funded scholarship program in the nation.  The program was founded</P>
<P>in 1991 and served as the inspiration for similar programs, including the CEF.  The Hudson Institute has performed research on students particpating in the ECCT program, and has also gathered information on students who applied for ECCT assistance but remained on waiting lists due to funding restraints.</P>
<P>Among the findings: </P>
<P>&#149; Ninety percent of parents who chose to move their children to a private school with help from ECCT reported they were satisfied or very satisfied.</P>
<P>&#149; Parents ranked safety as the most important factor in moving their child to a new school.</P>
<P>&#149; As in all privatley funded scholarship plans, there are instances where families drop out of the program for financial reasons.  However, the Hudson study revealed that families in the lowest income bracket are no more likely to leave the program than other families.  (Our own interpretation of this data is that the real heroes in America are these determined parents struggling to help their children get a better education.) </P>
<P>&#149;  It also appears single mothers are no more likely to leave the program than two-parent families.</P>
<P>&#149; Although families with the lowest incomes are no more likely to leave the Inidanappolis scholarship program, financial pressure is by far the most common reason for any parent to remove their child from the program.</P>
<P>&#149; An analysis of test scores from Indinapolis public schools and children who had taken advantage of the ECCT program revealed that the choice students in the critical grades 6-8 did not experience the severe drop in test scores as did public school students (including those who had applied for ECCT assitance, but remained on waiting lists). </P>
<P>We conclude that the ECCT program, like the CEF, is making a difference in children&#146;s lives today.</P>

<H4><B>Beware of an insider subversion of charter schools</B></H4>
<P>It has been revealed to the CEF that some Austin bureaucrats may attempt to thwart the establishment of charter schools by claiming such schools violate federal desegregation orders.  Under the letter of the federally imposed law, minorities may not represent more than 65 percent of the student body</P>
<P>of any school in Texas.  We expect a large number of charter school applications to come from inner-city minority communities.  The innovators from these communities know what it takes for their own children to succeed.  Yet, it is possible that the charter schools trying to create opportunities for minority children will be labeled in violation of the desegregation order.</P>
<H4><B>Study reveals Dallas children skipping school</B></H4>
<P>A report by the League of Women Voters of Dallas argues that not enough is being done to discourage children from skipping school.  The study notes that juvenile crime in Dallas has trended upward for years.  It also points out that half of youths who complete juvenile programs re-offend within 18</P>
<P>months.  According to the study, the current system is failing because:</P>
<P>&#149; Truants have discovered how to fool school officials.</P>
<P>&#149; School officials do not always follow up on truancy cases.</P>
<P>&#149; Parents refuse to take responsibility for their children.</P>
<P>&#149; Justice of the peace courts do not accept filings for truancy.</P>
<P>&#149; The juvenile department does not pursue truancy cases.</P>
<P>&#149; School officials don&#146;t file cases.</P>
<P>The study concludes, &#147;clearly something is wrong.&#148;  After years of neglect, however, school and juvenile policies toward truancy seem to be improving. For example, the district has assigned 18 truancy officers to file cases instead of the one representing the district previously.</P>

We thought you might be interested in seeing the comparison of the two sets of figures. <p>Jim Seibert's salary INCREASE ALONE is MORE than a teacher with an M.Ed at the top of salary scale makes in terms of years of experience -including benefits!!  Must be nice to give yourself a raise! He has been under an awful lot of pressure this year from those challengers.....he's probably earned it!! (Just kidding!!) <p>And....it appears in order to afford these raises - they needed to increase the dues by $21.00/year for each member. We have sent an e-mail to members to verify that this raise is a statewide assessment. The previous dues increase was $4,. and the one before that was $12 for the Community Educating monies!! <p>A thought that has crossed our minds is: is this increase to pay for the debt created by the NO! on 177-173 Committee? <p>We can hardly wait until we can see their books!! <p>Our best to each of you! Thanks for all you do!<p>Barb and Cindy<p>1996-97 WEA INFO UPDATE: <br>^bSALARIES AND DUES INCREASE^<p>SALARIES ( BASED ON FIGURES OBTAINED FROM PDC REPORTS)<p>WEA BOARD/LOBBYIST   1995     1996-97  INCREASE<p>JUDITH HARTMAN       $75,635  $78,684  +$3,049<br>ROBERT FISCHER       $85,200           RETIRED<br>KAREN DAVIS          $75,635  NA         <br>ROBERT MAIER         $73,243  $78,684  +$5,443<br>LENORE VEST          $36,96   NA<br>CT PURDOM            $99,120  $120,895  +$21,775<br>LEANN PREILIPP       $81,496  $98,536   +$17,040<br>JAMES SEIBERT        $99,180  $144,832  +$45,712<p>KRISTEEN HANSELMAN <br>(hired for: "NO ON 173-177")   $99,840<br>ROD REGAN<br>(TOOK PLACE OF ROBT.

The WEA is ruining<br>the reputations and credibility of the honest, hard-working teachers through<br>its corrupt activity. <p>The union is using money that it collects illegally from teachers, and then<br>it is illegally funding candidates and campaigns.  This destroys the<br>public's right to free and fair elections, the essential foundation for the<br>protection of our freedoms. By violating state law and the constitutional<br>rights of teachers, it is making a complete mockery of our democracy.<p>I ask that you prosecute and levy the MAXIMUM penalty allowed by law.  This<br>will discipline the out-of-control union leadership and send a strong<br>message to other political organizations that our rights as teachers and<br>citizens cannot be thwarted by those who hold us in contempt.<p>Thank you for your attention to bringing justice to Washington.

<BR>

<P>
I.
<P>
BACKGROUND<BR>
<BR>

<P>
STRUCTURE<BR>

<P>
The Washington Education Association (WEA)is a union of education
employees
<P>
in Washington State with approximately 65,000 members.<BR>

<P>
The WEA is a state affiliate of the National Education Association
(NEA).<BR>

<P>
The WEA structure includes 22 UniServ Councils and 330 local education
<P>
associations. A UniServ Council is a regional affiliate of the
WEA. A
<P>
local education association is an affiliate of the WEA and NEA.
The
<P>
UniServ Council provides services to the local association.<BR>

<P>
An education employee cannot be a member of the NEA without paying
dues to
<P>
the NEA, the WEA, the local association and the UniServ Council.
Dues for
<P>
WEA membership are based on a percentage of the average classroom
teacher=ED=
<P>
s
<P>
salary as defined by the WEA constitution and Bylaws.<BR>

<P>
Educational employees who do not wish to be members of the organizations
<P>
can pay Agency Shop Fees.<BR>

<P>
Agency Fee Payers pay a percentage of the National, State, UniServ
and
<P>
Local dues. Political action contributions (NEA-PAC/WEA-PAC) and
Community
<P>
Outreach dues are not deducted from Agency Fee Payers wages.<BR>

<P>
The WEA employs 140 full-time staff and is headquartered at 33434
8th
<P>
Avenue South in Federal Way, Washington. The WEA also has offices
in
<P>
Olympia and Spokane, Washington.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
POLITICAL ACTION<BR>

<P>
The Washington Education Association Political Action Committee
(WEA-PAC)
<P>
is the registered political action arm of the WEA.<BR>

<P>
The National Education Association Political Action Committee
(NEA-PAC) is
<P>
the federally registered political action arm of the NEA.<BR>

<P>
WEA-PAC was created by the WEA and became effective September
1, 1994.<BR>

<P>
Prior to September 1, 1994 the political action arm of the WEA
was
<P>
Political Unity Leaders in State Education (PULSE). PULSE dues
were $13.00
<P>
annually and were in addition to the dues paid to the WEA, the
NEA, the
<P>
local and the UniServ councils.<BR>

<P>
School district payroll offices collected the PULSE dues which
were
<P>
then distributed to the WEA.<BR>

<P>
The PULSE dues were collected automatically unless a WEA member
requested
<P>
that the money not be taken from their salary or wages.<BR>

<P>
The automatic withholding of wages for PULSE was considered a
=ECreverse=EE
<P>
check-off system.<BR>

<P>
In November of 1992 the voters of Washington State passed Initiative
134
<P>
which, in part, eliminated the =ECreverse=EE check-off option
and required a=
<P>
n
<P>
affirmative annual authorization by WEA members to collect funds
for
<P>
contributions to political committees or for use as political
<P>
contributions.<BR>

<P>
In December of 1992 a task force entitled =ECLife After Initiative
134=EE wa=
<P>
s
<P>
created by the WEA to examine the new law and assess WEA political
action
<P>
options in light of the new regulations.
<P>
CITIZEN COMPLAINTS<BR>

<P>
On February 1, 1996 a formal complaint against the WEA and WEA-PAC
was
<P>
received by the staff of the Public Disclosure Commission.<BR>

<P>
The complaint alleged a violation of RCW 42.17.680 after the WEA
loaned
<P>
WEA-PAC $162,255.00 and began repaying the loan with a new dues
assessment.<BR>

<P>
On February 6, 1996 a second complaint was received also alleging
a
<P>
violation of RCW 42.17.680 claiming that compulsory union dues
were used
<P>
for campaign activity conducted by WEA-PAC. This complaint also
refers to
<P>
the loan and the repayment with the new dues assessment.<BR>

<P>
On March 1, 1996 the staff received a complaint against the WEA
and WEA-PAC
<P>
alleging a violation of RCW 42.17.080 and RCW 42.17.090. This
complaint
<P>
alleged that WEA-PAC, the WEA and Blue Cross of Washington and
Alaska were
<P>
in collusion to circumvent disclosure reporting requirements.
<BR>

<P>
On May 22, 1996 the staff of the PDC received a complaint against
the
<P>
Sedro-Woolley School District and every other school district
in the state
<P>
for an alleged violation of RCW 42.17.680 when they began withholding
$1.00
<P>
per month per WEA member for the WEA Community Outreach Program
without
<P>
annual employee authorization.<BR>

<P>
On August 23, 1996 the staff received a complaint alleging the
WEA violated
<P>
RCW 42.17.680, RCW 42.17.080 and RCW 42.17.090. This complaint
was a
<P>
reiteration of complaints filed previously.<BR>

<P>
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE COMMISSION ACTION<BR>
<BR>

<P>
In 1995 WEA-PAC was scheduled for an audit by the staff of the
PDC.<BR>

<P>
The audit was assigned to Senior Political Finance Specialist
Joe Beck who
<P>
opened the audit on April 15, 1995.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Beck left the employment of the PDC prior to completion of
the audit.<BR>

<P>
The WEA-PAC audit was held until current staff finished their
assigned work
<P>
schedules.<BR>

<P>
Political Finance Specialist for the PDC Mike Moran was assigned
the
<P>
WEA-PAC audit in January of 1996. At that time the scope of the
audit was
<P>
narrowed to include only a review of bank records and invoices
to determine
<P>
accuracy and timeliness of disclosure filings.<BR>

<P>
On March 1, 1996 a letter was sent to Mr. C.T. Purdom requesting
a response
<P>
to a complaint against the WEA alleging that the WEA was trying
to subvert
<P>
campaign finance reform laws by loans made prior to the implementation
of
<P>
Initiative 134.<BR>

<P>
The letter stated that his response would =ECdetermine what further
action
<P>
the commission would pursue=EE.<BR>

<P>
On March 14, 1996 a response to the Purdom letter was received
from Ms.
<P>
Harriet Strasberg indicating the loans were made to reimburse
PULSE for
<P>
administrative and operating overhead. See exhibit #1.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Strasberg wrote that =ECIt was subsequently decided that WEA-PAC
funds
<P>
would not be used to repay the loans. Rather, WEA used internal
funds from
<P>
its community organizing account to repay the WEA general account.=EE
<BR>

<P>
A determination was made by Assistant Director Susan Harris to
not include
<P>
a review of citizens allegations of statutory violations contained
in
<P>
complaints against the WEA and WEA-PAC as part of the audit examination.
<BR>

<P>
At no time did the audit involve the activities of WEA or PULSE.
<BR>

<P>
An exit interview was held on April 5, 1996 in the offices of
the PDC and
<P>
Mr. Moran submitted his report of examination on April 15, 1996.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
CENTRAL ISSUES<BR>
<BR>

<P>
The allegations from the complainants center around two central
points of
<P>
public disclosure law.<BR>

<P>
=46irst, the complainants question the use of a mandatory WEA
dues
<P>
assessments (Community Outreach Funds) without gaining annual
authorization
<P>
by the individual union members.<BR>

<P>
The allegations state that one of the primary purposes of the
new Community
<P>
Outreach assessment was to further the political activity of WEA
and
<P>
WEA-PAC.<BR>

<P>
RCW 42.17.680 would prohibit mandatory assessments to a political
committee
<P>
or for political contributions without an annual authorization
from
<P>
individual members.<BR>

<P>
The second point is the lack of public disclosure of reportable
political
<P>
expenditures by the WEA and WEA-PAC. The allegations question
the
<P>
expenditure of WEA funds to support political committee activity
and that
<P>
such activity has not been disclosed to the public.<BR>

<P>
RCW 42.17.040, RCW 42.17.080 and RCW 42.17.090 requires that political
<P>
committees register and report contributions and expenditures
in a timely
<P>
manner to the Public Disclosure Commission and the appropriate
county
<P>
auditor.<BR>

<P>
Additionally, the issue of potential reportable expenditures in
the area of
<P>
grassroots lobbying and related lobbying activities that would
require
<P>
public disclosure under RCW 42.17.200, RCW 42.17.170 and RCW 42.17.180
was
<P>
explored.<BR>

<P>
Life After 134 Task Force<BR>
<BR>

<P>
CREATION<BR>

<P>
Carla Nuxoll, immediate past president of the WEA, created the
=ECLife After
<P>
134 Task Force=EE in 1992 to examine WEA political options in
light of the
<P>
passage of Initiative 134.<BR>

<P>
Nuxoll stated in her interview under oath (NIO) that the WEA was
interested
<P>
in analyzing the initiative to find out what it meant and wanted
to make
<P>
sure that whatever direction they took would be in line with that
law.<BR>

<P>
I do know this that when we were talking about what we were going
to do
<P>
with 134, we wanted to make sure that what we did was the right
thing.
<P>
That was a primary purpose of that committee, was to analyze it
so we knew
<P>
precisely what we could use money for and what we couldn=EDt uh
out of what
<P>
pots if you will and collection methods we could use money and
what we
<P>
couldn=EDt. (NIO P 10-11)<BR>

<P>
James Seibert, Executive Director of the WEA, stated in an interview
under
<P>
oath (SIO) that the task force was set up to begin assessing how
the WEA
<P>
could continue to be involved in political action and continue
to raise
<P>
political action funds. (SIO P 6)<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that the Life After 134 Task Force was designed to
provide a
<P>
forum for a broad discussion of the way they were doing business.
<BR>

<P>
...Right at the very beginning, that this was an opportunity to
reexamine
<P>
everything that we had been doing organizationally and try to
come up with
<P>
something that was in compliance with what 134 had required, but
at the
<P>
same time trying to reinvigorate at least a feeling of our members
at the
<P>
local level that there was value in the WEA being active in the
political
<P>
process. (SIO P 10)<BR>

<P>
Purdom, President of the WEA, said in an interview under oath
(PIO) that in
<P>
his opinion Initiative 134 was an all out attack on the WEA.<BR>

<P>
Purdom stated that the task force was created to look at changes
occurring
<P>
due to the initiative.<BR>

<P>
Well, the Life After 134 Task Force was appointed to help us come
to grips
<P>
and to understand how Initiative 134 impacted us as an organization,
to
<P>
identify the kinds of changes that we needed to make to be in
compliance
<P>
with that law. (PIO P 5)<BR>

<P>
And<BR>

<P>
One of the functions of the task force was to look at how we might
do
<P>
business in the future, how we might do a better job of, what
process we
<P>
might use in terms of recruiting members. =EBCause it was very
clear that w=
<P>
e
<P>
would need to do an annual sign-up. (PIO P 8)<BR>

<P>
Purdom said that the Life After 134 Task Force looked at the short
and long
<P>
term problems.<BR>

<P>
The Life After 134 Task Force really had two, two chunks of time
they
<P>
looked at. One was the immediate to get us into line and make
sure we
<P>
weren=EDt violating the new law and start getting a handle on
it to try and
<P>
consolidate as much money as we could, and then the second phase
was then
<P>
to look at the long term, how we were going to configure ourselves
for the
<P>
future, both in terms of structure and in terms of how we were
going to go
<P>
about raising funds. (PIO P 32-33)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
=46UNDING SOURCES<BR>

<P>
The first meeting of the Life After 134 Task Force was on February
17, 1993
<P>
with the initial goal to replace PULSE dues with a contingency
assessment
<P>
for =ECcommunity education=EE. See exhibit #1a.<BR>

<P>
The emphasis according to NEA Advisor John Chase was to not lose
revenue
<P>
and to =ECmaintain our continuous structure=EE.<BR>

<P>
Seibert said the task force looked at alternatives to a change
in the dues
<P>
check-off system.<BR>

<P>
Well, one of the major factors, one of the major requirements
of Initiative
<P>
134 was the fact that there was a change from the ability of the
WEA to
<P>
have a reverse dues check-off system for political action activities
to one
<P>
in which we had to sign-up the members every year. And so we talked
about
<P>
a vast array of alternatives on how to do that. (SIO P 8)<BR>

<P>
Robert Maier, Lobbyist for the WEA, said in an interview under
oath (MIO)
<P>
that they were not talking about getting around contribution limits
just
<P>
how to remain politically viable in the face of the Initiative.
(MIO P 15)<BR>

<P>
Maier said that one of the concerns of the Life After 134 Task
Force was
<P>
how to raise money.<BR>

<P>
Well, what we had to deal with was, primarily how to raise money
to
<P>
continue to function as an organization active in the political
world.
<P>
Because the law specifically took away our right to collect dues
by reverse
<P>
dues check-off. (MIO P 4)<BR>

<P>
Don Maekawa, Former Controller/Treasurer of the WEA, said in an
interview
<P>
under oath (MAEIO) that requiring members to sign annual authorizations
was
<P>
a concern of the Life After 134 Task Force.<BR>

<P>
I think there=EDs some charges the committee, or task force were
given
<P>
written charges as to what to do, but essentially, it was to take
a look at
<P>
the impact of Initiative 134 and come up with some recommendations
on how
<P>
we could get past this and continue business as usual without
having a,
<P>
=EBcause potentially it could have really cut down the collection
of our
<P>
PULSE dues. (MAEIO P 9)<BR>

<P>
Discussion at the February 8, 1994 meeting of the Life After I-134
Task
<P>
=46orce, as reflected in the minutes, centered around issues that
were raise=
<P>
d
<P>
by UniServ Councils.<BR>

<P>
The following comments and concerns were voiced:<BR>

<P>
Not willing to have a dues increase.
<P>
$13 too high, should be $10 or $12. It wouldn=EDt look like we
were rolling
<P>
it over.
<P>
Do not like the idea of an annual drive.
<P>
We need a systematic way of generating money.
<P>
It is really only a dues increase for those people who have opted
out of
<P>
PULSE in the past.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
AFFILIATION<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Throughout the minutes of the Life After 134 Task Force there
is a concern
<P>
about exceeding the contribution limits to Legislative and Statewide
<P>
Executive candidates.<BR>

<P>
The April 1993 meeting of the Life After 134 Task Force began
to discuss
<P>
the issue of affiliation.<BR>

<P>
The penalties for failing to comply with the initiative are severe,
we
<P>
suspect. Limitations are interlocking, including all state PACs
and we
<P>
have asked for a formal legal opinion.<BR>

<P>
The concept of the councils closing their existing PAC checking
accounts
<P>
and the WEA doing all the reporting was discussed at the April
meeting.<BR>

<P>
Minutes of the June 21, 1993 meeting of the 134 task force stated
that as
<P>
of a certain date all contributions will be distributed by PULSE.
<BR>

<P>
After November 15, 1993, PULSE will house the hard money and will
<P>
distribute contributions as requested by Council PAC=EDs. Though
PAC=EDs wi=
<P>
ll
<P>
not have to be registered with the PDC, they will continue to
function as
<P>
committees charged with carrying out traditional PAC activities.
<BR>

<P>
Recommendations from the June meeting addressed the affiliation
question.<BR>

<P>
UniServ PAC=EDs will no longer have to report expenditures to
the Public
<P>
Disclosure Commission. WEA=EDs legal Division has determined Initiative
134
<P>
=ECprohibits any contributions from PULSE and from the UPAC=EDs,
which, in t=
<P>
he
<P>
aggregate, would exceed the limits placed on contributions by
Part III,
<P>
Section 4 of I-134.=EE<BR>

<P>
As such, we recommend that councils close their existing PAC checking
<P>
accounts and EITHER add it to their council budget as a soft money
line
<P>
item described earlier OR return the money to PULSE and have it
credited to
<P>
the council=EDs hard money account for 1994.<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that WEA decided they would take on the responsibility
of all
<P>
the reporting because they didn=EDt want to make any mistakes.
<BR>

<P>
But, prior to 134, UniServ Councils had some reporting responsibilities.
<P>
They didn=EDt after 134, because PDC determined that we had to
be a single
<P>
PAC statewide, and so we decided that we would take on the responsibility
<P>
of all the reporting because it was easier for us to make sure
they didn=EDt
<P>
make mistakes, or that they didn=EDt fail to report, that we would
be
<P>
responsible since we were determined to be a single PAC after
134. (SIO P
<P>
13)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Robert Fisher, former Assistant Executive Director for Governmental
<P>
Relations and Political Affairs, said in an interview under oath
(FIO) that
<P>
his biggest concern was both PULSE and local PAC=EDs would contribute
to
<P>
candidates they would go over the limits imposed by Initiative
134. (FIO
<P>
P4)<BR>

<P>
Maier said that they asked the UniServ Councils to disband their
PAC=EDs.<BR>

<P>
I just stated that we wanted to have so that we could make recommendations
<P>
to a system and sort of maintain a statewide, well, not control,
but
<P>
influence or opportunity to talk about how this money should be
used. And
<P>
in the process of that, we asked them to disband their PAC=EDs,
we were real
<P>
concerned about the reporting issues and the financial consequences
of
<P>
that. (MIO P 17)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
<BR>

<P>
On March 6, 1993 the PULSE General Membership voted to approve
the initial
<P>
recommendations of the Life After Initiative 134 Task Force and
requested
<P>
that a full report and recommendations for action be presented
at the 1994
<P>
PULSE General Membership meeting. See exhibit # 2.<BR>

<P>
The recommendations included:<BR>

<P>
Accelerated dues collection.
<P>
Create a designated fund for political contributions.
<P>
Request a loan from WEA to cover operational costs.
<P>
Redraft guidelines for LEAF funds to preserve as much =EChard
money=EE as po=
<P>
ssible.
<P>
Assign the Task Force to complete their charges in time for action
by the
<P>
1994 Representative Assembly.<BR>

<P>
In April of 1994 the Life After 134 Task Force recommended a restructuring
<P>
of the political action program to the WEA Representative Assembly.
<BR>

<P>
The recommendations included Constitution and Bylaws amendments
that set up
<P>
the new structure of WEA-PAC and Community Outreach and funded
the program
<P>
with an additional $12 from WEA members.<BR>

<P>
The new structure eliminated the PULSE Board and designated the
WEA Board
<P>
of Directors as the managers of WEA-PAC.<BR>

<P>
The changes were said to be designed to put more decision making
power at
<P>
the council level and gave one half of the increase in dues ($6)
back to
<P>
the UniServ Councils to be used for local political programs.
<BR>

<P>
The minutes of Life After I-134 Task Force meeting on March 8,
1994 shows
<P>
that there was an open discussion on the dues increase/exchange.
<BR>

<P>
If we don=EDt have a dues increase/exchange, we would have to
sign up member=
<P>
s
<P>
each year. We would not have enough money.
<P>
Members need to understand it is a dues exchange, not an increase.
<P>
Change the name of PULSE and continue payroll deductions at $13
for soft mon=
<P>
ey.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Hard and Soft Money<BR>

<P>
The first reference to =EChard=EE and =ECsoft=EE money was reflected
in the =
<P>
minutes
<P>
of the February meeting of the Life After 134 Task Force.<BR>

<P>
We need to save as much hard money as we can and make sure hard
money is in
<P>
supply to meet the needs of the organization.<BR>

<P>
Under the heading Suggestions to RA in the February 1993 minutes
is a
<P>
discussion of =EChard=EE and =ECsoft=EE money.<BR>

<P>
Define how we will use the fund. =ECThose activities deemed to
be consisten=
<P>
t
<P>
with I-134 previously done by PULSE.=EE Part will be used for
communicating
<P>
with the community on quality education. Use the fund for purposes
not
<P>
considered political contributions under I-134. Save existing
PULSE money
<P>
for direct contributions (Hard money). Everything else will come
out of
<P>
the new general fund (Soft money).<BR>

<P>
Seibert said the terms hard and soft money became very common
in the Life
<P>
After 134 Task Force meetings.<BR>

<P>
It was a term that became very common in the conversation in the
Life After
<P>
134 Task Force. It probably took on its, you know, that=EDs when
it really
<P>
became a term used inside the WEA. I think prior to 134 it would
be safe
<P>
to say that 99 percent of our leaders and 100 percent of our members
had no
<P>
idea about any distinction between these. And it clearly grew
out of
<P>
making a distinction after 134. (SIO P 23)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
NEA MODEL<BR>
<BR>

<P>
It appears that the concept of =EChard=EE and =ECsoft=EE money
was modeled a=
<P>
fter
<P>
the Federal Election Commission and NEA examples.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Nuxoll said that the term soft money was a NEA term.<BR>

<P>
It was words that sort of connected with the way NEA talked about
funds
<P>
that they used in dealing with the national and sort of it was
not exact
<P>
but sort of analogous to what we were going to have to deal with.
So I
<P>
think that is kind of how we started to use it. I do know this,
hard money
<P>
meant the money we could give to candidates. Soft money was more
amorphous
<P>
I guess. (NIO P 10)<BR>

<P>
Nuxoll said that with soft money there were no hard and fast rules
and
<P>
there were a multitude of uses and a multitude of situations and
things
<P>
associated with it.<BR>

<P>
Seibert said his understanding of hard and soft money grows out
of the FEC
<P>
regulations.<BR>

<P>
I mean, generally, it=EDs similar to, the term in my experience,
grows out o=
<P>
f
<P>
the FEC and how NEA-PAC money has been treated over the years,
in terms of
<P>
what can be treated as hard money and soft money. (SIO P 21-22)
<BR>

<P>
Maier said that there was discussion among members of the Life
After 134
<P>
Task Force about the distinction at the Federal level about hard
and soft
<P>
money and how the political parties could separate the two types
of funds.<BR>

<P>
I don=EDt know that we predicated our decision to do that based
on the
<P>
parties. I just shared with them that when we contributed to parties
that
<P>
we used two different funds. Uh, and that it was consistent with
what we
<P>
were talking about and consistent with what I read in the initiative,
and
<P>
consistent with what we had told our members, and I had been told
even when
<P>
I came into this job that we used to use hard money for everything,
because
<P>
we had unlimited resources. Now that we didn=EDt we had to comply
by the
<P>
law, but that there were things that we could do that would not
require PAC
<P>
money. (MIO P13)<BR>

<P>
NEA Advisor John Chase suggested at the April 20, 1993 meeting
of the task
<P>
force as reflected in the minutes that a number of ideas should
be
<P>
explored.<BR>

<P>
(We want to hold on to our current PULSE Funds-hard money) If
we put into
<P>
dues, it will be considered PAC. Then you will be risking your
continuing
<P>
membership. Cannot raise hard money through dues.<BR>

<P>
Put PULSE reverse check off inside dues structure=F3make it an
assessment
<P>
with some guarantees.
<P>
Segregate to a new soft money account
<P>
allow people to opt-out (their money then goes into the WEA general
account.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
It=EDs all soft money - WEA=EDs =ECPolitical Education Fund (or?).
Need to =
<P>
come
<P>
up with some new =ECwords.=EE Need to be very careful with terminology.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
USE OF FUNDS<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Maier said that in his reading of the law it is clear that contributions
to
<P>
candidates is one thing, and everything else can be considered
soft money.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Maier stated that his understanding of hard and soft money centered
around
<P>
candidate contributions.<BR>

<P>
The distinction that I made, and that I actually had conversations
with
<P>
some of your staff about, was that hard money was contributions
to
<P>
candidates, and everything else was soft money. (MIO P 6)<BR>

<P>
Maekawa said that his understanding is that hard money would be
essentially
<P>
moneys that go to political candidates and that soft money was
overhead and
<P>
things that are not for contributions to help candidates into
public
<P>
office. (MAEIO P 32)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Maier said that he believed that funds expended on ballot measures
and
<P>
initiatives were considered soft money.<BR>

<P>
That in the strictest sense of the law, we thought was soft money,
<P>
although, we had, for a time internally, advocated using hard
money for
<P>
that, because we wanted people to use that as a way of raising
WEA-PAC
<P>
dollars. But we always were clear with them that it was not prohibited
by
<P>
law as far as we were concerned. (MIO P 6)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Purdom said that his understanding was that expenditures for ballot
<P>
measures and referendum were not hard money activities and excluded
under
<P>
Initiative 134. He said he believed that support for ballot measures
and
<P>
referendums would be considered soft money expenditures. (PIO
P 45)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
The ballot measures and local races and at the county level, and
the city,
<P>
and those kind of things are not addressed as being restrictive
in any way.
<P>
I mean, that=EDs how we got into calling it hard and soft money.
(PIO P 49)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Rod Regan, WEA staff member, said in an interview under oath (RIO)
that his
<P>
understanding was that soft money could not be used in contributions
<P>
directly to candidate campaigns, legislative candidate campaigns
and that
<P>
administrative costs, initiatives and ballot measures could be
funded with
<P>
soft money. (RIO P 10-11)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Minutes of a April 20, 1993 meeting of Life After 1-134 Task Force
indicate
<P>
that the concept of =EChard=EE and =ECsoft=EE money was initially
brought up=
<P>
by Mr.
<P>
Maier.<BR>

<P>
Soft money can be used for items listed in Initiative 134 under
PART
<P>
II-Definitions, Section 3-5(b) (Attached). Discussion on these
items
<P>
followed. It was agreed that a copy of this list will be sent
to UniServ
<P>
Councils. PULSE hard money is strictly for contributions.<BR>

<P>
A memorandum sent by Mr. Maier in the summer of 1994 to all interested
<P>
parties discussed =ECSoft=EE money uses. See exhibit # 3.<BR>

<P>
The memorandum states in part:<BR>

<P>
What we know for sure is that anything that is NOT a DIRECT or
IN-KIND
<P>
contribution to a candidate at the local, legislative, or state
level CAN
<P>
be paid for with soft money.<BR>

<P>
The memorandum also outlined a list of soft money uses. That list
included
<P>
fundraising for WEA and NEA PAC and for individual for candidates,
GOTV
<P>
mailings, support of state level initiatives and referenda, and
issues
<P>
campaigns with registered voters.<BR>

<P>
Maier said that the WEA distinction about using hard money for
issues
<P>
campaigns was an internal ploy to raise more WEA-PAC money.<BR>

<P>
I mean, it was an internal ploy to raise more WEA-PAC money. But
we never
<P>
said, and it was never told to us, and I=EDm sure I asked the
question about
<P>
whether we had to use PAC money for initiatives and school levies,
and no
<P>
one ever told me I had to. And I was always in the assumption
that we
<P>
could just go ahead and do that, and if we did that, in terms
of a soft
<P>
money contribution, we were to report it, but it wouldn=EDt have
to be PAC
<P>
dollars. (MIO P 9)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Pulse To Wea-Pac And Community Outreach Program<BR>
<BR>

<P>
POLITICAL ACTION<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Political Unity Leaders in State Education (PULSE) was the political
action
<P>
arm of the WEA until September 1, 1994 when WEA-PAC became the
official
<P>
political committee of WEA.<BR>

<P>
The functions of PULSE were divided between WEA-PAC and a new
Community
<P>
Outreach Program.<BR>

<P>
In the March 1994 issues of WEA Action, Mr. Purdom stated that
one of the
<P>
major decisions to be made is how to fund the new political action
program.
<P>
See exhibit # 4.<BR>

<P>
He said the money spent on political activities is classified
into two
<P>
types of funds known as =ECsoft=EE and =EChard=EE money.<BR>

<P>
To fund a new political action program, the task force is recommending
two
<P>
sources of funding based on the need to maintain two separate
types of
<P>
financial support.<BR>

<P>
He stated that =EChard=EE money would be raised through a voluntary
system o=
<P>
f
<P>
membership in the new WEA-PAC organization and =ECsoft=EE money
would be rai=
<P>
sed
<P>
through a =ECcontribution/dues exchange=EE.<BR>

<P>
The $13 per year PULSE contribution will be eliminated and $12
would be
<P>
added to the WEA dues. Those PULSE members now paying $13 would
pay only
<P>
$12 next year. These monies would be divided equally between the
state and
<P>
council/locals.<BR>

<P>
The =ECcontribution/dues exchange=EE mentioned was a mandatory
membership du=
<P>
es
<P>
increase to fund the Community Outreach Program within the WEA.
<BR>

<P>
Seibert stated in =ECSetting the Record Straight=EE that the Representative
<P>
Assembly created WEA-PAC and the funding for the Community Outreach
<P>
Program. See exhibit #4a.<BR>

<P>
In April 1994, following extensive debate, the WEA Representative
Assembly
<P>
overwhelmingly approved the creation of WEA-PAC to replace PULSE
and also
<P>
created a special new dues category of $12 per year to fund a
Community
<P>
Outreach Program. Half of the dues ($6) were to be rebated directly
to
<P>
UniServ Councils.<BR>

<P>
Two of the purposes of the Community Outreach Program - clearly
explained
<P>
to RA delegates - were to generate funds for UniServ Councils
to carry on
<P>
politically-related activities in local communities and to cover
WEA=EDs sof=
<P>
t
<P>
money costs in order to preserve hard money for political contributions.
<BR>

<P>
The May 1994 issue of WEA Action outlined the changes in the WEA
political
<P>
action program.<BR>

<P>
WEA Vice President Lee Ann Prielipp and Governmental Relations
Field
<P>
Representative Bob Maier gave delegates the recommendations of
the =ECLife
<P>
After 134=EE Task Force and fielded questions from members about
the purpose
<P>
and uses of the proposed $12 dues increase to offset the effects
of
<P>
Initiative 134=EDs restrictions.<BR>

<P>
And<BR>

<P>
At all levels, state-council-local, the $12 will be considered
=ECsoft
<P>
money=EE, meaning that it cannot be used for direct or indirect
campaign
<P>
contributions. It can be used for such activities as: coalition
building;
<P>
community organizing; member awareness; training; candidate recruitment;
<P>
political technology; our member lobby program; the endorsement
convention;
<P>
initiative and ballot measures; and community communications.
<BR>

<P>
In April of 1994 the WEA Representative Assembly voted to create
the
<P>
special new dues category of $12.00 per year to fund a Community
Outreach
<P>
Program.<BR>

<P>
The new WEA-PAC was to be funded by a voluntary payroll deduction
of $12
<P>
which was to be authorized by each member on an annual basis.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Regan said that one of the changes resulting from the Life After
134 Task
<P>
=46orce was to disband PULSE, create WEA-PAC and create the Community
<P>
Outreach funds. (RIO P 6)<BR>

<P>
=46isher said that PULSE was disbanded and that the Community
Outreach
<P>
Program did some of the activities that used to be conducted under
PULSE.
<P>
(FIO P 17)<BR>

<P>
=46isher said that the WEA was doing the type of things WEA-PAC
and the
<P>
Community Outreach Program began doing after Initiative 134.<BR>

<P>
So we have been doing that kind of activity for some time and
really what
<P>
it was a way of encouraging our local folks to be more active
in areas
<P>
other than just putting money in campaigns. So it was an encouragement
to
<P>
them to get themselves going on some other coalition and those
type of
<P>
activities. (FIO P 19)<BR>

<P>
PULSE REDUCTIONS<BR>

<P>
One concern voiced by Purdom, Seibert, Maier and Regan was the
drop in
<P>
participation in the WEA political action committee once the reverse
<P>
check-off provisions under payroll deductions were eliminated.
<BR>

<P>
Prior to 134 passing, we had approximately 42 to 43 thousand PULSE
members.
<P>
PULSE dues were $13.00 a year, so it was slightly more than a
dollar a
<P>
month that was collected. (SIO P 11)<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that the impact of Initiative 134 resulted in an
80 percent
<P>
drop in contributions.<BR>

<P>
It dropped almost immediately to eight, right in that area, and
it=EDs begun
<P>
to go up. It=EDs between eleven and twelve, I think now. (SIO
P 19)<BR>

<P>
The reports submitted to the commission indicate the following
changes in
<P>
automatic payroll authorization of political contributions for
the WEA
<P>
political action committee.<BR>

<P>
DUES COLLECTION<BR>

<P>
The Community Outreach dues were segregated both in the collection
at the
<P>
local school district and in the accounting within WEA.<BR>

<P>
A copy of the North Thurston School District APA Dues &amp; Contribution
<P>
Billing from the WEA show separate withholding for NEA dues, WEA
dues,
<P>
Community Outreach Funds, UniServ Council dues, Local Education
Association
<P>
dues, NEA-PAC contributions and WEA-PAC contributions. See exhibit
# 5.<BR>

<P>
Purdom said that the Community Outreach Program funding is kept
in a
<P>
separate account of the budget and is collected at the same time
as general
<P>
dues. (PIO P 40)<BR>

<P>
A memorandum sent to School District Payroll Officers on July
20, 1995 from
<P>
=46ern Buffington, WEA Director of Membership Systems, shows that
the
<P>
Community Outreach Dues are separate from the WEA Dues and are
to be
<P>
deducted from all Active members regardless of FTE status. The
memorandum
<P>
goes on to state that Agency Shop Fee Payers are exempt from the
Outreach
<P>
Dues. See exhibit # 6.<BR>

<P>
A similar memorandum sent to School District Payroll Officers
shows that
<P>
CPEA Membership Dues include a separate $12 per month for Community
<P>
Outreach. See exhibit # 7.<BR>

<P>
Purdom also said that Agency Fee Payers were excluded from the
assessment
<P>
so they don=EDt have to spend additional time arguing with agency
fee payers=
<P>
.<BR>

<P>
The Community Outreach dues increase appears to have generated
$643,847.00
<P>
between September 1, 1994 and August 31, 1995. Expenditures for
the
<P>
Community Outreach Program for that same period were $672,432.28.
A
<P>
difference of $28,585.28.<BR>

<P>
Between September 1, 1995 and August 31, 1996 it appears that
the Community
<P>
Outreach dues increase generated $597,058.00. Expenditures for
the
<P>
Community Outreach Program for that same period were $671,719.21.
A
<P>
difference of $74,661.21.<BR>

<P>
It is not known where the additional funds originated.<BR>

<P>
PDC INQUIRY<BR>

<P>
On March 23, 1994 Mr. Fisher wrote a letter to PDC Acting Director
David
<P>
Clark requesting information concerning changes in PULSE. See
exhibit # 8.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Fisher wrote the following:<BR>

<P>
If the purpose of PULSE changes from a political action committee
to a
<P>
committee that does not make campaign contributions, but, uses
the funds
<P>
for purposes such as:<BR>

<P>
1.Community communication on education issues;
<P>
2.Underwriting the cost of endorsement conventions;
<P>
3.Support of member lobbying;
<P>
4.Coalition building;
<P>
5.Community and member issue awareness;
<P>
6.Underwriting the membership drive for WEA-PAC, a newly created
political
<P>
action committee;
<P>
7.General member training for political involvement;
<P>
8.Political technology such as computers, software, etc.; and,
<P>
9.issue polling.<BR>

<P>
Can PULSE continue to collect contributions by payroll deduction
without
<P>
annually obtaining deduction authorization?<BR>

<P>
To ensure a clear separation between the activities identified
above and
<P>
political campaign contributions, WEA is forming a new political
action
<P>
committee, WEA-PAC.<BR>

<P>
In response to the inquiry by Mr. Fisher, Vicki Rippie, Assistant
Director
<P>
for Public Information and Policy Development, stated in a letter
that some
<P>
of the activities the new PULSE would undertake would be considered
<P>
contributions and that the new PULSE may meet the definition of
a political
<P>
committee and be subject to the annual withholding authorization.
See
<P>
exhibit # 9.<BR>

<P>
PDC staff cannot state unequivocally that new PULSE would not
meet the
<P>
definition of a political committee and thus have its contributors
subject
<P>
to the annual withholding authorization. It depends on what PULSE
actually
<P>
does,..<BR>

<P>
Rippie=EDs letter clearly outline what would constitute an in-kind
<P>
contribution from WEA to WEA-PAC.<BR>

<P>
In addition, the new PULSE would underwrite the costs of: 1) WEA=EDs
<P>
candidate endorsement conventions; 2) WEA-PAC=EDs membership drive;
3)
<P>
political involvement training for WEA members; and 4) providing
computer
<P>
and software technology to WEA-PAC. WEA understands that these
latter
<P>
three PULSE activities, and perhaps others, would constitute in-kind
<P>
contributions to WEA-PAC.<BR>

<P>
The letter goes on to say =EC(In addition, as we discussed, PULSE=EDs
lobbyi=
<P>
ng
<P>
activity will doubtless qualify is as a lobbyist employer and
all of its
<P>
direct expenditures to influence legislation - including grassroots
<P>
lobbying expenses - will be reportable.)=EE.<BR>

<P>
=46isher said that he would have forwarded Ms. Rippie=EDs response
to Mr. Se=
<P>
ibert.<BR>

<P>
What I would have done with any response I got to a question like
this I
<P>
would have forwarded it up to Seibert. I mean that is where the
decisions
<P>
are made, so this would have gone up to Federal Way. (FIO P 9)
<BR>

<P>
WEA Loan to WEA-PAC<BR>
<BR>

<P>
The Life After 134 Task Force recommended that PULSE request a
loan from
<P>
the WEA to cover operational costs and costs identified as PULSE
activities
<P>
which they considered non-political contributions.<BR>

<P>
Nuxoll said that they authorized that a loan could happen after
Initiative
<P>
134 if it were needed.<BR>

<P>
As a way of making sure that we preserved as much of the money
that was
<P>
collected for pure political action to be retained that way. So
I remember
<P>
we talked about what are the things out of this budget that we
used to call
<P>
PULSE that we could now um shall we say lop off or shrink or cut
back move
<P>
so that we could retain as much as possible for the political
<P>
contributions. That was something we were trying to do. (NIO P
17-18)<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that the recommendation for a loan came out of the
Initiative
<P>
134 task force.<BR>

<P>
Since we believed at that point that we could pay overhead out
of, out of
<P>
general dues money and expenditures, we decided to make a loan
to
<P>
WEA-PAC/PULSE to do that. So we would be preserving as much of
the hard
<P>
money as possible.. (SIO P 27)<BR>

<P>
On March 6, 1993 the PULSE general membership approved the Life
After 134
<P>
Task Force recommendation to request a loan for WEA to cover operational
<P>
costs and costs identified as PULSE activities which are non-political
<P>
contributions, i.e. =ECsoft money=EE activities. The loan was
to be paid ba=
<P>
ck,
<P>
with interest, not later than September of 1994 with the collection
of the
<P>
1994-95 PULSE dues. See exhibit # 2.<BR>

<P>
On August 31, 1994 the WEA authorized an initial loan to PULSE
for
<P>
$117,115.00. See exhibit # 10.<BR>

<P>
This loan was to cover the =ECsoft money=EE costs incurred by
PULSE from
<P>
January 1, 1994 to July 31, 1994.<BR>

<P>
Shirley Kurrus, former Records Recorder and Accounting Assistant
for the
<P>
WEA and PULSE/WEA-PAC, said in an interview under oath (KIO) that
the
<P>
purpose of the loan was to pay for PULSE=EDs overhead expenditures
for the
<P>
prior year.<BR>

<P>
The administrative and overhead costs for PULSE, the old PULSE,
prior to
<P>
134, were reimbursed to the new WEA-PAC. (KIO P 27)<BR>

<P>
She said that the $162,255 given to PULSE/WEA-PAC as a loan in
1994
<P>
represented actual internal expenditures and the overhead costs
of PULSE
<P>
for the prior year. (KIO P 25)<BR>

<P>
Maekawa stated that the loans to PULSE were for actual administrative
costs
<P>
that PULSE paid when they were still PULSE before WEA-PAC between
January
<P>
1, 1994 through August 31, 1994. (MAEIO P 12)<BR>

<P>
It=EDs for all of the administrative expenses of January through
August,
<P>
1994, which would include this, too, for eight months. It would
include
<P>
other administrative expenses that they pay directly. They might
have paid
<P>
for supplies. They might have paid for audit expenses. They might
have
<P>
paid for a computer, or whatever. (MIO P 17)<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that prior to Initiative 134 PULSE paid everything
related to
<P>
the operation out of the PAC account.<BR>

<P>
And at the that time, we paid everything related to operation
out of PULSE.
<P>
Paid the salaries, we paid any equipment we purchased, any rent,
we were,
<P>
in a sense, flushed with money for the most part at that time.
And so we
<P>
paid all that. When 134 passed, and we realized there would be
a
<P>
significant drop, at least initially in the enrollment, we decided
that a
<P>
recommendation that Life After 134 Task Force, and the decision
was
<P>
ultimately made was that the money we collected by this new process
where
<P>
we had to sign people up every year would be preserved for the
use of
<P>
making political contributions, and the expenses, such as overhead
and
<P>
operating costs would be shifted over a period of time into the
general
<P>
operation of the organization away from the he political WEA-PAC
<P>
expenditures. (SIO P 20-21)<BR>

<P>
On December 20, 1994 the WEA authorized a second loan to PULSE
for
<P>
$45,140.00. This loan was to cover the =ECsoft money=EE costs
of PULSE for =
<P>
the
<P>
month of August 1994.<BR>

<P>
A detail of Contributions and Administrative and Membership Services
<P>
Expenses provided by the WEA lists the expenditures that represent
the
<P>
loans totaling $162,255.00. See exhibit # 11.<BR>

<P>
Seibert confirmed that the loan to PULSE/WEA-PAC was designed
to preserve
<P>
as much hard money as possible.<BR>

<P>
It resulted from the whole notion of preserving as much of the
hard money
<P>
as we could preserve, and one of the members of the task force
suggested,
<P>
well, why don=EDt we, why don=EDt we just loan money to PULSE
to pay the
<P>
overhead costs, which we had been traditionally paying out of
the PULSE
<P>
money, loan them some WEA money to do that. And that=EDs how it
came about.
<P>
(SIO P 60)<BR>

<P>
Seibert stated in =ECSetting the Record Straight=EE that one of
the actions
<P>
regarding preserving political action funds was to loan PULSE
money.<BR>

<P>
To loan PULSE sufficient funds to pay for the =ECsoft money=EE
expenditure o=
<P>
f
<P>
operating a political action program. Soft money covers employee
costs,
<P>
administration and operating overhead (equipment, rent, supplies,
postage,
<P>
etc.). By making the loan, the Association would be able to preserve
funds
<P>
collected prior to January 1, 1994, as hard money.<BR>

<P>
Maekawa said that the purpose of the loans was to preserve money
for
<P>
candidate contributions. (MAEIO P 14)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
LOAN FORGIVEN<BR>

<P>
On January 3, 1995 WEA-PAC reported to the commission that the
WEA loan of
<P>
$162,255 made to the political action committee was forgiven.
See exhibit
<P>
# 12.<BR>

<P>
Kurrus stated that Mr. Maekawa told her that the loan had been
forgiven.
<P>
(KIO P 20)<BR>

<P>
Maekawa said the debt was forgiven and that the =ECpolitical action
committe=
<P>
e
<P>
the WEA was no longer required to repay it because it was for
soft
<P>
expenditures, and the decision was made to have the Community
Outreach,
<P>
which went into effect September, 1, 1994, to quote repay the
loan because
<P>
it was for soft expenses.=EE (MAEIO P 23)<BR>

<P>
Maekawa said the intention was for WEA to forgive the loan because
=ECwe wer=
<P>
e
<P>
going to get it from the Community Outreach=EE. (MIO P 25)<BR>

<P>
Maekawa said that someone had to repay the loans that came from
WEA dues
<P>
and that the Community Outreach Program was set up for specific
activities
<P>
and one of those would be to cover the overhead costs of the PAC
<P>
organization.<BR>

<P>
It did come from WEA dues, and there=EDs an obligation for somebody
to repay
<P>
that, and if PULSE was forgiven and they=EDre not going to repay
it, somebod=
<P>
y
<P>
has to repay that.=EE (MAEIO P 27)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
LOAN REPAYMENT<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Maekawa said that it was unclear to him which entity would pay
back the
<P>
loans. He thought that PULSE or the successor of PULSE would pay
back the
<P>
loans.<BR>

<P>
Well, that wasn=EDt absolutely clear to me. Because it was a loan,
I had
<P>
thought that, initially thought that PULSE would, or the successor
of
<P>
PULSE, somehow would, =EBcause it was called a loan. (MAEIO P
22)<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that there was no intention of WEA-PAC to repay the
WEA loans.
<P>
He said it was always the intention that the Community Outreach
money
<P>
would be collected from WEA membership to pay back the loans to
the WEA.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
No. It was that the money would be paid back to the WEA out of
the
<P>
Community Outreach funds. (SIO P 63)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Seibert stated in =ECSetting the Record Straight=EE that the loan
was being
<P>
repaid out of Community Outreach dues.<BR>

<P>
In 1994-95, the Association began repaying the $162,255 loan form
it $6
<P>
share of the Community Outreach dues by transferring to the WEA
general
<P>
fund a payment of $45,140, including interest. The 1995-96 Association
<P>
budget includes a second loan payment of $65,000 to be transferred
from
<P>
Community Outreach funds to the WEA general fund. In 1996-97,
WEA will
<P>
make its third and final payment for the balance of the loan plus
accrued
<P>
interest.<BR>

<P>
the Tremper &amp; Co. mentions on page 20:<BR>

<P>
On August 31, 1994 the Association paid $117,115 to an affiliated
<P>
organization for reimbursement of the affiliate organization=EDs
<P>
administrative expenses for the period January 1, 1994 through
July 31,
<P>
1994. Revenue from a dues increase will be used to offset this
<P>
expenditure. Subsequent to August 31, 1994 the Board of Directors
approved
<P>
the reimbursement of additional administrative expenses totaling
<P>
approximately $45,000.<BR>

<P>
Purdom stated that the WEA-PAC loan was repaid out of Community
Outreach
<P>
funds because it was aimed at repaying what he called soft money
<P>
expenditures and that they wanted to solidify the amount of money
they had
<P>
in the hard money account. (PIO P 47-48)<BR>

<P>
He said that there was no discussion about WEA giving a contribution
to
<P>
WEA-PAC rather than a loan.<BR>

<P>
No, because we viewed them as separate entities, and PULSE had
its own dues
<P>
paying members that generated a portion of the operations and
then we had
<P>
the general way we were structured that we had then dues, money
over here
<P>
and so we never talked about just making a contribution-- (PIO
P 47)<BR>

<P>
Seibert said that WEA-PAC did not spend the money loaned by the
WEA that it
<P>
just went into the WEA-PAC general fund and that the balance in
the
<P>
political account was always more then the amount of the loan.
<BR>

<P>
Documentation provided by the WEA indicate that the loans to PULSE
by WEA
<P>
were fully repaid with Community Outreach funds in August of 1996.

Kurrus stated that prior to Initiative 134 the WEA sent a monthly

to PULSE for overhead expenses. WEA-PAC was not billed for overhead
and it
<P>
did not go through her bookkeeping. (KIO P 17)<BR>

<P>
SUPPLEMENT TO REPORT OF INVESTIGATION<BR>

<P>
Introduction
<P>
PDC staff has conducted an investigation of the WEA and WEA-PAC
for
<P>
possible violations of RCW Chapter 42.17.<BR>

<P>
As part of this investigation, staff examined RCW 42.17.680, enacted
as
<P>
part of Initiative 134, which requires the annual reauthorization
of
<P>
payroll deductions for contributions to political committees or
for
<P>
political contributions. In analyzing the application of .680
to the facts
<P>
present in this case, staff discovered that, because of the way
.680(3) was
<P>
drafted, culpable conduct will not always fall within the statute=EDs
<P>
proscription. Staff believes that the voters=ED intent in enacting
.680
<P>
cannot be fulfilled as the statute now reads, and requests authorization
<P>
from the Commission to bring to the attention of the legislature
the
<P>
problem with enforcing this provision of law.<BR>

<P>
Investigative Findings
<P>
During the course of its investigation, staff learned that the
WEA is
<P>
receiving money, in the form of a special assessment levied on
union
<P>
members through payroll deduction, that goes to WEA=EDs Community
Outreach
<P>
Program (COP). Money is automatically deducted from members=ED
paychecks,
<P>
but not from agency fee payers. Members cannot =ECopt out=EE from
the COP
<P>
assessment. A portion of the COP money was used to support WEA-PAC.
<P>
RCW 42.17.680
<P>
In applying the Public Disclosure Law to the pertinent facts,
staff
<P>
examined Subsection (3) of RCW 42.17.680, which states:
<P>
No employer or other person or entity responsible for the disbursement
of
<P>
funds in payment of wages or salaries may withhold or divert a
portion of
<P>
an employee=EDs wages or salaries for contributions to political
committees
<P>
or for use as political contributions except upon the written
request of
<P>
the employee. The request must be made on a form prescribed by
the
<P>
commission informing the employee of the prohibition against employer
and
<P>
labor organization discrimination described in subsection (2)
of this
<P>
section. The request is valid for no more than twelve months from
the date
<P>
it is made by the employee.<BR>

<P>
Application of RCW 42.17.680
<P>
In this instance, assessments were automatically deducted from
WEA members=
<P>
=ED
<P>
paychecks for the COP, which in turn made payments on behalf of
WEA-PAC.
<P>
Members could not decline to pay the COP assessment.<BR>

<P>
In examining RCW 42.17.680 and whether salaries or wages had been
diverted
<P>
for contributions to a political committee or for use as political
<P>
contributions, the issue of who is subject to the statue=EDs prohibition
<P>
arose.<BR>

<P>
The prohibition of RCW 42.17.680 against withholding or diverting
wages for
<P>
political contributions is directed towards the employer or =ECother
person
<P>
or entity responsible for the disbursement of funds in payment
of wages or
<P>
salaries.=EE Clearly, the WEA is not the employer of the members
whose wage=
<P>
s
<P>
are being payroll-deducted. Furthermore, the WEA is not an entity
who is
<P>
=ECresponsible for the disbursement of funds in payment of wages
or
<P>
salaries.=EE If the quoted phrase had ended with the word =ECfunds,=EE
then=
<P>
it
<P>
would certainly be arguable that the WEA was responsible for the
<P>
=ECdisbursement of funds=EE by using the assessment for purposes
of the
<P>
Community Outreach Program. However, the phrase does not end there--it
<P>
goes on to qualify =ECdisbursement of funds=EE with the words
=ECin payment =
<P>
of
<P>
wages or salaries.=EE The WEA does not disburse funds in payment
of its
<P>
members=ED wages or salaries.<BR>

<P>
In trying to interpret whether .680(3) applies to labor organizations
using
<P>
deducted moneys for political purposes, staff was also guided
by comparing
<P>
the language of subsections (1) and (2) of .680 to subsection
(3).
<P>
Subsections (1) and (2) specifically apply to any =ECemployer
or labor
<P>
organization=EE while subsection (3) does not.<BR>

<P>
Staff=EDs conclusion was that the prohibition of RCW 42.17.680(3)
cannot be
<P>
applied to labor organizations under facts such as are present
in this
<P>
case.<BR>

<P>
School districts do fall within the scope of RCW 42.17.680(3)=EDs
prohibitio=
<P>
n
<P>
since they are the employer disbursing funds in payment of wages.
However,
<P>
school districts who payroll-deduct under facts such as these
do not seem
<P>
culpable. While it might be appropriate to charge an employer
directly
<P>
forwarding payroll-deducted moneys to a clearly-identified PAC,
it is a
<P>
different matter where dues are being payroll-deducted for a labor
<P>
organization and then used by the labor organization to make contributions.
<P>
The employer has no authority to control use of the dues money,
and
<P>
furthermore, it is staff=EDs understanding that federal labor
law prohibits
<P>
the employer from asking what the dues will be used for.<BR>

<P>
Thus the dilemma in this case: they party that controls the use
of the
<P>
withheld funds does not fall within the terms of the prohibition;
the party
<P>
that does fall within the prohibition cannot control or ask about
the use
<P>
of the funds being withheld so as to avoid violating the law.
<BR>

<P>
Recommendation<BR>

<P>
Staff believes that the inability in this case (and possibly future
cases)
<P>
to hold the culpable party responsible for using payroll deductions
that
<P>
have not been annually authorized for political contributions
frustrates
<P>
the intent of the voters in passing I-134, and requests the Commission's
<P>
approval to take this problem with enforcing .680 to the legislature
for
<P>
consideration. Even if the Commission does not agree that in this
instance
<P>
deductions were used as political contributions, staff would still
<P>
recommend seeking legislative change since the .680 enforcement
problem may
<P>
well come up again.<BR>

<P>
There was a complaint filed against one school district in this
matter.
<P>
However, there is no reason to believe that all school districts
in the
<P>
state were not acting in the same manner.<BR>

I. INTRODUCTION
<P>
Staff is conducting an investigation of the Washington Education
<P>
Association (WEA) and WEA-PAC. To date, this investigation has
<P>
revealed
<P>
three violations of RCW 42.17. First, the WEA and WEA-PAC failed
<P>
to
<P>
properly disclose a $162,255 donation from the WEA to WEA-PAC.
<P>
Secondly,
<P>
the WEA and WEA-PAC failed to disclose approximately $170,000
in
<P>
contributions from the WEA to WEA-PAC. Finally, the investigation
<P>
found
<P>
that the WEA has formed a second political committee, the Community
<P>
Outreach Program (COP), and that COP has not filed as a political
<P>
committee.<BR>

<P>
The investigation of the first two charges is complete. Investigation
of
<P>
the third charge is still in progress, but staff believes that
further
<P>
investigation of that charge will provide only provide additional
evidence
<P>
to support our allegation that COP is a political committee.
<P>
Staff believes that, based on the magnitude of the alleged violations
found
<P>
to date, a $2,500 penalty is not sufficient. Staff recommends
that this
<P>
matter be referred to the Attorney General's Office (AGO) for
<P>
prosecution
<P>
pursuant to RCW 42.17.360(5) and .395(3). At the same time, staff
will
<P>
continue its investigation of the third charge pursuant to RCW
<P>
42.17.370(6).<BR>

<P>
Staff is recommending referral to the AGO at this time because
of the
<P>
possibility that a law suit may be filed by Citizens for Fair
Campaign
<P>
=46inancing (CFCF) before we have an opportunity to present a
<P>
complete
<P>
investigation to you. On September 26, 1996, CFCF notified the
AGO
<P>
that
<P>
CFCF would file a law suit against the WEA if the AGO did not
act
<P>
within
<P>
forty-five days. Pursuant to RCW 42.17.400(4), CFCF must provide
<P>
the AGO
<P>
with a second ten day notice before CFCF may file a law suit against
the
<P>
WEA for the violations discussed in this brief.<BR>

<P>
II. FACTS AND ARGUMENT
<P>
The WEA is a labor organization representing approximately 65,000
<P>
public
<P>
school employees and is the state affiliate of the parent National
<P>
Education Association. Within the WEA there are
<P>
22 Uniserv Councils and 330 Local Education Associations.<BR>

<P>
A.The WEA's Political Operations Prior To Initiative 134.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Prior to January, 1994, the WEA directed school districts to
<P>
automatically
<P>
deduct one dollar per month from all members for placement in
its
<P>
political
<P>
committee, Political Unity of Leaders in State Education (PULSE).
<P>
Members
<P>
could opt out of this deduction, but a majority did not. Approximately
<P>
48,000 members gave one dollar per month to PULSE during 1993.
<BR>

<P>
Pulse spent this money on a variety of activities including support
of
<P>
candidates, ballot measures and local levy elections. WEA billed
PULSE
<P>
for
<P>
its share of overhead and administrative costs. In addition, PULSE
<P>
rebated
<P>
forty (40) percent of its money to the Uniserv Councils who then
spent
<P>
this
<P>
money in support of candidates, ballot measures and local levy
elections.
<P>
Both PULSE and most of the 22 Uniserv Councils filed with the
PDC as
<P>
political committees.<BR>

<P>
B. The WEA's Political Operations After The Adoption of Initiative
134.<BR>

<P>
Initiative 134 was adopted by a 72 percent vote in November, 1992.
In
<P>
addition to contribution limits, Initiative 134 contains RCW
<P>
42.17.680(3).
<P>
That section provides, in relevant part:
<P>
No employer or other person or entity responsible for the disbursement
<P>
of
<P>
funds in payment of wages or salaries may withhold or divert a
portion of
<P>
an employee's wages or salaries for contributions to political
committees
<P>
or for use as political
<P>
contributions except upon written request of the employee.<BR>

<P>
This statute meant that the WEA could no longer have one dollar
per
<P>
month
<P>
automatically deducted for PULSE. Members would have to
<P>
affirmatively
<P>
authorize this deduction each year. WEA leadership expected that
RCW
<P>
42.17.680(3) would cause a huge decrease in money available to
its
<P>
political committee, and that is exactly what happened. The number
of
<P>
members who gave one dollar per month dropped from approximately
<P>
48,000 in
<P>
1993, to approximately 8,000 in 1994. In response to this anticipated
<P>
shortage of political money and the limits contained in Initiative
134, the
<P>
WEA formed a =ECLife After 134 Task Force=EE. The purpose of the
<P>
group was =
<P>
to
<P>
review the new law and to decide how they could continue to
<P>
=ECconduct
<P>
business as usual=EE, knowing that their funds would be radically
<P>
reduced.
<P>
Acting on the recommendations of the &quot;Life After 134 Task
Force,&quot;
<P>
WEA took
<P>
several actions which led to this investigation.<BR>

<P>
1.The WEA Changed The Structure Of Its Political Operations.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
In April 1994, the WEA eliminated PULSE and replaced it with
<P>
WEA-PAC and
<P>
the Community Outreach Program (COP). WEA-PAC was formed to
<P>
continue many
<P>
of the political activities formerly conducted by PULSE including
<P>
contributions to candidates and ballot measures. Due to a concern
that
<P>
contributions needed to be centralized to avoid exceeding the
limits
<P>
contained in Initiative 134, the Uniserv Councils=ED WEA-PAC
<P>
rebates are
<P>
being held by WEA-PAC. The Uniservs were told to stop filing as
<P>
political
<P>
committees, and upon request to WEA-PAC, contributions on behalf
of
<P>
the
<P>
Uniserv Councils would be made and reported by WEA-PAC.
<P>
WEA-PAC is funded
<P>
by voluntary one dollar per month member contributions. Members
must
<P>
affirmatively authorize this deduction on an annual basis.<BR>

<P>
COP's purposes, as stated by the WEA's Executive Director, were
to
<P>
cover
<P>
WEA-PAC's &quot;soft&quot; money expenses in order to preserve
WEA-PAC's
<P>
&quot;hard&quot; money
<P>
for contributions to state and legislative candidates and to generate
funds
<P>
for Uniserv Councils to carry on politically-related activities
in local
<P>
communities.<BR>

<P>
COP is funded by a mandatory one dollar per month dues increase
<P>
which was
<P>
passed at the WEA Representative Assembly in April, 1994. Members
<P>
may not
<P>
opt out of this dues increase, but agency fee payers are not charged
<P>
COP
<P>
dues. COP money is collected separately from annual dues and is
<P>
segregated
<P>
and accounted for separately at the WEA. One-half of the money
which
<P>
comes
<P>
into COP is rebated directly to the Uniserv Councils based on
number of
<P>
members, while one-half of COP's money stays at the state level.
<BR>

<P>
In addition to the moneys spent by WEA-PAC and COP for political
<P>
purposes,
<P>
the WEA has used general dues to make contributions to ballot
<P>
measures.
<P>
=46or example, the WEA made $700,000 in contributions to the No
on
<P>
173 and
<P>
177 Committee.<BR>

<P>
2.The WEA Accelerated Collection Of Political Dues For The Year
<P>
1993-1994.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
In January, 1993, the PDC ruled that the new voluntary
<P>
system of dues collection contained in RCW 42.17.680(3) would
<P>
become
<P>
effective on January 1, 1994. The WEA's 1993-94 fiscal year ran
from
<P>
September 1, 1993, through August 31, 1994. In anticipation of
a sharp
<P>
decline in funds available for its political committee, the WEA
<P>
accelerated
<P>
collection of its political dues for the 1993-94 fiscal year.
That is, in
<P>
December, 1993, the WEA collected PULSE dues through August,
<P>
1994. Staff
<P>
does not allege that this action violated Initiative 134.<BR>

<P>
3.The WEA, Through The COP, Made $162,255 In Donations To
<P>
WEA-PAC Which
<P>
WEA-PAC Reported As Loans From The WEA.<BR>

<P>
In September, 1994, WEA-PAC reported to the PDC that it had
<P>
received a
<P>
$117,115 loan from the WEA. In January, 1995, WEA-PAC reported
<P>
that it had
<P>
received an additional $45,140 loan from the WEA. These amounts
<P>
were
<P>
calculated to repay WEA-PAC for overhead and other administrative
<P>
expenses
<P>
incurred by PULSE from January, 1994, through August, 1994. In
<P>
February,
<P>
1995, WEA-PAC reported that these loans had been forgiven.<BR>

<P>
Staff's investigation revealed that these &quot;loans&quot; were
made from the
<P>
WEA's
<P>
general dues account, and were never intended to be repaid by
<P>
WEA-PAC.
<P>
Instead, WEA used (as was always intended) COP money to repay
the
<P>
WEA's
<P>
general dues account. WEA-PAC should have reported these deposits
<P>
as
<P>
donations from the WEA, not as loans. In addition, the WEA or
COP,
<P>
failed
<P>
to report these donations to WEA-PAC, nor did WEA-PAC report
<P>
these as
<P>
in-kind contributions.<BR>

<P>
4.WEA-PAC And The WEA Or COP Failed To Report Contributions
<P>
From COP To
<P>
WEA-PAC Totaling Approximately $173,517.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
=46rom September, 1994, through August, 1996, money collected
<P>
through the CO=
<P>
P
<P>
was used to pay WEA-PAC's overhead and other administrative
<P>
expenses.
<P>
These expenditures by COP constituted contributions to WEA-PAC,
<P>
yet they
<P>
were not reported by WEA-PAC, the WEA or COP. Approximately
<P>
$173,517 in
<P>
contributions were not reported. This is a conservative calculation
of the
<P>
amount of contributions not reported for the period September,
1994
<P>
through
<P>
August, 1996; the WEA itself calculated the $162,255 =ECloan=EE
<P>
based on the
<P>
administrative expenses of PULSE for an eight month period.<BR>

<P>
The WEA believes that money which is used for direct contributions
to
<P>
candidates is hard money, and that such contributions are reportable
to
<P>
the
<P>
PDC. The WEA believes that money which is used to pay the overhead
<P>
of
<P>
WEA-PAC is soft money, and that WEA-PAC is not required to report
<P>
such
<P>
expenditures or contributions. These concepts are found in Initiative
134,
<P>
but only apply to bona-fide political parties in regards to contribution
<P>
limits. The WEA may have come to its erroneous understanding based
<P>
on the
<P>
WEA's understanding of federal election law.<BR>

<P>
5.COP Is A Political Committee Subject To The Reporting
<P>
Requirements Of RCW
<P>
42.17.080-090.<BR>

<P>
=46rom September, 1994, through August, 1996, one of COP's
<P>
primary purposes
<P>
was to influence governmental decision making
<P>
by paying the administrative costs of WEA-PAC and re-paying the
loan,
<P>
allowing WEA-PAC to preserve its funds to make contributions or
<P>
independent
<P>
expenditures supporting or opposing candidates. To this end, COP
<P>
made
<P>
approximately $300,000 in contributions to WEA-PAC. COP (both
the
<P>
state
<P>
portion and Uniserv portions) also made direct contributions to
ballot
<P>
measures and other political committees. These activities made
COP a
<P>
political committee, yet COP did not register and report as a
political
<P>
committee.<BR>

<P>
6.There May Be Other Political Committees That Have Failed To
<P>
Report With
<P>
The PDC.<BR>

<P>
One-half of the money received by COP was rebated directly to
the 22
<P>
Uniserv Councils. The COP was merely a pass through for this money.
<P>
However, upon the instructions of the WEA, the Uniservs (with
few
<P>
exceptions) ceased reporting their political activities to PDC.
Due to the
<P>
time constraints of this investigation and the large number of
Uniserv
<P>
Councils, it is not clear at this time what all of the Uniservs
did with
<P>
the money they received from COP or if they should be reporting
to
<P>
PDC.
<P>
The Uniservs were told that they could use COP money for any activity
<P>
except the direct support of candidates. However, some Uniserv
<P>
Councils
<P>
spent their rebate exclusively on community organizing. Others
used the
<P>
money on reportable political activities such as contributions
to local
<P>
candidates and local levy elections. The question of what the
<P>
Uniserv Councils did with their COP rebates, and whether certain
<P>
Uniserv Councils should be reporting as political committees needs
to be
<P>
investigated.<BR>

<P>
In addition, as noted above, the WEA has made several large
<P>
contributions to ballot measures out of general dues, including
$700,000
<P>
in
<P>
contributions to the No on 173 and 177 Committee.
<P>
The question of whether the WEA itself constitutes a political
<P>
committee needs further investigation.<BR>

<P>
7. Staff's Findings of a 1994 Audit of WEA-PAC Does not Excuse
the
<P>
Alleged Violations.<BR>

<P>
Staff conducted an audit of WEA-PAC for the 1994 election cycle.
This
<P>
audit was concluded in April, 1996. The audit, in general, concluded
that
<P>
the WEA was in substantial compliance with RCW 42.17 for the period
<P>
August
<P>
1, 1994 through December 31, 1994. In April, 1996, a meeting was
<P>
held with
<P>
the WEA regarding the audit. At that time, the first two complaints
had
<P>
been filed against WEA and WEA-PAC. There was no discussion of
the
<P>
complaints filed with the PDC at that April, 1996 meeting. The
WEA
<P>
argues
<P>
that the findings of the 1994 audit preclude the PDC from being
able to
<P>
take action against the WEA for the improper reporting of the
&quot;loan&quot;.
<P>
PDC
<P>
staff does not agree with that assertion.<BR>

<P>
=46irst, the two complaints on file with the PDC prior to the
April, 1996
<P>
meeting focused on RCW 42.17.680 and the use of compulsory union
<P>
dues for
<P>
campaign activities. The February 6, 1996 complaint does state
that
<P>
=ECIt
<P>
was the intent of the union to repay itself, it is clearly the
intent of
<P>
the law to prohibit such activities.=EE However, this is the only
portion
<P>
o=
<P>
f
<P>
either complaint which alleges that WEA-PAC never intended to
repay
<P>
the
<P>
loan. The complaints alleged a violation of RCW 42.17.680, not
a
<P>
reporting
<P>
violation. Regardless, a letter from WEA=EDs attorney, Harriet
<P>
Strasberg,
<P>
dated March 13, 1996, written to staff in response to the complaints,
<P>
states:<BR>

<P>
WEA made two loans to PULSE in the amounts of $117,115 on August
<P>
31, 1994
<P>
and $45,140 on December 21, 1994. The purpose of these loans was
to
<P>
reimburse PULSE for expenses incurred for the administration and
<P>
overhead
<P>
(equipment, rent, supplies, postage, etc.) necessary for the support
of
<P>
WEA=EDs political action committee. Those funds were neither
<P>
intended for
<P>
nor were they used for, contributions to candidates or for initiative
<P>
campaigns.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
It was subsequently decided that WEA-PAC funds would not be used
<P>
to repay
<P>
the loans.<BR>

<P>
Therefore, at the time of the April, 1996 meeting, staff had no
reason to
<P>
believe that the =ECloan=EE was actually a donation.<BR>

<P>
Secondly, the complaints were not discussed at the April, 1996
meeting.
<P>
It
<P>
was not reasonable for the WEA to assume staff=EDs silence meant
the
<P>
complaints had been dismissed.<BR>

<P>
The WEA also argues that the PDC had notice of WEA-PAC=EDs
<P>
failure to repor=
<P>
t
<P>
contributions from COP at the time of the audit because PULSE
had
<P>
reported
<P>
administrative expenses in the past, and WEA-PAC no longer reported
<P>
administrative expenses. This argument is misplaced.<BR>

<P>
The audit did not review PULSE=EDs reports. It was limited to
a review
<P>
of
<P>
WEA-PAC=EDs reports. The first section of the audit makes this
clear.
<P>
An audit has been conducted of the records and reports of the
<P>
Washington
<P>
Education Assn. PAC (herein referred to as =ECWEA-PAC=EE) from
<P>
August 1, 199=
<P>
4
<P>
through December 31, 1994.<BR>

<P>
The audit did not compare reports filed by PULSE with reports
filed by
<P>
WEA-PAC. It was not reasonable for the WEA to assume or expect
<P>
staff to
<P>
have uncovered WEA-PAC=EDs contributions from COP.<BR>

<P>
III. CONCLUSION<BR>

<P>
Based on the evidence we have discovered in our investigation,
we
<P>
believe
<P>
the WEA and WEA-PAC either failed to disclose, or failed to properly
<P>
disclose, approximately $300,000 in contributions from the WEA
to
<P>
WEA-PAC.
<P>
In staff=EDs opinion, these alleged violations alone warrant a
penalty
<P>
greater than $2,500. In addition, based on the investigation to
date, we
<P>
believe the WEA has formed a second political committee, COP,
which
<P>
has not
<P>
filed as a political committee, and there may be other entities
which have
<P>
failed to file as political committees. Staff recommends that
this matter
<P>
be referred to the Attorney General's Office for prosecution and
<P>
pursuant
<P>
to RCW 42.17.360 and .395. Staff will assist this effort by continuing
its
<P>
investigation pursuant to RCW 42.17.370(6). As noted above, staff
<P>
makes
<P>
this recommendation now because of the possibility that a law
suit may
<P>
be
<P>
filed by CFCF before we can return to you with a completed
<P>
investigation.<BR>

We hope that the Attorney General will prosecute the WEA vigorously so that they change their behavior in the future.  This will be a real test for the AG, who received teacher union support in the last election.  Stay tuned.<p><br>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Saturday, November 16, 1996, p. A-8<p>Union may face court action<p>By Scott Sunde, P-I Reporter<p>OLYMPIA -- The state's campaign watchdog believes it has found the Washington Education Association in such serious violation of election-finance laws that it is urging the state Attorney General's Office to take the teachers union to court.<p>The WEA said the Public Disclosure Commission's interpretation of the law is wrong, and complained that the union is a victim of a political conspiracy.<p>In a report released yesterday, the PDC staff concluded that the teachers union, which with 65,000 members is one of the state's most powerful political forces, failed to properly report more than $300,000 in campaign spending and ran afoul of the law by not registering as a political action committee.<p>The PDC can levy a fine of no more than $2,500.  But the attorney general could take the WEA to court, seek a fine of $10,000 for each violation, and, in special cases, ask a judge to triple the fine.<p>"The staff didn't feel that $2,500 was sufficient," said Melissa Warheit, the PDC's executive director.  "There as, we feel, a lot of money that wasn't reported as it should have been."<p>As Warheit and her staffers talked with reporters in the PDC's lobby yesterday, teachers union officials and their opponents listened.  They debated with the PDC, talked with reporters and continued to argue in an elevator on their way out of the office building.<p>"We think their interpretation is wrong," said Trevor Neilson, a WEA spokesman.  "We think we do follow the rules.  We will go to court to challenge each of their allegations."<p>Warheit will turn the report over to the five-member Public Disclosure Commission on Tuesday.  The commissioners will have the final say on whether to turn the matter over the attorney general.<p>"This is the largest violation in PDC history," said Bob Williams, president of the Evergreen Freedom Foundation, a conservative Olympia think tank that filed a PDC complaint against the teachers union in August.  "There is so much more that has to be done.  They've just scratched the surface."<p>Neilson called the report "an orchestrated effort on the part of Bob Williams and extremely conservative political operatives to weaken WEA's influence in the political arena.  What happens politically in Washington is tied intrinsically to education.  And that's an arena we need to be in."<p>The WEA is one of the state's biggest players when it comes to political contributions.<p>For example, the WEA dipped into members' union dues this year to provide at least $700,000 to the campaign that opposed referendums that would have created a school voucher system and charter schools, PDC officials said yesterday.<p>Voters rejected both measures by large margins earlier this month.<p>The PDC investigation comes four years after voters approved a new campaign finance law.  That law, which Republicans heavily backed, has made it harder for unions such as the WEA to collect money from the rank and file for political contributions.<p>Complaints about the WEA's fund raising and contributions started coming in to the PDC in February.  But wasn't until September that the agency investigated them, Warheit said.  Before September, the commission had its hands full with, among other things, a major investigation of state House Majority Leader Dale Foreman.<p>Foreman, a Wenatchee Republican who was ultimately cleared, failed to win his party's nomination for governor in the September primary.<p>The PDC staff investigation of the WEA concludes:<p>     The WEA loaned $162,255 to its political action committee from September 1994 to January 1995.  The union forgave the loan.  The PDC staff said the loan was "never intended to be repaid" by the committee and should have been reported as contributions.<p>     The WEA paid the political action committee's overhead from September 1994 through August 1996, spending $173,517.  That money, too, should have been reported as a contribution but wasn't, the PDC staff said.<p>     The union's community outreach program is a political action committee, but has never registered as one.<p>According to the report, the Community Outreach Program was designed to cover the WEA's political action committee expenses in order to preserve money for political campaigns.  The program was funded by a mandatory $1-a-month member dues increase.<p>The outreach program made contributions to the WEA's political action committees and other similar groups and made direct contributions to [the political committee formed to oppose the charter schools and scholarship voucher] ballot measures, the PDC concluded.<p>"The activities made COP (the outreach program) a political action committee, yet the COP did not register and report as a political action committee," the PDC report concludes.<p>Neilson, the WEA spokesman, denied that the outreach program is a political committee.  Harriet Strasberg, a WEA lawyer, said the PDC contention that the teachers union failed to report more than $300,000 in spending was a record-keeping matter that the agency could have solved by simply asking the union to file amended reports.<p>Neilson said the PDC audited the WEA and in April found the union in compliance with finance laws.  PDC staffers said that audit did not cover the matters included in the report released yesterday.<p>The PDC has become zealous and is responding to pressure, Neilson said.  He pointed to criticism of the PDC from Foreman.  At the same time, Williams' Evergreen Freedom Foundation has been highly critical of the PDC and the teachers union, Neilson said.<p>Moreover, in late September, lawyers from the Seattle firm of Davis Wright Tremaine wrote Attorney General Christine Gregoire and others saying they would sue the union if no action was taken against it.  The lawyers said they represented the group that persuaded voters four years ago to change campaign finance laws.<p>"We think the WEA is being made an example of," Neilson said.<p>Williams said he will urge Gregoire to seek triple damages against the union.<p>He said he will also seek to have the union's contributions of $700,000 from member dues to the anti-initiative campaign investigated.<p>In its report, the PDC staff said the contribution does need further investigation.<p>--end of article--<p>The Seattle Times, November 19, 1996, p. B-4.  <br>(Top of the Editorial Column)<p>WEA should clean house in wake of PDC findings<p>(unsigned editorial of The Seattle Times Editorial Board)<p>In a Sept. 3 Seattle Times op-ed, Washington Education Association executive director James Seibert claimed "Meticulous records track every hour and every dollar that WEA spends doing anything even remotely political."  He also assured the public that WEA is following the law.<p>Wrong on both counts.  A staff report of the state Public Disclosure Commission released last week shows that the union failed to properly  disclose more than $300,000 in campaign finances over the past two years.  According to the PDC staff, this may be among the most serious campaign-spending violations in state history.  The report recommends three specific violations be referred to the Attorney General for prosecution:<p>     ILLEGAL TRANSFERS OF MONEY.  The staff found WEA failed to properly disclose a $162,255 donation to its political action committee.  The WEA repeatedly claimed that the loan was legal and was being paid back with interest.  The PDC concluded otherwise:  "The loan was never intended to be repaid."<p>     UNDISCLOSED POLITICAL EXPENDITURES.  For the past two years, WEA has covered its PAC's full overhead costs totaling $173,517.  These administrative expenses never appeared in PDC reports, a violation of Initiative 134, which [also] requires written consent from union members for all political expenditures.<p>     FORMATION OF AN UNREGISTERED POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE.  Prior to passage of I-134, the WEA automatically deducted $1 per month from all members for placement in its political action committee.  After approval of the initiative, which required paycheck deductions for political activity to be voluntary and renewed annually, PAC contributions dropped from 80 percent to 20 percent.  To make up the loss, the union imposed a mandatory $12 annual fee to fund a "Community Outreach Program."  WEA officials insisted the program did not make direct contributions to political causes, but the PDC disagreed, concluding that it was a political action committee subject to state registration and reporting requirements.<p>The questions don't end there.  The PDC staff also confirmed that the WEA -- not its PAC -- spent more than $700,000 in unreported campaign contributions to defeat the charter-school and school-voucher initiatives (I-177 and I-173).  Due to the range of suspect activities, the PDC staff recommended further investigation into whether the WEA itself constitutes a political committee.<p>WEA leaders are trying to obfuscate the PDC staff findings by attacking the Evergreen Freedom Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Olympia whose research galvanized the PDC investigation.  But the demand for good government , ethical leadership and public accountability is nonpartisan and non-ideological.  Union spokesmen suggest only minor procedural matters are at issue.  But it appears that the WEA played unfair and broke the law.<p>Voters, and especially rank-and-file teachers, deserve apologies -- not lame excuses and conspiracy theories.  Public school students, their parents and teachers whose overriding interest is what goes on in classrooms across the state would be well served by a swift housecleaning in WEA headquarters.<p>--end of editorial--

Apple contends that the SDTA violated her First, Fifth and<br>14th Amendment rights by not allowing her to resign and not refunding the money which the union<br>uses to contribute to political and ideological campaigns, which are unrelated to the union's<br>bargaining activities. <p>"What this case is about is the right of teachers to leave the union," said Milton Chappell of the<br>National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, who is representing Apple in this case. "We<br>believe it is a violation of her constitutional rights." <p>The written agreement between the district and the association allows union members to revoke<br>their membership during the month of July in the year that the contract with the district expires.<br>Since the contract doesn't expire until the end of June 1998, teachers wishing to leave the union<br>may not resign until July 1998, according to Article 16, Section 16.8 of the contract. <p>The association draws authority for such a code from California Government Code 3540.1, which<br>allows public school employee organizations to require employees to maintain their membership in<br>the unions as a condition of their employment for the duration of the contract. Chappell claims he<br>knows of other teachers who have tried to resign from the union and have been blocked, which is<br>why he initiated the lawsuit as a class action. He hopes the federal court will rule the code<br>unconstitutional. <p>"We don't think this will withstand the test of the Constitution," Chappell added. <p>Apple, who has taught severely mentally handicapped students at Kearny High for the past nine<br>years, originally joined the union because she needed the liability insurance offered through the<br>association for her class, which often traveled throughout the community. She said she decided that<br>she wanted to leave the union about seven or eight years ago because the views espoused by the<br>union were in conflict with her own. <p>"I don't want to be associated with an organization that holds the views that they do," Apple said. <p>She would not comment on what specific views or issues she disagreed with the union on. <p>Apple wrote several letters this year to various association officials requesting resignations or<br>demanding it. Marc Knapp, president of SDTA, wrote a reply on Sept. 9 denying her request and<br>quoting the section of the contract. However, Knapp said in the letter that he sympathized with<br>Apple's concerns, and said "there are areas where I personally part company with SDTA." <p>After July 1998, the association will allow teachers to become "agency fee payers." The members<br>will reap the benefits of the collective bargaining which the union undertakes, but between 10 and<br>20 percent of their membership dues will be refunded, amounting to approximately $200. Agency<br>fee payers will not vote in SDTA elections or receive legal or economic benefits through SDTA,<br>CTA or the National Education Association. <p>SDTA officials confirmed that a teacher may not move into the agency fee payer status until July<br>1998 when the contract expires. The only exceptions made, according to Association Vice<br>President Maryann McDonald, are for "religious objectors." Objectors must pay what would be<br>their dues to one of three charities who work with children. <p>"It's interesting that this lawsuit was filed by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation,<br>because they are an anti-union organization," McDonald said. "I find that a little disturbing." <p>Chappell said he hopes the case will overturn the provisions in the California code which allow the<br>union to require membership during the contract time. Although they will ask for past dues spent<br>on political activities, Apple said she does not care if she gets any money back. She said she just<br>doesn't want to pay any more in the future. <p>gallagher@sddt.com <p><p>

If you would like more information, please contact me.  Feel free to distribute this information among your colleagues according to the policies established for your work setting.<p>Cindy Omlin, Speech-Language Pathologist, CCC-SP.<p>P.S.  For more information you may also access the website at<br>www.schoolreport.com/weacn/<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<p>STATEWIDE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST WASHINGTON EDUCATION<br>ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION AND LOCAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF UNION DUES:  YOU ARE INVITED TO JOIN THE LAWSUIT.  <p><B>WASHINGTON EDUCATION ASSOCIATION KILLS BILL TO INFORM MEMBERS OF THEIR RIGHTS</B><br> <br>In order to keep education employees in submission to the unions mandatory dues arrangement, the WEA killed House Bill 1738.  This bill stated:<br> <br>NEW SECTION.  Sec. 1.  The legislature believes that all public employees covered by collective bargaining agreements should be notified of their First Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.  Because the First Amendment enumerates rights that are fundamental to our freedom, notice of these rights, as determined by the United States Supreme Court, must be conspicuously and routinely provided to a person whose employment is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  The legislature finds that it should be the responsibility of the public employer and the collective bargaining representative to provide such notice.  The purpose of this act is to protect First Amendment rights, consistent with the belief that to compel a<br>man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.<br> <br><B>YOUR RIGHTS</B><br> <br>Education employees are not required to join the union, but non-union employees must pay an agency shop fee or their fair share of the unions representation in collective bargaining, grievance resolution and contract maintenance (chargeable activity).  Those joining the lawsuit are willing to pay this "fair share,"  but they believe that political and ideological<br>activity on which a diverse membership disagrees should not be funded by mandatory dues.<br> <br>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that educators and other workers have the First Amendment right to withhold that portion of their union dues which is spent on non-chargeable activity, such as political activity and other non-essential services.  Employees also have the right to challenge the amount that the union claims it spends on chargeable activity.  Non-members who do not challenge the unions calculation continue to pay 100% of the union dues.<br> <br>Because the union deceptively categorizes its political spending, its calculation of the "fair share" is disproportionately high.  Therefore, this lawsuit is to challenge the unions calculation.  The WEA claims that 85% of the dues are used for collective bargaining and other chargeable activity. The Spokane Education Association President recently admitted to a news reporter, however, that 70-80% of the SEA dues is NOT used for member<br>representation.<br> <br>The union is legally required to represent agency shop fee payers<br>(non-members) the same as union members and provide the same benefits, rights, and services of the bargained contract.  Non-members cannot participate in union governance, receive strike benefits, or receive WEA liability insurance.   (Liability insurance is easily obtained from independent education associations.)<p>The union has repeatedly failed in its obligation to inform employees of their rights.  When asked, union officials usually give no information, or they give inaccurate or obscure information.   WEA shows greater regard for maximizing their collection of dues than in upholding employee rights.<br> <br><B>THE LAWSUIT</B><br> <br>A class action lawsuit was filed in federal court on October 10, 1995. National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation staff attorney, Milton Chappell, will provide most of  the legal work at no cost.  Local attorney services provided by Steven T. OBan of Ellis, Li & McKinstry, PLLC, administrative services and communication expenses will be covered by a fee<br>of $150 for each union challenger which is expected to sustain expenses up until the point of trial (in 12-18 months).  Another fee of $150 may be assessed if the suit goes to trial.  Total fees for the entire action have been capped by the attorney at $300 per challenger. If the judge does not certify the class, only those who have joined this suit will benefit from the courts decision.  If the class is certified, all non-members will benefit from the court's decision.<br> <br>Our attorneys intend to audit the WEAs books and disclose and challenge their expenditures in court. (Teachers who challenged the WEA in 1994 received an out of court settlement for a 50% reduction in dues for two years ($200-300 per year).  That settlement has expired.)<br> <br><B>JOINING THE SUIT: STANDING TOGETHER FOR PRINCIPLE</B><br> <br>Those joining this lawsuit are NOT anti-union.  We SUPPORT union<br>expenditures on legitimate union activities for collective bargaining,contract maintenance and improvement of working conditions.  We believe, however, that union expenditures for political and ideological activity should be funded only by voluntary contributions to WEA-PAC.  We believe that the unions disproportionate focus on political activity is reducing its effectiveness and focus on the protection of employee rights and workplace issues.  Kathy OToole, General Counsel for the WEA, has characterized employees who believe the union should focus on representing its members as "dinosaurs."<br> <br>Those wishing to receive information about their rights and the forms for resigning from the union and joining this statewide challenge must call 1(800) 336-3600 and request the packet for the WEA Class Action Lawsuit. Once the forms and fee (or downpayment) are received, our attorneys will shepherd the challengers through the legal process and take care of all<br>communications with the WEA.  You are very important as the eyes and ears of our attorneys.  It is very important that you send documentation of questionable activities and spending by the union to them.<br> <br>This is your chance to make a difference and redirect the union to its legitimate purpose.  Over 150 education employees from all over the state have already joined this suit. You can too!<br> <p>

B-1<p>Teachers to sue union over use of dues<br>Action comes during probe of WEA political donations<p>by Scott Sunde, P-I reporter<p>A group of 20 teachers will sue the Washington Education Association in federal court today, joining a growing number of voices that are accusing the state's largest teachers union of illegally using dues to back political candidates and causes.<br>The lawsuit, which also is expected to name the National Education Association as a defendant, comes during a major investigation by the state's Public Disclosure Commission of the WEA's sources of political contributions.  The investigation is the commission's "No. 1 priority" said Melissa Warheit, PDC Executive Director.<br>The WEA expects the Public Disclosure Commission to find no problems.<br>"We're very confident we're using  . . . our members' dues legally," said Teresa Moore, a WEA spokeswoman.<br>The WEA and its 65,000 teacher members are central players in the campaign against two initiatives on the November ballot:  173, which would set up a voucher program allowing parents to use tax money to send their children to public or private schools; and 177, which would set up so-called charter schools.<br>By August, the Washington Education Association had financed about 65 percent of the budget of the campaign set up to defeat both initiatives.<br>PDC reports show about $210,00 in contributions through September, Warheit said.  That money did not come from WEA's political action committee, and the PDC is trying to determine the source of the money, Warheit said.<br>Supporters of the initiatives fear not only that the association will pour more money into the campaign, but also that it will do so illegally.<br>"They're going to spend all this money [against I-177] illegally, and it won't come out as a crime until after the election," said Jim Spady, who with his wife sponsored the drive to get the charter school initiative on the ballot.<br>Indeed, the size of the investigation and other work means the PDC is unlikely to finish its investigation until after the election Nov. 5, Warheit said.  She said her staff wants to be done by Nov. 12.  That would allow commission members to discuss violations and charges -- if any are alleged -- at their meeting Nov. 19.<br>The lawsuit expected to filed today in Seattle focuses on agency fee payers, teachers who are not union members.  Federal law says that the union must represent these nonmembers, but it also says that the union can charge them only for the cost of representing them.  That charge is their agency fee.<br>The WEA has about 2,700 agency fee payers.<br>The teachers involved in the lawsuit believe the WEA is charging them more than the cost of representing them, said Steven O'Ban, a Seattle attorney who is representing the teachers.<br>O'Ban said the lawsuit will contend that some of the extra money the WEA charges these teachers ends up being used for political purposes.<br>Moore, the WEA spokeswoman, said the association is confident that is charging the fee payers a correct amount.  "None of their money is used for political purposes," she said.<br>The Public Disclosure Commission is looking at a larger question of whether the WEA is circumventing a 1992 law that made it harder for unions to use dues for political purposes.<br>Before voters passed the 1992 law, the WEA asked members if they would agree to pay $12 a year for political purposes.  About 80 percent of union members agreed to the charge, and that amount was automatically deducted from their paychecks unless they stopped it.<br>The 1992 law said union members would have to agree each year to the contribution.  Today, only 20 percent of WEA members make the contribution to a political action committee.<br>But opponents of the union contend that hasn't stopped the union from using regular dues for political purposes.<br>Some teachers complained to the PDC last spring.  And in August, the Evergreen Freedom Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Olympia, filed a second complaint.<br>One question concerns the WEA's community outreach campaign.  Members are charged $1 a month in regular dues to support the campaign.  The money goes to voter education, member education, organizing parents and other purposes, Moore said.<br>WEA critics say the outreach campaign is simply the old checkoff system under a new name.<br>But Moore said the WEA is using the outreach money legally and that it is not going to candidates for office.  She could not offer specifics about where the money has gone or whether any has gone to the campaign against the initiatives.<br>Warheit said the PDC is considering whether the outreach program has circumvented the law.

The machine is fueled by the rank-and-file<br>teachers' dues which are supposed to be used for non-political, traditional collective<br>bargaining purposes.  Sadly, the WEA has received an implicit green light from the PDC<br>to continue illegal campaign expenditures."<p>For example:<p>1.  $1.3 million has been extracted from the teachers' paychecks during the past two<br>years and has been illegally spent on undisclosed political activities without teachers'<br>consent.<p>2.  Illegal transfers of money from the WEA to its PAC (WEA-PAC) have been made: <br>a $162,255.00 "loan" made from the "Community Outreach Program" (essentially a<br>WEA money-laundering entity), to the PAC was "forgiven".<p>3.  The WEA-Pac is housed in the WEA building and has no record paying its own<br>sizable administrative expenses, including rent (totaling est. $120,000.00 per year.)   <p>It has been two years since the first Whistle-blowers--a handful of courageous teachers--<br>hired a law firm to take on their case against the WEA for its illegal procurement and<br>political use of their dues.  Teachers have filed numerous complaints with the PDC<br>against the WEA since January. <p>Frustrated by the PDC's lack of initiative, the teachers encouraged EFF to conduct their<br>own investigation.  The serious systematic violations uncovered by EFF are<br>meticulously documented and available to the PDC.  EFF also discovered the<br>existence of an embarrassingly insufficient PDC audit which failed to address teachers' <br>allegations against the WEA (recorded in the PDC's own files).  The PDC staff's has issued<br>conflicting statements regarding future investigations of WEA.<p>Meanwhile, two lawsuits brought against the Union by the teachers have already been<br>successfully settled out of court, suggesting the depth of the violations.  Additional teachers,<br>emboldened by the Union's ongoing violations, have brought a new suit.  Yet, however<br>successful the teachers' lawsuits may be, action on the part of the PDC is urgently required: <br>any settlement loss sustained by the WEA's political machine is peanuts compared to what its<br>illegally-funded political agenda stands to lose if forced to comply with the law.  Forced<br>compliance with the law, simply stated, would very likely bankrupt the WEA-PAC before the<br>all-important November elections.<p>All of this should have lit a fire under the PDC months ago.  <br>It didn't.  Meanwhile the largest PAC represented at the Democratic Convention in Chicago this<br>week is the Teachers Union;  700 Union delegates (or spouses of), paid to attend by the Union,<br>are all primed to push forward their agenda.<p>Meanwhile back at home, the WEA bosses illegally make ready a multi-million dollar<br>political campaign targeted against candidates, and initiatives:  $1.4 million is budgeted<br>through August alone just to defeat Initiatives 177 and 173.<p>On August 26 the Evergreen Freedom Foundation brought two requests before the PDC for their<br>immediate attention:<p>1.  Place an immediate injunction on all political spending by the WEA and its affiliates<br>until an audit which actually attends to the evidence the PDC has access to, can be<br>completed.<p>2.  Direct the PDC staff to make this audit a priority, hiring outside staff if necessary, for<br>a timely completion.<p>The WEA will doubtless continue to claim that very few of the dollars collected from teacher's<br>pay checks are spent on political activity.  However a review of their books resoundingly<br>contradicts their public statements.<p>"A society is only as free as its elections are fair:  hence the important role of The Public<br>Disclosure Commission as the watchdog of campaign finance regulations," Williams stated.<p>The EFF has offered to sit down with the PDC to review the extensive evidence.<p>Included is a copy of EFF's summary material presented to the PDC regarding the WEA<br>violations and cover-up.   <p>                           <CENTER># # # # # </CENTER>                      <p>August 26, 1996<p>Susan Harris<br>Public Disclosure Commission<br>PO Box 40908<br>Olympia, WA 98504-0908<p>Dear Susan,<p>     Numerous teachers have contacted us over the past few years upset about how<br>their union, the Washington Education Association, (WEA) is misspending teacher<br>collective bargaining dollars.  As a citizen advocate and government watchdog group,<br>our Foundation is keenly interested in such matters.<p>     Our subsequent investigation of the WEA has uncovered an unfortunate pattern<br>of illegal expenditures and activities.  In fact, we estimate the Washington Education<br>Association (WEA) and its affiliate organizations have illegally spent nearly $4<br>million for political purposes during the past two years alone.<br>     This letter details the three principal charges we are leveling against WEA and<br>their affiliates.<p>     1.  WEA has illegally taken $1.3 million from teachers' salaries during the<br>past two years and has violated the law by spending all or most of the $1.3 million<br>on political activities. <p>     2.  Illegal transfers of money were made from WEA to PULSE (now called<br>WEA-PAC) amounting to $162,255 to be used for political purposes.<p>     3.  Illegal administrative expenditures were made by WEA on behalf of<br>WEA-PAC totaling an estimated $120,000 per year.<br>      The WEA clearly intends to make similar, or greater financial expenditures in the<br>upcoming fall elections.  In a Seattle Times interview on April 9, 1996, Robert Maier,<br>lobbyist for WEA, discussed how WEA gets around expenditure limits.  Maier says<br>money spent by independent expenditure groups in 1996 "will be amazing" because of<br>the "higher stakes."<p>     James Seibert, WEA Executive Director, said in the association's June newsletter,<br>"Between now and election day, the education community--including WEA--must set<br>aside many of our routine and traditional activities and focus our energies and resources<br>on electing officials who share our vision for public education.  We also must defeat<br>those candidates and initiatives that ultimately could destroy the institution of public<br>education."  Activity by WEA such as Seibert calls for is illegal.<p>     Because of the seriousness of these charges, and because of the impending<br>elections, we ask that, by September 20th, the PDC complete an investigation of the<br>longstanding charges against WEA contained in this letter.  <br>     <br>     We also ask that an injunction be placed on all WEA-PAC expenditures until these<br>issues are resolved.<p>     For your information, the key pieces of evidence used in this document are: IRS 990<br>reports, independent audit reports and WEA-PAC and PULSE PDC records all from years 1992,<br>1993 and 1994 (PDC includes 1995).  Also used are testimony and exhibits from the April 1996<br>arbitration hearing, the WEA Action newsletters and Jim Seibert's letter to teachers statewide<br>titled "Setting the Record Straight."<p>                      <CENTER><B>WEA Charges Detailed<br></B></CENTER><br><B>1. Details of the $2.6 million Community Outreach Fees Violation </B><br>     WEA is spending a lot of money for political purposes that is not being reported.  One<br>of the major violations is occurring using what is called the Community Outreach Program Fees-<br>-a mandatory program assessment of $12 per teacher per year.  This $12 per year, per teacher<br>alone adds up to approximately $1.3 million in income for WEA over the last two years.  James<br>Seibert, WEA's Executive Director, acknowledges that the Community Outreach Program<br>money will be spent to "carry on politically-related activities in local communities and to cover<br>WEA's soft money costs in order to preserve hard money for political contributions."<p>     But current law under Initiative 134 requires an annual written authorization by<br>employees for employers to withhold wages for political contributions (RCW 42.17.650). <p>     When Initiative 134 was passed by the voters, WEA stated it didn't apply to their<br>members because they are not public employees.  But an AG opinion from Roselyn Marcus<br>dated December 14, 1992 determined that the Initiative does apply to teachers and that annual<br>written authorization for PAC contributions must be obtained.<p>     After WEA-PAC contributions became voluntary under I-134, the number of teachers<br>giving to the political organization (PULSE, and now WEA-PAC) plummeted.  The Community<br>Outreach Program, with its $12 mandatory fee--identical to the amount previously mandated by<br>the PAC--is a direct attempt to recoup this loss.<p>     But WEA has not reported contributions or expenditures from these "politically-related<br>activities" to the PDC.  This  violates existing state law.<p>     When pressed for details, the WEA told teachers that funds from this new fee would be<br>used to begin repaying loans previously made from WEA to WEA-PAC--also a violation of state<br>law.  In other words, WEA cannot even legally collect the money much less spend it.  <p>     To support this point, it should be noted that WEA does not require this $12 from<br>agency-fee payers because it is not viewed as a legitimate bargaining expense.<p>     Most, if not all of these expenditures are political and as such (1) violate the state law<br>that forbids automatic dues checkoff, and (2) must be reported to the PDC.  <p><B>2. Details of Illegal Transfers of $162,255 (Attachments #1 and #4)</B><p>     PDC records show WEA loaned $117,115 to PULSE (now called WEA-PAC) on August<br>31, 1994.  A second loan of $45,140 was made on December 21, 1994 bringing the total of<br>teacher funds loaned to the political action committee by WEA to $162,255.<p>     On January 3, 1995, WEA forgave the $162,255 loans.  In other words, WEA loaned<br>mandatory collective bargaining dues to a political action committee. <p>     In December 1995, a teacher contacted EFF regarding these loans.  He questioned<br>"forgiving" the loans since that meant teacher union dues and agency fees would have been used<br>for direct, "hard-money" contributions to candidates and ballot measures.  Several teachers filed<br>a PDC complaint in this regard on February 6, 1996.<p>     But a different version of intent was given by Mr. Maekawa, the WEA Treasurer.  He<br>stated, "The loan to PULSE was from WEA funds..." and that "...the loan is being repaid from<br>the Community Outreach Fund."  Upon further questioning by the teachers, Maekawa explained<br>that the fund has repaid $65,000 so far, another $65,000 is budgeted this year, and after that,<br>the balance "may be forgiven" altogether.   <p>     Mr. Seibert furnished two different answers regarding the loans and the mandatory fee<br>assessed to each WEA member.  In his January 26th letter, Seibert states WEA began repaying<br>the loan from the Community Outreach dues and that the 1995-96 Association budget includes<br>a second loan payment of $65,000 to be transferred from Community Outreach funds to the<br>WEA general fund.  Seibert said WEA will make its third and final payment for the balance of<br>the loan plus accrued interest in 1996-97.  <br>     Seibert's second version came several months later in his sworn testimony to the<br>Arbitration panel (April 24, 1996) when he said the loans would not be repaid.<p>     Seibert also says that both the 1994-95 Association budget and annual independent audit,<br>along with the 1995-96 Association budget, clearly show repayment of the loan.  But in fact,<br>they do not. The actual expenditure report WEA passed out at the arbitration hearing shows<br>no funds have been repaid on the loan (See attachment #2). <p>     The IRS reports submitted by WEA do not mention a loan.  The independent audit does<br>not reveal a loan (See attachments #3 and #4) .<p>     Any way they want to tell the story, what WEA is doing is illegal.<p>     <B>In order to fully investigate this matter, the following questions must be answered:</B><p>1. When were the loans approved by the WEA Board?<br>     If it was a loan, and the independent audit says it was not, the dates must be obtained<br>     from WEA Board minutes.<p>2. What were the terms of the loans?<br>     Records turned in to the PDC indicate the "loans" were promissory notes with 6.5%<br>     interest.  The WEA Board minutes would indicate the rest of the terms.<p>3. When were loan checks written from WEA to PULSE?<br>     (Copies of canceled checks can be obtained.)<p>4. When were the loans reported to the PDC?<br>     PDC records reflect the first loan for $117,115 was issued on 8\8\95 and reported to<br>     PDC on 8\31\94.  The second loan for $45,140 was made on 12\12\94 and reported to<br>     PDC on 12\21\94.<p>5. When were the loans forgiven and who authorized it?<br>     PDC records show that the loans were forgiven on Jan 3, 1995.  Did the WEA Board<br>     meet between December 21, 1994 and January 3, 1995?  If so, a copy of the Board<br>     minutes authorizing the write-off should be procured.  <p>     Transcripts of a 1996 arbitration hearing indicate WEA never intended the<br>     $162,255 to be a loan. (See attachment #)  This being the case it was an illegal<br>     contribution.  If it was intended to be a loan write-off, WEA should have reported<br>     an in-kind donation to PULSE for the amount of the loan written off.  This was<br>     not done making either tactic a violation.<p>6. Why did the amount of the forgiven loans not include any interest that was due? <br>     According to PDC records the loans were a 6.75% interest-bearing promissory note.<p><B>3. Details of Illegal Administrative Expenditures </B><p>     Until the 1994 "loans," WEA-PAC (PULSE) had a long history of paying for administra-<br>tive and overhead costs associated with the day-to-day operation of WEA-PAC.  But in  1995<br>and 1996, WEA-PAC has reported no administrative costs to the PDC.  Yet the WEA-PAC<br>office is a physical place, located in the WEA headquarters in Federal Way, still presumably<br>requiring routine office expenses; i.e. rent, employee wages, benefits, state and federal tax<br>withholdings, telephone, utilities, postage, copy machines, office supplies, computers, etc.<p>     In fact, WEA is picking up the administrative costs for WEA-PAC.  Their 1995<br>independent audit report states, "The Association is affiliated with the Washington Education<br>Association--Political Action Committee (WEA-PAC) whose primary purpose is to advance the<br>political needs of employees in public education....Effective September 1, 1994, the Association<br>pays all WEA-PAC administrative costs."  <p>     The independent audit report for 1993 and 1994 states the following: "The Association<br>[WEA] provides PULSE with office and staffing requirements under an advance and<br>reimbursement policy."  This audit shows that WEA paid $117,115 in PULSE administrative<br>expenses in 1994.  <br>     In addition, the audit report confirms that WEA paid WEA-PAC administrative expenses<br>totaling $162,255.  However, these expenditures were not reported to the PDC by either WEA<br>or WEA-PAC.<p>     Interestingly, in 1994 PULSE paid WEA $6,503.50 monthly for what they categorize as<br>salary, rent and data.  That alone totals $78,040 and doesn't include the costs of any special<br>PAC mailings.  <p>     We estimate WEA-PAC's administrative costs to be at least $120,000 per year.<p>     Due to the seriousness of these charges I am requesting that the PDC:<br>     1. Issue an injunction on all WEA-PAC expenditures until these issues are resolved. <br>The amount of apparent illegal activity by WEA-PAC exceeds the cash balance.<br>     2. Require WEA to repay all teachers (from April 1994 to the current time) for<br>whom they do not have signed authorizations for the $12 per year. !! # of teachers!!<br>     3. Require the WEA-PAC to repay the loan to WEA and fine WEA for willful<br>campaign violations.<br>     4. Require WEA to report all political expenditures as required by our public<br>disclosure law.  All contributions in excess of campaign limits should be refunded to WEA<br>by WEA-PAC.<br>     5. Audit all income and expenditures in the Community Outreach Program for 1994<br>to present.<p>     Three sections of RCW 42.17.010 stand out regarding these apparent violations.  "It is<br>hereby declared by the sovereign people to be the public policy of the state of Washington:<br>     (1)"That political campaign and lobbying contributions and expenditures be fully<br>disclosed to the public and that secrecy is to be avoided...."<br>     (10)"That the public's right to know of the financing of political campaigns and lobbying<br>and the financial affairs of elected officials and candidates far outweighs any right that these<br>matters remain secret and private...."<br>     (11)..."The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote complete<br>disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political campaigns and lobbying."<p>     Susan, I am a former governmental auditor and CPA.  I want to assure you that I do<br>have documentation for all the charges contained in this letter.  If you need any additional<br>information, please contact me.<br>                              Cordially,<p><br>                              Bob Williams<p><p>                         <CENTER>  # # # # #  </CENTER>                      <p><br>Please refer to the following letters: Barbara Amidon and Cindy Omlin (2/6/96), John<br>Wright (5/17/96), Jeff Leer (undated), Bob Williams (7/9/96 and 7/23/96) <p><p>               <B><CENTER>Timelines and Conflicting Stories</CENTER></B><br>  <br>     Serious discrepancies arise when reviewing the timeline of money loaned, forgiven,<br>transferred, etc.<br>  <br>April 1994     Community Outreach Program is approved and each WEA member is<br>               assessed $12 in program dues effective in the fall of 1994.<br>  <br>Aug. 31, 1994  WEA loaned PULSE $117,115.<br>  <br>Sept. 13, 1994 PULSE reported loan to PDC.<br>  <br>Sept. 14, 1994 PDC received PULSE's report (PDC# 2584-EZ).<br>  <br>Nov. 4, 1994   The WEA Audit Report for 1993 and 1994 states, "On August 31, 1994,<br>               the Association paid $117,115 to an affiliated organization [PULSE] for<br>               reimbursement of the affiliate organization's administrative expenses<br>               for the period January 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994.  Revenue from a<br>               dues increase will be used to offset this expenditure."  <br> <br>               Note: the auditors do not call these expenditures a loan.  <br> <br>               The auditor goes on to state "Subsequent to August 31, 1994, the Board<br>               of Directors approved reimbursement of additional expenses totaling<br>               approximately $45,000." <br> <br>               The auditor says the $162,255 is for additional expenses and not a loan. <br>               If this is the case, these apparent in-kind expenditures by WEA were not<br>               reported to the PDC as required by law.<br> <br>     Note the discrepancies.  The auditor does not state that the $162,255 are loans.  In fact,<br>he states they are reimbursements for the affiliate organization's administrative expenses. <br>Auditors are precise as to timing.  Note he says the expenses are for the period of January 1,<br>1994 to July 31, 1994.  This conflicts with Seibert's comments in "Setting the Record Straight<br>on WEA's Loan to PULSE" in which Seibert says $100,000 was for calendar year 1993.<br> <br>Dec. 21, 1994  WEA loaned $45,140 to PULSE which brought total of loan to $162,255. <br>               This is the same $45,000 referred to by the above auditor's report.  Since<br>               the auditor's report was dated November 4, 1994 and it clearly<br>               indicated that this was not a loan, how could PULSE report it to the<br>               PDC as a loan on December 21, 1994?  Thus, PULSE incorrectly<br>               reported it to the PDC as a loan and delayed reported the expenditures<br>               until after the election.<br> <br>     Observation: On January 1, 1995, PULSE shows a balance of $408,716.40 after<br>receiving the second loan in December of $45,140.  One wonders why a "loan" was necessary.<p>Jan. 3, 1995   WEA loan to WEA-PAC was forgiven.<br> <br>Jan. 5, 1995   WEA-PAC reported the $45,140 loan to PULSE to PDC.  Note this was<br>               reported after the loan was allegedly forgiven.<br> <br>Jan. 6, 1995   PDC received WEA-PAC report (PDC# 0065-6EZ)<br> <br>Feb. 9, 1995   WEA-PAC reported that the loan had been forgiven on January 3, 1995.<p>Feb. 13, 1995  PDC received WEA-PAC report (PDC #0445-4EZ).<br> <br>Mar. 15, 1995  PULSE reported to the PDC by FAX that the loan was still outstanding. <br> <br>Mar. 16, 1995  PDC received PULSE report(PDC # 0765-2EZ). <p>Nov. 2, 1995   1995 WEA audit report reports, "During the fiscal year ended August 31,<br>               1995, the Association reimbursed WEA-PAC for pre-September 1, 1994<br>               administrative expenses totalling $45,140 ($117,115 -1994)"  Note: these<br>               expenditures were not reported by WEA-PAC to the PDC.  <br> <br>Jan. 26, 1996  Letter from Seibert to Local Association Presidents, UniServ Presidents,<br>               UniServ staff/office copy "Setting the Record Straight on WEA's Loan to<br>               PULSE" <p>Apr. 24, 1996  At the Arbitration Hearing, Mr. Seibert confirmed WEA would not repay<br>               the loan.  Mr. Seibert stated that "...the loan is not being paid back from<br>               WEA-PAC in order to preserve the funds in WEA-PAC."  <p> <CENTER>  # # # # #  </CENTER>     <br>end.

The foundation says the practice is banned by citizen Initiative 134, passed by voters in 1992.  The initiative overhauled campaign finance laws.<p>The foundation's president, Bob Williams, a Republican who lost the 1988 governor's race, asked the PDC to stop the teachers union from all political spending until the case is resolved.<p>Union spokeswoman Teresa Moore dismissed Williams' claims as politically motivated.<p>"As a former Republican candidate for governor and an outspoken critic of public education, Bob Williams is following the Dole campaign's lead in attacking teachers and their unions," Moore said in a statement.  "We are confident that we have followed all PDC rules and guidelines."<p>The foundation's claim was accompanied by a news release that criticized the PDC for not investigating the allegations earlier this year after a handful of teachers filed complaints.<p>Melissa Warheit, executive director of the PDC, said the case was put on hold while the commission's staff struggled with a heavy workload of cases, including one involving Republican gubernatorial candidate Dale Foreman that is subject of hearings this week.<p>Now that many of those cases have been resolved, she said the foundation's claims against the WEA "will be the No. 1 priority."<p><CENTER>######</CENTER><p>end of article.<br>

<P>One of the challenges by opponents of school choice is &quot;Where is the research proof?&quot;  Aside from the fact that there is such proof, and ample practical experience, this might carry more weight if they would first apply this standard to the present system.</P>
<P>Where, for example, is research justifying building a box, called a school, which is filled with smaller boxes, called classrooms, in which rows of students face the front of the room, before a teacher who typically talks 70-80% of the time, that is, three to four times as much as all of the students combined?</P>
<P>Few activities in schools, government or independent, are based upon research, and the older they are the less evidence there is that they are justified. Worse yet, much schooling directly contradicts research findings.  Some large schools have a long history.  Santa Monica, California high school was reported to have 8,000 students as far back as 1961. </P>
<P>Generally, consolidation of schools, and school districts, has taken place in the past 40 years, since the appearance in 1959 of James B. Conant's <B>The American High School </B><B>Today</B>, in which he said schools should be bigger.  He didn't specify how big, but he suggested high schools have graduating classes of about 100.  Assuming a four-year school, and a modest dropout rate, that translates into high schools of about 400-500.</P>
<P>Roger Barker and Paul Gump's <B>Big School, Small School</B> (1964) cited hundreds of studies stressing the advantage of small schools.  As they said, &quot;a school should be sufficiently small that all of its students are needed for the enterprises.  A school should be small enough that students are not redundant.&quot;</P>
<P>This was ignored by superintendents and school boards with an &quot;edifice complex.&quot;  By the mid-1980s, said Walter Karp, 63% of all high school students were in schools of 5,000 or more.</P>
<P>A Minnesota study a generation ago concluded that the most economical high schools were those with 38-175 seniors which, again, averages out to about 400 students in a four year school.</P>
<P>Herbert Kiesling found the relation between school size and student performance to be negative over a size range from average daily attendance of fewer than 200 to almost 4,000. That is, as school size increased student performance decreased.</P>
<P>Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner in 1973 cited studies that concluded that the maximum size for what they termed &quot;a humanized school&quot; is about 250. </P>
<P>A decade ago Joe Nathan noted that small schools, whether in a city or small town, tended to have higher achievement rates, less violence, and greater student participation in school activities.  He also reminded us that almost all American presidents have been the products of small towns and small schools.  </P>
<P>Government schools average approximately 500 students - 85,000 schools for 43 million students.  This average would be larger except for the thousands of rural schools where 500 students are not possible.  Even into the 1990s 40% of rural elementary schools had less than 200 students, and 75% of secondary schools fewer than 400.</P>
<P>The average independent school averages only about 200 students - 25,000 schools for about five million students.  This would be smaller except that many urban parochial schools mimic their public neighbors. Having winning sports teams has also played a role in decisions on school size.</P>
<P>Where is the centralized school that was ever built because of a demand by teachers, students, parents or taxpayers?   Overwhelmingly these groups oppose such projects, the closing of a small school often meaning the loss of local neighborhood or community identity, in addition to being contrary to sound educational policy.  Even the claimed economies of scale tend to be rhetorical rather than reality, when factors such as additional bureaucracy and transportation are taken into consideration.   </P>
<P>Research findings about school districts are similar.  Deborah Verstegen, in the <B>Journal of Educational Finance</B>, fall 1990, noted &quot;...data from New Jersey ...found, in 'all cases, larger district enrollments are associated with lower test scores.'&quot;  <I>In all cases</I>.</P>
<P>Such findings have been regularly reported in the general press as well as educational and research journals - and just as regularly ignored.</P>
<P>Thomas Toch, in <B>The Washington Post</B>, October 20, 1991, commented on the closer relationships between students and teachers in smaller schools, which have consequences beyond just the academic, although related.  He cited a 1987 study that found student dropout rates in schools with more than 2,000 students are twice those in schools with fewer than 667.  A 1988 review reported there is more class cutting, absenteeism and classroom disorders in the larger schools.  More recently, similar conclusions regarding attendance, dropping out, violence, vandalism, student involvement in activities, and school climate being negatively affected by school size were drawn by Diana Oxley in the <B>PHI DELTA KAPPAN</B> of March 1994.</P>
<P>Even schools of 400-500 may be too large.</P>
<P>Dennis Dunn, in <B>Every Child Is Our Child</B>, 1992, argued that the maximum size for any school should be 200-215, and that Ted Sizer, former Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, now at Brown University and the leader of the Coalition of Essential Schools, believes 200 is best.</P>
<P>The story of the growing success over the past 20 years in the East Harlem section of New York City has been told many times, but bears repeating.  Ranking last among the city's 32 subdistricts, the decision was made to seek greater staff involvement and decision-making.  While school choice and size were not part of an original master plan, since no such plan was established, these emerged as two main elements in raising the district from dead last to the middle ranks, although its students are disadvantaged.</P>
<P>In a system where schools had been as large as 2,300 students, all of the modified schools are small, some with only a few dozen students and none with more than a few hundred and about a dozen teachers.</P>
<P>Equally dramatic results occurred in NYC's nearly 70-year-old Julia Richman High School, only 37% of whose 1,800 students graduated and more than 75% of whom were absent on typical day.  In 1993, in collaboration with a local affiliate of Sizer's Coalition of Essential Schools, six smaller high schools were opened.  Attendance and test scores have gone up, dropout rates down, and the schools are safer.</P>
<P>In <B>Education Week</B>, March 22, 1995, Ann Bradley again confirmed that &quot;small schools are much more hospitable places for both students and teachers...&quot;</P>
<P>The charter school movement indicates the value of this approach.  While these are autonomous public schools, they lack the power to tax or compel attendance.  With a few exceptions, such as the Vaughn school in Los Angeles which was a large public school that was granted charter status, they are small, and all are schools of choice.   Some, such as the St. Paul Academy, began with 15 or 20 students, an enrollment which many public school educators maintain makes impossible an effective program.  So much for conventional thinking.</P>
<P>Small schools and schools of choice have many nonacademic advantages as well.  As already mentioned, centralized schools leave many neighborhoods or communities without a school of their own.  Parental involvement, already difficult for disadvantaged families who may feel looked down upon by, or otherwise uncomfortable in, the typical school environment, is further limited when a school is so large that many students live miles away.</P>
<P>Transportation, nonexistent with the dispersion of small neighborhood schools, may become a major cost.  Bureaucracy increases.  A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that, of the nations reviewed, the United States is the only one in which fewer than half of school employees are teachers.  </P>
<P>Resistance to innovation increases; with more staff, students and parents there are more interests whose approval, or at least acquiescence, must be obtained.  This alone is a major argument for school choice. This entire struggle to reform schools would be avoided if each school was an autonomous school of choice.  Political approval would not be needed.</P>
<P>Finally, beginning more or less where we started, as now Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan said in 1969, &quot;the education establishment is resistant to research findings...and will probably remain so...&quot;  So when members of that establishment argue for research evidence, as they almost invariably do when opposing virtually every proposed reform, they should be required to first provide the research base for what they are presently doing.</P>
<P>With few exceptions, they can't do it. Not just because they aren't familiar with the research, which they aren't, but because it rarely exists.</P>

<P>It is impossible to educate students without spending money.  There are also schools, both government and independent, that have minimal funds to do their job.</P>
<P>Having said that, the never-ending appeal by the educational establishment for more money faces at least two major problems.</P>
<P>The first, and most fundamental, is that more money will simply not be forthcoming, at least not in the amounts that educators request.  With the many demands on the public dollar, and growing public resistance to any major spending increases, government schools will do well to receive increases even marginally ahead of inflation.  As the title of a <I>Denver Post</I> article by Al Knight said a few years ago, &quot;If Money's the Solution, That's the Problem.&quot;</P>
<P>Even if money were available in relatively abundant measure, where is the evidence that it would lead to significant improvements?  Per-pupil funding in constant dollars has significantly increased in the past three decades.  Whether one accepts the thesis that results have deteriorated, or that the alleged decline of the schools is a myth, there can be no arguing the fact that gains have not doubled or tripled to keep pace with the expenditure of dollars.</P>
<P>There are school districts where the expenditures are only a few thousand dollars per pupil per year. There are others, in New York and Texas, for example, that spend in excess of $20,000.  Yet where is the district that thinks it is spending enough?</P>
<P>As an aside, it should be noted that the most &quot;elite&quot; K-12 schools in the nation are not the private ones to which this description is usually applied but the high spending suburban districts.   It is the private ones that seek to attract students without regard to geography and that provide financial assistance to those who could not otherwise afford to attend.  Where is the wealthy suburban district that does the same?  They not only do not seek such variety, or offer such assistance, in many instances they have hired security people to check on their students to make sure they are all residents.  No urban, poor, minority or other nonresidents need apply.  </P>
<P>The failure of money to improve results is indicated by two federal reports - 1983's <I>A Nation at Risk</I>, and 1994's <I>Goals </I><I>2000: Educate America Act</I>. </P>
<P>Contrary to those who see some sinister plot to destroy the government schools, neither of these reports was issued by reformers or those who belong to this alleged conspiracy.  The eighteen members of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, who issued <I>A Nation at Risk</I>, included public school administrators, the 1981-82 National Teacher of the Year, the President of Yale University, a Nobel Laureate, a former Governor, and the retired chairman of Bell Labs, among others.   <I>Goals 2000</I> is an act of Congress, which is hardly a hotbed of education reform or radical thought.</P>
<P>And what did these reports say?</P>
<P>The former included one of the most famous remarks ever made about education:</P>
<P><I> </I><I>&quot;If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on </I><I>America the mediocre educational performance that exists </I><I>today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.  As it </I><I>stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves...We </I><I>have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinking, </I><I>unilateral educational disarmament.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I> </I></P>
<P>And they provided specifics:</P>
<P>&quot;International comparisons of student achievement, completed a decade ago, reveal that on 19 academic tests American students were never first or second and, in comparison with other industrialized nations, were last seven times. </P>
<P>&quot;Some 23 million American adults are functionally illiterate by the simplest tests of everyday reading, writing, and comprehension...</P>
<P>&quot;Average achievement of high school students on most standardized tests is now lower than 26 years ago when Sputnik was launched...</P>
<P>&quot;The College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) demonstrate a virtually unbroken decline from 1963 to 1980...</P>
<P>&quot;Both the number and proportion of students demonstrating superior achievement on the SATs (i.e., those with scores of 650 or higher) have also dramatically declined.</P>
<P>&quot;Many 17-year-olds do not possess the 'higher order' intellectual skills we should expect of them.  Nearly 40 percent cannot draw inferences from written material; only one-fifth can write a persuasive essay; and only one-third can solve a mathematics problem requiring several steps.&quot;</P>
<P>Eleven years later, after innumerable reform efforts, the expenditure of more than two trillion dollars, and more words about reform than any society should  have to tolerate, what did Congress say in the <I>Goals 2000: </I><I>Educate America Act</I>?</P>
<P>&quot;The Congress finds that...</P>
<P>&quot;the reforms in education from 1977 through 1992 ...often have been limited to a few schools or to a single part of the educational system.&quot; (p. 35)</P>
<P>&quot;A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the National Education Goals.&quot; (p. 91)</P>
<P>&quot;(A) The current achievement levels of students in the United States are far below those that might indicate competency in challenging subject matter in core content areas.</P>
<P>&quot;(B) During the last 20 years, relatively little changed in how students were taught.  Despite much research suggesting better alternatives, classrooms continue to be dominated by textbooks, teacher lectures, short-answer activity sheets, and unequal patterns of student attention.</P>
<P>&quot;(C)...the differences in performance between Caucasian students and their minority counterparts remain unacceptably large...the gender gap in mathematics...still remains at higher levels of problem solving.  Too little progress has been made in reducing gender performance gaps favoring males in science and females in writing.' (p. 112)</P>
<P>&quot;(A) The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace.  Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year. At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate 4 years later and many more students from high-poverty backgrounds leave school with skills that are inadequate for today's workplace.  Student</P>
<P>performance in many inner city neighborhoods grows worse each year...</P>
<P>&quot;(D) An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas where there are large concentrations of children who live in poverty.&quot; p. 115</P>
<P>&quot;Many elementary and secondary schools in the United States--</P>
<P> (i) are structured according to models that are ineffective and rely on notions of management and governance that may be outdated or insufficient for the challenges of the next century; and</P>
<P> (ii) are unsuccessful in equipping all students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed as citizens and in the working world.&quot; p. 119</P>
<P>&quot;(A)...Disappointing student performance on achievement tests and licensure examinations, declining rates of postsecondary education persistence and completion among minorities, and other troubling trends in the quality of postsecondary education...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;(C) The more than 1,000,000 men and women incarcerated in the prisons and jails in the United States are among the most severely educationally disadvantaged in the United States, with high rates of functional illiteracy and extremely low levels of educational attainment.&quot; p. 121</P>
<P>&quot;(A) education research...is not having the impact on the schools...that such research should;</P>
<P>&quot;(B) relevant education research and resulting solutions are not being adequately disseminated to and used by the teachers...</P>
<P>&quot;(C) there are insufficient linkages...to ensure that research on effective practice is disseminated and technical assistance provided to all teachers...</P>
<P>&quot;(F) teachers have little control over what inservice education teachers will be offered.&quot; pp 140-141</P>
<P>This is progress?  Note that a span of eleven years is almost an entire educational cycle.  Virtually all of the students in 1983 were gone by 1994, too many of whom (a majority?) have lost their educational opportunity forever.</P>
<P>How many more trillions must be spent, and millions of citizens destined to live at the margins of society, before it is realized that this system must be opened up, that, for too many, the benefits of schooling as usual are minimal, if not disastrous?</P>

<P>Most readers of this newsletter know that in 1990-91 Wisconsin approved a proposal by Rep. Annette &quot;Polly&quot; Williams for the Milwaukee Public School District's 97,000 students, and to the number of eligible nonpublic schools that could participate, the program has been growing slowly each year.  About 750 students received government-funded tuition vouchers in 1993-94 to attend any one of a dozen non-religious private schools in that city.</P>
<P>Less well-known is a privately funded school-choice program begun in 1992 by PAVE, Partners Advancing Values in Education.  PAVE scholarships may be used at any private school in Milwaukee, including religious schools.  Contrary to those who argue modest grants will not help low-income people, PAVE, like most private programs, is for such parents and provides maximum grants of $1000 at the elementary and middle-school level and $1,500 for high-school students.  Eligibility is limited to families with incomes less than 185% of the poverty level.</P>
<P>PAVE funded 2,370 students in 1993-94 - up from 2,089 the year before, 1992-93 - who attended 102 private schools. One such parent was Valerie Barrett who, with her two children, took part in REACH conferences of December 1993 and May 1994.  In 1993-94 PAVE received an additional 2,200 applications. </P>
<P>Even Williams' Milwaukee Parental Choice Program turns away students every year because of the lack of capacity due to the limited number of eligible schools.</P>
<P>Another significant factor is that the PAVE program is reportedly the largest private program in the nation and also the only one to operate alongside a government-supported school choice program.</P>
<P>Critics who like to say the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program program isn't successful are not in Milwaukee, rarely quote Milwaukee sources, and ignore the much larger, inclusive private PAVE program.</P>
<P>A Wisconsin Policy Research Report gives the results of a random sample of 1,000 adult, black/African-American Milwaukee residents conducted in January.  They paint quite a different picture than some would have you believe is the case.</P>
<P><B>Q:</B><B> </B><B>Should Parents have the Right to Choose their local school?</B></P>
<P><B>A:</B> 95.2% said yes; </P>
<P>  3.4% said no; </P>

<P> 16.3% Milwaukee Public</P>
<P> 14.1% DK/DR.  </P>
<P>Given the margin of error this is essentially the same as a 1990 survey that found 72% believed the private schools are better.</P>
<P><B>Q:</B><B> </B><B>Have Milwaukee Schools Improved in 5 Years?</B>  </P>
<P><B>A:</B> 21% said yes</P>
<P> 22.3% felt they stayed the same</P>
<P> 47% thought they have gotten worse </P>
<P>  9.7% didn't know/didn't respond.</P>
<P><B>Q:</B><B> </B><B>Suppose that you had a child in the local Milwaukee public school, and that the government gave you a voucher worth $3,500 which </B><B>you could use to enroll your child in any school--public, private, or church-related. Would you use that voucher to enroll your child in a </B><B>different public school from your local school, in a private school, in a church-related school, or would you keep your child in the same </B><B>public school he or she would be in right now?</B></P>
<P><B>A:</B> 41.5% said they would use a private school </P>
<P> 28.5% would remain with their present public school </P>
<P> 18.5% would utilize a church-related school</P>
<P>  5.4%  would transfer to a different public school</P>
<P>  5.7%  didn't know or didn't respond.</P>
<P><B>Q:</B><B> </B><B>Is Today's Education Better Than Your Own?</B> </P>
<P><B>A:</B> 48.1% said it is worse</P>
<P> 40.3% said it is better</P>
<P>  7.9% viewed it as the same</P>
<P>  3.7% didn't know or didn't respond.</P>
<P>Then the following question was asked about the state program:</P>
<P><B>Q:</B><B> </B><B>A choice plan is currently being offered to low income parents in Milwaukee.  Under this plan some parents can choose to send their </B><B>children to a local public or private school, but not to a parochial school.  Would you favor or oppose expanding this choice program to </B><B>include parochial schools?</B></P>
<P><B>A:</B> 70.5% favor including parochial schools (more than three times those opposed)</P>
<P> 21.7% opposed</P>
<P>  7.8% didn't know/didn't respond.</P>
<P>This is interesting given the other response that fewer than 19% would themselves use a voucher at a parochial school.</P>
<P>Milwaukeeans clearly know where they stand on this issue, despite claims made by school choice opponents, few of whom have ever been near the city. </P>
<P>On a different topic, when asked about placing the <B>Educational Emphasis on Basics vs. Building Confidence</B></P>
<P><B>A:</B> 60% favored the basics</P>
<P> 33.2% building confidence and self-esteem</P>
<P>  6.8% didn't know/didn't respond.</P>
<P>Rep. Williams has herself often said that minorities are more interested in education than integration.  The survey tested sentiment on this issue as well, asking:</P>
<P><B>Q:</B><B> </B><B>If the Milwaukee Public Schools had the opportunity to increase learning among all students by reducing the degree of integration, </B><B>would you approve or disapprove of this?</B></P>
<P><B>A:</B> 55.3% approved, indicating their belief that, given the choice, education is of primary importance</P>
<P> 36.8% said they disapproved of this tradeoff</P>
<P>  7.9% didn't know/didn't respond.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, older people are more satisfied with the public schools, or have more reservations about major reforms such as school choice.  This has been the result in other surveys as well.  This may be because of the Good Old Days Syndrome, and because schools years ago didn't face some of the serious problems of today.  Also, in earlier times fewer students remained through high school graduation so those who did graduate were more accepting of the school environment.  </P>
<P>There was one exception to this in Milwaukee, however.  Those 55 to 64 thought schools have improved a bit but those 65 and over were quite critical of today's school system.</P>
<P>The number of those who would use private or parochial schools is up 5% from the 1990 survey  and is now five times the number of those who actually use such schools today.</P>
<P>Although the 28.5% who would use the same public school is low, it is still higher than the overall negative view of the Milwaukee public schools in general.  As is often the case, with education, with Congress, etc., the public's general view is more critical than is the specific view of their own school, Congressman, etc.</P>
<P>Most significantly of all, though, is the 95.2% that agreed parents should have the right to select the school their child(ren) attend.  It is almost unheard of for polls to find 95% of the public agreeing on anything.  You could almost ask if they think the sun will come up in the east in the morning and 4.8% might be expected to say no, or not answer. </P>
<P>Janet R. Beales and Maureen Wahl of the Reason Foundation have also issued a report on the PAVE program which found that students therein, who have the much wider choice of schools to attend, outperform both Milwaukee Parental Choice Program and Milwaukee Parental Public School students on standard tests.</P>
<P>Parents said educational quality was the most important reason they chose a particular school.  Ninety-six percent were satisfied with what their child was learning.  This would seem to have a bearing on why nonpublic schools of all types tend to have fewer problems with discipline than the public schools, not to mention violence.  Regardless of age, when we have more control over our lives and are where we want to be, we are less likely to have or cause problems.</P>
<P>Remember, despite other claims of school choice opponents, these are not handpicked students.  They are from low-income families, 57% headed by a single parent. Participating private schools may not screen applicants.  Acceptance or rejection is based on capacity.  If more apply than can be accepted, a random lottery is used.  </P>
<P>Although this year's survey found many who thought the Milwaukee Public Schools have improved in the last five years, the Reason Foundation study notes that 79% of the students graduated from high school in 1971; by 1993 just 44% did.  Today's graduates have a 2.18 grade point average, on a four-point grading scale.  This despite the fact that per pupil spending has increased 21% from 1973 to 1993, from $5,820 to $7,030, in 1993 constant dollars.</P>
<P>Consistent with this finding is a statement by Rep. Williams that 60% of Milwaukee Public School students drop out of high school.  More disturbing, she said that one-quarter of the remainder, 10% of the original group, graduate with minimal academic skills.</P>
<P>Those who claim school choice will leave the poorest students behind are describing many public school districts, and not just Milwaukee.</P>
<P>In Harrisburg, PA, where this is being written, 75% of the students live below the poverty level; 60% are from single parent homes; 70+% are black; and about 15% are Hispanic.  </P>
<P>Who has been left behind?  The poor.  Those who can flee have already done so, by moving out, or by sending their own children to a nonpublic school.  Not least among these &quot;escaping&quot; (remember, that National Education Association President Keith Geiger has said we can't allow students to escape - which would indicate they are prisoners) are the teachers in these public systems.</P>

<P>O1</P>
<P>ne of the most famous government reports ever issued was 1983&quot;s <I>A Nation At Risk</I>, which concluded that the nation's public schools were engulfed in &quot;a rising tide of mediocrity&quot;, and that if any other nation did to us what we are doing to ourselves we would consider it an act of war.</P>
<P>It might be well to recall that the report spoke of public schools as a system, not as isolated situations here and there, or just in inner-city schools, or whatever.  They were speaking of the suburban schools as well, where parents and the public are all to willing to believe that their schools are good schools, regardless of any evidence to the contrary, or without making any effort to determine whether this is true or not.</P>
<P>To a large degree parents, taxpayers and the general public are content as long as schools are open (no strikes), are quiet (no violence), the students seem to be achieving (report cards have good grades, even if they happen to be inflated ones), and the students don't complain (which they rarely do as long as they aren't hassled too much and their report cards keep mom and dad satisfied).</P>
<P>If you live in such a district, it isn't necessary to conduct an investigation, with which the system probably will not cooperate.</P>
<P>Try a few simple tests of your own. To be fair, you might do this even if your youngster attends a nonpublic school.  After all, you should be concerned with your child's educational attainments, regardless of the school he or she attends.</P>
<P>Obtain an outline map of the United States and hand it to your son or daughter and ask them to identify the states.  As a teacher who did this several times each year with 11th graders, I found that few could get more than 10 or 15 right the first time, and many couldn't even identify Pennsylvania.  By repeating this periodically through the year, however, most of them could eventually identify most states.</P>
<P>This is not a trivial matter.  Those who cannot picture in their minds where the states are will have little understanding of such references.</P>
<P>Or, the next time you stop at the bank ask for a check register.  They are free.  Fill in a page or two with some expenses, deposits, check fees, and bank interest, such as appear in your own regular statement.  But don't do any of the computation.  See if your favorite student can accurately balance the figures, a matter of simple addition and subtraction.  The National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tests indicate that most 17-year-olds cannot do this.</P>
<P>Find some relatively easy crossword puzzles for them to complete.  These test both knowledge, even if it is sometimes trivia, and the ability to spell words correctly.</P>
<P>You may be surprised by the outcome of such simple home tests.</P>
<P>I2</P>
<P>n any event, by 1994, eleven years after <I>A Nation at Risk</I>, innumerable attempts to reform the public schools, and the expenditure of more than $2,000,000,000,000 (that's two trillion dollars, no misprint), what has been achieved?</P>
<P>According to Congress, not much.</P>
<P>Last year the Congress adopted the <I>GOALS 2000: EDUCATE AMERICA ACT</I>.  Ignoring the merits or demerits of that 231 page measure, which are still being debated and may or may not be modified or repealed by the current session of Congress, consider the findings which were used to justify its enactment and specific provisions.</P>
<P>&quot;The Congress finds that-</P>
<P>&quot;...the reforms in education from 1977 through 1992 have achieved some good results, but such reform efforts to often have been limited to a few schools or to a single part of the educational system&quot; (p. 34)</P>
<P>&quot;A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the national education goals.&quot; (p. 91)  </P>
<P>Yes.  A majority.  Again.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>&quot;(A) The current achievement levels of students in the United States are far below those that might indicate competency in challenging subject matter in core content areas.</P>
<P>&quot;(B) During the last 20 years, relatively little changed in how students were taught.  Despite much research suggesting better alternatives, classrooms continue to be dominated by textbooks, teacher lectures, short-answer activity sheets and unequal patterns of student attention.</P>
<P>&quot;(C) Despite progress in narrowing the gaps, the differences in performance between Caucasian students and their minority counterparts, remain unacceptably large. While progress has been made in reducing the gender gap in mathematics, such gap still remains at higher levels of problem solving.  Too little progress has been made in reducing gender performance gaps favoring males in science and females in writing.&quot; (p. 112)</P>
<P>&quot;(A) The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace.  Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year.  At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate 4 years later and many more students from high-poverty backgrounds leave school with skills that are inadequate for today's workplace.  Student performance in many inner city neighborhoods grows worse each year.  At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate in four years...</P>
<P>&quot;(B) Rural schools enroll a disproportionately large share of the poor and at-risk students of the United States and yet often lack the means to address effectively the needs of these children...</P>
<P>&quot;(D) An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas where there are large concentrations of children who live in poverty.&quot; (p. 116)</P>
<P>&quot;(A) Many elementary and secondary schools in the United States--</P>
<P>  (i) are structured according to models that are ineffective and rely on notions of management and governance that may be outdated or insufficient for the challenges of the next century; and</P>
<P>  (ii) are unsuccessful in equipping all students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed as citizens and in the working world.&quot; (p. 119)</P>
<P>&quot;Disappointing student performance in achievement tests and licensure examinations, declining rates of postsecondary education persistence and completion among minorities, and other troubling trends in the quality of postsecondary education should be addressed by the United States as part of its overall drive to improve American education...</P>
<P>&quot;The more than 1,000,000 men and women incarcerated in the prisons and jails in the United States are among the most severely educationally disadvantaged in the United States, with high rates of functional illiteracy and extremely low levels of educational attainment...an estimated 90 percent of these individuals are expected to be released by the end of the decade...&quot; (p. 121)</P>
<P>&quot;(A) education research, including research funded by the Office, is not having the impact on the schools of the United States that such research should;</P>
<P> (B) relevant education research and resulting solutions are not being adequately disseminated to and used by the teachers that need such research and solutions. &quot; p. 140</P>
<P>&quot;(C) there are insufficient linkages...to ensure that research on effective practice is disseminated and technical assistance provided to all teachers...</P>
<P> (F) teachers have little control over what inservice education teachers will be offered.&quot; (p. 141)</P>
<P>Is this progress???</P>
<P>This is the &quot;achievement&quot; resulting from eleven years, 2+ trillion public</P>
<P>dollars, and the best efforts of the federal government, fifty state governments and 15,000+ local school districts?</P>
<P>Imagine, if you will, if current trends continue, what we can look forward at the conclusion of the eleven years from 1994-2005, during which 3-4 trillion more dollars will be spent.</P>
<P>For those who tag any discouraging word about schooling as &quot;school bashing,&quot; remember &quot;The Congress finds that&quot; these conditions exist.</P>
<P>As in 1983, these findings are not merely anecdotal or or isolated situations.</P>
<P>&quot;A majority of public schools in the United States are failing...The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace.  Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year...An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas..(Many schools) are structured according to models that are ineffective...(and) are unsuccessful in equipping all students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed...relevant education research and resulting solutions are not being adequately disseminated to and used by the teachers...&quot;</P>
<P>Pardon the repetition but the message seems not to be getting through.</P>
<P>Should we not stop talking about reforming or &quot;restructuring&quot; the system, placing the student first, etc., etc.,  and begin actually doing it?</P>
<P>Is it acceptable to have a public school where the police were called in more than 200 times from September 1994 to March of 1995, an average of nearly twice each school day?  (This is not fiction.  It is a real school.)</P>
<P>What more needs to be said?</P>
<P>How much worse must it become?</P>
<P>How much longer can this be tolerated?</P>
<P>Does anybody care?</P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B><I>Privately Funded Choice Plans</I></B></FONT></H5>
<P>More than a dozen private school choice programs in cities around the nation operate very successfully.</P>
<P>When the Bradley Foundation joined with others to fund scholarships for low-income students in Milwaukee in 1992 all 4,500 applications were picked up the morning after the scholarships were announced.</P>
<P>PAVE's first year report noted immediate gains, with astounding levels of parental involvement.  &quot;Ninety-six per cent of the parents surveyed attended parent-teacher conferences and 67% attended parent-teacher organization meetings.&quot;</P>
<P>More than 90% of the parents said they were &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;Very Satisfied&quot; with teacher performance, discipline, textbooks learning achievement, involvement opportunities and school location.</P>
<P><I>Given the Choice: A Study of the PAVE Program and School Choice in Milwaukee</I>, a recent study from The Reason Foundation, says the program's success is ongoing and low-income students demonstrate higher academic performance in private schools than in public schools. </P>
<P>With state and local officials across the country, including Pennsylvania, Arizona, Connecticut, Kansas, Texas, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin considering adopting or expanding school-choice programs &quot;careful study of existing choice programs is an imperative,&quot; says Janet R. Beales, coauthor of the study.</P>
<P>Ms. Beales, policy analyst with the Reason Foundation, and coauthor Maureen Wahl, director of research for the Milwaukee-based Family Service America, analyzed PAVE's school-choice program, and one implemented by the state, assessing performance gains, demographics, parental satisfaction, and attrition.</P>
<P>The government-run program, the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP), authored by state Rep. Annette &quot;Polly&quot; Williams, began in 1990-91.  It granted roughly 750 tuition vouchers to students in 1993-94 which enabled them to attend any one</P>
<P>of a dozen non-religious private schools in Milwaukee.</P>
<P>Unlike the MPCP, PAVE scholarships may be used at any Milwaukee private school, including religious ones.  In its second year of operation, 1993-1994, PAVE served roughly 2,370 students in 102 different private schools.  Both programs target low-income students, are heavily oversubscribed, and report high levels of parental satisfaction.  Contrary to charges of some opponents, among the top reasons why parents choose a school for their child is education quality and school discipline.</P>
<P>Beales notes that the PAVE program serves over three times as many low-income students as the MPCP but for most of the students it serves the MPCP has been successful. A state-sponsored evaluation found that, while MPCP students were at the bottom of their public school class, they have shown modest academic achievement gains in the choice program.</P>
<P>The Reason Foundation's findings show that PAVE students outperform (MPS) students on standardized tests of academic achievement.  A higher fraction of PAVE students scored at or above the National Percentile Rank (NPR) than other comparison groups.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="mg1.gif" WIDTH = 668 HEIGHT = 211 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></P>
<P> Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge</P>
<P> Inaugural Address, January 17, 1995</P>
<P><I>                             &quot;We will offer Pennsylvania's parents and children quality educational </I></P>
<P><I>                             choices: public; private; and religious.  We will be guided by the only </I></P>
<P><I>                             special interest that really matters -- our children.&quot;</I></P>
<P>The state-funded voucher system has worked so well that Governor Tommy Thompson is proposing its expansion in his 1995-1997 state budget.</P>
<P>If adopted, vouchers worth $3,300 per child, or the actual tuition, whichever is lower, would be provided for Milwaukee students, grades K-12, to attend any school of their choice, whether religious or non-sectarian, with the cost capped at $11.5 million.  In 1997-98, 5,500 students would be eligible and the voucher would be adjusted for inflation.  After that there would be no limit other than the available openings in private schools.</P>
<P>Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, who first had doubts about the Williams proposal, is now an active supporter of its expansion.  He has said that, what has been termed &quot;The GI Bill for Kids will hurt public schools in the same way the original GI Bill hurt public universities: it will help make them the best in the world.&quot;</P>
<P>When PAVE students who attended public schools are compared to those who had only attended private school significant differences in achievement appear.  Public school transfers are consistently lower in math, reading, and composite scores, than those who had only attended private schools.</P>
<P>Based on demographics, the two groups have almost identical economic and family backgrounds.  &quot;This evidence suggests that differences in test scores may be due to prolonged enrollment in private schools of choice,&quot; says Beales. &quot;In other words, the type of school the student attends, public or private, may greatly influence academic performance.&quot;</P>
<P>Beales said, &quot;Our findings suggest that the earlier parents are given the choice of schools, the better their children will perform.  Likewise, the fewer regulatory restrictions placed on choice, the more students will have the opportunity to choose a school that meets their needs.&quot;</P>
<P>While the education establishment opposes such programs, it apparently only does so when they are beyond its control.  Since 1986-87 Milwaukee's school board, in addition to operating its own alternative high schools for at-risk students, has been authorized to contract with outside groups to educate up to 30% of such pupils.  But, of course, the district decides which students it wishes to move out.</P>
<P>Two years ago the state of Wisconsin authorized all school districts to contract for educational services for up to 200 of those at-risk.   They are defined as those in grades 5-12 who are one or more years behind in high school credits or two or more years behind in basic skills.  The students must also be either a dropout a habitual truant, a parent of an adjudicated delinquent.</P>
<P>In 1993-94 the Milwaukee schools had 1,200 such students being educated at 22 sites, and they were paying more than $5,000 for each student.</P>
<P>Milwaukee's public educators have no doubts about the value of school choice, at least for themselves.  It has been reported that 62% of them do not send their own children to the city's public schools.  That indicates their judgment about the quality of the schools within which they work.</P>
<P>This is not unknown in the rest of the nation as well, not only with public educators but with opponents of school choice generally.  As David Boldt of <I>The Philadelphia Inquirer</I> has noted, these opponents have no problem with school choice for themselves.

<P><B>Adapted from </B><B><I>The Wealth of Nations</I></B></P>
<P><B>by Adam Smith, 1776, </B></P>
<P><B>Book V, Chapter 1, Article 2</B></P>
<P>1</P>
<P>In every profession, the exertion of the greater part of those who exercise it, is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of making that exertion.  This necessity is greatest with those to whom the emoluments of their profession are the only source from which they expect their fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence.  In order to get this subsistence they must execute a quantity of work of a known value, and where the competition is free the rivalship of competitors obliges every man to endeavor to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness.</P>
<P>The endowments of schools have necessarily diminished the necessity of application in the teachers.  Their subsistence, so far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions.</P>
<P>Where the teacher is prohibited from receiving any honorary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of the revenue which he derives from his office his interest is set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set it.  </P>
<P>It is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can; and if his emoluments are to be precisely the same, whether he does, or does not perform some very laborious duty, it is certainly his interest, at least as interest is vulgarly understood, either to neglect it altogether, or, if he is subject to some authority which will not suffer him to do this, to perform it in as careless and slovenly a manner as that authority will permit.  If he is naturally active and a lover of labor, it is his interest to employ that activity in any way from which he can derive some advantage, rather than in the performance of his duty, from which he can derive none.</P>
<P>If the authority to which he is subject resides in a group of which he himself is a member, and in which the greater part of the other members are, like himself, persons who either are, or ought to be teachers, they are likely to make a common cause, to be all very indulgent to one another, and every man to consent that his neighbor may neglect his duty, provided he himself is allowed to neglect his own.</P>
<P>If the authority to which he is subject resides in some other extraneous persons it is not very likely that he will be suffered to neglect his duty altogether.  All that such superiors can force him to do, however, is to attend upon his pupils a certain number of hours, that is, to give a certain number of lectures in the week or in the year.  What those lectures shall be must still depend upon the diligence of the teacher, and that is likely to be proportioned to the motives which he has for exerting it.  </P>
<P>Such an extraneous jurisdiction is liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously.  The person subject to such jurisdiction is necessarily degraded by it, and, instead of being one of the most respectable, is rendered one of the meanest and most contemptible persons in the society.</P>
<P>Forcing students to attend any school independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers tends to diminish the necessity of that merit or reputation.</P>
<P>If the teacher who is to instruct each student should not be voluntarily chosen by the students but appointed; and if in case of neglect, inability, or bad usage, the student should not be allowed to change him for another without leave first asked and obtained, such a regulation would not only tend very much to extinguish all emulation among the different tutors but to diminish very much in all of them the necessity of diligence and of attention to their respective pupils.</P>
<P>Discipline is in general contrived not for the benefit of the students but for the interest or ease of the masters.  Its object is, in all cases, to maintain the authority of the master and, whether he neglects or performs his duty, to oblige students to behave to him as if he performed it with great diligence. It seems to presume perfect wisdom and virtue in the one and the greatest weakness and folly in the other.</P>
<P>Where the masters, however, really perform their duty, there are no examples, I believe, that the greater part of the students ever neglect theirs.  No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the attending.</P>
<P>It may be necessary to oblige young children to attend education necessary for them to acquire but after twelve or thirteen, if the master does his duty, compulsion is rarely necessary.</P>
<P>The education for the teaching of which there are no public institutions is generally the best taught.  The three most essential parts of literary education, to read, write, and account, are still more commonly acquired in private than in public schools; and it seldom happens that any body fails to acquire them to the degree necessary.</P>
<P>In general, schools with assured funding have been the slowest in adopting improvements, and the most averse to permit any considerable change in the established plan of education.  Those improvements are more easily introduced where the teachers, depending upon their reputation for the greater part of their subsistence, were obliged to pay more attention to the opinions of the world.</P>
<P>Till about the time of Marcus Antoninus no teacher appears to have had any salary from the public, or to have had any other emoluments but what arose from the honoraries or fees of his scholars.  If the opinion of their own utility could not draw scholars to them, the law neither forced any body to go to them, nor rewarded any body for having gone to them. The teachers had no jurisdiction over their pupils, nor any authority besides that which natural authority and superior virtue and abilities never fail to procure from young people towards those who are entrusted with their education. </P>
<P>In modern times, the diligence of public teachers is corrupted by the circumstances, which render them independent of their success and reputation.  Their salaries put the private teacher, who would compete with them, in the same state as a merchant who attempts to trade without a public subsidy, in competition with those who trade with a considerable one.  Assured funding has thus not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers but has rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones.</P>
<P>Were there no public institutions for education, no system, no science would be taught for which there was not some demand; or which the circumstances did not render either necessary, or convenient, or at least fashionable, to learn.</P>
<P>Were there no public institutions for education a student, with application and abilities, after going through the most complete course of education which the circumstances of the times were supposed to afford, could not come into the world completely ignorant of every thing which is the common subject of conversation.</P>
<P>(In 1776) There are no public institutions for the education of women, and there is accordingly nothing useless, absurd, or fantastical in the common course of their education.  They are taught what their parents or guardians judge it necessary or useful for them to learn; and they are taught nothing else.  Every part of their education tends evidently to some useful purpose. It seldom happens that a man derives any conveniency or advantage from some of the most laborious and troublesome parts of his education.</P>
<P>For a very small expense the public can facilitate, can encourage, and can even impose upon almost the whole body of the people, the necessity of acquiring the essential parts of education.  The public can facilitate this by establishing schools where children may be taught with the master only partly paid by the public. If he is even principally paid by it he will soon learn to neglect his business.</P>
<P>The public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education by obliging every man to undergo an examination in them.</P>
<P>A person without the proper use of the intellectual faculties seems to be mutilated and deformed in a still more essential part of the character of human nature.  Even if the state derived no advantage from the instruction of the people it should still give attention that they should not be altogether uninstructed.  The state, however, derives a considerable advantage from their instruction.  </P>
<P>The more the people are instructed, the less liable they are to the delusions of enthusiasm and superstition which frequently occasion disorders.  An instructed and intelligent people are always more decent and orderly than an ignorant and stupid one.  They each feel more respectable and are more likely to obtain the respect of others.  They are more disposed to examine, and see through, the complaints of faction and are, on that account, less apt to be misled.</P>
<P>In free countries, where the safety of government depends very much upon the favorable judgment which the people may form of its conduct, it must surely be of the highest importance that they should not be disposed to judge rashly or capriciously concerning it.</P>
<P> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</P>
<P>More than two centuries later, does this seem like it's deja vu all over again; or that the more things change the more they stay the same?</P>

<P>Some opponents of school choice are citing an October 1994 <I>Money</I> magazine article as evidence that public schools are as good as private schools.  Aside from the fact that such comparisons, whether made by public or private advocates, are irrelevant to the school choice debate, it is important to note what the article said.</P>
<P>One is reminded of Karl Marx's comment that he was not a Marxist.  What is said is often not what is interpreted by others. Thus the point here is not to criticize the article, but the distortions that some make of it.</P>
<P>One of the article's conclusions is that &quot;Students who attend the best public schools outperform most private school students.&quot;  Of course.  The best in one category are compared with the average in the other.  It is equally true that students in the best private schools outperform most public school students.  Neither finding requires any study.</P>
<P>It is also reported that &quot;The average public school teacher has stronger academic qualifications than the average private school teacher.&quot;  True, and irrelevant.  Study after study has concluded that qualifications such as advanced degrees, years of teaching experience, and certification have no correlation with either teacher effectiveness or student achievement.</P>
<P>Even Arthur Wise, president of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education,said in, of all places, the April 1991 issue of the National Education Association's <I>NEA Today</I>, that &quot;Right now, teacher certification procedures are a joke!&quot;</P>
<P>It was also said that &quot;The best public schools offer a more challenging curriculum than most private schools.&quot;  Again, the best of the public schools are compared with all of the private ones, and the statement could be reversed with equal validity.</P>
<P>According to the article, &quot;Catholic schools beat average publics on student success measures, but not by much&quot;; &quot;in many tough inner cities, Catholic schools often provide the only oasis of educational opportunity&quot;; and, &quot;there is no denying that, overall, the Catholic schools in our sample outperformed the average and disadvantaged public schools on students achievement measures.&quot;  In many instances the majority of the students are non-Catholics as well. </P>
<P>Although it was not reported here, these schools typically spend only one-half to one-third as much as public schools.  While salaries are a part of the reason, &quot;Catholic schools had the largest classes, averaging between 20 to 30 students each.&quot;  </P>
<P>The study also &quot;found the most luxurious buildings in average public school districts.&quot;  Many public school boards and superintendents have an &quot;edifice complex.&quot;</P>
<P>Furthermore, &quot;a fifth of both private and public schools have student bodies that are 50% or more minority,&quot; while &quot;The most racially segregated institutions in our sample are the advantaged public schools.&quot;</P>
<P>There are about 25,000 nonpublic and 85,000 public schools in the nation. Some 20,000 of the latter are high schools.  The <I>Money</I> report &quot;examined 70 public and private schools.&quot;  Of these, they visited 22 and interviewed the other 48 principals by telephone.</P>
<P>Based on this .064 of 1% sample, it is claimed &quot;about 10% of all public schools--about 2,000 nationwide--are as outstanding academically as the nation's 1,500 most prestigious and selective private schools.&quot;  </P>
<P>Besides, can it be seriously maintained that elite suburban schools are &quot;free&quot; of cost?  While reference is made to the cost of private schools none is given for the elite public ones which often spend more per pupil than private schools.  That cost is mostly paid from local sources, primarily the property tax which is deductible from the federal income tax, giving these wealthy citizens a free ride on at least part of the educational support they provide for their children.</P>
<P>That the magazine's readers have incomes above the norm is shown by the suggestion that parents seeking a good public school &quot;move to an affluent district with a top-ranked public school system.&quot;</P>
<P>Aside from the fact that everyone can't move to one of the favored suburban districts, there would be no room for them if they did.  Then there is the impossible barrier of cost.</P>
<P>How much?  Far too much.</P>
<P>&quot;In the most desirable suburbs whose schools we examined, median prices for single-family homes ranged from $156,000 in Birmingham, Mich., a Detroit suburb, to more than $500,000 in Beverly Hills and Kenilworth, Ill., which sends its kids to nearby New Trier High.&quot;  </P>
<P>I t will no doubt be a consolation to Detroit's poor inner-city students and parents to learn that they can improve their educational opportunities by buying a $156,000 home in the suburban community of Birmingham.</P>
<P>Those in Illinois have even a better option.  New Trier High school has been recognized as one of the finest such schools in the nation for years, public or private.  And it is a school available to all who can meet the modest requirement of being able to purchase a $500,000 home.</P>
<P>With average income in this nation being less than $30,000 a year, you see how practical this suggestion is, not only for the poor, disadvantaged and minorities but for the typical American family as well.</P>
<P>The truth is that highly rated suburban schools, which may spend $25,000 or more per pupil per year, an amount spent by few if any elite private schools, are private schools in public school disguise.</P>
<P>They are elite schools for the most affluent Americans, private enclaves excluding 99% of their fellow Americans and virtually 100% of the disadvantaged and minorities.</P>
<P>As indicated at the beginning, the entire article is irrelevant to the school choice debate, a topic which is not part of the article.</P>
<P>No one seriously argues that all private schools are better than all public, or the reverse.</P>
<P>When a high school graduate elects to go to college &quot;A&quot; rather than college &quot;B&quot;, does anyone make odious comparisons between the two institutions?</P>
<P>Of course not.</P>
<P>The same should be true of K-12 education.</P>
<P>Even if, to quote a former Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, &quot;every school a good school&quot; were the norm, individuals would still select one rather than another.</P>
<P>More than that, as the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously decided in 1925, everyone has a constitutional right to school choice, a right that those with means can exercise, either by paying tuition at a nonpublic school or living in &quot;an affluent district with a top-ranked public school system.&quot;</P>
<P>Those without means are in effect denied their constitutional right.</P>
<P>That is the heart of the matter.</P>
<P>School choice is not about comparing schools; it is about individual rights.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B><I>A &quot;Choice&quot; Publication</I></B></FONT></H5>
<P>William Bentley Ball, who was a presenter at the first REACH Alliance School Choice conference in December of 1993,  is perhaps the premier lawyer in the nation on what he regards as two essential educational principles: parental rights in education and the freedom of private education from government domination. </P>
<P>He has been the attorney for cases on religious freedom in education in 22 states and argued ten such cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, including defending the Amish in the <I>Yoder</I> case and arguing for religious educational rights in <I>Lemon v. Kurtzman</I>, which he regards as a decision based on extreme anti-religious bigotry.  Just last year he successfully argued for the right of a deaf student to have a publicly funded sign-language interpreter on Catholic school premises in the <I>Zobrest</I> case, </P>
<P>Bill is the author of a new book, <I>Creatures of the State</I>, the title of which is taken from the 1925 unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruling that school choice is a constitutional right.  It is written for the general reader and is a guidebook to where we stand under current decisions of the Supreme Court and includes his concern, increasingly shared by others, that government control of education has very negative effects.</P>
<P>Among those praising the book are former U.S. Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and Mary Ann Glendon, Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard University.</P>
<P>If you would like to give yourself, or others, a thoughtful and provocative present this holiday season, <I>Mere Creatures of the State</I>, may be ordered for $15.95 ($13.95 plus $2.00 shipping) from CRISIS Books, Box 1006, Notre Dame, IN 46556</P>

<P><B>WHY</B> do opponents of school choice claim it will lead to segregated schools when that is what currently exists in the public school system?</P>
<P>When <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954, 19 of the 20 largest school districts included minority populations but were predominantly white. </P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, if segregation is a concern to defenders of the public school status quo, is it true that in 1994, forty years later, student enrollments in all of the twenty-five largest school districts in the nation are predominantly minority?  Even within these largest districts, segregation exists because of population distribution.  Schools with nearly all-white enrollment and schools with nearly all African-American or all Hispanic within the same district are accepted as normal.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it commonly the case that nonpublic schools in large urban districts have a better racial or economic mix of students than the local public schools?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do some groups claiming to represent minority populations, such as the NAACP, oppose school choice, and even join lawsuits opposing parental choice for those they claim to represent when public opinion polls show that minority citizens now favor school choice by a larger margin than does the general public.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it possible for a poll in Philadelphia by Temple University earlier this year to find that 82% of African-American and Hispanics say they would use a voucher if it were worth $1500, and 90% would do so if it were $3,000, yet the Black Caucus in the Pennsylvania General Assembly opposes making this possible.  Who are they representing?  And for how long will this be possible?</P>
<P>1</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> does the public school establishment say it takes all students when most districts refuse to accept home-schooled students for classes and extracurricular events in which they wish to participate?  These students, after all, do live within the school district's boundaries.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do school districts argue that accepting home schoolers on a part-time basis will cost them money, when it costs them less than if home schooled students attend the school on a fulltime basis. (it may cost about one-twelfth as much to home-school a student, paid for by the parents, as it does to educate them in a public school).  Their parents are taxpayers who actually save the schools money.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, as another argument for treating home schoolers as aliens in the district, is their part-time participation opposed on the grounds of legal liability when, again, if the students decide to attend the district's schools on a regular basis, neither cost nor legalities are raised in an attempt to keep them from doing so.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do the public schools say they take all students when they only take those who live within their district? Many public school districts across the nation, especially in suburban areas, hire investigators to make sure that students from outside their district boundaries do not attend their schools. </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> isn't it recognized that it is the nonpublic schools that accept students without regard to their home address.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do the public schools emphasize that they take all students but rarely talk about how many they retain?  Across the nation 25-30% of public school students drop out - or are, in effect, pushed out, whereas nonpublic schools not only accept almost all of the students who apply but have a very high retention rate as well.  And this applies to nonpublic, and the new charter, schools that are specifically interested in problem students.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do defenders of the status quo charge that student and parental choice is sometimes determined on the basis of geography when the public schools are almost totally established on this basis, that is, students at assigned to each public school on the basis of some arbitrarily drawn attendance line, and those who live within this geographic area must attend that school and no other, not even another similar school in the same district.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do the public schools insist on treating each student as their personal property - they can't be allowed to &quot;escape,&quot; in the words of National Education Association President Keith Geiger - at the same time they complain that they don't have enough money to educate, or even house, the students they already have?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> isn't it recognized that if resources exceed responsibilities, whether in business and industry, personal finances, or schooling, there are essentially two options: 1. increase the resources, or 2. decrease the responsibilities.  With funding an ever-growing problem for the public schools, and no likelihood of &quot;adequate&quot; funding, which is rarely ever defined in specific terms, the public schools would be better able to function if they at least had the same amount of funds with fewer students - per-pupil funds would increase.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> aren't more high school students with the ability to do so permitted and encouraged to attend college prior to the usual graduation from high school?  Twenty years ago a Carnegie Commission on Higher Education report noted that there is so much duplication between the last two years of high school and the first two years of college that one or two of those years could be eliminated, at least for many students.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> don't more states follow the lead of Minnesota  which, for nearly a decade now, has had a law which permits state funds, currently in excess of $4,000 per year, to be applied toward college tuition for the years the student would otherwise have been in high school.  This is money that the state will be spending anyway, and it is more efficient and effective, and saves the student a year or more of schooling seat time, to support those students who can benefit from early admission.  In the decade of experience with this postsecondary enrollment option thousands of students have taken advantage of its provisions, as a group they have performed better in college</P>
<P>than those who graduated in the normal sequence, and within the first few years of the law's existence Minnesota high schools quadrupled the number of Advanced Placement courses they offered - college level courses presented in the high schools -in an obvious attempt to keep the students in their schools and keep the state funds flowing their way.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, in Pennsylvania has there been so little use of a regulation on the books for more than twenty years that permits a public school district to grant a regular high school diploma to any student who satisfactorily completes a year of college.  One district did so with a student who went to college after her sophomore year of high school.  Not only that, the district allowed her to wait two years and then participate in the graduation exercises with her class.</P>
<P>At a minimum, probably at least 15% of today's high school students could do the same, for at least one of the years they would otherwise be in high school.  As well as saving money directly, and permitting the students to move earlier into their career years, it might save further sums of money if enough students took advantage of it to alleviate the need for school expansion or construction.</P>
<P>In Pennsylvania, for example, with 100,000+ high school graduates annually, 15,000 or more students taking advantage of this option would save huge amounts of money, making some of those dollars available for other budgetary purposes.  Projected nationally that could be several hundred thousand students - if school districts were more flexible, reasonable, and less concerned with holding onto every student they can.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> isn't it recognized that hundreds of colleges and universities do not require a high school diploma for admission?  Thus, the above suggestion is not merely theoretical. It can be done right now by those districts who place the student first, rather than the system.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, if the teacher unions know what should be done to make schools more effective, don't they  fund a school and show us by example.  The California Teachers Association raised some $16 million last year to oppose a voucher initiative.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> don't they raise another $16 million and establish a school in south central Los Angeles, the WATTS area.  That could provide $16,000 per pupil for 2 500 pupil schools.  If that still isn't enough, they could have $32,000 per pupil for one school of 500.  No district in the nation, or college either, spends that kind of money.  With 400 pupils they could spend $40,000 each.  </P>
<P>In fact, they wouldn't even need a special assessment.  Myron Lieberman notes that the combined local, state and national income of both unions is probably in excess of $1 billion.  The NEA even has a national foundation that could fund a school if it didn't spend its funds in smaller grants.</P>
<P>Somewhere between $16,000-$40,000 surely should do it.  And even that is more than public funding can ever provide for 40+ million students.</P>
<P>But they won't do it.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>?  Because they really have no answers and by claiming that more money will solve public schooling's ills, without saying how much is enough, they always have the excuse that failure could be avoided if only there were more funds available.</P>

<P>One argument against public funding of school choice is the view that &quot;who pays the piper calls the tune.&quot;  This is sometimes even stated by some who would otherwise support choice.</P>
<P>Admittedly this is a possibility, as is the argument that all students might want to attend the same school.  A possibility, however, may be far different from reality, as higher education attendance attests.</P>
<P><B>$</B>ome are so anti-government, and so convinced that this would happen that there is no reasoning with them to the contrary.</P>
<P>As Al Smith used to say, &quot;Let's look at the record.&quot;</P>
<P>A commonly cited basis for this concern is <I>Grove City College v. Bell</I>, a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision which held that student assistance under the federal Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG) program subjected the college to the provisions of Title IX, barring sex discrimination by institutions receiving &quot;federal financial assistance.&quot;  </P>
<P>Perhaps the leading legal expert on this subject is Attorney William Bentley Ball, who has represented ten cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, including the June 1993 <I>Zobrest</I> decision.  He addressed this topic at the REACH Alliance conference in December, 1993, a summary of which appeared in the December 30, 1993 issue of <I>Choice Comments</I>.</P>
<P>For those who missed it, his basic point held that &quot;It is true that the Court held the BEOGs constitute such assistance to Grove City.  But it so held because Congress, in enacting the BEOG program, had expressly declared that a specific purpose of the BEOGs was in fact to 'provide assistance to <U>institutions</U> of higher education.' Further, the Court said that Congress had specifically intended Title IX requirements to be closely tied to the BEOG statute.&quot;</P>
<P>That is, the Court did not hold that government-funded student aid necessarily justifies government regulations, but that this particular form of aid was meant for institutions.</P>
<P>Thus, while <I>Grove City</I> is accepted by many as sufficient proof of the danger of government funding, the basis for that decision is ignored, as are the further facts that out of more than 3,000 schools in higher education, only two show such concern, and that higher education is much less regulated than are the public schools.</P>
<P>Pennsylvania owns 14 universities.  There is no constitutional or other restriction preventing it from doing anything it wishes with them - expanding them, merging them, abolishing them, or whatever.</P>
<P>Yet look at how they actually operate.</P>
<P>Their curriculum is not mandated.  </P>
<P>Their faculty need not be certified.</P>
<P>A 180-day school year is not law. </P>
<P>Or a five hour instructional day.  </P>
<P>Or any of the other endless mandates and restrictions on the public schools. </P>
<P>Ohio Governor George Voinovich said in his state-of-the-state message this year that Ohio's public school superintendents are responsible for filling out some 1200 forms and reports annually, a figure that probably has some applicability to public school superintendents in the rest of the nation.</P>
<P>Every state owns institutions of higher education.  If public funding means public regulation, why don't they establish mandates at this level similar to those in basic education?  </P>
<P>The answer can only be that it isn't necessary because higher education operates on the basis of choice.  There are some fourteen million fulltime college and university students, and millions more of part-timers, yet not one of them is assigned to the school they attend, or required to remain there.  Therefore, stifling government controls are not needed or used.</P>
<P>Would this not be true in basic education as well?  Is it not true for the millions of students who are in nonpublic schools or homeschooled?</P>
<P>Is it not true in other nations?  </P>
<P>Indeed it is.</P>
<P>The Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development, the OECD, did a study of developed nations to determine the degree of local autonomy or flexibility possessed by the public schools.  All of the nations, except the U.S., have some form of school choice, yet the U.S. was ranked dead last on this basis.</P>
<P>Does this not at least suggest that lack of school choice results in excessive government regulation, and that its presence will reduce mandates?</P>
<P>After all, when a state such as Pennsylvania spends more than <B>$</B>14 billion on K-12 schooling, and the general public can't control it or escape from its clutches, must not the state try to establish controls of its own, even though they don't work?</P>
<P>Would it need to have all these mandates if parents could send their children to a school of their choice and thus be able to withdraw them from any school that was failing them?  Is this not the accountability that is sought but which at present does not exist?</P>
<P><B>$</B>ome who fear government controls say that the idea they can be avoided or minimized is naive.  They argue that we should have school choice but it can only come about when the present system is abolished, and there is complete separation of school and state (sometimes termed SOSAS), with absolutely no public funding at all.  </P>
<P>They visualize a system, if that's the word, whereby all of the fifty million school age youngsters in this nation attend a school of their choice with funding provided by parents, churches, and other altruistic sources.</P>
<P>Talk about being naive.</P>
<P>Let's look at that record.</P>
<P>Where in the world is there a nation in which the government has absolutely no involvement in the education of children?   </P>
<P>Where is there a society in which all of the money needed to educate the young comes from private sources?</P>
<P>Where is there a system in which, whatever the level of funding from public versus private sources, there is absolutely no government regulations, mandates or oversights? </P>
<P>What is the likelihood of that which exists nowhere in the world becoming a reality in this nation?</P>
<P>Even the 1925 <I>Pierce</I> decision, in which the U. S. Supreme Court said &quot;the child is not the creature of the state&quot;, and unanimously ruled that no child in this nation can constitutionally be compelled to attend a public school, said that the government could establish reasonable conditions under which education could be conducted. </P>
<P>Is it possible, or desirable, that the government or citizenry would permit anyone to do whatever they wish regarding their children's education?</P>
<P>If the thought that the education of fifty million children can be totally supported by individual resources and voluntary organizations has any validity, why don't those advocating it try to put it into practice?</P>
<P>After all, even under the present system there is no prohibition preventing totally private funding from being established.  If everyone with incomes sufficient to pay for their children's education is joined by churches, foundations, and whatever other sources that may be willing, decides to provide the money necessary to educate all children, including most especially the children of the poor and disadvantaged, they can start phasing in that program now.</P>
<P>As more and more children are so provided for, public school enrollments will drop, government funding at all levels will become less and less necessary, and eventually all taxes to support public education can be eliminated because there will no longer be any public school students.</P>
<P><B>$</B>pecifically suggesting it, and saying let it start now, rather than to propose it as some ideal world of the future, is to expose it for the dream it is.</P>
<P>It has never happened.  It is not happening now.  And it will not happen in the future.</P>
<P>In short, there is no way to fund the education of huge numbers of children without it being to a large degree a collective effort.  Total separation of school and state is a fantasy.</P>
<P>A greater separation than now exists is not.  That requires an objective judgment of what form of government funding will involve the least amount of government control.  That form is clearly individual student vouchers, or scholarships - a GI Bill for Kids - in which the producers are directly accountable to those they serve, the only accountability that will work.</P>
<P>Finally, those who do not wish to participate in a publicly funded school choice program need not do so.  But they should not use their view to prevent its creation because without it no one has that option.  And that's all it is - an option.  By its very definition school choice is voluntary.</P>
<P>Those who fear the government, like the public school establishment that opposes parental choice because they fear loss of control, can only succeed with a viable alternative.</P>
<P>Totally private funding is not it.   </P>

<P><B>WHY </B>the public school establish-ment, which claims to &quot;teach critical thinking and problem solving&quot;, is unable to think critically and solve its own problems?</P>
<P><B>WHY </B>are those who want to change the educational process known as conservatives while those defending the status quo claim to be reformers?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it claimed school choice will &quot;cream&quot; the best students when public magnet schools have been doing that  for years, and elite public schools, such as Central High in Philadelphia and Stuyvesant High in New York City have done so for generations?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it that significant reform is opposed with the claim that research is needed (aside from the question as to why these same sources so often also oppose research projects) when much of the present system not only lacks a research base but is in direct contradiction to research findings.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, for example, do we educate students by building a box called a school, inside of which are little boxes called classrooms, occupied by students in rows facing the front of the room, where an adult talks 75-80% of the time; that is, the adult talks three to four times as much as all of the students combined?  </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> does secondary schooling use arbitrary time blocks after each of which students move to another room for a separate subject of instruction?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it said that each student is &quot;taken from where he or she is to where they need to go&quot; when, in fact, they move in groups, from class to class or grade to grade, based essentially upon age with little regard to where each is or needs to go.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> are school districts so large?  Studies indicate a direct relation between a district's size and the cost per student; and an inverse relationship between district size and student achievement.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, in contradiction to many studies, are public schools built for thousands of students?  Schools for a few hundred, at most, are more effective at educating students and developing their potential.  For example, see Roger Barker and Paul Gump's book <I>Big School, Small </I><I>School</I>, published in 1964.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, when youngsters from violent and dysfunctional neighborhoods or families, who lack order and self-discipline in their lives, are in high schools of 2,000 or more students, with many from similar circum-stances, are we surprised that those schools are violent and dysfunctional?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, if large schools are economical and effective, are nonpublic schools smaller?  In Pennsylvania the average public school has about 600 students, with suggestions for further school consolidation, while the average nonpublic school has about 150. </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it that rarely, if ever, is a consolidated school called for, or supported, by students, parents, the general public, or teachers?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, in short, if the research, the community, and most educators agree that small schools are better, do superintendents and school boards have an &quot;edifice complex?&quot; </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is there an increasing trend, and continual efforts, to increase the state share of education funding when studies indicate that higher state funding is related to higher per pupil costs and lower student achievement?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it only in education that those who are public employees feel the need to attack and denigrate those who are privately employed?  Do doctors and nurses in public hospitals or departments of health regard those in private practice as enemies?  Do lawyers in district attorneys' offices or departments of justice regard lawyers in private practice as unqualified or unprofessional?  Do the police, who are public employees and unionized, oppose or try to restrict private security forces?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> are public school teachers referred to as professionals when they are told where, when, what, sometimes even how, to teach, with whom to teach, and otherwise treated like the public employees they are.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do so many public school teachers, who almost unanimously object to the above conditions, resist reforms, such as school choice, which would enable them to eliminate most of these restrictions and work directly on a mutually acceptable basis with their students, as do doctors with patients, lawyers with clients, and  other professionals?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, if the process is valid, is certification required for those who teach in the public schools but not for those who prepare those who teach in the public schools?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> does schooling require more certification credentials than any other profession - to teach at the elementary level, to teach at the secondary level, to be an elementary school principal, to be a secondary school principal, to be a superintendent, ad infinitum?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do so many educators complain about excessive government regulation (and they are right) but oppose any attempts to enact meaningful deregulation of the system?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do so many businessmen, who say they believe in free enterprise, competition, and minimal government interference, support a monopolistic school system in which individual enterprise is a no-no, competition is nonexistent, and government interference is virtually absolute?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> should school administrators be former teachers?  Are court administrators lawyers?  Are hospital administrators doctors?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it assumed that an adminis-trator who was once a teacher is qualified to evaluate all teachers regardless of specialty?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B>, when a disadvantaged student from a lower socioeconomic status doesn't do well, is the student blamed; but when those from advantaged back-grounds do well the school claims the credit?   The school may even be viewed as a good school rather than one with good students.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> would anyone be proud of the fact that they compel students to attend an unsafe school?  The National Education Association is.  </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> did NEA TODAY, Sept. 1994, page 6, boast that the &quot;NEA and its allies succeeded in defeating two negative amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  By close votes, the Senate defeated an amendment that would have provided federal funds for private school tuition vouchers to students in schools deemed unsafe...&quot;  </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> have they no shame?  Are they so afraid of vouchers that danger to students is of no concern?  In case of doubt, the item's headline is, &quot;Best Win For Education Employees.&quot;</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> isn't NEA President Keith Geiger, quoted in <B>USA TODAY</B>, October 20, 1993, as saying that inner-city schools &quot;are absolutely terrible--they ought to be blown up,&quot;  willing to let the students leave first?</P>
<P> </P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do so many educators bemoan parental apathy when parental involvement is often welcomed only on the school's terms.  Join the PTA, the Booster Club, help raise money, or help spread the word about our good school but don't think parental involvement means you can have your child assigned to another school, or another teacher, or otherwise have any choice over your child's school environment.  Apathetic parents may have much to be apathetic about.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> does the U.S. Secretary of Education advocate &quot;parental involvement&quot; when he says he is totally opposed to parental choice, which would give them power.  </P>
<P>Involvement - power = manipulation.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do both opponents and propo-nents of school choice argue over how good or bad the &quot;system&quot; is when that is essentially irrelevant?  Even the strongest defender of the status quo will admit that not all public school students succeed, and even the most adamant &quot;school basher&quot; will have to concede that some public school students do very well.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> should the argument for school choice rest on how many public schools succeed or fail?  With 15,000 school districts, millions of staff and 42,000,000 students, almost anything that can be said is true someplace.</P>
<P>Even if only 10% fail - and no one argues the figure is that low, - that's more than 4,000,000 students.  It is no satisfaction to them, or anyone else, if others succeed.  Similarly, the number that don't succeed is irrelevant for those who do.</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> does the American Civil Liberties Union oppose school choice, when a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court said in 1925 it is a civil liberty?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> don't we talk about students, which is what school choice is all about.  As the U.S. Supreme Court said in 1925, &quot;the child is not the creature of the state.&quot;</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> do those claiming full school choice is unconstitutional object to such laws being passed and tested in the courts?  Don't they believe what they say?</P>
<P><B>WHY</B> is it that when the establishment tries something different, such as Outcome-Based-Education (OBE) they say it will take years to evaluate, but when they object to a reform, such as school choice in Milwaukee or privatization in Baltimore they attack it if it doesn't show immediate gains?</P>

<P>1</P>
<P>Recently the Senate of Pennsylvania created a Select Committee to Study the Structure and Financing of Public Education in the Commonwealth.  The committee held four hearings across the state from August 9-12.</P>
<P>The main impetus behind the resolution was teacher strikes and the suggestion for a statewide teacher contract.  By far, most of those who testified opposed a statewide contract.  There was also concern over state and federal mandates.</P>
<P>But many went well beyond these points, with some imagining the unimaginable and questioning the existence of the present system.</P>
<P>At each hearing several persons, including school board members, called for, or predicted, school choice.</P>
<P>Thus the title above.</P>
<P>Here are some edited comments:</P>
<P>&quot;The problem is whether or not public education will continue as we have known it or will be replaced by a system described by some as school choice. This may sound dramatic but I assure you that public education as an institution is not in good shape to meet the challenges of the future.  Indeed, some consider it to be in a terminal state before its death is recognized.&quot; <I>- Dr. Norman F. Ness, Vice </I><I>President, Concerned Citizens-Kennett Consolidated School District, Kennett Square.</I></P>
<P>&quot;It is my personal opinion that the best means of reforming our schools is to make the schools responsive to parents by introducing school choice. Wealthy individuals have school choice now, either by living in a good school district or by having the resources to send their children to independent schools.&quot; <I>- Jeff Hellrung, President, Chester County Tax Action Group</I>.</P>
<P>&quot;It should be made easier to experiment, not more difficult.  We should stop gasping in horror every time someone mentions merit pay, or vouchers, or school choice.  All of these things deserve serious scrutiny.  The current system doesn't work.&quot; <I>- Eugene W. Hickok, Carlisle </I><I>School Board member, and college professor</I>.</P>
<P>2</P>
<P>If a statewide contract is introduced: &quot;the long-term effect will be further deterioration of the quality of public education as more disgruntled parents look to school vouchers, charters or other solutions to their educational problems.&quot; - <I>Dr. Earl Barnhart, Carlisle School Board </I><I>Member</I>.</P>
<P>&quot;I would suggest looking at proposals which will strengthen local and parental control such as school choice.&quot; <I>- John C. O'Neal, Member, </I><I>Montoursville Area School Board</I>.</P>
<P>&quot;I believe that every child is part of the public and is entitled to equal funding for educational purposes.  Public and private schools, nonpublic schools, and home schooling comprise the total educational package in Pennsylvania.  Where a child receives the education is entirely up to the parents.  You should provide equity in funding education regardless of where the education takes place.  Provide a minimum of $4,777 for each student in the state.  This money would go to the school district or the school facility or the parents who provide the education.&quot; <I>- Robert E. Roush, Jr., Member, Big Spring School Board</I>.</P>
<P> (The California Supreme Court said it would accept vouchers as an equitable means of funding, <I>Serrano v. Priest, Dec. 30, 1976, - Serrano II- </I><I>Editor)</I>.</P>
<P>&quot;It is almost a year to the day that I became involved with the convoluted practices in public education.  Time, and information have radically revised my ideas about public education.  It is too expensive to save and not worth the effort.  The answer to every problem in public education can be addressed more intelligently if the General Assembly has the courage and foresight to vote into law schools of choice.  Just as there is separation of church and state, there should be separation of state and education.  Government should not be educating or dictating what our children are taught.  Free enterprise would allow the State to get out of the school business, provide the taxpayers financial relief, allow parents a choice, and give children excellent and individualized educations.&quot; <I>- Carolyn J. Rapaport, Co-Chairman, </I><I>Pennsylvania Taxpayers for Quality Education. </I></P>
<P>(For more on this concept, see Stephen Arons, <I>Compelling Belief</I>, NY: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1983. - Editor).</P>

<P><B><I>PHILADELPHIA</I></B></P>
<P>According to a Temple University survey directed by Prof. Paul Seidenstat 90% of African-American and Hispanic parents support full school choice.  Similar conclusions have been drawn by other polls for some time, although with smaller percentages.  This raises the question as to how long those who claim to represent minority citizens can continue to maintain that fiction while strongly opposing school choice.</P>
<P>The Temple survey reported general backing as well, by margins proportional to the amount of the voucher/scholarship.  With a $1,500 grant, 72% of the parents said they would elect a transfer; 80% would do so if the grant were raised to $3,000.</P>
<P>Given the growing financial as well as educational crisis in the Philadelphia school district - the deficit may exceed $400 million within three or four years - and this overwhelming support of school choice in the city, its implementation there is inevitable, and sooner than many may imagine.</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>VERMONT</I></B></P>
<P>2</P>
<P>has permitted school choice from the beginning of the public school movement in the 19th century.  Local communities may operate secondary schools or pay tuition for students to attend a public or private school of their choice, with no geographic restrictions.  Students go to schools in several other states and Canada; at least one recently went to a school in Paris, France, the tuition paid by the local government back home.  </P>
<P>About one-third of Vermont's towns have no public secondary school, so 25% of these students exercise choice, three-quarters of whom attend other public schools.  Just as parents elsewhere move into a community so their children can attend the local school, some in Vermont move where there is no secondary school so their children can exercise choice.</P>
<P>In 1961 the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that religious schools could not be included in the choice program a decision that reportedly was not implemented.  It is now moot because the Court has unanimously reversed itself, rejecting a First Amendment challenge to the state's payment of tuition in religiously affiliated schools, saying &quot;jurisprudence has evolved greatly since 1961.&quot;</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>NEW YORK</I></B></P>
<P>The U.S. Supreme Court surprised perhaps no one but the defendants with its June ruling that the Kiryas Joel Village School District, whose boundaries contain only students of the Satmar Hasidim religion, is unconstitutional.  Even so, the decision was not unanimous and five justices indicated that the Court's 1985 <I>Aguilar</I> decision should be reconsidered.  At that time the Court prohibited public remedial education teachers from providing services on the premises of religiously affiliated schools.  It appears that a majority of the present Court might hold such religiously neutral assistance to students to be constitutional.</P>
<P>3</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>NEW YORK </I></B><B><I>CITY</I></B></P>
<P>The Manhattan Institute's Center for Educational Innovation has chosen Community School Districts 5 and 7 as the first two New York City school districts in the Gilder Initiative for School Choice Throughout New York City.  With a one million dollar challenge grant from Institute Trustee Richard Gilder, the Initiative provides seed money and expert support to create theme-based alternative schools, help restructure failing schools and implement district-wide school choice.</P>
<P>The Center participates in demonstra-tion programs in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, in addition to Baltimore, Philadelphia and East Orange, New Jersey.  Recently it has been asked to join restructuring projects in Buffalo, Atlanta and Newark.  The Center's personnel include several former New York City district level superintendents, including Seymour Fliegel (East Harlem District 4, noted for its successful school choice program).</P>
<P>Further information can be obtained from John Elwell, Director, Center for Educational Innovation, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017 - Telephone (212) 599-7000, FAX (212) 599-3494.</P>
<P>4</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>CALIFORNIA</I></B></P>
<P>Parents for Educational Choice has been succeeded by the Coalition Advocating Reform in Education (CARE), which has set the March 1996 Presidential primary as their target date for a second statewide initiative on school choice.</P>
<P>Much has been made of the defeat of the first initiative last fall although many predicted this in advance.  In addition to the political strength and financial resources of the opponents, there are those who feel success is more likely through legislation, which, unlike initiatives, can be amended.  California's Proposition 13 in 1978, which capped property taxes, was Howard Jarvis' fourth try.</P>
<P>A properly drafted school choice initiative will ultimately triumph as well, and it won't take four attempts.</P>
<P>In an attempt to avoid full school choice, much of the public school establishment in California now favors public school choice such as is being implemented in Los Angeles.  So much for the claim that competition will not lead to school reform.</P>
<P>Their support of public school choice may speed the establishment of full school choice, once awareness develops of the changes which result from even this limited step.  The campaigning for students by individual public schools in Los Angeles is attracting national attention, and will make it difficult to continue the claim that parents aren't interested in, or capable of, deciding where their children should go to school.</P>
<P>CARE's address: 645 14th Ave. San Francisco, CA 94118; Tel. (415) 752-7333; FAX (415) 752-5851. Rabbi Pinchas Lipner, Chairman.</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>MINNESOTA</I></B></P>
<P>Various &quot;second chance&quot; options are available.  Generally, eligible students are at least one year behind grade level; two years behind in performance; pregnant or a parent; chemically dependent; or absent from school for three weeks straight.  </P>
<P>The need is demonstrated by the fact that about 28,000 students participate each year.  This in a state that already leads the nation in the percentage of students who graduate from high school, over 91%.</P>
<P>5</P>
<P>A school choice proposal in Connecticut failed by a 71-71 vote at the end the legislative session earlier this year.  Supporters are confident that support has continued to grow and that they now have the votes necessary to pass an enabling act when the legislature next convenes.</P>
<P>According to a recent statewide poll, 62% of New Jersey's citizens favor the introduction of full school choice, 69% in Jersey City where Mayor Bret Schundler is seeking to introduce this option.  Backed by Governor Christie Whitman, leaders in the State House and Senate, and others, the Mayor's proposal, &quot;The Jersey City 'Schoolchildren First' Education Act,&quot; is expected to receive major legislative attention this fall.</P>
<P>As with any full school choice program, the Mayor's proposal would not just empower students and their parents but educators as well.  Teachers and administrators will be eligible to receive waivers from the State Commissioner of Education enabling them to create a wide variety of programs tailor made to children's different needs.  This will include the ability of parents and teachers to establish charter schools, public schools largely free from the usual bureaucratic interference.  Speaking of</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>CHARTER SCHOOLS</I></B></P>
<P>there are claims that, like school choice in general, they will &quot;cream&quot; the better students.  Experience is disproving this smokescreen.  Five of fifteen charter schools scheduled to open next year in Massachusetts, will serve disadvantaged and at-risk students, as will three of nine approved charters in Colorado and a majority of the 50+ in California.</P>
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>PRIVATE </I></B><B><I>PROGRAMS</I></B></P>
<P>About 7,000 disadvantaged children now receive grants to attend 500 schools in more than a dozen states.  Typically, these programs provide half-tuition, parents the rest, proving that even parents with limited financial resources will make extraordinary efforts to help their kids. </P>

<HR WIDTH=60% SIZE=4 ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>Some time ago this newsletter reviewed what research had to say about school choice, especially work by Professor Mary Anne Raywid of Hofstra University. This is an update.</P>
<P>Opponents of school choice like to say there is no adequate research on its effects, while they claim the results will be negative.  Aside from asking how they know its impact when they are unaware of the research, they are wrong on both counts. </P>
<P>Professor Raywid, as long ago as 1982, had studied some 1200 choice programs.  Ironically, in her report published that year she thanked the National Education Association (NEA) for its cooperation in allowing its research staff to do computer runs and otherwise assist her in tabulating the results of her study.</P>
<P>Raywid has continued her research since then, and in a more recent publication by the Manhattan Institute, she still concludes that study after study favors the practice of students choosing the school they will attend; that choice has a positive effect on student achievement; that, of the main restructuring strategies, school-based management and choice, &quot;choice wins, hands down&quot;; and that it generates teacher leadership.</P>
<P>Contrary to claims that choice will lead to increased segregation, Raywid says it promotes integration better than do mandatory assignment plans.</P>
<P>As for the charge that students won't make good choices, undoubtedly true in some cases, Raywid finds &quot;no reason to assume that a poorly chosen school could be any more injurious to a particular youngster than many assigned schools are now--and in a choice system, unlike an assignment system, the student caught in such circumstances has the advantage of being able to transfer.&quot;</P>
<P>An unusual finding is that school choice reduces the number of special education students.  There are &quot;large numbers of cases where kids who have appeared to be slow, learning disabled, or emotionally troubled are simply transformed in a different school environment, and the special services are no longer needed.&quot;</P>
<P>She thinks that schools of choice improve because teachers are able to be creative, develop programs they believe in, and thus work better with kids.  These &quot;more positive circum-stances evoke greater commitment, greater effort, and greater efficacy.&quot;</P>
<P>In this win-win situation where teachers can develop their own school, and students are more likely to be where they can succeed, teachers, students, and parents all experience higher satisfaction rates.</P>
<P>One reason for this is that schools of choice are often much smaller than public schools designed by those who neither teach nor study in them.  As &quot;schools-within-schools or schools with limited enrollments--it is a smaller, cozier environment and the staff are more likely to know one another.  Moreover, they are far more likely to work fairly closely with one another than in a traditional school.&quot;</P>
<P>The average nonpublic school in Pennsylvania has about 160 students, compared to more than 400 for the average public school - and the public average would be even higher if rural schools, many of which are necessarily small, were factored out.  That is not a minor item in Pennsylvania, which has the largest rural population of any state in the nation.</P>
<P>Nationally, the average nonpublic school has about 200 students, and the average public school about 500, a figure also distorted because of millions of rural students.</P>
<P>Given the hundreds of studies that find problems with the present public school structure, operation and results, Raywid thinks the demand for schools to improve is legitimate, but the demand for better schools must be accompanied by alternatives on how to do it.  Of those alternatives, she says becoming &quot;a school of choice...is the best way in my judgment.&quot;</P>
<P>Time has borne out her view two years ago that the choice movement was just beginning since the public demand for educational progress and meaningful accountability seems to be here to stay, and a large majority favor it.  She believes that choice &quot;is one of the most non-invasive forms of accountability we'll find, and one of the least injurious to education.&quot;</P>
<P>She favors choice because: &quot;First...I think choice is the best route we know to school improvement, the best lever or catalyst we have for reform.  Second, I think parents have a right to more say in their children's education than traditional schools allow them.  Choice seems to me the most appropriate way to empower them.&quot;</P>
<P>Although perhaps the one who has most thoroughly studied choice for the longest period of time, Raywid is not the only researcher in the field noting positive results.</P>
<P>John F. Witte of the Robert M. Lafollette Institute of Public Affairs is studying Milwaukee's state mandated voucher program.  Contrary to another claim of opponents, Witte, like Raywid, finds that &quot;rather than skimming off the best students, this program seems to provide an alternative educational environment for students who are not doing particularly well in the public school system.&quot;</P>
<P>Since that time Witte has publicly stated that, in looking at Milwaukee's 97,000 students as a group, at the 60,000-some students who are eligible for the Rep. Polly Williams sponsored program, and the fewer than 1,000 who can actually take part, the first year the participants were the poorest of the three categories and, in the second year, they were poorer still.</P>
<P>In short, there has been no &quot;creaming,&quot; the students given a chance for a meaningful alternative were exactly those intended.</P>
<P>This should make sense to those who are not fearful, or determined to use scare tactics to oppose choice.  Better students, by definition, are those who are the ones most successful in a given school.  They would therefore seem to be the ones least likely to make a change.  It is precisely those who are doing least well, or who are most unhappy, that will want a different educational environment, and who should be permitted to choose one.</P>
<P>Another researcher, Prof. Robert L. Crain of Columbia University Teachers College, has issued a report on school choice in which he said, &quot;Among the big cities, this is the most egalitarian program I know and probably the most exciting...&quot;</P>
<P>He reported that students in New York choice schools increased their reading skills nearly twice as fast, on the average, as children attending neighborhood schools and they earned 25% more credits toward graduation.</P>
<P>These results reinforce research elsewhere which show that pupils do better and parents participate more in schools they choose.  Furthermore, teachers are prouder and perform better in schools of choice.</P>
<P>John A. Murphy, for seven years superintendent of Prince George's County public schools in Maryland, a largely minority system, and now heading the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools in North Carolina, has said he found &quot;a choice system brings much more harmony between the home and school.  Rather than forced busing for integration, which antagonizes many people, there is voluntary busing to get to a school of choice.&quot;</P>
<P>Other supporters include Arizona Governor Fife Symington who said, &quot;I just can't believe in modern-day America...anybody would deny a parent the right to choose a school that's best for their child.&quot;</P>
<P>Since the earlier newsletter, the first charter schools in the nation have begun operation, beginning with Minnesota.  Time after time, contrary to the &quot;creaming&quot; charge, these schools are small and geared to students with problems who are most in need for working options.</P>
<P>Privately funded choice programs are appearing across the nation, beginning a few years ago in Indianapolis and now in operation is such cities as San Antonio, Atlanta, Detroit and Milwaukee (Where parent Valerie Barrett lives.  She has told two REACH conferences what a difference school choice has made in the lives of herself and her two children).</P>
<P>Despite the usual glitches with new and growing efforts, school choice programs work, are saving children, and serve as encouragement for others toiling to achieve them in their own communities or state.  </P>
<P>School choice is spreading; its success has been clearly demonstrated; it has a long history in the developed democratic nations around the world; it has been introduced and is being expanded in former Iron Curtain nations; and the opponents have no workable alternatives or even arguments other than, as Ted Kolderie has noted,  &quot;saying what if, what if, spreading fear and doubt.&quot;</P>

<H5>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><I>SCHOOL BASHING</I></B></FONT></H5>
<P>Many in the public school establishment, especially those speaking for the two teacher unions, repeatedly make two accusations against school choice advocates.</P>
<P>The first is that we indulge in &quot;bashing&quot; the public schools.  That charge, in itself, is a form of &quot;bashing&quot; - a resort to name-calling rather than dealing with the real issue.</P>
<P>Are we critical of much that occurs in government schools?  You bet.  And some of us have spent enough time as staff members to know whereof we speak.  But we have also said that a system with 15,000 districts, 85,000 schools, millions of staff members, and some 45,000,000 students is so varied that almost anything you say is true somewhere.</P>
<P>No one seriously claims that good things don't occur in public schools.  To the contrary, we have repeatedly said that with full school choice most students will stay where they are.  It is the defenders of the status quo who fear there will be a flight from the public schools if students can do so.</P>
<P>When we are critical, the criticism is based on facts, facts usually drawn from the government, research studies and surveys, and media reports.</P>
<P>Probably the best known critique is the 1983 report <I>A Nation at Risk</I>, the federal study by a commission representing the establishment.</P>
<P>How many times have you heard it said that public schools are engulfed by &quot;a rising tide of mediocrity,&quot; and that, if another nation did to us and our children what we are doing to ourselves we would consider it an act of war?  If that is &quot;bashing,&quot; blame the federal report.</P>
<P>Since 1983 this nation has spent over $2,000,000,000,000 (that's two <B>trillion</B> dollars) on the public schools, has increased per pupil spending 30% in constant dollars, and has tried to reform the system.  All of the students who were there in 1983, except for some in kindergarten and first grade, have since graduated or dropped out.</P>
<P>What has been gained from all that time, money and effort? </P>
<P>Not much, according to the latest federal statement, the<B> GOALS 2000: EDUCATE AMERICA ACT</B>.</P>
<P>In it, &quot;Congress finds as follows:&quot;</P>
<P>Page 91, &quot;(1) A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the National Education Goals...&quot;</P>
<P>Page 112, &quot;(A) The current achieve-ment levels of students in the United States are far below those that might indicate competency in challenging subject matter in core content areas.&quot; </P>
<P>Page 115, &quot;(A) The rate of decline in our urban schools is escalating at a rapid pace.  Student performance in most inner city schools grows worse each year.  At least half of all students entering ninth grade fail to graduate 4 years later and many more students from high-poverty backgrounds leave school with skills that are inadequate for today's workplace.  Student performance in many inner city neigh-borhoods grows worse each year... (D) An educational emergency exists in those urban and rural areas where there are large concentrations of children who live in poverty.&quot;</P>
<P>The rate of decline is escalating; student performance grows worse; an educational emergency exists.  Defenders of the status quo need to tell the Congress to stop &quot;bashing&quot; the public school system. </P>
<P>If that isn't severe enough, how about the comment that inner city schools &quot;are absolutely terrible--they ought to be blown up.&quot;  That was said not by the government but by Keith Geiger, President, National Education Assoc-iation, <B>USA TODAY</B>, Oct. 20, 1993.  </P>
<P>Or, in the 1990s, &quot;we're going to be digging even deeper, and the teachers are going to be even dumber.&quot;  Albert Shanker, President, the American Federation of Teachers, <B>NEW YORK TIMES</B>, Nov. 5, 1989.</P>
<P>Neither are noted advocates of school choice for all students.</P>
<H5>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><I>THE FAR RIGHT</I></B></FONT></H5>
<P>The other commonly levelled charge is that school choice is a scheme promoted by the far right, a term that is not defined, referring to groups and individuals generally not named.</P>
<P>1</P>
<P>In February, NEA's Keith Geiger referred to Americans for School Choice as a &quot;hard-core, well-organized elite of right-wing political activists.&quot; Yet the ASC board is a distinguished group which includes many governors.</P>
<P>Historically, reference to the political left and right goes back to the French Revolution when radicals and revolu-tionaries sat on the left in the legisla-ture and their opponents, including monarchists, sat on the right.</P>
<P>With few revolutionaries and fewer monarchists today, the political spectrum is often said to range from communists on the left to fascists on the right.  Some argue it is a circle not a line since both fascism and communism lead to dictatorships.</P>
<P>In any event, the far left can be ignored in this context since no one claims they favor school choice.</P>
<P>As for the far right, in this country that usually refers to such as the American Nazi Party, the Skinheads, or even the Ku Klux Klan.  The Klan which opposes Blacks, Catholics, and Jews, was the inspiration of the Oregon initiative in the early 1920s which directed that all students in that state had to attend public schools.  So the &quot;far right,&quot; like the far left, is not inclined to favor individual choice.</P>
<P>Like &quot;bashing,&quot; &quot;far right,&quot; is a smokescreen, an appeal to emotion that avoids dealing with the right of parents to send their children to schools they choose, which was unanimously affirmed by the (far right?) U.S. Supreme Court in 1925 when it voided the Oregon law.  </P>
<P>Beyond this, however, it might be helpful to note some of the advocates of school choice, and consider how far to the right they might be.</P>
<P>Since REACH is a Pennsylvania organization we'll start with the 28 (of 50) state senators who passed school choice legislation in the previous session, and 89 in the House.</P>
<P>Or REACH Board member Ed Donley, who, in 1993, received the most prestigious award of the Pennsylvania State Education Association, recognizing his contributions to public education.</P>
<P>Consider Wisconsin Democratic Representative &quot;Polly&quot; Williams, sponsor of that state's Milwaukee choice program and Wisconsin chairman of Jesse Jackson's campaigns for president.</P>
<P>Governors include William Weld of Massachusetts; Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson, John Engler of Michigan, Christie Whitman of New Jersey, George Allen of Virginia, Fife Symington of Arizona, and Pete Wilson of California.</P>
<P>In 1976, the California Supreme Court, in <I>Serrano II</I>, said the inequitable funding of California's public education system could be resolved with tuition vouchers.</P>
<P>Polly Broussard, a 20-year public school teacher in Louisiana, is an Americans for School Choice board member, that right-wing elite.</P>
<P>Other public educators include John Taylor Gatto, New York City's public school Teacher of the Year three successive years, and New York State Teacher of the Year in 1991; Kevin Irvine, Colorado's Teacher of the Year in 1991; and Linda Cross, a Wisconsin teacher who was nearly elected Superintendent of Public Instruction.</P>
<P>2</P>
<P>To this list may be added former U.S. Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, a former Governor of Tennessee and former President of the University of Tennessee; and U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who more than twenty years ago introduced a &quot;Baby GI Bill&quot; proposal in Congress to enable more youngsters to choose their school.</P>
<P>Even a majority of public school teachers, in a poll reported in <B>USA TODAY</B> in August of 1990, agreed schools would be better if parents chose those their children attend.  </P>
<P>Are they what is meant by right wing?</P>
<P>3</P>
<P>Finally, to show how things can be distorted, a flyer on the &quot;New Right&quot;, recently distributed in Pennsylvania, had four interesting quotes. They are:</P>
<P>&quot;It is only the ignorant who despise education.&quot; <I>Publius Syrrus</I>, 42 B.C.</P>
<P>Schooling has its critics but who despises education?  We aren't told.</P>
<P>&quot;It is impossible for ideas to compete in the market place if no forum for their presentation is provided or available.&quot; <I>Thomas Mann</I>.  Does the establishment provide such a forum?</P>
<P>&quot;To educate is to open minds to many points of view and many thoughts.  To indoctrinate is to close minds to all but one thought and one point of view.&quot; <I>Stephen Robinson</I>.  Supporters of school choice don't stifle dissent.</P>
<P>Finally, &quot;I fear more from everyone thinking alike than from some people thinking otherwise.&quot; <I>Charles G. Bolte</I>.</P>
<P>So do we friends, so do we.</P>
<P>All four quotes represent beliefs exactly opposite of those demonstrated by the flyer containing them.  This would be humorous if the shallowness of thought it exposes weren't so sad.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3>By David W. Kirkpatrick</FONT></CENTER></H3>
<P>Q.  What is school choice? </P>
<P>A.  School choice permits everyone to exercise their constitutional right to select the school their child(ren) attend.  This right existed unchallenged until the 1920s, when a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court, saying &quot;the child is not the creature of the state,&quot; ruled that no child can be legally compelled to attend government schools.</P>
<P>It is also about educational achievement so that a child who, for whatever reason, is not performing satisfactorily, or who is unhappy, in one educational setting can select another where he or she might be successful.</P>
<P>It is not about &quot;bailing out the Catholic (or any other) schools,&quot; since they, like all schools, would have to compete to attract and hold students.  </P>
<P>Where school choice has been introduced it has not been uncommon for government school enrollment to go up (particularly where drop-outs are permitted to return) and even for nonpublic enrollments to go down where the government schools improve and offer a satisfactory education.</P>
<P>Q.  Is it constitutional?</P>
<P>A.  An expert on constitutional law, Harvard Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe, said in the June 12, 1991 <I>New York Times</I> that &quot;Any objection that anyone would have to a voucher program would have to be policy-based and could not rest on legal doctrine.  One would have to be awfully clumsy to write voucher legislation that could not pass constitutional scrutiny...aid to parents...would be constitutional.&quot;</P>
<P>Q.  What are the major differences between &quot;governmental school choice&quot; and &quot;non-governmental school choice?&quot; Is one better than the other? </P>
<P>A.  Full school choice is better because it would offer more choices in the number and types of schools.  Choice restricted to government schools only, all of which operate under the same basic rules and restrictions, would offer only officially approved options.  </P>
<P>That would be analogous to the perhaps apocryphal story that Henry Ford once said you could have a Ford in any color you wanted, as long as it was black.</P>
<P>Q.  Why is it important that school choice legislation pass?</P>
<P>A.  Government schools have become increasingly expensive without corresponding results.  It is estimated that over 700,000 students drop out annually.  That's more than 4,000 each school day.  Another 700,000 or more graduate who are not functionally literate.</P>
<P>Many districts, especially urban districts such as Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Chicago, face severe financial problems. There isn't the money available that they believe they need to survive so we must try alternatives.</P>
<P>Prof. Mary Anne Raywid of Hofstra University, has studied school choice for years. In the Dec. 1990/Jan. 1991 issue of <I>Educational </I><I>Leadership</I>, She said, &quot;I have been an advocate of choice, as well as a scholar and chronicler of its development, since the early 1970s...three (reasons) underlie my own view...a conviction that public education's future is in real doubt and that schools may not survive; a conviction that all schools, not just the weakest, need present and continuing revitalization; the belief that in public schools, as in other public institutions, power has tended to gravitate to bureaucracies in ways inconsistent with our democratic commitment.&quot;</P>
<P>Q.  Won't school choice cost more money?</P>
<P>A.  It could well cost less.</P>
<P>For example, the Philadelphia School District budget for the coming year, despite severe slashes including eliminating about 1000 staff positions, includes $100 million for capital costs, mostly for site acquisitions.  This is because enrollment in the district is increasing by 5-6,000 students per year.  After the $100 million is spent, hundreds of millions more will be necessary to construct the new schools, and then still further hundreds of millions to staff and operate them.</P>
<P>Would it not be much less expensive to provide students with scholarships and permit them to go elsewhere?</P>
<P>Even a $5,000 scholarship is less than the district currently spends per student and it would make a massive building program unnecessary.  There are more than 200 private schools in Philadelphia, virtually none of which spend $5,000 per pupil.  Most tuition costs are in the $600-3,000 range.  (The school choice legislation before the General Assembly only calls for scholarships up to $700 at the elementary level and $1,000 for high school students.)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Q.  How will the state pay for school choice?  Or, to state it another way, as some opponents charge, won't this mean a tax increase, or a diversion of funds away from government schools?</P>
<P>A.  The funding can come from the normal increase in state revenues that occur each year.  The Pennsylvania 1993-94 state budget is some $800 million higher than the budget for the 1992-23 fiscal year, yet it did not require a tax increase.</P>
<P>State revenues grow about 5% each year; more in good economic years.  It can reasonably be expected that there will be a further $800 million or more available when next year's budget is adopted.  If this bill passes, it will require less than $80 million each year, or just 10% of the increase, for each of the first three years, after which increases will be significantly reduced, or stabilize. </P>
<P>Therefore, clearly no tax increase is necessary, nor would funds have to be diverted from the government schools.  </P>
<P>It would, of course, involve a determination of the state's funding priorities, but every budget, personal or public, is a statement of priorities.  This is a necessity facing the state every year, since requests for new or increased funding always exceed the amount of money available.</P>
<P>Q.  What effect will the passage of school choice legislation have on public education?  On private education?  On education of our children in general?</P>
<P>A.  We believe it will make possible improvements in all three categories.  And not just because of competition, which is only one factor.  If schools are directly responsible to students and parents, as in higher education, even in state-owned institutions, there will be less need for government officials to continually pass mandates in an effort to make them better, an effort that has obviously failed.</P>
<P>All higher education students are in a school of choice.  Half of them graduate from a college other than the one at which they started.  And, while higher education is not without its problems, it is generally agreed that it functions better than K-12 government schools.</P>
<P>Q.  Competition is given as a major reason for the passage of school choice.  If non-government schools can practice selective admission/retention, while government schools must accept and educate learning disabled and other special needs students, there seems to be a lack of equity.  To be fair, the same demands should be made of the parties competing, which does not seem to be the case.  How do you respond to that?</P>
<P>A.  First, the choice legislation before the Pennsylvania General Assembly would not permit arbitrary discrimination.  A school, public or private - and this legislation does call for public school choice, where five or every six students in Pennsylvania are - would not have to participate.</P>
<P>If, however, it does participate, it must accept all applicants on a space avail-able basis. If more apply than there are spaces, selection must be by lot.</P>
<P>Second, government schools, at the individual school or district level, do not have to accept all students.  They only accept those assigned to that school, or who live in that district.  The advantaged live in their own districts, removed from the problems others may face.</P>
<P>Forty years after <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I>, all 25 of the largest government school districts in the nation have a student body that is primarily minority.</P>
<P>Further, government schools do not have to retain, and they certainly do not educate, all students.  The dropout rate, which is often a force out rate, has already been mentioned.  Nor do government schools have to accept or retain all students with special needs.  </P>
<P>In fact, students with the most severe special needs are not in government schools; they are in private institutions, including some which are out of state.  Nor is this meant to be a criticism.  No standard school, government or otherwise, is equipped to handle students with severe problems and/or needs.</P>
<P>Finally, the equity issue, the &quot;even play field,&quot; argument is valid, but it cuts both ways.</P>
<P>The typical nonpublic school has half, or less, the fiscal resources of a government school.  It is not reasonable to expect a school receiving $700-1,000 per student to accept and serve students who may cost $60,000 or more per year - as do some students with special needs; or to provide all the services to be found in a govern-ment school that spends, as a statewide average in Pennsylvania, more than $7,000 per year per student. (Some school districts in the nation spend more than $15,000 per pupil.)</P>
<P>School choice would be one way to level the field for both groups.  If government schools are accountable directly to students and parents there is much less need for regulations, as in higher and nonpublic education.</P>
<P>If funds are available in reasonable amounts to all students, as they are in Vermont, where they can be used in government and nongovernment schools, in or out of state, and as the California Supreme Court declared in 1976 when it said tuition vouchers would be one way to insure equity in state supported education, the likelihood of students finding a suitable school are dramatically increased.</P>
<P>As Quentin L. Quade, Director of The Blum Center for Parental Freedom In Education, at Marquette University, has written: <I>there is no </I><I>educational downside to educational choice, and no good argument, only smoke screens, against it.  It is not parental freedom that needs </I><I>to justify itself but any policy which limits it.</I></P>

<P>&quot;Currently, we seem to take pride in  teaching all young people in the same way.  We believe that doing so promotes equality.  It does the opposite.  What is fair about creating just one kind of school with one kind of teaching when children's interests, learning styles, and develop-mental levels differ so dramatically? ...Choice celebrates the differences among children and uses those differences to good effect...Choice works for teachers, too.&quot; Charlotte-Mecklenburg, NC School Supt. John Murphy, PHI DELTA KAPPAN, April 1992</P>

<P><B> </B></P>
<P><B>This was the title of an article by Al Knight in </B><B><I>The Denver Post</I></B><B> some time ago, and it is demonstrably true.</B></P>
<P><B>Knight reported that the Colorado Education Association &quot;scorned a variety of school measures still before the legislature as 'so-called </B><B>reform measures' and said the CEA would testify against every one of them.&quot;</B></P>
<P><B>The CEA seemed prepared to reject anything except more money.  Thus, Knight's conclusion that money as the solution is the problem.</B></P>
<P><B>There is ample evidence that he is right, evidence over a long period of time, and in a variety of circumstances. </B></P>
<P><B>Some were noted in my book, </B><B><I>Choice in Schooling</I></B><B> (Chicago: Loyola University Press, 1990).  For example, the More Effective Schools (MES) </B><B>program that was introduced with much fanfare in New York City in the late 1960s, as a collaborative effort of the Federation of Teachers and </B><B>the school district.  Unable to be done districtwide because of the cost, selected schools received more money for smaller classes, additional </B><B>specialists, and the like; all the things that are supposed to make for more effective schools, thus the title.</B></P>
<P><B>In the mid 1970s the program was quietly dropped.  It proved to be the More Expensive Schools program, which was no longer affordable </B><B>and had not produced the expected results.</B></P>
<P><B>Another instance was reported by John Henry Martin and Charles H. Harrison, in their book </B><B><I>Free to Learn</I></B><B> (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: </B><B>Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1972)</B></P>
<P><B>Martin was the superintendent in a school district that increased its budget 35% (how many can do that today?) to put the touted practices </B><B>in place.</B></P>
<P><B>As my book noted, &quot;Average class size went from over thirty pupils to about twenty.  Specialists of all kinds were hired or increased in </B><B>number: guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, classroom aides, and remedial teachers.  Two full-time remedial reading </B><B>teachers were assigned to each elementary school in which the average enrollment was six hundred students.&quot;  And more.</B></P>
<P><B>After an evaluation two years later Martin said:</B></P>
<P><B>In the end, the cherished faith died...all that was done to make a difference had made no difference.  The panaceas were, after all, only false </B><B>promises--vain expectations.  All the patented prescrip-tions...had failed. </B></P>
<P><B>While the New York MES program was underway, Former Berkeley, California Supt. Neil Sullivan told how his district also lowered class size, </B><B>provided remedial teachers, etc., and three years later concluded that the inner city children has not only failed to gain from these efforts but </B><B>had actually lost ground. (Syndicated Columnist James J. Kilpatrick, &quot;Accountability in the Schoolhouse,&quot; Allentown, PA: </B><B><I>The Morning </I></B><B><I>Call</I></B><B>, Nov. 23, 1970)</B></P>
<P><B>We have apparently not learned from these, and other attempts. </B></P>
<P><B>A recent program to make the unworkable work, is in Kansas City.</B></P>
<P><B>As reported in the August 28, 1993 issue of </B><B><I>The Economist</I></B><B>, this effort has a long history.  It was clear that Kansas city schools had </B><B>problems.  Nine years of litigation culminated in a 1986 court decision ordering the school system to be drastically revised, even if it took </B><B>huge amounts of money, which it did.</B></P>
<P><B>Many schools were torn down.  Fifty-six &quot;magnet&quot; school were created.  Technology flourished, with one computer for every three pupils at </B><B>Central High School, which was rebuilt at a cost of $32 million.  Nearly a million dollars was budgeted each year to promote the district on </B><B>television to persuade parents keep their children in, or return them to, schools in the district.</B></P>
<P><B>The excess cost has been $1.3 billion beyond the regular school budget, or more than $36,000 for each of the district's 36,000 pupil </B><B>placements.  This, in turn, required significant financial support from the state, support that could only be provided by scrimping on </B><B>what was available for the rest of the state's schools and students.</B></P>
<P><B>The result?  The racial balance is unchanged.  University of Missouri Professor John Alspaugh says there has been no improvement in </B><B>reading and math scores.  Students in elementary schools which did not become magnet schools outperform those in schools that were </B><B>among the chosen.</B></P>
<P><B><I>The Economist</I></B><B> says that, despite the rise in expenditure, &quot;the drop-out rate has risen every year, without fail, since the decree was handed </B><B>down, and now stands at a disgraceful 60%&quot;</B></P>
<P><B>It also reminded its readers that University of Rochester economist Eric Hanushek has cited almost 200 studies that indicate more spending </B><B>on traditional schooling does not translate into improved learning, higher attendance or other desirable goals.</B></P>
<P><B>A Jack Anderson column, &quot;School vouchers proposed in N.J.,&quot; </B><B><I>The Erie Times</I></B><B>, Sept. 23, 1993, tells of the efforts by Jersey City Mayor Bret </B><B>Schundler, who will address the REACH conference in December, to introduce school choice into that district, one that was taken over by </B><B>the state of New Jersey in 1989, because it was ruled a &quot;total educational failure.&quot;  The district is only a bit smaller than Kansas City, 30,000 </B><B>students instead of 36,000. </B></P>
<P><B>What has the state done? </B></P>
<P><B>Mostly, the usual - thrown money at the problem, more than $100 million in four years.  While falling short of the Kansas City monetary </B><B>deluge, that is still a significant amount.</B></P>
<P><B>Yet fewer than half of the district's 9th graders pass the state proficiency exam and more than half the students drop out.  Perhaps </B><B>unknowingly, the district is about to embark on the Kansas City journey by instituting a magnet program, with specialized schools </B><B>emphasizing science and technology, engineering, etc.  It isn't quite clear how they propose to have students </B></P>
<P><B>achieve in such areas when they are not proficient in basic skills. In the meantime, the city's nonpublic schools, which spend far less per </B><B>pupil, about $3,500 per year, graduate 90 percent of their students, a high proportion of whom pursue postsecondary studies. </B></P>
<P><B>There is an old chestnut about the businessman who lost money on every sale but hoped to make it up on volume.</B></P>
<P><B>It has also been said that one form of insanity is to do more of what you have been doing and expect different results.</B></P>
<P><B>Both of these seem to be variations of the process of public schooling.  Of all the professions, (accepting for the moment that education is a </B><B>profession), those in education should be the least likely to follow the same unsuccessful road that others have tread before them.</B></P>
<P><B>Those who claim to teach critical thinking and problem solving should be able to think critically and solve some of their own problems.  </B><B>Instead, they seem unwilling to even discuss alternatives, much less accept them.</B></P>
<P><B>Where are the establishment groups that promote open and full debate of any and</B></P>
<P><B>all educational ideas?  Where are the ones that are willing to support trial efforts of any and all alternative programs to see whether they </B><B>show promise of working better, and being more beneficial to both students and the public interest than what now exists?</B></P>
<P><B>It is this inability of its defenders to establish viable programs that threatens the present system, not the reformers.  As Myron Lieberman </B><B>says in his latest book, </B><B><I>Public Education: An Autopsy</I></B><B>, (Harvard Univ. Press, 1993) &quot;promarket forces have one ineradicable advantage </B><B>...the inherent futility of conventional school reform.  The direction of change in public opinions is not in doubt: the emergence of a </B><B>market system is a question of when, not if.&quot;</B></P>

<P>From &quot;the more things change the more they stay the same&quot; file: &quot;If it were not for the school systems' monopoly on the education of the poor, the schools would have gone bankrupt long ago.&quot; Allan C. Ornstein, p. 91, &quot;Decentralizing Urban Schools,&quot; <I>Journal of Secondary Education</I>, February 1971</P>
<P>Even with the monopoly, bankruptcy may be approaching. Some of the reasons why were pointed out in 1978 by Ed Steimel, President of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry:</P>
<P>&quot;Public education (1) cannot be improved from within; (2) will not accept change so long as the bur-eaucracy can resist it; (3) must reach the brink of disaster or per-haps fall to ruin before the bur-eaucracy can be overthrown; (4) is doomed in its present form because it has totally lost the element of competition which is essential to the setting of priorities and the achievement of goals; (5) will probably survive long after it has died; and (6) will probably exper-ience reincarnation in another form of publicly financed education.&quot;  </P>
<P>Here are some signs that &quot;the brink of the disaster&quot; may be near. </P>
<P>Last school year, the Holyoke, Massachusetts schools dismissed more than a third of its faculty.  Seventy students in an auto mechanic class, spoke only Spanish while their teacher spoke only English.</P>
<P>Students at Lawrence High School Had to bring toilet paper to school because the district could not longer afford to buy it.</P>
<P>In Wales, Massachusetts, five of the seven teachers at the elementary school were dismissed, leaving the principal with 58 students in a combined 5th &amp; 6th grade class, one teacher with a class of 52 3rd and 4th graders; and the other teacher has a class of 76, made up of kindergarten through 2nd grade students.  The school also had no custodian or secretary. Despite this, the community voted against raising property taxes to rehire the teachers but did approve raising $20,000 to collect garbage.</P>
<P>California had cut education spending by 12% (after inflation) in three years.  Despite this, in early September the state cut aid to education by $2 billion, and said it would hold basic state per-pupil funding steady over the next two years.  Even that now seems doubtful, with predict-ions the state is facing another deficit, of $7.5 billion.  In the Sonoma Valley Unified School District, administrators and teachers have not had a salary increase in two years, while the San Jose district may have to reduce its budget by 20% in the next three years.</P>
<P>A national survey found 74% of 50 principals had budget cuts, 40% had let teachers go; Nearly half had cut back on music, art and programs for the gifted, and 80% had eliminated field trips.</P>
<P>In Texas 76% of the districts responding to a survey said they had either cut or frozen teacher pay - the Sterling City School District cut starting salaries by $1,282.</P>
<P>Florida's Broward County cut nearly $20 million out of its budget,and eliminated the positions of 35 assistant principals, 109 primary specialists, and 300 high school teachers.</P>
<P>Last June, the St. Louis School District laid off 295 employees, including 80 teachers.  The Board had earlier voted to eliminate a total of 457 positions.  Another 162 were eliminated  by attrition. They also planned to close 10 of their 123 schools.</P>
<P>At the beginning of this school year, there were predictions of a $400 million shortfall in Maryland this year and level state funding next year.  This could bring about funding reductions for the eighth time in two years.</P>
<P>Minnesota school administrators suggested that the state freeze school employees salaries and revoke the teachers' right to strike.</P>
<P>By late November, Los Angeles, the nation's second largest school district, was facing bankruptcy. This is a district where half of the entering kindergarten students do not speak English and half of the nearly 650,000 students live in poverty.  The state, as noted above, is in no position to make up the funding gaps.  Nor is the federal govern-ment, although some educators have high expectations of the incoming administration.  Great increases in federal funding cannot be realized since the national annual deficit is in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Even with selective cuts in some programs there is no chance of a balanced federal budget in the immediate future so any new or expanded initiatives can only be paid for by borrowed dollars.</P>
<P>Colorado voters in November defeated a proposed sales tax hike, so the public schools there reportedly face at least a 9% drop in per-pupil funding next year. This is compounded in districts where property values have declined because of the adoption of a tax limitation measure.</P>
<P>Even wealthy, and high-spending, states are not exempt.  Connecticut has eliminated all funding of gifted programs, resulting in 36 districts discontinuing such offerings.</P>
<P>New Jersey, which adopted a record tax increase, and revised its school funding formula a year and a half ago, is witnessing the same stress, even in the more affluent suburban areas.  Barbara Horl, who heads a school board in a mostly white-collar suburban area, was quoted in <I>The New York Times</I> on Nov. 29, as saying &quot;Everyone who is part of the public schools is seeing the strain...how long we can continue holding the system together before something snaps is the big question for not only us but school districts everywhere.&quot;</P>
<P>Pennsylvanians know they are part of this mix.  Last year the Sto Rox School District in western Pennsylvania, despite having one of the highest property tax rates, became financially distressed and was taken over by the state,   That's the third district where the state has had to do this in the last 20 years.  The pace may be about to pick up, with predictions that nearly 40 other districts are almost in the same condition.  Some claim that figure could go as high as 100 in the next year or so.</P>
<P>The Philadelphia School District began this school year with overcrowded classes, some at Germantown High School with more than 60 students.  <I>The Inquirer</I> has cited transfers from private and parochial schools as a contributing factor, a trend that has been going on for years, as was pointed out during the debate over school choice funding a year ago.  It would be much more efficient, and educationally effective, to keep students in nonpublic schools, even at a cost of $2-3,000 each - and only $900 was proposed - than for them to transfer to public schools at a cost of $7,000 each.</P>
<P>One teacher facing up to the issue is Jonnie Johns, a San Fernando Valley English teacher:</P>
<P>&quot;The union is jumping up and down for money that the district doesn't have, that the state doesn't have, and that the country doesn't have.  Everybody is putting their head in the sand, bickering over dollars, and they're not facing the truth, that the system is collapsing.  We're out of money, we're out of morality, we're out of everything.&quot;</P>
<P>Teachers are leaving, unfortunately including the best ones, such as the 1988-89 Idaho State Teacher of the Year, and New York State's 1991 Teacher of the Year.</P>
<P>Bob Lemoine, social studies department at Germantown, said  &quot;somebody's got to figure out how we can do it better.&quot;  </P>
<P>Clearly the establishment has no idea what to do except call for more money, money which isn't going to materialize in any significant amounts.</P>
<P>The sad thing is there are ways to do it better, including but not restricted to school choice, but they can't even get a fair hearing, much less be tried.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, the choices are: 1) large increases in funding for the present system, 2) let the system slowly strangle, along with the welfare of millions of youngsters, or, 3) change the system. The first is impossible, the second is undesirable, so the third should be inevitable - and it may be, but apparently not without passing through a period of chaos first.</P>

<P><B>&quot;There's a saying among teachers: If you think education is expens-ive, try ignorance.  Education is tremendously expensive in the United </B><B>States, but what we are getting for our money is ignor-ance.&quot; p. 51, John Chancellor, </B><B><I>Peril and Promise</I></B><B>, NY: Harper &amp; Row, 1990</B></P>
<P><B>NBC's John Chancellor is right.</B></P>
<P><B>The idea that more money, by itself, will lead to improved education is held by too many.  The representative of one educational group in the </B><B>state, commenting a few months ago at a hearing of the House Education Committee on the Outcome-Based Education proposals being put </B><B>into effect, said they would be difficult to implement &quot;when funding of education is at an all-time low.&quot;  This caused Chairman Ron Cowell </B><B>to say that, while the committee was there to receive comments and not to debate with anyone, it is more accurate to say that funding of </B><B>public education is at an all-time high.  And it is.</B></P>
<P><B>Figures from </B><B><I>The Condition of Education/1992</I></B><B>, the latest annual report from the U.S. Department of Education, prove it.</B></P>
<P><B>Using constant 1991 dollars, total revenues per pupil were $623 in 1930.  By 1990, they were $5,399, nearly nine times as great.  </B></P>
<P><B>They grew from $623 in 1930 to $835 in 1940, up 34%.  By 1950 it was $1,188, a 42% boost.  By 1960 funding grew 59%, to $1,885; and the </B><B>1960s saw a tremendous upsurge in costs, 67%, to $3,144 in 1970, a decade that also saw a great increase in the number of students, from </B><B>35.2 million in 1960 to 45.6 million in 1970, the greatest increase of any single decade.</B></P>
<P><B>By contrast, enrollment declined in the 1970s and 1980s, from 45.6 million in 1970 to 41.6 million in 1980 and to 40.5 million in 1990.</B></P>
<P><B>Still, per pupil revenues rose, up 33% from 1970-1980, reaching $4,188 in 1980; and 29% more in the 1980s, to $5,399 in 1990.</B></P>
<P><B>The 29% rate of increase in the 1980s was the lowest of any of the six decades, but note that the base to which that rate applied was much </B><B>greater.  So, while the rate increase was only 29%, the dollar per pupil growth was $1,211, almost twice as great as the total dollars per pupil </B><B>in 1930.</B></P>
<P><B>Two things should seem to be clear from this history.  First, if money alone could resolve the crisis in public education, it would have </B><B>happened a long time ago.</B></P>
<P><B>Second, it seems unlikely that a similar expansion in per pupil revenues will be possible in the decades ahead.  Projecting the increase of the </B><B>past six decades to the next six gives a per pupil figure of $46,788 in the year 2050.  </B></P>
<P><B>As indicated, these figures are based on constant 1991 dollars.  In dollars of the time, which will vary in value, as well as changes in pupil </B><B>enrollment, the figure 60 years from now would be well in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per student.</B></P>
<P><B>Does anyone really believe this is possible?</B></P>
<P><B>Whatever one's position on public education may be, and attitude toward taxes, there are, in general terms, only three scenarios confronting </B><B>us.</B></P>
<P><B>The first is that we come up with substantial amounts of new dollars to keep the present system afloat.</B></P>
<P><B>And substantial means just that - huge amounts of money, not just a few percent more per year.</B></P>
<P><B>The second is that the present system continues on its slow path of financial strangulation as it struggles to maintain itself without what its </B><B>practitioners regard as sufficient funds.</B></P>
<P><B>The third option is for the system to be changed - really changed.</B></P>
<P><B>Since the first option is not possible, and the second option is not desirable, the third alternative must be inevitable.</B></P>
<P><B>If this outline is correct, the pertinent questions then become: what changes are desirable or necessary?   How are they to be brought about? </B><B>  How desperate must the situation become before it is generally accepted that the present system cannot survive?   And how many </B><B>students must suffer the consequences in the meantime?</B></P>
<P><B>Nor is this just a statistical exercise.  The &quot;more money&quot;' theory has been tried, and in sums not likely to be duplicated.</B></P>
<P><B>&quot;A generation ago John Henry Martin put the platitudes to the test and found them wanting.  The things that are supposed to make public </B><B>schools work were tried: more money; more teachers... smaller classes; more specialists.  And they didn't work.  Martin realized they didn't </B><B>work, wrote that they didn't work...But these same ideas continue to be promoted and believed.</B></P>
<P><B>&quot;Martin was the superintendent of a school district which supported an increase in the budget of thirty-five percent, making possible many </B><B>changes that are supposed to make for efficient schools and efficient education.</B></P>
<P><B>Average class size went from over thirty pupils to about twenty.  Specialists of all kinds were hired or increased in number: guidance </B><B>counselors, psychologists, social workers, classroom aides and remedial teachers.  Two full-time remedial teaching teachers were </B><B>assigned to each elementary school in which the average enrollment was six hundred students.</B></P>
<P><B>&quot;Teachers with advanced degrees were hired, the curriculum was updated, an extensive in-service program for teachers was initiated, a </B><B>teacher council was chosen by secret ballot, and dozens of other reforms were introduced.</B></P>
<P><B>&quot;After two years, outside evaluators were hired to make a thorough and detailed assessment of the results.</B></P>
<P><B>&quot;Students took achievement tests, with the results analyzed by class size, teacher age and experience, and the students' race, sex, and family </B><B>income.</B></P>
<P><B>&quot;Martin reported:</B></P>
<P><B> </B><B>In the end, the cherished faith died...all that was done to make a difference had made no difference.  The panaceas were, after all, only </B><B>false promises--vain expectations. All the patented prescriptions... that made such a grand appearance in the college textbooks and the </B><B>theses of the pedagogues had failed the hard test of reality in the field.  pp 103, John Henry Martin and Charles H. Harrison, </B><B><I>Free To </I></B><B><I>Learn</I></B><B>, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&quot;</B></P>
<P><B>(The preceding is from pp 12-13, of my book, </B><B><I>Choice in Schooling</I></B><B>, Chicago: Loyola University Press, 1990)</B></P>
<P><B>A similar program was tried in New York City in the late 1960s. Termed the More Effective Schools (MES) Program, it was a cooperative effort </B><B>by the school district and the New York local of the American Federation of Teachers, then headed by Al Shanker, now the AFT's national </B><B>president.  It was introduced with much fanfare, and did many of the things tried in Martin's district.</B></P>
<P><B>The result was the same,  Much more money was spent (it might more properly have been called the More Expensive Schools program), with </B><B>no significant gains in academic achievement; teacher-pupil ratios were reduced to better than one to twelve; evaluated, it was found </B><B>ineffective, rather than effective; only four of 21 schools had students reading at grade level on the average; and all four had a student </B><B>body consisting mostly of white middle-class students.  </B></P>
<P><B>In the mid-1970s the program was quietly dropped. (pp 13-14, same source)</B></P>
<P><B>In short, those who oppose school choice and/or other proposals to have meaningful change need to come up with alternatives of their own. </B><B> Opposition isn't enough.   Time is running out.</B></P>
<P><B>On a separate note, it might also be noted that, since school choice is criticized by some as &quot;elitist,&quot; that when </B><B><I>Brown vs. Board of </I></B><B><I>Education</I></B><B>, was handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954, 17 of the 20 largest public school districts in the nation were </B><B>majority white.  Today, The enrollment in all of the 25 largest public school districts is largely  minorities, and disadvantaged minorities at </B><B>that. The same is true for smaller cities.  Harrisburg has more minority and disadvantaged students, than the other 23 districts in </B><B>Cumberland, Dauphin and Perry Counties combined.  And most of its teachers live in other districts.</B></P>

<P>Despite much lip service to the contrary, teachers and teacher unions frequently view citizen/parent participation in school affairs as a threat to their benefits and their prerogatives.  Although the importance of teacher/parent cooperation is obvious, parent/teacher relations are actually characterized by inherent conflicts of interest.</P>
<P>   For instance, parents want teachers to be available to meet with parents after school or on Saturdays or weekends.  Clearly, such availability is not in the interests of teachers.  They prefer to be duty free as much as possible; typically, they view availability to parents before or after the regular school day as an extra duty which calls for additional compensation.  In saying this, I impute to teachers only the same degree of self interest that characterizes most workers.  At some point, however, we must distinguish employer from employee rights; understandably, teachers, like employees generally, draw the line more in their favor than their employers would.  </P>
<P> Of course, parents are not the legal employers of public school teachers.  Nevertheless, teacher employment responsibilities are important to parents in ways that go far beyond the ordinary citizen's stake in public education.  A critical point is that these ways involve conflicts of interest that are typically resolved in collective bargaining between teacher unions and school boards.  For example:</P>
<P> 1.  Teachers prefer to work the fewest possible days; parents often prefer a longer school year.</P>
<P> 2.  Parents want a convenient and expeditious complaint procedure vis-a-vis' complaints against teachers.  In contrast, teacher unions typically bargain for a wide variety of procedural requirements, such as insistence that parental complaints be in writing; a teacher right to have a union representative present when parents complain; and brief time limits for submitting parental complaints.</P>
<P> 3.  Teachers want complete control over pupil grades; parents want an appeal procedure to challenge grades they perceive as unfair.</P>
<P> The situation can be summarized as follows:  Parent/teacher cooperation is conducive to pupil achievement.  Such cooperation, however, has significant implications for teacher terms and conditions of employment.  Conflicts inevitably arise over these employment issues.  In the overwhelming majority of school districts, the teacher union positions render it more difficult for parents to articulate or defend their needs, interests, preferences, and/or complaints.</P>
<P> On teacher availability for parental conferences, we can envisage the following:</P>
<P>  School District A.   </P>
<P>  Teachers shall be available:</P>
<P> 1.  Without additional compensation any day after school by appointment.</P>
<P> 2.  One evening a month during the school year.</P>
<P> 3.  One Saturday morning a month during the school year.</P>
<P> 4.  Also at other times paid for by the district at an agreed upon hourly rate.</P>
<P>  School District B.  </P>
<P>  Teachers shall be available:</P>
<P> 1.  One day a week after school, from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.</P>
<P> 2.  Two evenings each semester at PTA meetings.</P>
<P> 3.  No weekend or other availability except as agreed to by the teachers.</P>
<P>  School District C.</P>
<P>  Teachers shall be available:</P>
<P> 1.  One evening each semester.</P>
<P> 2.  One entire day, teacher time paid by the school district, pupils dismissed for          the day.</P>
<P> Leaving in abeyance the issue of fairness to teachers, and considering teacher availability from a parental perspective, many parents have jobs which preclude after school conferences with teachers, or would require a substantial loss of pay. Saturdays would be most convenient and most economical for many parents.  Parents who can meet with teachers after school on some days cannot on others, hence rigid limits on availability is virtually certain to render teachers unavailable to many parents.</P>
<P> The variations in parental home and employment obligations require considerable flexibility in teacher availability if all parents who wish to confer in person with a teacher are to be able to do so without a significant financial sacrifice.  To summarize briefly, both parents and teachers have legitimate but conflicting interests on teacher availability.  Hours of employment, however, are a mandatory subject of bargaining.  That is, both the teacher union and the school board must bargain on the issue if requested to do so by the other party.  Consequently, in most school districts, the issue is resolved by collective bargaining.  The bargaining is not between parents (or parental organizations) and teacher unions; it is between representatives of the school board and of the teacher union.  The adequacy of teacher representation is indisputable.  Most teachers are represented by, or have available at bargaining tables, full-time experienced union representatives with impressive backup support.  These union representatives know the provisions relating to teacher availability in every school district.  The school board negotiator who proposes four evening meetings a year will have to explain why nearby districts require two, one or even none, except at the option of the teacher.</P>
<P> The union will agree to parent meetings during the regular school day, but if and only if the school board agrees to delete a day of instruction.  Such negotiated decisions become a part of the union contract, which has the force of law for its duration.  And so goes the real world of parent/teacher cooperation, as unremitting in teacher interests as in any other aspect of bargaining.</P>
<P> Parents and/or parental organizations do not bargain on behalf of parental interests; that is a school board responsibility.  Ideally, the board negotiations take into account all the interest groups with a stake in an issue: parents, taxpayers, employers, teachers, support staff, and so on.  These interest groups rarely have their own representatives present during teacher bargaining; as a practical matter, the school boards decide how much or how little weight to accord to parental interests.</P>
<P> In practice, school boards accord minimal weight to parental interests.  One reason is that the PTA, which supposedly represents parent interests, does not take sides on school district collective bargaining issues.  Incredible as it may seem, the PTA opted for neutrality in 1968 and reaffirmed this position in 1987.  Because of the far-reaching implications of the PTA policy with respect to collective bargaining, let me spell out in full its resolution on the subject. </P>
<P>          P O S I T I O N   S T A T E M E N T</P>
<P>TEACHER NEGOTIATIONS, SANCTIONS, AND STRIKES, (1968)</P>
<P> Teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes are very much a part of the reality of operating public schools.  While there are great variations throughout the country in the intensity of teacher militancy, no school system can escape the necessity of responding to the growing voice in educational decision-making.  Not only do school boards and school administrators have to reckon with teacher militancy, but PTA becomes involved.</P>
<P> The PTA, because of its strategic position, has become involved in activities related to negotiations and may find itself on the horns of several dilemmas.</P>
<P> 1.  If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.</P>
<P> 2.  If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.</P>
<P> 3.  If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities.</P>
<P> As a result, PTA leadership in local units, councils, and states has expressed an urgent need for guidance in this difficult situation.</P>
<P><U>Guide to State Congresses</U></P>
<P> The best efforts of state PTAs in regard to teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes start with alertness before a situation arises.</P>
<P> 1.  Study state laws regarding negotiations, sanctions, and strikes so as to act within the law, and so that counsel to local units will be consistent with the law.</P>
<P> 2.  Seek to bring together in conference meetings the state leadership of all groups concerned for the purpose of mutual understanding.</P>
<P> 3.  Encourage state legislation which will improve the procedures for negotiations and resolution of impasse.</P>
<P> 4.  Help local units understand particular state issues involved.</P>
<P> 5.  Urge school boards and teachers to establish frequent and regular lines of communication about educational concerns.</P>
<P><U>Guidelines for Councils and Local Units</U></P>
<P> Because situations locally vary so widely, both across the country and even within states, guidelines cannot be highly specific.  A great deal of discretion in action is left to the council and the local unit.  These are suggested measures for action organized appropriately to three phases:  the pre-strike period, during the strike, and after the strike.  These guidelines, plus counsel from the state PTA and the basic good judgement of the people, should enable the council and the local PtAs to minimize the dilemmas and to contribute constructively to community understanding, teacher satisfactions, renewal of cordial parent-teacher dialogue,and improved educational climate for children.</P>
<P><U>Pre-strike period</U></P>
<P> 1.  Continue to work for quality education.  Efforts in this regard reassure teachers that parents are helping to achieve their goals of greater job satisfactions and improvement of substandard salaries.</P>
<P> 2.  Be alert to early symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction:</P>
<P> a.  Abnormal turnover in teaching staff and administrators.</P>
<P> b.  Teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature.</P>
<P> c.  Growing dissatisfaction of teachers as evidenced by complaints. </P>
<P> 3.  Seek action that corrects the basic causes of dissatisfaction -- salaries, student conduct, teaching conditions, lack of participation in decision-making.</P>
<P> 4.  Inform the officers of teachers' organizations, the school boards, and administrators of the appropriate role PTA might play in the event of a work stoppage, and be advised as to provisions for the welfare and safety of children during work stoppage. </P>
<P> 5.  Urge school boards and local teachers' organizations to consider the advisability of developing written agreements on negotiation procedures, including grievance procedures.  Because work stoppages and negotiations are ofttimes conducted in a way that tends to create dissension and low morale that are harmful to children, the PTA should do all it can to prevent such situations from developing.  The advance planning and the orderly procedures embodied in written agreements may avert strikes.</P>
<P> 6.  Learn from the school board and the teachers' organizations what issues are being negotiated.</P>
<P> 7.  Provide full public airing of the issues.  The purpose of these discussions is to dispel confusion and develop intelligent, informed public opinion.  If a strong majority opinion develops regarding an issue that affects children, the PTA has a responsibility to bring this to the attention of the negotiation parties.  PTAs should be keenly aware that the decisions made in negotiations ofttimes have much more of an impact upon the welfare of children than to temporary closing of the school and other disruptive action.</P>
<P> 8.  Reexamine the role of teacher members in the local unit.  Teachers as well as parents should join and participate by individual choice.  Their motivation to participate should spring from a professional awareness of the unique contributions which they may render and the value of teacher rapport with parents and the community.  The teacher continues as a willing partner in the PTA when participation is free of unwarranted expectations.</P>
<P><U>During the Strike</U></P>
<P> 1.  Urge immediate and continuous negotiations and if necessary mediation to get schools open as soon as possible.  If negotiation is delayed, the PTA should seek to bring the school board representatives and teachers' organization representatives together.</P>
<P> 2.  Serve as an open forum to inform the public on the points of disagreements and the progress of negotiations.</P>
<P> 3.  PTA should not man the classrooms, except possibly for a day in the absence of advance notice of a strike.  No only is manning of classrooms inconsistent with PTA efforts to obtain a qualified teacher in every classroom, but personal liability may be incurred.  If the school administration intends to keep the schools open during a teacher walkout, it should develop a corps of volunteers outside the PTA structure.</P>
<P> 4.  Suggest and urge appropriate action by parents, community agencies, and volunteer groups that will protect children during the period the school is closed.</P>
<P> 5.  Encourage the full and continuous participation of teacher members in PTA activities.</P>
<P><U>After the Strike</U></P>
<P> 1.  Plan activities that will restore harmony, promote teacher morale, and renew parent-teacher dialogue.</P>
<P> 2.  Through informed public opinion see that the negotiated agreements which settled the strike are faithfully implemented.</P>
<P> 3.  Work for community understanding and support of school needs.</P>
<P> </P>
<P> Clearly, the aforesaid PTA policy is a colossal victory for the teacher unions; it neutralizes the one interest group most likely to oppose teacher union positions from participation in the bargaining process.  If the organization representing parents does not complain about excessive tenure protections, teacher unavailability to meet with parents, and complaint procedures geared to teacher protections instead of parental rights, it is very unlikely that any other organization will do so.  Deplorably but understandably,  </P>
<P>school boards accord minimal weight to parental interests.   Consider also the fact that many school board members are elected as the result of teacher union support.  Thus, while the parents have taken themselves out of the process, the teachers and their unions are active at every stage of it, usually to the detriment of the parents.  As the PTA resolution explicitly recognizes, the intimidation factor also plays a role at the school and teacher levels.  Many parents are afraid of teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests.  The prevailing thought is that parents must be in a supportive role, no matter what the issue. </P>
<P> In view of PTA neutrality and union opposition to proposals contrary to teacher interests, it is virtually impossible for school boards to negotiate pro-parent positions on collective bargaining issues.  To do so would require that parents challenge teachers at PTA meetings in which the teachers themselves are present and well prepared to crush any movement in this direction.  Under these circumstances, the PTA's neutrality in bargaining is a tremendous advantage for teacher unions.  When school boards do not receive bargaining proposals that protect parental interests, and subsequently sacrifice parental to teacher interests, as often happens, the PTA cannot object; neutrality comes to the fore.</P>
<P><B>Who then will advocate for parents?</B></P>
<P> Because they are subservient to teacher unions, the PTAs cannot provide parents with a useful role in educational policymaking.  PTA programs are designed to diminish, not to increase dissatisfaction with school performance.  Instead of hearings to expose academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events where the best work of students is presented.  Significant time and effort are involved in teacher support services, such as trip chaperoning, and fund raising for school activities.  PTA parents are supposed to be supporters, not critics of schools and teachers.  After nearly 100 years, the PTA can not offer even the pretense of affecting basic educational decisions.  </P>
<P> Interestingly enough, in its early years the PTA did not include teachers qua teachers.  Nor should it be assumed that its transformation from an organization representing parents to an organization which has abandoned its initial raison d'&#234;tre occurred without any internal turmoil and loss of membership.  As a result of criticism of teacher unions by some state and local PTA's, teacher union members threatened to or actually withdrew their membership and boycotted PTA activities.  More than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA in 1966 when PTA power peaked.  Its financial status at that time made other citizen groups drool with envy, but by 1974 neither the <U>PTA </U><U>Magazine</U> nor the association could make ends meet.  The National PTA lost over six million members from 1966 to 1982, precisely the years in which collective bargaining by teacher unions increased to unprecedented levels.  Indisputably, teacher opposition to the PTA played a significant role in the decline of parent membership as well.</P>
<P> Nevertheless, the facade of cooperation was carried on among the national leadership during these years of overt teacher/parent conflicts.  In fact, the 1970 National PTA program included David Selden, President of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), as a panel participant on &quot;Parent Involvement in the Schools.&quot;  Meanwhile, the National Education Association (NEA), was distributing literature in the PTA convention exhibit area.  By this time, PTA membership had dropped by about three million, whereas the NEA gained 85,880 members in 1970.</P>
<P> By 1970 both the NEA and AFT were vigorously lobbying for state legislation to legitimize and regulate collective bargaining negotiations by unions of school district employees.  Wisconsin had been the first state to do so in 1962, followed in 1965 by California, Connecticut, Michigan, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington.  By April 1972, 29 states had passed legislation requiring school boards to bargain with teacher unions.  Although bargaining rights were enacted partly because legislative approaches to teacher terms and conditions of employment were deemed ineffective, the paradoxical result of the bargaining laws was to strengthen the teacher unions politically. </P>
<P>  At its 1972 convention, the NEA established its Political Action Committee (NEA-PAC).  As a result, the NEA became even more effective as a special interest group.  At first, the PTA tried to emulate this development.  At its 1972 convention, the PTA dropped its policy that the PTA &quot;will not interfere with administration of schools and shall not seek to control their policies.&quot;   The organization's new goal was to &quot;seek to participate in the decision-making process establishing school policy&quot; instead of sitting passively on the sidelines.   However, the teacher unions, had decided that the most effective way to advance teacher welfare and security was to characterize these objectives as benefitting parents and children.  Consequently, and as a result of their much greater resources, the teacher unions largely upstaged the PTA as the advocate for parents and children.</P>
<P> At the same time, teachers were again reassured of their dominant position within the PTA.  With specific reference to the controversial 1968 Resolution, the 1972 National PTA President said &quot;In the role of teacher strikes and the PTA role, I hope all of you will read the PTA guidelines carefully.  Teachers, administrators and school board members were consulted in their legal and professional capacities.  The importance to teachers will be obvious to any reader.&quot;</P>
<P> In defiance of the 1968 PTA Resolution, many American parents abandoned the national PTA policies on teacher bargaining and teacher strikes.  For example, most parents in Hortonville, Wisconsin, sided with their school board, not with their PTA counterparts, during a strike in that district.  Even though Wisconsin law prohibited strikes by public employees, Hortonville teachers struck on March 18, 1974.  The Hortonville school board unexpectedly fired the teachers for engaging in an illegal strike and for violating their individual contracts.  On April 8 school reopened with replacement teachers.  The town veterinarian made appearances at the school's agriculture classes and more than 100 other parents volunteered for door duty and playground supervision.  </P>
<P>  When PTA National President Lillie E. Herndon was asked in 1974 if there were &quot;any teachers left in the PTA?&quot; she acknowledged that in 1970 the National PTA quietly quit keeping track of the occupations and ages of its members.  As a result, a lack of demographic data continues to handicap PTA efforts to assess membership attitudes toward the organization. </P>
<P> At a 1974 joint meeting of NEA, AFT and PTA officials, officers of the NEA and AFT asked PTA leaders:  &quot;Why don't you people just form a parents group and leave the teachers out of it?&quot;  The suggestion went unheeded and extensive press coverage publicized the continuing parent/teacher conflicts.  For example, the state PTA and the Ohio Education Association (OEA) split over three bills in the Ohio legislature.  Two of these bills involved teacher certification, training and dismissal; the third was an association supported negotiations bill that included binding arbitration.  The state PTA actively and successfully opposed several OEA legislative proposals.  Consequently, at its 1976 state convention, OEA adopted a resolution asking its 85,000 teachers to drop out of the PTA, to boycott all PTA activities, and to encourage parents to form new parent-teacher organizations not affiliated with the PTA.  Understandably, the 1976 Ohio PTA President said, &quot;For years we did everything the teacher association wanted and we never disagreed about anything.  Now that we're beginning to deal with real issues, they (the union) have a different opinion about us.&quot;  </P>
<P> Elsewhere, teachers and parents continued to fight over legislative issues.  In 1977, the Indiana PTA voted not to support the teacher union proposals for limits on class size, teacher preparation time and provisions which would allow the union to collect service fees from all teachers regardless of union membership.  Two years later, PTA President Grace Baisinger, played a prominent role in organizing the National Coalition to Save Public Education.  Coalition members and the PTA vehemently opposed (and still oppose) tuition tax credits (or vouchers) to enable parents to enroll their children in public and/or private elementary and secondary schools of choice.  Despite the absence of statistics on the issue, it is likely that many private school parents dropped out of the PTA as a protest against PTA's policies on these issues.  Parents of students, and teachers in nonpublic schools were fighting for their own convictions.  </P>
<P> In an effort to increase PTA's lagging membership, the PTA launched an allout attack on rival parent-teacher organizations (PTOs) and parent advisory councils.  Parent advisory councils were mandated by federal law and were often required to focus on specific groups of children, such as the bilingual or the gifted or disadvantaged.  In 1977, Congress dealt the PTA a severe blow by requiring schools and school districts to set up new councils to meet the law, rather than use the existing councils in which PTA had been represented.  California, Florida and Illinois have required citizen involvement in some state funded school improvement programs for several years, as have other states.  </P>
<P> Similar requirements for parent involvement are included in the Goals 2000 legislation which was passed by the 103rd Congress, March 31, 1994.  With its membership now stabilized at just over six million, the PTA is urging its members to become the parent representatives on these federally funded councils, possibly shutting out representation from other parent groups.  Insofar as this happens, the teacher</P>
<P>unions will be assured of support from council members purporting to represent parents.</P>
<P> Although much more remains to be said about PTA subservience to teacher unions, let me conclude with a few comments about the possibilities for parent empowerment on educational matters.  In thinking about how to represent parental interests more effectively, NEA history is instructive.  Prior to teacher bargaining, the NEA included both teachers and administrators at the local, state, and national levels.  Local associations were almost invariably ineffectual defenders of teacher interests.  It was practically impossible to propose an action or policy critical of school administrators when the latter were members of the association, especially if active in its governance.   Similarly, the PTA's futility results from its all-inclusive membership policies.  Unless the teachers leave as they began to do in 1967, or are expelled, the PTAs will continue to be an exercise in futility.</P>
<P> The only other feasible solution is to establish a new parental organization which does not include teachers in its governance structure.  This would be extremely difficult to do since many teachers would presumably still have the right to join and participate as parents.  However, as public resentment against skyrocketing costs, dismal educational results, and questionable educational reforms increases, parents are more likely to demand a stronger presence in educational policymaking.  Increasingly, citizen participation in educational affairs will highlight the differences between noneducators and teachers who are employed in the schools.  Consequently, parents are seeking organizations and procedures through which they, the primary consumers, can make the government education monopolies more responsive.   As this struggle intensifies, the teacher unions will undoubtedly do their utmost to preserve the six million member PTA in its present form.  The unions may well be successful in this effort, but their success may also convince many parents that school choice and competition is the only way to empower parents to control the education of their children.</P>
<P>   </P>
<P>    </P>
<P> The resolution's sponsor made an impassioned plea for support of her position.  She compared its importance to eliminating cigarette smoking by minors, a continuing effort by the PTA, first begun in 1926.</P>
<P> Brief discussion followed; an amendment was defeated, and the resolution was passed within the limited minute debate period.  Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers and Students had passed their only resolution: &quot;That the California State PTA seek participation in coalitions to study the effects of electro-magnetic fields.&quot;  Delegates further directed the PTA leadership to inform its districts, councils and units about the EMF issue.</P>
<P> At that same convention, the audience broke into thunderous applause when a speaker asserted that the California PTA had defeated the voucher bill known as Proposition 174 in November 1993.  &quot;You were the voice of the California children!&quot; she shouted.</P>
<P> Thirty-six days later, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories meeting in Las Vegas were considering resolutions dealing with violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms.  Generally known as the PTA, this is the National Congress of Parents and Teachers at work in 1994.</P>
<P><B>National Congress of Mothers</B></P>
<P> In 1885 Alice McClellan Birney, a former journalist, wife of a prominent Washington lawyer and mother, envisioned an organization &quot;uniting in holiest purpose&quot; to educate all the mothers of the country about the supreme importance of the child.  Mrs. Birney was fortunate that hot summer at Chautauqua, New York, where the first adult education center in the United States was holding its annual summer school.</P>
<P> Ten thousand men and women were at the conference.  Two prominent kindergarten teachers who were holding a series of mothers' meetings were among them.  In their local communities, kindergarten teachers often invited visits from parents, and occasionally formed child study circles from these visits.  At the Chautauqua meeting, however, the idea of a national effort to educate parents in child care excited the audience.</P>
<P> At the meeting, several ministers requested Mrs. Birney to speak to their congregations on &quot;Better Trained Mothers.&quot;  To organize the mothers' group, Mrs. Birney enlisted the financial support of Phoebe Apperson Hearst, the 53 year old widow of California Senator George Hearst, and the mother of the future newspaper publisher, William Randolph Hearst.  Hoping to encourage at least 50 women to come to Washington to support her vision, Mrs. Birney sent a four-page invitation to attend the First National Congress of Mothers, February 17-19, 1887.  The invitation, which was sent to all the leading women's clubs in America, stated in part:</P>
<P> &quot;It is universally admitted that feminine influence has been a mighty factor for good in all ages, and, therefore, incalculable benefit may be expected from the assembling of many women for the interchange of views, and the study of home problems which can be solved by woman alone.&quot; </P>
<P> The National Congress of Mothers became a socially acceptable activity for women who had leisure time to spend outside their homes.  The welfare of children and the &quot;elevation of mankind&quot; were causes with more universal appeal than those of the American Association of University Women which had been organized in 1882, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs, or the Daughters of the American Revolution, organized in 1890.</P>
<P> The National Congress of Mothers enlisted women from the upper social strata from the beginning; the wife of the vice-president of the United States and the wives of several cabinet members were present at its formation and reception at the White House.  These women feared that the country's children were at risk and that as a consequence, the country was at risk.  If the next generation was to assume a constructive role in society, parents needed to understand the importance of their role and to develop the skills required to raise their children.  </P>
<P> In order to effectuate the &quot;kindergarten principles from cradle to college,&quot; Mrs. Birney encouraged the formation of mothers' clubs to serve as a means of communication between those who wanted information and those who could supply it.   Although resolutions expressing the mothers' concerns were drafted and occasionally petitions presented to the U.S. Congress, these clubs were not pressure groups.  For example, one such petition in 1899 called for the creation of a National Health Bureau.  Locally, the clubs encouraged such projects as campaigns for better school sanitation, public playgrounds, and vacation schools.</P>
<P><B>National Congress of Parents and Teachers</B></P>
<P> At the fifth national annual convention in Columbus, Ohio, in 1901, the New York State Superintendent of Public Instruction called for the cooperation between home and school as he presided over a conference attended by parents and teachers.  Nevertheless, the idea of including teachers in the National Congress of Mothers was not generally accepted until eleven years after the organization was founded and six years after the resignation of Alice McLellan Birney.  In 1908 the name was changed to The National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations, but did not become the National Congress of Parents and Teachers until 1924.  As early as 1920, however, the national office was in the National Education Association (NEA) building in Washington, D.C.  In 1954, the national office moved to Chicago where it currently rents space in the IBM building on the near North side. </P>
<P> By 1927, the influence of the teachers in the PTA was evident.  The program for the PTA's 1927 convention &quot;was built around the seven cardinal objectives of education as adopted by the National Education Association (NEA).&quot;  National PTA membership exceeded 1 million and plans were underway to publish <U>Parents &amp; Teachers</U>, the first PTA textbook. </P>
<P> PTA work was and is carried out through committees and volunteers. Early committees included:  Education, Finance, Health, Kindergarten, Literature, Legislation, Press, Printing, Program,  Transportation, and Domestic Science.  Present day committees vary according to need and resources, but resemble those established in the 1920s.  The earliest Education Committee was established for the education of mothers and has evolved into a committee dedicated to influencing educational policies and practices.</P>
<P> Membership began to rise after the depression, continued through the Second World War, and nearly doubled from 1945 to 1950, exceeding 6 million by 1950.  As membership increased, so did PTA activity with respect to legislation.  In cooperation with the teacher organizations and such organizations as the League of Women Voters, the 1947 National PTA called for &quot;active support&quot; for increased school aid funds, reorganization of school districts into larger units, various welfare measures, and opposition to limitation on property tax rates.</P>
<P> In the PTA's formative years, parents had exercised considerable control in their neighborhood or rural one-room schools; however, consolidation of school districts tended to reduce the parental role in school district decisionmaking.  With increasing frequency, the school administrator was a professional who was often insulated from local parents.  And as state laws standardized educational practices and curriculum, parents had fewer means of influencing what happened in the schools attended by their children.</P>
<P> Ironically, in order to better serve its members, the 1953 California PTA Board of Managers reorganized its larger districts into smaller areas to improve its communication and volunteer efforts.  &quot;No area of child welfare service was ignored by our 1,316,048 members,&quot; reported the California PTA President the year after the reorganization was implemented.</P>
<P><B> </B></P>
<P><B>Not to decide is to decide</B></P>
<P> As the mid-1960s approached, PTA members at the grass roots became involved in more volatile controversies.  Teacher strikes illustrate this point: 2 in 1965; 30 in 1966; and 80 in 1967.  </P>

<h3 align="center">Outsourcing Defense?</h3>
<h4 align="center">Investor's Business Daily - Guest Editorial (01/17/96)</h4>
<h4 align="center">By Loren B. Thompson</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Defense Department is about to begin a major change in its management philosophy. One
result could be a huge opportunity for private entrepreneurs. 

<p>In February, the Pentagon will disclose its first selections of military support functions suitable for
outsourcing.

<p>Though private industry has been systematically outsourcing for years, this is a near-revolution for
the armed forces.

<p>About half of the defense budget consists of support functions such as maintenance, supply, health
care, data processing, administrative services, facilities management, transportation and so on. In
1995, these defense functions cost over $100 billion.

<p>The use of outside contractors is not unusual in the Pentagon. But the military has traditionally
held that any activity necessary to waging war should be under the control of the armed services,
meaning that it should be performed internally.

<p>Defense planners recognize that most support functions do not fall within the core competencies
of the military. But they have been reluctant to rely on the market for services that could make the
difference between life and death in wartime.

<p>Now budget pressures and the impressive performance of the private sector are forcing planners
to rethink that premise.

<p>World-class firms such as Boeing and General Dynamics commonly achieve 20% to 30% savings
when they outsource noncore functions.

<p>Similar savings on even half of the services now internal to Defense could save over $10 billion.
That's enough to offset current shortfalls in funding for weapons modernization.

<p>If the private-sector record is any indicator, privatization should also IMPROVE the efficiency
and responsiveness of the defense infrastructure.

<p>Some Pentagon organizations, such as the Defense Logistics Agency, have greatly improved their
management practices. But it is a rare government agency that can match the performance of free
enterprise. Even when the public sector achieves comparable performance in some key measure,
such as delivery time or data throughput, costs are usually much higher.

<p>Thus, defense privatization could save a great deal of money while actually bolstering the
effectiveness of the armed forces.

<p>That at least is the conclusion of senior Clinton administration officials who have spent much of
the past three years trying to make the Pentagon a more market- driven organization.

<p>Privatization - outsourcing to the private sector - is just the latest in a series of Clinton efforts to
wipe out the barriers between the defense-acquisition system and the commercial economy.

<p>Some uniformed personnel grumble that these initiatives will compromise military access to vital
services in wartime.

<p>Senior political appointees think this shows a lack of awareness about how capable private-sector
companies have become. Reliable private-sector sources of logistics, information services,
maintenance and the like may once have been hard to come by, they say, but those days are long
gone. Today it is the military that tends to lag behind.

<p>The Pentagon privatization initiatives could create sizable new business opportunities over the
next several years.

<p>Private firms will be able to compete for the right to provide a vast array of support functions.
And more contractors will be needed to manage the resulting arrangements.

<p>Past experience suggests that private- sector experts would manage outsource contracts better
than Pentagon bureaucrats. Outsiders tend to have more relevant skills and background and are
much easier to ''incentivize'' than civil-service contract managers.

<p>The only thing that could derail these common-sense improvements is Congress. Legislators
sometimes rush to defend even the most redundant or superfluous facilities, preventing Pentagon
policy-makers from rationalizing their unwieldy infrastructure. That's why a special law and
commission were needed to close obsolete military bases.

<p>With market-oriented Republicans controlling Congress, it seems reasonable to expect less
tolerance of government waste and more faith in the private sector's ability to provide flexible,
efficient support to the military.

<p>With support in Congress, privatization could be the most important defense management
initiative of the post-Cold War period.

<h3>Teacher unions and school choice in countries that have both</h3>
<h4>(How educators in Sweden, Germany, Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Russia, New Zealand, Belgium, France, and elsewhere learned to stop
worrying and like the voucher.)</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Robert W. Kasten and Gregory Fossedal</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Findings of importance to policy-makers:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Why are <u>teacher unions</u> around the world <u>bitterly opposed</u> to opportunity scholarship plans,
school vouchers, <u>parental choice</u>, and other market-based reforms?  The answer, according to an
unscientific but broad survey of nearly 50 teachers unions in more than a dozen developed
countries, is this:  <u>They aren't</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In fact, out of 48 unions expressing a stand, only eleven (23 percent) strongly oppose
voucher-choice systems.  Seventeen (35 percent) are strongly in favor, while twenty (42 percent)
are not strongly opposed or in favor, or are politically inactive.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Among countries that have significant experience with them, fourteen unions (52 percent) back
choice-voucher plans, and twelve (41 percent) are neutral.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Even in the U.S. teachers commonly dissent from the NEA/AFT monolith.  A survey of members
of the Association of American Educators, an independent teachers association, found that 14
percent agree with the NEA's position on school choice, while 76 percent disagree.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Teacher union officials from Sweden, Belgium,
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Australia,
and Denmark say choice  including, in most cases, government support for private schools 
works.<img src="unchc.htg/img.gif" align="right" >

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>LAURIE CAILLE is an officer of the Syndicat National des Enseignements de Second Degree, a
French teachers union for junior high school teachers.  She is trying to explain to an American
why school choice works well  for France.

<p>"In France," she says, "we have an old tradition of absolute separation between the church and the
state."  The French approach of providing significant aid to private and religious schools might, in
another environment, seem to involve government in the business of religion.

<p>The state's subsidy to private schools goes "only through 'contract' or agreements between the
states and the schools."  Still, for a choice or voucher system to work, it would have to be built
around such a wall of separation, since in France, "schools, both public and private, are subsidized
by the state."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ONE CAN just imagine the reaction union officials at the National Education Association or
American Federation of Teachers would have if a similar procedure were proposed for the United
States.  No matter what provisions were made to insure separation even precautions sufficient to
satisfy one of the largest teachers unions in France  they would not be enough.

<p>And that in a way, is what makes Ms. Caille an unusual teacher union official.  Or, to be more
precise, it makes her a typical one  provided only that one steps outside the United States.

<p>Like many, Ms. Caille is not a fervent supporter of vouchers or "school choice."  But neither is
she angry about the prospect  as most teacher union officials in the United States appear to be
when the subject comes up.  In fact, Caille argues the French system, elements of which have been
in place since Napoleon's compromise with the Catholic Church in the First Empire, has helped to
provide a sound education.  If anything, she says, the social impact has been small or positive.  

<p>It tends to "defuse" any church-state tensions, as another French teacher union official put it, by
letting families go their own way  within a broad frame-work of access and universal education.

<p>Recently, AdTI staff interviewed officials from more than 40 teachers unions in a dozen foreign
countries with significant school choice.  In most cases  such as Sweden, Denmark, Australia,
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and others  the choice plans now attract significant support
for movement between both public and private schools.  

<p>The predominant mood is by no means one of enthusiastic support, particularly outside of those
countries, such as Denmark and France, where school choice and government support for private
schools is well-entrenched, an ingrained habit.  

<p>But there is a broad acceptance to public and private school choice among the solid majority of
teacher unions outside the United States.  In the Netherlands, 75 percent of all primary and
secondary students attend a state-supported private school.  "Most teachers in the Netherlands,"
says Walter Dresscher, President of the NGL, one of the largest Dutch teachers unions, "think
that this system works very well."

<p>Table 1 shows the results of a non-scientific survey of 48 teachers unions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">Table 1.

<p><strong>Q: What position does your union take on "parental choice" or vouchers  systems which
allow parents to select between public schools and in some cases private or "free" schools? </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>STRONGLY 

<p>SUPPORT  35 %

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>STRONGLY 

<p>OPPOSE 23 %

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEUTRAL OR NO

<p>STRONG POSITION 42 %

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Of 92 unions surveyed, 48 responded: 17 strongly support choice/voucher schemes, 11 strongly
oppose.  Twenty unions were either neutral or took no strong position.  Of these, 10 said their
union takes no position on choice systems as such (which are in place in most of the countries);
another three said their unions avoid politics altogether.  Seven liked or disliked the system but
with serious caveats  four like choice-voucher plans, but only if changes are made in funding
formulas or other mechanics; three don't like them but do not advocate overturning existing
systems.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The most fervent supporters of these market-based plans for education, perhaps not surprisingly,
are in countries such as the former Soviet Union.  There, a thirst for freedom has led to a bouquet
of educational entrepreneurship and institution-building.  In Moscow alone there are more than a
dozen teacher unions and associations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE ONLY countries, in fact, with more than <em>one</em> negative response towards choice or vouchers
were the United States, England, Canada, and New Zealand  from which nine of the 11 "strongly
opposed" answers came.

<p>There are several possible reasons, especially considering the similarities between them.  All are
English-speaking, largely white countries.  Vouchers and choice plans enjoy some support across
the board, but in recent years they've been especially popular among the less affluent and minority
groups.

<p>Historically, voucher plans were often a response to Catholic, and in some cases Protestant or
Jewish demands, for religious schooling.  (The largest Israeli teachers union, the Irgun Morim,
predates the founding of the state of Israel, was an active proponent of Hebrew language
instruction in Palestine from the 1920s.)  The four countries with the strongest anti-voucher
sentiment either have small Catholic populations, or a political tradition that has unabashedly
restricted access to religious education.  

<p>Even in these four, the fundamental attitude is no longer one of active hostility, but grudging
acquiescence.  "Even if some members do not like the system," says A. Craig Duncan, MA,
Acting General Secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, "it is now generally
accepted."  Indeed, since Scottish and other unions in the United Kingdom have much greater
participation by private school teachers, "our members in independent schools are worried about
possible financial problems for their schools if the assisted places scheme"  supporting poor
students in private schools  "is phased out."  (For an excellent summary of the history and
functioning of choice systems, see Charles Glenn, <em>School Choice in Six Countries</em>, Department of
Education, 1989.)

<p>For these and other reasons, teacher unions outside of the four great English-speaking republics
(including Canada outside of Quebec) have grown accustomed to parental choice even favorable. 
Each of these has either only limited parental choice in education (U.S., Canada), or very recent
experience (Britain, Sweden), or is still fighting a relatively bitter battle over choice and
choice-related issues such as school funding formulas (New Zealand, Australia, Sweden).   Even
so, a majority of unions in Australia and Sweden back their country's choice-voucher plan.

<p>Indeed, if we look at the results among unions in countries with significant exposure to public or
public-private choice, the result is:  14 unions (52 percent) in favor of voucher-choice plans, 11
(41 percent) with no strong opinion, and two (7 percent) opposed.  (Table 2.)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">Table 2.

<p><em>Among unions in countries with long-standing choice or voucher plans...</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Q: What position does your union take on "parental choice" or vouchers  systems which

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We asked union officials to comment about the concrete workings of their system, and the
experience teachers have actually working in it.  Surely this experience will have some relevance
to a U.S. debate in which opposition to choice is largely theoretical  that is, carried on by persons
who have little or no experience functioning in an education market.  One good way to organize
these responses is in terms of the complaints about choice-voucher systems voiced by theoretical
critics.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1. "Vouchers, or systems which have the effect of vouchers,...  will destroy public
education." </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The above is a resolution adopted by the National Education Association and published in its
annual handbook.  On its face, the assertion would seem to be absurd.  Table 3 is a list of some of
the countries with the highest degree of parental choice in education, usually including
private-school subsidies.  On the right is the percentage of public funds that go to public schools,
generally a figure above 80 percent.  A similar survey of pupil enrollment rates suggests vouchers
and choice plans have hardly proven fatal to public schooling.

<p><em>If vouchers "destroy" public schools, it will come as news to teacher union officials from to
Russia to Australia.  Some union officials who were asked if choice or voucher plans had or
would "destroy" public education in their country appeared to think the interviewer did not
understand their system, and, like Ms. Caille above, repeated slowly how their system works, to
make clear that public schools were not singled out by the plan.</em>

<p><em>"The private schools get 75 to 85 percent of the cost of educating a child in the public schools 
not 100 percent," says Carolyn Allport of the National Tertiary Education Union in Australia. 
Thus, public schools get between 118 percent and 133 percent of the per-pupil support that
private schools do.  "We have our criticisms of this system but the formula is not weighted
against public education."</em>

<p><em>"Our choice system has been in operation for a period of over thirty years," notes Mrs. Roth of
the Danish Union of Teachers.  "And we have a strong public education system.  We view the
public schools and the private schools as working together.... or at least, co-existence."</em>

<p><em>Bernard Hosie, a teacher and headmaster in Australian schools for 18 years, is even more
pointed.  "Great Britain instituted a dual system of education in the late 1940s," he wrote
recently in The Los Angeles Times.  "It has not destroyed the public system as the prophets of
doom foretold."  (October 11.)</em>

<p><em>(Only in the Netherlands, as Table 3 indicates, do private schools predominate.  But in the
Netherlands, other than during the Nazi occupation, the private schools simply never ceased to
be popular.  Public education took the form of public funds going to private institutions  a la
food stamps, Medicaid  in a way that provided high consumer satisfaction).</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>THIS DOES not mean that teacher union officials abroad completely dismiss the kinds of
concerns about public education so debated in the U.S.  On the contrary, most of them have felt,
and some still feel, such concerns.  But they do find that some of their earlier fears were
excessive.  And  perhaps most important  they note that public schools have enjoyed a certain
re-invigoration, and teachers a liberation, since choice or voucher plans were adopted.  Parents
select a school, actively or by default; the very act, the very possibility, causes them to take a
different attitude towards the schools, to feel empowered.  Teachers deal in a market of broader
alternatives, with greater freedom to experiment, and greater emphasis on results.</em>

<p><em>In Sweden, just four years of public support for private schooling have led to a renaissance of
education diversity.  "We now have German schools, Finnish schools, Estonian schools,"
comments Sven Kinnander, international officer of L&auml;rarnas Riksf&ouml;rbund (National Union of
Teachers in Sweden.)  "We now have different pedagogical orientations and teaching methods." 
There are "religious schools, like Catholics, Methodists, even Muslims."  There are also "schools
with alternative education methods...  such as Montessori or Waldorf pedagogics," receiving
support, as Kerstin Weyler, Information Officer at the National Agency for Education, notes. </em>

<p><em>The spirit of renewal has even helped invigorate the (still dominant) public sector schools. 
"Many municipalities," Weyler notes, "are introducing school vouchers for their own schools" 
that is, offering public school choice so as to be able to match more closely the market options
provided by private-sector schools.  "Competition is growing."</em>

<p><em>In countries where voucher or choice systems are long-standing, an ethos of cooperation
between private and public schools has to some extent replaced the doctrine of all-out warfare. 
Belgium's school voucher plan "dates back to the years 1830-1831 when Belgium became
independent," explains J.M. Ansciaux, the General Secretary of Centrale Generale des Services
Publics-Enseignement.  "Private schools are considered institutions of public interest."</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>AS THESE comments suggest, union officials abroad are reluctant to concede the superiority of
the religious and private sector schools.  In a sense, the numbers back them up  choice and
voucher systems have not led to the collapse of public school systems.</em>

<p><em>When we asked open-ended questions about the workings of choice and voucher systems in their
countries, union officials from Great Britain, Ireland, France, Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand,
and Australia all emphasized the fact that the vast majority of parents choose to remain in the
public school system.  It seemed clear that for many of them, this is a matter of pride  a talking
point, as it were, on behalf of public school teachers.</em>

<p><em>"Only five percent of the students of compulsory school age attend private schools," comments
Frau Waltraud Fuchs of Deutscher Lehrerverband.  "It is not predominant."</em>

<p><em>"Despite the government subsidies," comments Sharan Burrow of the Australian Education
Union, "less than one student in four in Australia attends private schools, "and the figure is
smaller for primary schools."</em>

<p><em>"Ninety percent of the schools are public ones," agrees Carole Hicks, executive director of the
NZEI.  "This, for us, is a measure of how well our public schools are working," says Bill
Gibbons, Deputy Secretary General of New Zealand's Post Primary Teachers Association.</em>

<p><em>"The proportion of private schools in Sweden is very low," says Ann-Christian Larsson and
Kristina Ullstrand of L&auml;rarf&ouml;rbundet (Swedish Teachers Union.)  "Only 1.8 percent of the pupils
attend private education [even though] these schools are financed by public means." </em>

<p><em>These unions take choice or voucher plans as a kind of gentle insult, or at least, something of a
challenge.  (This is particularly true in countries where the adoption of choice is very recent or
was especially bitter).  There is a healthy, competitive spirit in this.  And, on the evidence, public
sector schools have proven capable of adapting.</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>ALL OF THIS, however, tends to undercut the end-of-public-education-as-we-know-it drama. 
The spirited, bullish comments about their public schools we heard from union members may
suggest that private schools do not have the decisive edge many in the United States and other
non-choice systems think they do.  Also, though, it implies that choice-voucher advocates may
have an insight into the dynamics of choice plans.  If public schools in Sweden, Germany, and
Denmark are that healthy, perhaps there is something to be said for voucher plans after all.</em>

<p><em>"It is not about people being pitted against each other," says Jean-Michel Boullier, the head of
the Federation des Syndicats Generaux de l'Education National et la Recherche.  (His union
represents only public school teachers.)  "We want the same conditions in private and public
schools.  But we think the education system has to move and avoid being static.  So it is
important to have more than one system.  The public system in France is too big, and the
government has to reactivate it."  The choice system, he says, "is one way of doing that."</em>

<p><em>School voucher programs, as one U.S. teacher from Topeka, Kansas said recently, "can only
help the public schools through competition.  That NEA canard about how choice will rob public
schools of needed funding is so old.  Do all those people take night school rhetoric programs
together?  You hear the same lame lines all the time, like, 'taking food out of the mouths of
children.' " (The American Educator, February, 1996.)</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>2. Voucher-choice plans favor the rich,  and often hurt or ignore the poor.</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The New Zealand Education Institute, one of the most anti-voucher unions we spoke to, put the
argument this way in a recent press release:  </em>

<p><em>"RICH SCHOOLS' VOUCHER SCHEME DOES STATE SCHOOLS OUT OF TEACHERS."  </em>

<p><em>The plan, the release quotes national secretary Rosslyn Noonan as saying, "is going to cost
almost $240,000."  The money will go to private schools, who will pay their teachers more.  This
will hurt public schools on the margin, and thus tend to hurt the poor.  The money "would be
better used for incentives to get teachers into classrooms in state schools experiencing staff
shortages," such as in inner city ethnic schools.</em>

<p><em>One notable thing about the release itself is that it was issued in reaction to a
government-proposed pilot program to provide extra private-school assistance to 200 poor
children.  </em>

<p><em>We asked: Is the New Zealand Educational Institute supporting this particular experiment, since
it at least appears aimed at helping low-income families?  No, said executive director Carole
Hicks.  </em>

<p><em>"We are fighting this experiment very hard."  Why?  Because the "real aim is to take money
away from the public schools," and the public schools "are needed to help the poor."  </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>FEW OF the teachers unions abroad took this extreme a view of the equities of voucher plans
generally  let alone those focused specifically on the lower income.  In countries with a longer
voucher experience, of course, many poor families now have experience with empowerment
through vouchers.  In U.S. cities, choice and voucher schemes have always been more popular in
polls of city dwellers than in affluent suburbs.  Now, in places like Milwaukee and Harlem,
programs have been a reality  and the support is at extreme levels of 80 percent and higher.</em>

<p><em>Foreign teachers unions tend to be less concentrated and more diverse.  (See our recent paper,
"Teacher Union 'Concentration' in 21 Countries," October 17, 1996.)  Thus, more often than in
the U.S., they represent inner-city private school, religious school, or choice-school teachers
who either favor, or have adapted to, or have an interest in, the choice or voucher system.  In the
case of New Zealand, this de-concentration of interests became clear when we talked to other
public education professionals, who differ from the NZEI on the equities both of vouchers
generally and the new plan focused on the poor.</em>

<p><em>"Children from low socio-economic backgrounds can apply to be government-funded under the
recently-introduced TIE scheme (Targeted Individual Entitlement) to attend private schools,"
notes Louise May of the Schools Staffing Section of the New Zealand Ministry of Education. 
"This scheme is proving to be very popular."  Well: Not universally.  The scheme is not popular
with the NZEI, nor would it likely find favor in the U.S. with either the NEA or AFT.  This merely
throws into relief, however, that the equity arguments against voucher-choice systems do not
constitute the heart of the objections these groups have.  Remove the inequity, even focus
programs specifically on the most needy, and the objections remain.  (Even the equity
objections!)</em>

<p><em>Besides  as one U.S. teacher from South Dakota, who supports school vouchers, put it "The NEA
is saying that a parent can send their child to any school of their choice but that if its a private
school they should pay for it over and above the taxes they're already paying.  Isn't that unfair to
middle and lower income parents?"  (The American Educator, February, 1996.)</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Fairness for teachers</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>OF COURSE, equity can refer to more than pupil expenditures.  Teacher pay and working
conditions are an issue of equity as well.  In the view of many teacher union officials abroad, the
fairness of choice and voucher plans is considerably superior in those terms than the U.S. system
of closest-public-school monopoly with no choice and no aid to private schools.</em>

<p><em>"Here... the working conditions and salaries for our teachers are the same in private as in public
schools," notes Ann-Christian Larsson of L&auml;rarf&ouml;rbundet (Swedish Teachers Union.)  </em>

<p><em>"There are no salary differences between teachers in the public schools versus the private
schools," says Marianne Kristoffersson of L&auml;rarnas Riksf&ouml;rbund.  "Those who are members of a
union get help and support from the union," but private school teachers account for about 3-4
percent of the members of the Swedish teacher unions.  And, "when a collective agreement had
been made in the public sector," as Larsson notes, "the private employers enter into similar
agreements with their employees."</em>

<p><em>"Our teachers haven't been opposed to this choice by the parents," observes Hans Laugesen of
Sweden's Gymnasiesko-lernes Laererforening, "because teaching itself has the same regulations
in public and private school.  While a teacher or a school official accepts the special ideology
that governs a private school he is at the same payment level as in public schools."</em>

<p><em>All this is in marked contrast to the wide U.S. gap between public and private teacher school
pay.  A public school teacher from Sacramento who supports school choice says:  "It would give
us more opportunities!  One reason I don't teach in private schools is because the pay is lower
than in public schools."  (The American Educator, February, 1996.)</em>

<p><em>U.S. unions are not keen to talk about pay differentials, though, given that public school primary
and secondary teachers earn significantly more than their private school counterparts here.  In
fact, it's somewhat revealing unions that despite the way that terms like "equity" and "fairness"
dominate discussions of education, U.S. teacher union officials almost never apply them to
teachers certainly not in terms of making public-private comparisons.  Table 4 shows why
"fairness" and teacher pay is not high on the agenda of the NEA or AFT.</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>WHAT is most interesting, then, is the whole different context in which teachers unions outside
the U.S. view the fairness question regarding vouchers and choice.  For these unions, it includes
teacher pay and public-private sector fairness; the possibility that poor children will benefit
from choice; and various non-economic considerations.</em>

<p><em>"Many times" in the Netherlands, comments Dresscher, the president of the NGL, "the question
has been raised whether it [the voucher-choice system] is outdated or not.  The fact is, the Dutch
system does prevent the problem of big differences between public and private education, often
related to social class."</em>

<p><em>In this view, vouchers, by mixing poor students into schools now limited to the middle and upper
class, make a contribution to dynamic fairness.  They can break down social barriers.  This is a
mission traditionally envisioned for public schools, but which they have seldom achieved
because of school assignment by zone and other practices common to nearly all public school
systems. </em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>3. Voucher programs violate church-state separation, or promote religious divisions.</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>The teacher union officials who spoke to us about vouchers and church-state issues tend to share
the concern for keeping religion and the government at arms' length.  In general, though, they
take a different view of what this means.</em>

<p><em>"For us, a neutral policy is one in which religious and secular concerns are treated equally,"
says Mrs. Fuchs of Deutscher Leherverband.  "How is it that favoring non-religion would be
equal?"</em>

<p><em>As we recounted at the beginning of this paper, Ms. Caille of the Syndicat National des
Enseignements de Second Degree had a similar, let-me-explain-it-again kind of reaction.  "If the
experience of teachers unions in countries that have vouchers is any guide, then economic
impacts between public and private schools have some importance to teachers and the
electorate.  The idea that vouchers of favor or disfavor religion seems not to."</em>

<p><em>"We have achieved a settlement of sorts," says Sharan Burrow, federal president of the
Australian Education Union, a group that opposes voucher-choice formulas.  Under this peace
treaty  or, to be more precise, limited cease-fire  battles continue to rage regarding "fees, the
philosophy of education," and a "range of initiatives."  The AEU and some others continue to
oppose the voucher-choice idea as a policy.  But there is relative peace on religious issues.</em>

<p><em>This is not because the teachers or their unions necessarily have any strong pro-religious
leanings.  In fact, teacher union officials from Sweden, Germany, France, and other countries
complained about the way in which Moslems and other non-Western religious and-or ethnic
groups have been able to obtain school licenses and thus, funding for their activities.  American
voucher opponents (such as Al Shanker) have given more graphic expression to this fear by
noting the possibility that under a voucher scheme, a Ku Klux Klan or Nazi leader could open
their own school with government funding.  </em>

<p><em>"That could not happen here," comments Mrs. Fuchs.  "You must obtain a license first."  (This is
true of all voucher-choice plans we are aware of.)</em>

<p><em>A related, but separate objection is the idea that voucher or choice plans will have a divisive
impact, tending to segregate children into religious or social sects.  This differs, of course, from
the idea that vouchers will improperly subsidize particular religions or religion generally.  But it
is often bound up in the same cluster of arguments.</em>

<p><em>"Our system," says Gene Roth of Danmarks L&aelig;rerforening, "is an expression of entente."  There
was "great division... in the Dutch Community in the nineteenth century between protestants,
catholics, and liberals."  Choice  allowing families to go their own way on religious matters,
under a broader umbrella of shared national ideals common to all the schools, public and
private  was an effort to defuse this conflict, and secure social peace and unity.  "It has worked."</em>

<p><em>"There is no significant level of antagonism between the different types of private schools, nor is
there between public and private schools," comments Louise May of the Schools Staffing Section
of the Education Ministry of New Zealand.  "Mostly they seem to be fairly supportive of each
other."</em>

<p><em>In New Zealand, May notes, the government funding formula has the affect of encouraging
different groups to come together.  "Integrated, private schools have to comply with some
governmental requirements.  For example, a Catholic integrated school must accept 30 percent
non-Catholic students to receive government funding."</em>

<p><em>For France, as Boullier, head of the Federation des Syndicats Generaux de l'Education National
et la Recherche, put it, "the private schools pre-date the public schools, and their history goes
all the way back to pre-Revolution France."  Advocates of public education, he notes, at first
were confined merely to arguing for public funds to help the poor be able to reach these private,
mostly religious, schools.  "In most of the 19th Century, public schools were just private schools,
receiving assistance."  What would now be public schools "started in the year 1885.  Our trade
union was founded in 1937."</em>

<p><em>Thus, to French teachers unions, the idea of rights to public education, which they certainly
uphold, are somehow bound up almost inextricably with the idea of rights to conscience and to
parental choice, including the choice of private, religious schooling.  Even that, in a sense,
understates the concept:  "It is more that the French idea of 'public education' includes private 
and religious  as part of it," as a young French college student put it to us during an interview.</em>

<p><em>"The public system is more comprehensive in France," as Ms. Caille of the put it.  "Schools, both
public and private, are subsidized by the state.  But the state's subsidy to schools... goes only
through 'contract' or 'agreements' between the state and the schools."</em>

<p><em>The sensibility of French unions on the matter of religion is of special interest, for reasons that
may justify a slight digression, particularly for those with an interest in Alexis de Tocqueville
himself.  Others may skip to the next sub-head on page 14, at no loss.</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><u>An aside</u></em>

<p><em><strong>Tocqueville, choice, and</strong></em>

<p><em><strong>the French religious agony</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>FRANCE HAS had voucherized education going back to the immediate aftermath of the
Revolution of 1789.  At various points, the system was questioned, but never overturned other
than by war or a brief revolutionary episode.  </em>

<p><em>In 1844, for instance, the Republicans (in French terms, the center-left and far left) attempted to
bring all schools under the direct regulation of the federal government ("the University") and cut
off funds to schools that did not meet its regulations.  Since one of the regulations was to be no
state support for religion, this would have had the effect of terminating the support for private
schools that had been in place since it was grudgingly conceded by Napoleon in order to win the
support of the Catholic Church for his rule.  The Villemain bill, containing these provisions,
came before the Assembly in January, 1844.</em>

<p><em>It was then that a young (but already famous) French parliamentarian went to the center of the
oval-shaped chamber to question what contribution, if any, would be made to religious harmony,
or for that matter education itself, if religious schools were either regulated into atheism or, just
as bad, financially strangled into bankruptcy.  Having heard the zero-sum arguments about
different groups, experts, and side-effects, he took up what seemed to be the deeper issues of
social harmony, morality, and freedom.</em>

<p><em>"If we are not careful, gentlemen," Alexis de Tocqueville began, "we will soon arrive at a point
at which we will represent here, neither ideas nor men, but interests, canals, railroads.  You say
that a peace"  that is, a social peace  "exists, and I will tell you again that the war has only
changed the theater of politics, it has become philosophical and religious...."</em>

<p><em>"To be sure, I do not share the views of many prejudiced people against the University"  the
French government's Department of Education over the grammar schools.  "I myself was part of
these schools.  Its existence, even its purpose, is among the highest interest of the country.</em>

<p><em>"But I will still notice what needs to be corrected.  Yes, instruction has indeed progressed, but
education"  interruption from the left  "did education, which is the training of the heart and the
morals, reach the same level?"</em>

<p><em>"I hear some 'no's, and these 'no's do not come from critics interested in its ruin, they come from
faithful friends of the institution" of public education....  The University"  the federal regulation
arm for grade schools  "left many things to be changed, and therefore gave much pretext for
war....  War is here, it is started, it is already active...."</em>

<p><em>Thus, members of the French clergy issued attacks  "some of them unfair"  upon the secretary of
education.  Levellier, and other public officials, responded by trying to push the clergy out of its
legitimate interests in education altogether.  "What does the secretary of education do?"  He,
"and other men of some importance....  retaliate against not only a part of the clergy which
threatens secular education, and not only the whole clergy, but all of Catholicism and of
Christianity."  </em>

<p><em>Given this state of war, what was the solution?  The exclusion of religion from schooling was a
non-solution.   "</em>

<p><em>The fear of a too-powerful church, meanwhile, of a state-backed religion, was obsolete,
Tocqueville thought, especially in an increasingly Democratic age.  "Some people think the
clergy will take a predominant place in society and the government.  But do not take seriously
the assumption that a society like ours, proud and impregnated of civil and religious freedom,
would subdue to an Orthodoxy.  Gentlemen, this is pure imagination."</em>

<p><em>"I have never seen a free people whose liberty is not enrolled in beliefs.  To me, the reason for
this is that liberty is more the daughter of morals than the daughter of institutions, and morals
are daughters of beliefs."</em>

<p><em>The effort to lift persons materially, through public education and other means, was important 
indeed "the essence of democracy as I understand it."  But even this, and this purpose, was not
the highest purpose  not even the highest purpose of education, as implied above.</em>

<p><em>"Don't you think we need these religious beliefs," while debating a bill "threatening their ruin? 
Do you truly believe that we can help these problems through cold and vain philanthropy? 
Don't you think we need to appeal to religious men, to all religions, to alleviate all these
miseries.... to teach all this ignorance and enlighten all this darkness?"</em>

<p><em>For the religious war in France, Tocqueville argued, there needed to be an active, dynamic
solution  not simply a "separation" of church and state or a smoldering silence of contempt, but
a system that allowed belief to flourish.  "I myself am convinced that the greatest danger in these
fights, sooner or later, is that they come to indifference."  The violent rhetoric of the clergy 
which Tocqueville did not hesitate to criticize  would in turn facilitate the removal of religious
and moral content from the schools in a real but deadly peace.  "The peace you are talking
about is a fruitless one," a repressed "war of interests instead of a healthy war of political
opinion.... In short, gentlemen, I will not vote for the paragraph..."  (Alexis de Tocqueville,
speech to the Chamber of Deputies, Le Moniteur Universel, January 17, 1844, pages 92-93.)</em>

<p><em>Thus in Tocqueville's terms, France's de facto voucher system was not likely to be a cause of
religious strife, of which he agreed France has had much.  Rather, it is a potential solution to
religious division, a way of defusing the tension and disarming the time bomb.  </em>

<p><em>This dynamic was perhaps best expressed powerfully 150 years later by French Socialist Louis
Legrand, whose 1981 book catalyzed a great education debate in France and whose ideas were
taken up as a rallying torch by Francois Mitterand in his election as president.</em>

<p><em>"The body of society," wrote Legrand, "already is divided."  To say this is not to cause division,
but merely to acknowledge that one exists.  "The official solution to this dilemma has been
sough, as we have seen, in an aseptic concept of secularity.  This is the worst and most
hypocritical situation...  emptying public education  having become more and more intellectual
and arid  of values and thus of explicit ideology, while allowing the development of a 'free'
educational system marked by an ideological ethic and context....  The common school cannot be
the present public school with its ethical and ideological emptiness."  (L'&eacute;cole unique: &agrave; quelles
conditiones?, Paris, Scarab&egrave;e 1981, pages 203-204.)</em>

<p><em>Thus, one of the most lucid exponents of the &eacute;cole unique, or common school  which to Legrand
means one, truly, common school representing a solid, tangible, national ethos, as distinct from
the "vapid" schools created by public education  required, at least for its evolution, and perhaps
indefinitely to sustain it, the presence of an other system with a spirit of its own.  This
independent sector would offer definition to the common school, and act as a spur to its
evolution.  This is neatly consistent with the classic liberalism of French education reformers
from Thiers to Maupas to de Tocqueville.  As Legrand continued:</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>"It is contradictory and inadmissable that a democracy that considers itself liberal should refuse
to citizens who desire it the exercise of the fundamental right to decide on the nature of the
education that their children will benefit from." (p. 205.)</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Nothing rotten in Denmark</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>France's emergence from a millennium of religious strife to the relative peace of today owes to
many social, political, and other factors.  The fact that this happened, however, during a 200
years span in which voucher-choice education was used to defuse the conflict in at least one
important institution, the school, though, suggests at the least that such mechanisms are not
inconsistent with social and religious harmony.  They may even help, marginally, to produce it.</em>

<p><em>"We have some very rough disagreements in our schools," a French teacher we spoke to
observed, "and especially between us and the state in negotiations over pay.  But as far as the
parents and children go, at the end of the day, they can walk away from these conflicts or from a
certain school or teacher or method, and go a different way.  Teachers have greater flexibility in
that regard here too.</em>

<p><em>"You, on the other hand  in America, it is more, everything is fought out and won for the whole
school.  It is"  we interrupted to suggest, "winner-take-all"  "yes, winner take all.  If your public
school is going to have a science textbook, that is the textbook.  If you and I are parents, and we
disagree, we have an argument at the school board meeting, and someone wins and someone
loses.  And that is it for the whole school  everyone's child at the school lives with that policy. 
And they can leave and go to another school, but of course some cannot afford this.</em>

<p><em>"And this happens, over and over.  I mean, there is one science textbook; there is one religion  or
of course, normally, no religion; there is one thing for school lunch; there is one teaching
method.  It is no wonder that you are having such fights over the schools in America.</em>

<p><em>"In France, we fight about almost everything else, and we fight about wages in the school when
it is time, but there is very little conflict over the running of individual schools.  Where someone
is unhappy, they go elsewhere."</em>

<p><em>This teacher, who is not religious and teaches in a public school, seems typical of the teachers
and even union officials who spoke to AdTI on the issue of vouchers and religion.  There may be
a deeper irony, given that Europe is a more secular society, and America, more religious. 
European teachers seem more respectful of religious liberties  the freedom of parents and
students  than those in America.  In America, the cradle of democracy, less weight is given to
these liberties than to the specter of state involvement in religion  something which, if anyone
has reason to fear, it would be Germany, France, Italy, and the rest of Europe.</em>

<p><em>"Everybody is entitled to public education, but realistically we can't meet everyone's needs,"
suggests Ms. Roth of the Danish Union of Teachers.  </em>

<p><em>"In a democratic and open-minded society, if parents want their children to receive the type of
education they desire, they can do so."</em>

<p><em>In the Netherlands, 75 percent of all primary and secondary students attend a state-supported
private school.  "Most teachers in the Netherlands," says Walter Dresscher, President of the
NGL, one of the largest Dutch teachers unions, "think that this system works very well." </em>

<p><em>CONSIDERING the broad acceptance of public choice and even private voucher plans among
teacher unions abroad, the real anomaly becomes, why are American teachers unions 
principally the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association  so
hostile?</em>

<p><em>One answer may be the relatively narrow focus of U.S. teacher unions.  "There are 17,000
teachers in Northern Ireland," as David Allen, Secretary General of the Ulster Teachers' Union
puts it, "and we have five unions.  You have only two big ones," covering more than two million
teachers.  We developed this idea in greater detail in a recent paper on union "concentration,"
mentioned above.</em>

<p><em>As well, America has little background with religious conflict  certainly nothing compared to
Europe.  In America, this has led to an attitude that the government can ignore religious
differences, etc.  In Europe, the fear of centuries of division has led educators to seek out a
modus vivendi, a way to defuse the ticking time bomb of religious division.</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>MOST important, the United States has little experience with public-school choice, and almost
none with private-school support vouchers.  This has made the debate in the United States
largely a theoretical one, in which hopes and fears, complaints and promises, are bound to be
magnified. </em>

<p><em><strong>BELGIUM</strong> -- Constitution of 1970 guarantees "the rights and freedom of ideological and
philosophical minroties."  This right underlies the education system.  "The very structure of
Belgian education," writes Charles L. Glenn, a professor at Boston University's school of
education management who has written two books on school choice internationall, "assures, at
considerable cost, that parents will be able to decide at least whether they want a Catholic or
secular school, while in larger cities other choices exist as well.  The desire of many parents for
religiously based schooling, a cuase of bitter conflict at several points of Belgian history, has
been accomodated successfully."  (School Choice in Six Countries, U.S. Department of

eroded parental rights and, after 1935, sought aggressively to shut down private religious and
non-sectarian schools.  "The state ought to be the basic organizer and controller of the school
system," a 1939 directive from Nazi education theorist Martin Bormann read.  "The pupils
should be put in the public school system, andthe private schools closed."</em>

<p><em>After the war, Konrad Adenauer, the future Chancellor, fought to overturn the Nazi education
system and revive the Weimar liberalism on education choice.  "In every other sphere, the
illegalities of the National Socialist Government are being abolished," he said in a 1946 speech. 
"The earlier legal situation is being re-established.  We want that for elementary schools as well. 
It is unacceptable to validate precisely that illegality of the Nazis experienced as painful by the
broadest section of the population."</em>

<h3>Teacher union "concentration" in 21 countries</h3>
<h4>Senator Robert Kasten &amp; Gregory Fossedal</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Findings of importance to policy-makers:</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>How does the structure of U.S. teacher unions compare with that of other developed countries? 
What does this structure imply for the performance and flexibility of our schools?  A comparative
survey shows U.S. teacher unions  just two major ones  form an unusually concentrated
oligopoly:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>European countries tend to enjoy four or more teacher unions, representing a variety of
ideologies, teaching methods, and religious orientations. 

<p>Some countries restrict political action by public sector unions, or have teacher choice systems for
dues, or parental choice systems for schools, that encourage diversity and diffusion among
teachers unions.

<p>Some Asian countries have low membership rates of 40% or less, or outlaw true teacher
"unionism" altogether.  Examples include Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Do these differences matter?  While the data in this limited survey do not support sweeping
conclusions, some fairly strong correlations emerge:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Countries with low "union concentration"  whether because of diverse union choices, limits on
union political activity, or low union membership altogether  perform better on standardized
reading, math, and science tests.

<p>Countries with union oligopoly structures  where a small number of ideologically and
operationally homogenous unions wield great political power  tend to have more rigid school
systems that resist reform.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Thus, policies that would actually increase union concentration, like a proposed merger of
America's two major teacher unions, would hurt performance and reduce flexibility.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Policies that would lower the barriers to entry for new teacher associations might provide a
healthy degree of competition and diversity to U.S. education.  They would tend to make the
system more responsive to parents and to institutional reform.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>STRONG TEACHERS unions, in historical terms, are a recent thing.

<p>Teachers unions as a dominant player, in a public education sector that is itself dominant, are a
very recent thing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ONLY since the late 1950s have federal and state spending crept close to local and private
spending on education.

<p>In that period also, teacher union membership moved from a minority in most states, and bare
majority in a few, to its present position  making unions the dominant bargaining and political
entity in education, with membership rates of more than 75 percent of public school teachers, and
a bargaining representation rate of 82 percent.<sub><font size="+2">*</font></sub>

<p>This rapid change and growing role in running our children's schools produces some natural
confusion, frustration, and alienation by parents.  Are teachers unions "to blame" for the decline in
education that appears to accompany their emergence as oligopoly institutions?  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The concentration of so much of the teacher labor market into two bodies would constitute an
"oligopoly" or "monopsony" in most economics texts. 

<p>Or is this unfair?  After all, many countries and U.S. states with very high levels of union
membership, staunch collective bargaining rules and rates, and other traditional measurements of
union strength out-perform the U.S. (or, within the U.S., out-perform other states) at math,
reading, science, and other standardized performance tests.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>RECENT WORK by a number of scholars, most notably Professor Myron Lieberman of Bowling
Green University, suggests there is some question <em>whether</em> public sector unionism and collective
bargaining are even appropriate for the school environment.  Pro-union academics, and even such
reformist education leaders as AFT president Al Shanker, have taken up the pro-union cause with
equal vigor, if less depth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Charles Kerchner and Douglas E. Mitchell, two scholars of teacher unionism, put it this way in
their survey:

<p>"In the space of a quarter-century, teachers unions in the United States have changed public
education  its governance, school organization, and even the nature of teaching work.  The
transformation has been as swift as, and more complete than, the massive industrial changes
brought about by... the spread of unionism in the 1930s."  (<em>The Changing Idea of a Teachers'
Union,</em> New York, Falmer Press, 1988, page 2.)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Factor one: </strong>

<p><strong>Collective bargaining</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE FIRST characteristic we compared, both internationally and on a U.S. state-by-state level,
concerned variations in collective bargaining rights and practices.  But the states which outlaw
collective bargaining tend to be those with low per capita income, begging the question whether
poor performance reflects lack of resources or bargaining policies.  And there is little variation
regarding bargaining per se on an international level.  (More so on right to strike and teacher pay.) 
Such variations as exist don't seem to correlate strongly with performance on standardized tests,
though if anything, they rather tend to disprove the thesis that bargaining is a plus for educational
performance.  

<p>Figure 1 compares various measurements of collective bargaining  including collective bargaining
on a simple yes-or-no scale and the right to strike.  These are expanded from information in
scholar Bruce S. Cooper's <em>Labor Relations in Education</em>.  Also included is an index of teacher
pay as a share of per capita GDP  as calculated by the AFT itself in a 1993 study, "How U.S.
Teachers Measure Up Internationally."  This seems like one reasonable way to measure collective
bargaining clout input by the outcome of wages, though as we have noted, it is not necessarily in
the realm of teacher pay or narrow bargaining rights that U.S. teacher unions enjoy such
distinctive power.  

<p>(It should be noted, however, that such a system will tend to make countries with very low birth
rates look as though they are paying more, and those with high birth rates, relatively less.  There
will be a similar affect for countries with relatively low or high private sector unemployment rates. 
Both factors tend to overstate how much Europe, with its stagflationary environment since the
1970s, pays teachers, and understate how much the U.S. and others do.)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE COUNTRIES are listed in order of their performance on recent standardized reading, math,
and science tests, which we have indexed into a composite score.  (We re-based reading scores to
a base of 100, scaling variation from the midpoint to the comparable variation from midpoint for
the 100-based scores; then averaged available scores.)  This facilitates a comparison between
different bargaining factors.  A high concentration of strong or weak bargaining arrangements at
the top or bottom of the list would suggest some connection between them and student
performance.  A more or less random distribution of those factors among the high- and low-test
countries weakens the case that collective bargaining <em>as such</em> is a strong factor, either plus or a
minus.

<p align="center">Collective bargaining rights, from this survey, seem to tell us less about education performance
than about the state of a country's industrial development.  Relatively affluent countries in North
America and Europe generally have mature labor relations systems that grant greater rights to
public sector unions not enjoyed in middle-income countries.  Accordingly, they enjoy high
performance  though not as high as the rising Asian countries which are also middle income, and

<p align="center">FOR EXAMPLE, here we see the country average composite performance score for countries
with various characteristics such as strike, non-strike, bargain, and non-bargaining:

<p>Students perform slightly better in 10 countries where teachers have the right to strike as
compared to 11 countries were teacher strikes aren't legal.  They do slightly worse in 13 countries
with widespread collective bargaining than in 8 countries with no, or only scattered, collective
bargaining.  In neither case, though, is the difference statistically significant.  The one noticeable
trend is that countries with fewer bargaining and strike rights tend to be grouped near the top
(South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the bottom (Spain, Portugal, Italy) of the
performance spectrum.  Higher income countries with more developed public sector union
systems tend to fall in the middle, with the U.S. in the lower middle range.

<p>Thus, of the five top-scoring countries on standardized tests, four have no or only some collective
bargaining for teachers.  The same, however, is true of three of the bottom five countries.  Only
one of the 11 countries in between  Switzerland, with its traditional low-regulation labor market 
has only "some" collective bargaining, and all other ten have full bargaining, most at the national
level.

<p>Grouping by test scores, one finds a similar story of weak or non-existent correlation.  Among the
<u>top five countries by test score</u> (South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden, Japan, and Singapore)  the
<u>teacher pay</u> index is <u>148</u>.  (A teacher of medium seniority typically earns 148 percent of the
country's per capita Gross Domestic Product.)  In the <u>bottom five</u> (Portugal, Spain, Italy,
Germany, and Great Britain) <u>teacher pay</u> is <u>155.4</u>.

<p>Thus there are some admitted gaps in the case that collective bargaining harms education, at least
in terms of the measurable outcome of test scores.  There are also problems, however, for the
teachers unions and their advocates themselves.  These problems become even larger when one
examines the claims made by the proponents of collective bargaining on its behalf.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ALBERT SHANKER, president of the American Federation of Teachers, provided an instructive
example in one of his advertised commentaries in <em>The New York Times</em> (July 21, 1996).  Although
it does not cite Lieberman, Shanker's article appears to be a response to his work, particularly as
regards bargaining.

<p>"The people who makes this claim," (that unions harm schools), Shanker writes, "don't explain
why most of the countries with successful school systems  like Japan, Germany, and France  also
have strong teacher unions." 

<p>Shanker doesn't define "strong" unions or "successful school systems."  Nor does his assertion
appear to fit a reasonable definition on any level.  Consider:

<p><em> </em><u>Japan</u>'s last teacher union president complained of state "repression" and called Japan's system
one of the most "anti-teacher" in the world.  Then, about 38 percent of Japan's teachers were
union members.  Now less than <u>one teacher in three is a union member</u>.  The rate has declined for
20 consecutive years.

<p><u>Germany</u>, meanwhile, is hardly a top-performing education system.  In fact, the failure of the
German economy to innovate, as measured for example by its waning share of industrial patents
and stagnant unemployment rates, has been a source of angst for years.  (E.g., Amity Shlaes,
<em>Foreign Affairs</em>, Spring, 1994.)

<p><u>France</u> has performance scores modestly above average.  France, though, employs significant
state support for Catholic,  Protestant, and other private schools.  Both the AFT and the NEA
have both been harsh opponents of such <u>parental choice</u> proposals for the United States;  if
France's schools are indeed "strong," perhaps Shanker would support introduction of the French
system here.

<p>France does have "strong" education unions  but unlike the United States, <u>France has five major
teachers unions</u>, not just one or two.  (On a per capita basis, the equivalent would be twenty U.S.
unions.)  All these are factors, as this paper explains, that seem to improve performance in
education systems with high union membership.

<p>"U.S.-style collective bargaining," Prof. Kerchner writes, "is not a mainstay of many of the rest of
the world's teachers' unions."  Often, for instance, teacher pay is set as part of an overall civil
service scale.  (In Cooper, page xvii.)

<p>Indeed, in Shanker's table (ranked by test performance), the <u>top five</u> countries are <u>Taiwan, Korea,
Russia, Switzerland, and Hungary</u>.  

<p>Taiwan and Korea have de facto <u>union membership</u> rate of <u>close to zero</u>.  (Korea's weak teachers
association has more than 50 percent membership, has only recently taken on some functions of a
"teachers union" in the American sense.)

<p>Switzerland, Hungary, and Russia  have had <u>parental choice</u> features going back to the
mid-1980s.  Switzerland has strict constitutional provisions limiting public sector union political
clout.

<p>Strong collective bargaining rights don't appear to be a major <em>negative</em> factor in performance. 
They may be, but the evidence presented here doesn't prove that.  Our data leave open the
possibility that strong unions are a plus, a minus, or a non-factor.  Shanker himself writes: 

<p>"Does this prove that collective bargaining leads to higher student achievement?  I wouldn't go
that far...."

<p align="center">If we compare apples to apples  say the U.S. and other affluent Western countries  there appears
to be little variation in union membership rates.  Tracing any slight differences to variations in test
score performance (see the composite scores on the earlier table) would be even more difficult. 

<p align="center">There are broader variations vis-a-vis Japan, Singapore, and other Asian tigers.  But for these, the
comparison of figures itself is more doubtful.  For instance, we've listed South Korea twice in the
table to reflect the fact that the country has a teachers association with about 65 percent
membership.  Nominally a union, the Korean Teachers Association has no right to strike; engages
in wage "discussions" twice annually that would not be considered collective bargaining by most
Western union leaders; is not highly active politically; and is highly proscribed in all its activities
by virtue of Korea's tough laws on public sector unions.

<p align="center">So should Korea's nominal 65 percent union membership lead it  with its high performance rate on
tests  to be ranked among the strong union group?  Or should Korea's unfriendly policies towards
teachers unions as bargaining and political entities lead us to count the KFTA as a mere
association and actual union membership as close to zero?  It would certainly be news to Korean
teachers to learn that they enjoy twice as much strength as teachers in Japan.

<p align="center">To avoid making arbitrary judgments either way, we simply left Korea out of our comparison base
regarding membership and performance.  The impact of including Korea would be small, but if
our judgement about where it belongs is fair  namely, as an association  it would tend to raise the
performance of the low-membership countries.

<p align="center"><strong>To put these variations in perspective, note that the range of science scores runs from a low
of 66 by Great Britain to a high of 78 for South Korea.   That's a spread of 12 points.  The
difference in averages for the two groups is nearly 4 points, making up almost a third of the
full range. </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>A regression analysis of the teacher union membership rate to math scores produced an
r-squared factor of 0.681; to reading scores, an r-squared of 0.516; and to overall scores, an
r-squared of 0.582.  In short, differences in union membership rates correlate with <u>51
percent to 68 percent</u> or more of the differences in test scores.  Much more careful,
multi-variable regressions would be required to draw any dramatic conclusions from this
fit between performance and unionization rates.  The single-variable regression, however, is
at least consistent with a hypothesis that membership matters.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>The differences in union policy, and there are substantial ones, are much greater in areas
outside the bargaining and membership framework.  Mandatory dues, and their extent,
vary widely.  So do the degree of union choice (or, in the U.S., heavy concentration) offered
to teachers, and the presence (or absence) of market structures in the surrounding
education system as a whole.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Furthermore, there is the whole question of union and education structure beneath the
visible surface of aggregate strength measurements.  The <em>number</em> of unions that make up a
given membership or bargaining percentage may be as low as one (China) or two (the
United States) or as many as several dozen.  There is wide variation in terms of ideology,
religion, political activism, and other factors  and considerable variation in the degree of
variety within a given country for these factors.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>A BROADER view of "union strength," then, might yield greater insight into the
education culture than simple bargaining coverage or membership rates as single factors. 
Perhaps the elusive concept of "union strength" is not the most useful point for
comparison.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>A common-sense survey of at the systems suggests why.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Factor three:</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Union concentration</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>UNTIL A 1992 consolidation, Australian educators might belong to any one of more than
100 employee unions, according to the <em>Australian Financial Review</em>.  Even after the merger,
Australia has several dozen regional unions providing bargaining, clustered together under
four major umbrella unions.  There are significant Catholic and protestant teachers
associations that act as a lobbying force <em>in favor</em> of funds to private schools.  Australia also
has a school choice system, which, as we will discuss, can sometimes have important
implications for the structure and impact of teachers unions.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Obviously, the political and social combinations resulting from this policy mix are likely to
differ substantially from that of Canada, where compulsory fees for a single dominant
union are the norm; or Britain, where teachers unions have managed in recent years to
limit some school choice reforms, enact tight rules for hiring foreign teachers (who often
will work for less), and block international performance testing <em>and</em> one-man one-vote for
the union structure itself.  Yet Canada's union membership rate for teachers is comparable,
at 78 percent, to Australia's 62 percent.  And Great Britain's rate, 60.4 percent, suggests its
unions are slightly "weaker."</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Denmark, meanwhile, has several major teachers unions and a half-dozen with more than
two percent membership.   "In Denmark," as one teacher put it, "there is little question
<em>whether</em> you are likely to belong to a union, but a question <em>which one</em>."  Yet its union
membership rate is more than 90 percent, and collective bargaining provisions, if anything,
are stronger than those in the United States.  Traditional strength measurements might
rank Denmark well above the U.S., but its education structure provides greater teacher and
parent choice, a less oligopolistic structure.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Here we see the number of teachers unions, by country, that enjoy approximately 3 percent
or more membership of teachers as a whole; and, as a measure of diversity, which countries
have significant religious-school unions.</strong>

<p><strong>Among the nations of European culture studied, the average number of teachers unions
with significant membership is <u>4.4 unions</u>.  The <u>United States</u>, with <u>two unions</u>, is at
roughly half.  The U.S. is the only country without a significant "religious" teachers union,
referring either to an explicit religious mission or an orientation towards religious schools
or both.  Indeed, such developing countries as <u>India, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Iceland,
Honduras, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh</u> have more liberalized
teacher union structures  less concentration, more diversity  than the U.S.</strong>

<p><strong>The United States is almost alone in the OECD group in its degree of union concentration. 
Canada equals us in terms of number of unions, but the considerable degree of
organization of and support for Roman Catholic school teachers, especially in Quebec and
Ontario, provides a diversity we lack.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>REGARDING union concentration and diversity, the U.S. does resemble some of the highly
successful systems of Asia.  They, too, have little tradition of union organization among
private or religious school teachers, or of public support for those schools, and they
generally have two unions or even one.  (Countries with significant Moslem or Christian
populations are an exception.)</strong>

<p><strong>But note:  The one or two unions in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are weak and
restricted politically.  Three of the four have membership rates of less than 35 percent.  As
recently as <u>1993</u>, <u>Korea arrested</u> more than <u>100 teachers</u> for "<u>illegal union activity</u>,"
reducing their sentence only after they spent time in jail.  When <u>Singapore</u> last had a
significant teacher work stoppage, the president of the United States was Gerald R. Ford. 
The last major strike of any kind was during Ronald Reagan's second term.</strong>

<p><strong>Looking at union diffusion and diversity gives one a picture so much of "union strength"
as of union concentration  along the lines of the "industrial concentration ratios" used by
economist Richard Caves and others to measure competition in industries.  (<em>American
Industry: Structure, Conduct, Performance</em>, Prentice-Hall, 1977.)  They measure the
hegemony of a few union elites.  </strong>

<p><strong>This notion might also be referred to as "teacher choice," meaning the consumer freedom
enjoyed by individual teachers  against, if need be, the aggregated influence of teachers as a
group, or as represented by their union leadership.  And it focuses not just on the nominal
bargaining relationship, but on political leverage.</strong>

<p><strong>Union leaders like to point out, and scholars of comparative education have noted, that the
U.S. is a distinctly large country with an unusually decentralized education system
regarding school budgets:  More than 10,000 local union bargaining units and a
corresponding number of school boards and other management.  All this makes for a
considerable, and in some ways admirable, degree of decentralization.  </strong>

<p><strong>Still, while a teacher may choose to join a somewhat different bargaining unit  if he is
willing to change jobs  he will nearly always be  represented either of the American
Federation of Teachers or the National Education Association.  That, with the small degree
of difference in ideas and operation, is the sum and circumference of his choices.</strong>

<p><strong>Remember, moreover, that we are not only or even primarily concerned with the impact of
U.S. teacher union structure on the bargaining process.  If we were, we would pay a good
deal more attention to teacher salaries, the gap between what (unionized) public school
teachers earn and (generally non-union) private and religious school teachers do.</strong>

<p><strong>Rather, our concern is as much or more with the impact of unionism on the culture and
politics of schools  on the degree of choice for teachers, parents, and others in the system. 
This means choice between different national institutions, ideologies, religious leanings (or
lack of any at all), or operational style.  (Some teachers unions surveyed, for instance, forgo
the right to strike  not because of statutory prohibition but as a matter of their internal
constitution and professional mission.)</strong>

<p><strong>The U.S. <u>combination</u> of <u>strong union membership rates <em>and</em> high concentration <em>and</em> low
diversity</u>makes it truly distinctive.  </strong>

<p><strong>Figure 6, on the next page, compares the degree of union concentration or
"oligopolization" for the countries studied with performance on standardized tests.  For
each country, we assigned a rating of 0 through 5 to the concentration of union power  5
being a high degree of oligopoly or monopoly power, 0 being none.  The ratings were in the
final sense a subjective judgment, along the lines of AdTI's previous work extending the
Freedom House survey back through selected years to the late 19th century.  (See <em>The
Democratic Imperative</em>, New Republic Books, 1989.)  But it is based on six inputs, some of
them quantifiable:</strong>

<p><strong>Union <u>membership</u>, from 0 percent to 100 percent.  (0-1 points.)</strong>

<p><strong>Union <u>density</u>, chiefly the number of teachers unions with membership above the 3 % level. 
This constitutes an element of teacher choice, and diffusion of power for union elites.  (0-1
point.)</strong>

<p><strong>Union <u>diversity</u>, including ideological-partisan diversity, religious diversity, educational
approach or "ethos" differences, and others.  We define union diversity in these matters by
the union's official activities as such, and not by membership diversity if it is not reflected
in policy.  That is, although more than 30 percent of the members of the National
Education Association are, according to one poll, Republican, the NEA consistently
endorses Democratic Party candidates; its PAC directs 99 percent of funding to Democrats;
and its platform is substantially in line with that of America's center-left Democratic Party. 
The same observations hold for America's other major union, the AFT.  Hence the United
States scores a 0.1 for ideological and religious diversity.  (0-1 points.)</strong>

<p><strong><u>Teacher pay</u> as a share of GDP and teacher pay in the union sector versus pay in the
non-union sector.  These are a plausible measurement-by-outcome of union bargaining
strength.  (0-0.5 points).</strong>

<p><strong>The degree of <u>compulsion</u> in paying dues, ability to direct them to or away from desired
activities, and other matters regarding government policy towards unions, (0-0.5 points.)</strong>

<p><strong>Degree of freedom in the demand side of the education market  is there <u>school choice</u>, and
can parents readily choose between schools (including private) with a minimum of
economic penalty?  (0-1 points.)  Whatever the direction of causality, systems that enjoy
<u>school choice</u> seem to enjoy a large element of union diversity as well.  Systems with low or
no choice tend to be those with oligopolistic union structures.   (There is probably two-way
reinforcement going on.  For reasons discussed below, a free market in education supply
seems to promote, or at least allow, for more of a market on the demand side.)</strong>

<p><strong>The point is not to prove that oligopoly teachers unions directly hamper</strong>

<p><strong>school performance, but to suggest, by comparison to bargaining data for instance, that
structure matters.  This relationship deserves more careful study by scholars. </strong>

<p><strong>It may be politically vital.  The fact is, parents and teachers both have legitimate interests
in our schools.  An attempt to ride over one or the other completely is ill-conceived, and will
face a difficult time politically.  Our philosophy of citizenship, like that of Alexis de

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Policies that tend to promote or broaden teacher choice are not universal, but there are
examples.  In most cases  as with the more familiar concept of school choice, interestingly 
they seem to have evolved.  Enactment of such reforms was a response to perceived rights
of conscience and free association, and not necessarily part of a self-conscious effort to
"weaken" or "rein in" teacher unions.  Often they were in response to demands by teacher
rank-and-file.</strong>

encountered doing international work of this sort.  </strong>

which union members' dues can lawfully be put without an
individual member's consent."  Sunshine laws, for instance,
mandate disclosure of union financing and particular
financing for political activity.  A 1982 law, "Act Respecting

proven an extremely strong limitation on the accumulation of
union elite power even at the bargaining level.  In cases over
the last 10 years, Swiss courts have allowed some "solidarity
levies" in labor contracts, under which workers must pay (but
need not join) for a union's services.  But these payments
have been limited to a fraction of regular dues for unions that
engage in significant non-bargaining activities.  And those
that do not are, of course, abstaining from politically
oligopolistic behavior at the outset.  (Mitchnick, <em>International

percent pay hike while abolishing collective bargaining for
teachers in England and Wales.  England already enjoyed a
relatively wide range of union choices for teachers, but the
strength of some of the smaller associations has gained in the
last eight years.  For example, a "students first" union which
eschews strikes and even the withholding of non-contracted
voluntary services has enjoyed rising membership in the
1990s.  (Bruce S. Cooper, <em>Labor Relations in Education</em>,

<p align="center"><strong>Few of these successful endeavors to promote diffusion of union concentration involved any
head-on measures to penalize unionization as such.  Only in Britain and a handful of other
cases have rights to collective bargaining been substantially rolled back.  Other countries 
Korea, Singapore  have been tougher on unions.  Yet none of these enjoys strong civil or
parental rights, and few have major elements of school choice.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Many of the most notable policy efforts have aimed at, or had the effect of, promoting a
different character of unionism and a different structure of the union "market," with
relative indifference to "more power" or less in bargaining for unions as a whole.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Factor Five:</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Parent choice</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>At the recent convention of the American Federation of Teachers, AFT President Al
Shanker made this notable statement about the proper objectives of a teacher union
member:  "<u>It is as much your duty to preserve public education as it is to negotiate a good
contract</u>."  (August 2, 1996.)</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>This was hardly a slip of the tongue.  It is, in fact, the animating spirit of the leadership of
both the AFT and the NEA.  Both place great stress on a political defense of the system 
meaning, public schools  as against mere workplace issues.  It could be argued that in
recent years the NEA and AFT have put proportionately <em>more</em> effort into protecting the
public school system from perceived encroachment (from vouchers, parental rights, or
other proposals) than they have into improving the wages or work conditions of their
members.  If this sounds like a harsh judgment, consider it in light of Shanker's instruction
to the union's activists that they <em>ought to</em> stress this political effort at least equally.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>SCHOOL CHOICE makes an interesting point of reference for judging union political
orientation.  For one thing, school choice is now widespread in the developed world, even in
pockets of the United States and Canada.  For another, it is the education reform of choice
by most center-right parties.  School choice formed the thrust of education reform in
Sweden (1992) and in Great Britain under former minister of education Margaret
Thatcher (1981, 1988).  Ronald Reagan (1980), George Bush (1988), and Robert Dole
(1996) all campaigned on it.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Finally, school choice is the <em>bete noir</em> of many union officials, at least in the United States. 
(Interestingly, the reception has been much less hostile among many countries of Europe
and Oceana, as a forthcoming paper will discuss.)  Much of the interest in restructuring
collective bargaining or other aspects of policy towards teacher unions comes from the fact
that education reform proponents are frustrated with the ability of union officials to
frustrate school choice plans in Congress, the state legislatures, and the courts.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>When Dole took the unusual step of criticizing the teachers unions as such during his
acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention, he threw a spotlight on the issue
of union clout that virtually ensures the subject will be with us for some time.  Many
forthcoming debates will be filled by words like "bargaining," the "right to strike," and
"relative wages."  Often, though, the real bone of contention will be the desire of some to
change the school system to a more market-based, parent-as-consumer approach; and the
fervent and conflicting desire of others to, as Shanker put it, "protect public education" as
we know it.  </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>To many, the salient impact of teacher unions has not been to win significantly higher
wages for teachers.  More important, to most, is the impact on education itself.  Cooper
writes:  "[U]nionization of public school teachers across the world is a movement of great
importance  a revolution of sorts.  It has redefined the way school organizations work; the
process of decision making; hiring, evaluating, and firing of staff."</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>If reformers desire to "fight the unions" <em>in order</em> to achieve some other, systemic objective,
they need to examine what sort of union structure seems to promote, or at least be most
consistent with, the choice schemes that they desire.  "Who wills the ends," as St. Thomas
More reportedly said, "yet does not will the essential <em>means</em> to the ends, makes practical
war upon the ends themselves, indeed against his very soul."</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>THE FIT between different union structures and school choice is thus of topical interest, as
well as offering insight into the flexibility of various structures, by testing their adaptability
to a common, but sometimes bitterly disputed, education reform.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Instead, most systems fall on the right  combining "strong" unions, from a traditional view,

<p align="center"></strong><strong>The direction of cause and effect, once again, could be debated.  Our guess is there is
reinforcement going in both directions.  A broad, diverse union movement provides
representation to teachers who are not opposed to choice, or may even favor it, making this
reform easier to enact.  At the same time, the fact of a choice system, by making it easier for
parents to choose a school with a particular language, location, pedagogic style, or even
religion, promotes a diversity of schools that could be a natural base for diverse types of
union representation. </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Reformers, however, should note the empty column on the lower right.  At the least, high
union concentration (low "teacher choice") has not yet been combined with significant
parental choice.  And, at the same time, many countries have managed to combine
"strong" unions in the bargaining sense with a large degree of parental rights and choice,
provided there is significant union diversity and choice.  "Weak" unions, in terms of
bargaining and membership, meanwhile, are no guarantee of choice:  Korea, Taiwan,
Singapore, Japan.  In fact, they seem to go with <em>non-choice</em> systems.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>In countries such as France and the Netherlands, which have had school schemes since the
mid-19th century, the chicken-egg question of teacher choice and parental choice is most
acute.  Other countries, however, have enacted choice schemes, or significantly expanded
choice options, in recent years.  These include <u>Sweden, Great Britain, Australia</u>, and
<u>postwar Germany</u>.  In each case there was a high degree of union diversity and teacher
choice <em>before</em> parental choice was established or significantly expanded.  This diversity, of
course, at once weakened the monolithic forces opposed to reform, and established some
groups in favor of choice, such as financially stressed parents in the un-funded private
system and the lower-paid teachers working with their children.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>"We have been <em>for</em> the choice system," says Sven Kinnander, international representative
of the Lararnas Riksforbund teachers union in Sweden.  "We welcome these schools
because it creates the possibility of more than one employer for teachers.  Before 1992 we
had very few of these free schools."  Teachers also benefit, he argues, from the wider choice
of workplace environment.  "We now have different pedagogical orientations," and more
religious schools.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>(Post-war Germany and post-Revolutionary France under the education reforms of 1830
and 1849 did not have significant union diffusion or even organization.  Both, though,
suffered through something close to a collapse in the viability and legitimacy of national
institutions.  Similar developments may be at work today in Eastern Europe.  Only the
most extreme education reformers, of course, would advocate creating a national collapse in
order to facilitate parental rights and school choice.)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>The system's the thing</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>HOW BIG a priority are non-bargaining issues to union elites?  There's a suggestive bit of
evidence from AFT President Shanker's recent defense of union bargaining strength in the
<em>Times</em> advertised commentary.  </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>In the piece, Shanker praises such systems as Germany and Japan which, as we note above,
are not especially strong havens of union rights.  What's notable, though, is that Shanker
doesn't mention such countries as Denmark, the Netherlands, or Sweden.  All three
perform well on some standardized tests.  All have been implicitly praised in past AFT
studies and press releases for spending lots of money on government schools.  They also
have strong rights of collective bargaining, and generally well-paid teachers.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>All three, however, have parental choice systems and parental rights constitutional
guarantees.  And all have significant degrees of union diversity and teacher choice. 
Apparently, these factors dampened the AFT's enthusiasm for their spending levels and
bargaining system.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>A former Jersey City official who has worked with the teachers union says that:  "I would
often have gladly given them everything they wanted on pay, if we could have had systemic
reform....  But I'm not sure that was possible because their first, primary interest was in
keeping the system the same."  This comment is remarkably symmetrical to Shanker's
statement about union priorities.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Reformers may wonder:  If union leaders want to protect the current system of education
more than the pay and conditions of their workers, are they more interested in teacher
union power <em>as such</em>, or in the power of the teacher-union structure of today?</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>One of the more informative and balanced reports on teacher unions internationally is
Bruce S. Cooper's <em>Labor Relations in Education</em>.  Most of the chapters are written by
teacher union leaders, including one on the United States by Shanker.  The introduction,
by Charles Kerchner, observes:</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>"Given the close alliance between the NEA and the Democratic Party in the United States,
it is interesting to contemplate what would occur if an avowedly Republican education
alternative were to develop."  Or, one might add, a union of private-school teachers; a
union for teachers in Jewish or Roman Catholic schools; or one for inner-city teachers
favoring parental choice scholarships.  Or, for that matter, a non-ideological,
non-sector-specific union but one that would <em>compete</em>with the NEA and the AFT?  (A la
PAGE in Georgia.)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Strong unions?</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Yes, but only two</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>To make the point more poignant, suppose the NEA and the AFT were offered a choice
between an environment with five major unions, and an <em>increase</em> to 90 percent teacher
unionization  or the status quo, and a 5 percent cut in public school teacher pay?  Would
the same leaders, if they had to pick one, choose a parental school choice system, with a
national right to strike  or a national ban on teacher strikes, but a guarantee against school
voucher, scholarship, choice, and similar programs?</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Is there any doubt that in their heart of hearts, the leaders of both major unions would
favor a pay cut, and "weaker" unions, over a stronger position for unions as a whole but
one in which they are less dominant?  That they treat promoting teacher rights as less
important than denying parental choice? </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>The leaders have all but made this syllogism explicit.  An NEA resolution that says
vouchers would "destroy public education."  And the AFT president admonishes union
elites to "defend public education" as staunchly as they work for "a good contract."  It
follows that the animating purpose of the NEA and AFT, in the eyes of its leaders, is
fundamentally political and statist.  Pay and conditions for its rank and file are no more
important, and may be less.  </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>It is not too much a leap to believe that, as the NEA and AFT hierarchy care more about
the school system than about teacher contract provisions, so they care more about
protecting their own degree of exemption from competition.  The mutual leadership know
what they are doing when they place great emphasis, as at both 1996 conventions, on
reducing even the small amount of competition that now exists between the NEA and AFT. 
Their plans to merge the two organizations, so similar in ideology and operation, into one,
are not idle or purposeless.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Conclusions</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>MUCH WORK remains to be done by comparative education scholars to test these and
other tentative hypotheses.   From the evidence we've examined, however, there are
grounds for education reformers to direct their research, analysis, and prescriptions in
certain directions.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Efforts to simply "weaken" or "oppose" teacher unions have potential political drawbacks
and unintended consequences.  There are some reasons to doubt an "anti-union" policy by
U.S. or U.S. state officials  in and of itself  could significantly improve performance.  Such a
policy might even prove to divert attention and resources from more systemic battles.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Such policies might, of course, promote school productivity, if it is deemed that teachers
can and should work for lower wages.  It might have political benefits, for example by
helping reformers to overcome union elite resistance to particular policy improvements
such as school choice.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>But even if "union clout" is driven down in some overall way, the data presented here
suggest there may be scant or no improvements in education performance, and perhaps no
added flexibility regarding policy reforms either.  Union bargaining clout could be
thwarted, for example, without disrupting at all the quasi-hegemony of major teachers
unions in the political culture.  Membership rates could be lower as well without serious
disruption to politics as they are.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Suggestive evidence of this is the non-relationship between teacher salaries and student
performance.  Other things being equal, teacher salaries should in some way reflect the
strength of a union in its bargaining relationship.  In turn, they should serve as a proxy for
union "strength." Insofar as union strength is a good thing, as per the union's elites, or a
bad thing, as per neoconservative and liberal critics of the union, there should be
measurable impacts, good or bad, for students and schools.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>If union leaders are right that American schools mainly lack resources, then high teacher
salaries (and the power relationships they reflect) should lead to superior performance.  If
critics of "unionism" per se are right, then high salaries (and the strong union hand they
are a sign of) should correlate with poor performance.  But the performance of students is
more or less randomly distributed against teacher salaries.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>UNION power vis-a-vis administrators certainly creates difficulties, and the collective
bargaining process could be improved.  It may be that such improvements would have a
major impact on education performance;  but we can find no evidence of this from this
admittedly brief survey of international teacher union policies.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>The power of a few union officials to block reforms and, in effect, set policies for large parts
of the system is much harder to measure.  But when the effort is made, it appears to yield
important insights into how our schools are run, and therefore, what they produce.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>As an example, we adapted the industry concentration ratio, as used by Richard Caves and
other analysts of oligopoly commercial behavior, to the structure of teachers unions in the
United States and other countries.  While this involves interpretation of data, it at least 
can start from a hard data base.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>REFORMS should focus to at least some extent on teacher choice  with a careful distinction
between the power of <em>teachers</em> as a group of several million diverse individuals, and the
particular <em>institutions</em> which happen, now, to represent them.  A further distinction must be
drawn between <em>unions</em> and the <em>particular elites</em> who lead them.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Starting from this conceptual base, several reforms would appear to make sense.  Most of
them, notably, have the effect of <em>strengthening teacher choice</em> in the workplace, in the
surrounding politics of how the education workplace should be run, and at the bargaining
table.  </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Teacher <em>choice,</em></strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Union <em>reform.</em></strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>1. <em>Establish a dues check-off system</em> to facilitate teacher choice between different unions or
allow discretionary participation in bargaining activities only.  A version of the latter, as
was passed recently in Indiana, would allow teachers to avoid paying dues not related to
bargaining.  Systems that facilitate teacher choice in unions, as in the case of the new
PAGE teacher union in Georgia, will allow current union oligopoly power to be diffused
through different and competing organizations. </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>This is a classic, Madisonian recipe for rendering special interests less harmful by
decentralizing them and encouraging competition.  It has the added political advantage of
allowing reformers to argue for the empowerment of individual teachers, while opponents
must explain why freedom of choice must be restricted.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>2. <em>Restrict political action by public sector unions.</em> Franklin Roosevelt, no enemy of
unionism, worked hard to exclude public sector unions from the protections of the Wagner
Act, arguing that their special commitment to public service, as well as access to public
resources, made it inappropriate for them to exercise significant leverage against their
employer  which is to say, the people of the United States.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Given the decentralized nature of education, one can make a case for allowing <em>bargaining
rights</em> to remain intact.  But political activism is another matter.  There is something
pernicious about an organization that can leverage itself on both sides of the bargaining
table  as unions do through collective negotiation on the one hand, yet through political
activism on the other.  And do so, moreover, using funds originally derived from the public
as well.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Of these powers, the power far more threatening to the public interest is the way in which
oligopoly union elites are able to hold education reforms hostage politically.  </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Should teachers be allowed to organize politically through non-union institutions?  Of
course.  They already do, as the heavy supply of NEA members at the Democratic National
Convention every four years suggests.  But there is no clear public purpose in allowing this
power to be united under one roof with the bargaining clout of the largest single employee
organization in the country.   There are plentiful reasons not to.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>3. <em>Review the possible application of anti-trust laws to public sector unions</em>.  Serious
philosophical issues arise when a group of citizens, an interest group, organizes to bargain
and even strike as a unit against the government  which is to say, against the whole society. 
The same group enjoys tax benefits and subsidies for much of its activities.  When it then
applies this accumulated muscle against the legislature and the political economy, its
position is unusually privileged.  It is not clear why teachers, as against nearly any other
labor or professional group, should enjoy this status.  </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>If Congress, the administration, and the states move in the coming years to diffuse and
decentralize power beyond a few national education union bosses, of course, there would be
no need to apply such remedies  and no justification, since by definition the anti-trust laws
exist to frustrate concentrations of power.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>4. <em>Promote pay equity for teachers.</em> The pay gap between public and private (or, in much of
Europe, "independent") schools is much wider in the United States than in most of the
developed world.  Congress should hold hearings and consider legislation.  One obvious
source of the relative gap is that in many other countries, governments support the private
school system, usually indirectly through vouchers or other parental choice mechanisms. 
Would parental choice in the United States, either nationally or in states and localities, help
to narrow this gap?  Is this desirable?  Why is it that officials from the NEA and AFT have
demonstrated so little concern about this gap?  Or, alternately, do they think it is a serious
problem, and if so, what solutions do they recommend?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>5. <em>Review current laws and regulations on teachers unions to make sure they don't perpetuate
high concentration.</em> Other countries appear to have established much lower "barriers to
entry" for emerging unions.  The United States should study those systems to see why it is
that even such authoritarian countries as Singapore and Malaysia enjoy much more
teacher choice and union diversity than we.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Preventing the concentration of power in a few hands is an animating goal of American
federalist democracy.  It also appears, from these data, to work empirically in schools
around the world.  Those with decentralized teacher union structure do well.  Those with a
small cadre calling the shots do not.</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>It is probably not appropriate, and  hopefully not necessary, for federal officials to promote
aggressively the formation of further unions.  But there should be a thorough review of all
statutes, executive orders, and regulations to insure that U.S. policy is not creating undue
barriers to entry in the teacher-union field.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>6. <em>End special tax breaks, subsidies, and even de facto tax-exempt lobbying privileges</em>by the
NEA and AFT.  Segregate union political activities from legitimate collective bargaining
operations, and separate the NEA's true, tax-exempt promotion of education from its
political lobbying and other arms.  </strong>

<p align="center"><strong>Some of this agenda would simply require serious enforcement of existing statutes, such as
the original articles of incorporation for the NEA.  Few Americans are against teachers
earning a decent wage, for their rights to bargain collectively, or even, in many cases, for
their right to strike.  These rights need not be infringed, but the unbridled political activity
of public sector unions under tax-exempt umbrellas would be curbed.  Ultimately, the
rights of individual teachers to associate and organize <em>as they see fit</em> would be enhanced, not
retarded.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>AMERICANS MAY face the ultimate trust-building question soon as the NEA and AFT
move closer to a planned merger into one, colossal teachers mega-union.  If the information
suggested by school performance in other countries is any indication, this proposed merger 
especially in today's tight, two-union oligopoly  would raise profound questions for
American education.  </strong>

<p><strong><hr>

<p></strong>America's major teacher unions -- the National Education Association (NEA) and the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) -- have spent millions of dollars this election season in an attempt
to elect a new Congress.  Analysis of the recipients and targets of their PAC money suggests that
much of the unions' efforts did not bear fruit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the races in which they funded challengers, the unions were only able to win 20 percent of the
races in the Senate (one out of five) and 17.5 percent in the House (18 of 103).  In the
all-important open seats, teacher union-backed candidates won 38.5 percent of Senate seats (five
of 13) and 48.7 percent of House seats (19 of 39).  The incumbents they backed in each chamber
did very well.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The NEA also used independent expenditures to try to defeat nine targeted House members.  In
those contests, which were chosen in part because polls suggested they could be won, the NEA
nonetheless only won four of nine seats, despite spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in
several of the races.

<p><em>"We needed to take a look at what our members were thinking before the election.  They don't
want us to be partisan.  They don't want us to be political." -- Mary-Elizabeth Teasley, NEA
Director of Government Relations</em><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Earlier AdTI research has described the sharp partisanship of unions in their 1996 campaign
activities.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Of the major unions analyzed, teacher union Political Action Committees (PACs)
were found to be among the most lopsided in their support of Democratic candidates over
Republican candidates.  They were shown to be more partisan than the Teamsters and almost as
partisan as the AFL-CIO.  This Issue Brief provides the latest figures on National Education
Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teacher (AFT) PAC contributions to federal
campaigns.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The PAC contribution data are from the NEA's September Monthly Report to the Federal
Election Commission (FEC) and from the AFT's July Quarterly Report and are the latest figures
for the 1995-6 election cycle.  It is also important to note that the teacher unions have been
involved in political campaigns in other ways besides PAC contributions.  For example, the NEA
is spending $500,000 on radio and television ads and direct mailings to defeat four Republican
U.S. House Members.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Although there are limits on PAC contributions, groups may spend
unlimited sums on "independent expenditures."

<p>As Table 1 shows, the teacher unions have given 99 percent of their funds to Democratic
candidates and less than 1 percent to Republicans.  This partisanship contrasts sharply with recent
figures about public school teacher party identification.  A survey by the National Center for
Education Information found 42 percent of teachers identify themselves as Democrats, 30 percent
identify themselves as Republicans, and 28 percent as Independents.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> This survey data confirms
the statement of NEA President Bob Chase who recently observed, "Our membership breaks
down very similar to the general public as far as percentage being Democrat, Republican and
Independent."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="neaaftup.gif" width="557" height="340" align="top" >

<p>The same survey found that 39 percent of public school teachers identify themselves as moderate,
35 percent as conservative, and 25 percent as liberal.  These ideological positions again contrast
sharply with teacher union policy positions, which AdTI has analyzed in earlier studies and found
to be quite liberal.  For the NEA for example, AdTI found that if every item in their <em>Legislative
Program for the 104th Congress</em> were enacted, federal spending would increase by at least $702
billion annually -- an expansion of about 40 percent.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While the NEA and AFT of course have a right to support whatever policies and candidates they
wish, such extreme partisanship in the face of sharply differing views among teachers seriously
calls into question the union leaders' claims to represent the interests of teachers.

<h3 align="center">Do Unions Represent Teachers?</h3>
<h3 align="center">Leaders Back Liberal Agenda; Many Members Don't</h3>
<h4 align="center">By Carl F. Horowitz</h4>
<h4 align="center">Investor's Business Daily - National Issue - September 17, 1996</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As kids head back to school, their teachers have landed in the middle of the presidential race. And
GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole put them there.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In his acceptance speech to the Republican convention, Dole called on the public to support
school teachers but oppose their unions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''I say this not to the teachers,'' he said, ''but to their unions: If education were a war, you would
be losing it. . . . When I am president, I will disregard your political power, for the sake of the
parents, the children, the schools and the nation.''

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At first glance, it seems a contradiction to speak out for teachers but attack their unions.

<p>Yet there's a logic to it - the leaders of the teachers' unions are Democratic Party activists; many
teachers are not. Union leaders, commanding huge sums of cash, back strong liberal positions,
despite the views of many of their members.

<p>The 2.2 million-member National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers, with about 900,000 members, have sent huge contingents of delegates to every
Democratic Party convention since 1976. About 10% of the delegates in '92 were NEA members.

<p>It was much the same this August in Chicago. Of the 4,320 regular delegates, 480, or 11%, were
from the NEA (363) or AFT (117). Each union also accounted for several dozen of the 605
alternates, the Democratic National Committee said.

<p>The unions have a lot of money to throw around, too. NEA and AFT take in a combined $1.3
billion a year, mainly from dues, says Charlene Haar, president of the Education Policy Institute, a
Washington-based think tank. This money goes to a wide range of member services, including
information and seminars, as well as political field organizing. Haar co-wrote the '94 book, ''The
NEA and AFT: Teacher Unions in Power and Politics.''

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>John Berthoud, vice president of the Arlington, Va.-based Alexis de Tocqueville Institution,
estimates NEA now spends $39 million a year on some 1,500 political field organizers throughout
the U.S.

<p>These funds do not include those of the union's political action committee or other offshoot
groups.

<p>Federal Election Commission data for the 1993-94 election cycle show the NEA contributed $2.2
million to Democratic candidates, but only $25,800 to Republican candidates.

<p>These sums do not include the national NEA's ''soft-money'' donations to national and state party
organizations. Nor do they include state and local chapter donations to parties and candidates,
virtually all Democrat.

<p>Given their size, it's not surprising NEA and AFT members form a large pool of unpaid
volunteers, assisting with phone banks, canvassing and polling.

<p>The NEA has endorsed more than 250 candidates for Congress this year -not one a Republican.
Both the NEA and AFT have endorsed President Clinton's re-election.

<p>But there's another side to the story: the teachers themselves. Many of them resist becoming
adjuncts to the Democratic Party. Besides that, far from all teachers even belong to a union.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Almost 40% of the National Education Association's members call themselves Republicans,
according to the NEA's own polls.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In November, the Washington-based polling firm, Peter D. Hart Research Associates, asked AFT
members how they would vote in the next congressional race. About 40% planned to support the
Democratic candidate, 16% the GOP candidate, and another 22% weren't sure.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At the Republican convention in San Diego, 34 delegates were NEA members.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>EPI's Haar says teachers are split one-third each Democrats, Republicans and independents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>About 25% to 30% of all public school teachers do not belong to a union, while almost no private
school teachers belong, Haar said. Many teachers are nonunion out of personal conviction, as well
as for financial reasons.

<p>Why would so many teachers belong to unions that back politicians and causes they may actually
oppose?

<p>One explanation is that labor law allows NEA and AFT to act as gatekeepers, much as it does
other unions. In states with collective bargaining laws for teachers, unions can make teachers join,
or pay ''agency fees'' in lieu of joining, as a condition of employment. In those states, teachers with
different political views must still pay the union or not get a job.

<p>Combined national, state and local annual dues for NEA and AFT members, willing or not, range
from around $300 to $700.

<p>For teachers who do back their unions, there's a good reason for it. Unions overwhelmingly
represent teachers in public schools. And public employees' unions have a distinct agenda, argues
Rutgers University economist Leo Troy, one of Haar's co-authors.

<p>Old- style unionism focused on working conditions and job security. Today's newer kind, found
mainly in the public sector, pursues income redistribution, he observed in his own book, ''The
New Unionism in the New Society.''

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''The New Unionism has yet to see a tax it doesn't like,'' he wrote.

<p>Teachers' unions thus have an interest in forming cadres for the party of income redistribution -
the Democrats.

<p>Berthoud of the De Tocqueville Institution did some calculation early this year. If Congress were
to pass NEA's legislative program, he said, federal spending would go up $702 billion a year. And
almost all of it would go to health care and Social Security.

<p>NEA officials insist they place education above party politics.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''I think we have a long history of making the schools better,'' said NEA Government Relations
Director Mary Teasley.

<p>Rank and file don't have a problem with that goal. The Hart poll for AFT revealed 58% of
teachers see improving education as one of the two top nationwide election issues.

<p>Mark Mellman, president of a Washington consulting firm that has done confidential polls on
teacher attitudes and that has numerous Democrat clients, says union leaders take their cue from
the members.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''Teachers' unions reflect attitudes of their members,'' he said.

<p>In fact, the NEA's board recently voted to affirm a commitment to bipartisanship. Union heads
themselves can sound like today's Republicans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''Time is running out on public education. . . . The dissatisfaction that people feel is very basic,''
noted AFT President Albert Shanker.

<p>Yet the unions seem in conflict with the GOP on two key education issues: giving certain eligible
parents vouchers to use as they see fit, which backers say means transferring kids to private
schools; and contracting out public school services to private firms.

<p>Candidate Dole has proposed vouchers of $1,000 for grades K-8 and $1,500 for grades 9-12 to
eligible parents for a private-school education. Funding for each voucher would be divided
between Washington and the states.

<p>The unions vigorously oppose such a measure.

<p>Private contracting enjoys support among free- market advocates. School districts typically
underestimate the true costs of services, argues Reason Foundation education specialist Janet
Beales.

<p>But contracting doesn't sit well with teachers' unions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''NEA and AFT leadership are vehemently opposed to contracting out,'' Haar said. ''Opening up
competition in service delivery runs the risk of fewer union members and fee payers.''

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It also might explain why teachers' unions organize workers tangential to teaching. For years
NEA and AFT have organized bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other school employees.

<p>In the 1993-94 school year, about a fourth of NEA's rolls were not full-time teachers. They
included support staff, retired teachers, ''life members,'' agency-fee payers and students.

<h3 align="center">"Mad and Mobilized"</h3>
<h3 align="center">Dole Declares Teachers' Unions a Menace, but Clinton's Their Pet</h3>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4 align="center">Elizabeth Gleick</h4>
<h4 align="center">TIME Magazine</h4>
<h4 align="center">September 9, 1996 Volume 148, No. 12 </h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At a rally in Chicago last week for the nation's two teachers' unions, the National Education
Association and the American Federation of Teachers, the scene appeared straight out of one of
those old melodramas with vocal audience participation. The guest speaker, Vice President Al
Gore, had only to mention the villains--Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, "the Ginsu gang," who
"tried to chop, slice and dice all those things that are important to us"--and hisses filled the air.
The heroes, too, were just as easy to identify. "We love all our teachers," Gore told the
pumped-up, cheering crowd. "We don't bash them." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Long before last week, of course, the Clinton-Gore campaign had known it could count on the
votes of the majority of members of the N.E.A. and the smaller A.F.T., a politically active bloc
some 2.5 million strong that traditionally backs Democratic candidates. (Since it was established
in 1972, the N.E.A. political-action committee has never endorsed a Republican for President.)
But in July, Dole began attacking these organizations by name, railing against the evil influence of
"the teachers' unions" much as George Bush used to invoke the A.C.L.U. During his speech to the
Republican Convention in San Diego, Dole fulminated, "I say this not to the teachers, but to their
unions: If education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be
driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying." Now, as some new N.E.A.
posters are proclaiming, America's teachers (90% of whom belong to a union) are MAD AND
MOBILIZED.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Dole's attack on the teachers' unions is "the single most mystifying thing we've seen,'' says White
House press secretary Mike McCurry. Notes Joe Lockhart, press secretary for the Clinton-Gore
campaign: "People don't see the teachers as Big Labor, like the Steelworkers." But they do see an
education system in terrible disarray, and last week's back-to-school headlines brought fresh
evidence: 91,000 students without classroom space in New York City, a bankrupt board closing
schools in the District of Columbia, buildings crumbling, test scores falling. Voters are looking for
someone to blame, and the Dole campaign is trying to capitalize on the perception--and sometime
reality--that the unions, rich, powerful and self-protective, are part of the problem, not part of the
solution. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Certainly, the N.E.A. and the A.F.T. have a history of resisting changes, from curriculum reform
to teacher certification to merit pay. But as unionized teachers see it, the fierce struggles to
protect their jobs, their raises and their work rules are part of a bigger war to save the very
institution of public education in a climate of budget cutbacks and ideological polarization.
"Blaming teachers for problems in education is like blaming doctors for aids,'' says Susan Moore
Johnson, a dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "The problem with public
education in this country has to do with poverty, immigration, dissolution of the family and
community." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Nowhere is the battle line drawn more clearly than on the subject of school choice. It has been
touted as an all-purpose panacea: let parents shop around and they will reward good schools over
bad, forcing the bad ones to play catch-up, thus improving quality overall. President Clinton has
embraced this idea in the form of "charter schools"--public schools that throw out all the rules,
including union rules, and start over--and some local teachers' unions have slowly come around to
endorsing these experiments. But the unions draw the line (as has the President, so far) at giving
students public funds to attend private schools, including religious schools, on the ground that
siphoning off money and motivated students will destroy public education. "We are unalterably
opposed to vouchers," says incoming N.E.A. president Bob Chase. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Christian conservatives, on the other hand, are unalterably committed to vouchers as the best way
to gain control over what their children learn. But until the day that vouchers can subsidize
religious academies and home schooling, the Christian Coalition will be very active on local
school boards, where it often faces off against the teachers' unions on curriculum and rules.
Training materials for a seminar the Coalition ran last year in Atlanta state that the "strategy must
be to weaken the teacher unions financially. Any success in achieving this objective will facilitate
virtually all conservative objectives, educational and noneducational." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Given that, it's not surprising that Chase, for one, believes Dole's San Diego attack was meant "to
placate the far right." That's not the case, a Dole staff member insists. The real issue: "We need an
enemy besides Clinton. Sometimes you're defined by your enemies--and [teachers' unions] are a
great enemy to have." At the same time, Dole says he is not a teacher basher. "Maybe I don't
make it clear enough, but teachers do a good job," he told TIME. "This is about the people at the
top who won't let President Clinton make any reforms." But, says Kathy Bell, a Republican
teacher from Florida who sits on the N.E.A. executive committee and feels "really hurt" by Dole's
attacks, "anyone who tries to divide unions from teachers really doesn't understand the concept." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Yet it is not only the religious right that has grown frustrated with teacher-union tactics. Around
the country, local officials complain about lengthy, bitter contract fights and union rules that make
it nearly impossible to fire bad teachers. In Texas, for instance, a right-to-work state where the
teachers' unions have limited clout, it could have taken 2  years to terminate an incompetent
teacher until new legislation was passed last year. In New Jersey, where the New Jersey
Education Association contributes more to local and state campaigns than any other organization,
battles between the local school boards and the N.J.E.A. often involve hardball tactics: in
Madison last fall, teachers stopped writing college recommendations for seniors after they had
worked nine months without a new contract. Yet even the N.J.E.A, says Lynne Strickland,
director of the Garden State Coalition, a lobbying group for 118 suburban school districts, is
making some "midcourse corrections" and now supports charter schools. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In fact, a new spirit of compromise is evident across the country. Albert Shanker, the longtime
head of the A.F.T. who was once a symbol of teacher militancy, has been quick to support such
contested measures as teacher standards. In Illinois 40 school districts belong to the Consortium
for Education Change, begun by the state N.E.A. affiliate, which promotes cooperative efforts
among unions, schools and parents. In Glenview, Illinois, for example, teachers have adopted a
"constitution" rather than a contract and become active participants in reform. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The N.E.A. has also started to play up its bipartisan nature, noting, for instance, that 30% of its
membership is Republican. Yet this year, of the 255 congressional candidates being supported by
the group, only one Republican is receiving any part of the N.E.A.'s $5.5 million in PAC
money--not to mention the $20.7 million it will spend on such indirect political activities as
lobbying and training members for campaign work. "If they're saying they're bipartisan, but their
dollars are saying something else, I'd listen to their dollars," says John Berthoud, an analyst with
the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a public policy research group. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"We don't apologize for the political power we have with the Democrats," says A.F.T. media
director Janet Bass, "just like N.R.A. and the tobacco industry don't apologize for the political
power they have with the Republicans." The Clinton campaign isn't apologizing either. A senior
official says the White House always "welcomes" the opportunity to discuss the President's record
on education, including his expansion of Head Start, the creation of direct student loans and a
new literacy program he unveiled last week. Instead of talking about unions, the President talks
about a much more popular subject: the teachers themselves. "None of us would be here tonight if
it weren't for our teachers. I know I wouldn't," he told the Chicago convention. And the thing
about teachers is, they never forget a name or a face--or an insult.

<h3 align="center">"E Pluribus Union"</h3>
<h4 align="center">The Detroit News - Editorial</h4>
<h4 align="center">Sunday, September 1, 1996</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On the eve of Labor Day, teachers unions find themselves caught in the national political
spotlight. Their powerful presence at the Democratic National Convention has been highlighted
by pundits, and a national audience watched Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole dress
them down. Union apologists now hope to deflect public scrutiny by hiding behind Americans'
respect for local teachers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But the politicization of our schools as a result of union politics is a legitimate issue. Both the
National Education Association (NEA), America's largest union, and the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT), an AFL-CIO affiliate, contribute overwhelmingly to Democratic candidates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>So far in the 1995-1996 election cycle, 99.1 percent of NEA political action committee (PAC)
contributions and 98.6 percent of AFT PAC monies have gone to Democrats, according to a
recent analysis by a non-profit Washington think tank, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution. The
teachers unions' partisanship is so pronounced they make the much-vilified Tobacco Institute and
the National Rifle Association - which have given 78.3 percent and 80.1 percent of their PAC
funds, respectively, to Republican candidates - look wildly bipartisan.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The unions' spending contrasts with their members' attitudes. Forty percent of NEA members
reportedly are Democrats, but roughly 30 percent are Republicans and 30 percent independents. 
In an internal AFT poll, 54 percent of the members surveyed said they would support
congressional candidates favorable to the Clinton administration, but 26 percent said they would
support candidates who opposed it.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The NEA's strong-arm political lobbying led Forbes magazine to dub it the "National Extortion
Association" and prompted a U.S. News and World Report columnist to charge that "the NEA,
the giant dinosaur of educational policy, is the largest single reason why the public-school system
seems almost impervious to real reform. Its clear goal is power over a monopolistic system...."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Bob Dole stressed in his acceptance speech that in attacking the unions, he wasn't attacking
teachers. It's a fair distinction. There is plenty of evidence that unions place their own interests
ahead of the interests of classroom teachers and the kids they instruct. The unions' resistance to
merit pay hardly serves their best teachers, for instance, but it does help keep the pressure on for
higher salaries and more education spending.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Here in Michigan, the power of the teachers unions has been restrained by new laws forbidding
strikes and levying automatic fines in case of walkouts. That's a big reason schools are opening
this year with little of the trouble that has characterized opening day in the past.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Legislature should also consider laws giving teachers the freedom to choose whether they
want to pay the union to bargain for them in the first place (all teachers in most districts must
render the union a fee to cover the cost of "representing" them). Freeing teachers from this
coercion would constitute a giant step toward meaningful academic freedom in the classroom. It
would also force unions to compete more vigorously for the affections of teachers if they want to
stay in business.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The unions don't fairly represent the attitudes of the rank-and-file. And if the unions claim
otherwise, then they shouldn't have any qualms about giving teachers a say in whether teachers
want union bargaining services - much less spend a chunk of teacher paychecks on political causes
in which they may have little interest.

<p align="center"></strong><strong>Executive Summary</strong>

<p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is gearing up to take a major role in the 1996
elections.  This paper aims to provide some understanding of the political and legislative goals of
the AFT through analysis of its PAC contributions to Congressional campaigns ($452,742
through the first quarter of 1996) as well as through examination of policy resolutions of the
union.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Key findings include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>The AFT is supporting Members of Congress who have voted to expand the size of
government and opposing Members who have voted to cut the size of government.</li>
  <li>The AFT is more partisan in their PAC contributions than even the highly-partisan National
Education Association.  This extreme partisanship of union leadership runs counter to union
membership which is much less monolithic in their party loyalties.</li>
  <li>The AFT is funding the most liberal Members of the House and Senate.  The Members they are
backing are more liberal than those backed by the NEA.</li>
  <li>The AFT's overall policy agenda would expand government.  By opposing entitlement reform,
their agenda is clearly contrary to the interests of children.</li>
  <li>Like the NEA, they are strongly opposed to education reform proposals such as
vouchers/scholarships, as well as more generic government reform ideas such as privatization.</li>
  <li>At this year's AFT convention, of the 76 proposed resolutions, <em>not one would lead to a
reduction in government spending</em>, while 43% would increase spending.  Only about one third
of the resolutions have anything to do with kids, education, or schools.</li>

<p align="center"><strong>I. Introduction</strong>

<p>The role of unions in the 1996 elections has been much remarked upon.  Observers as well as
union members should be most interested in understanding union objectives.  This paper attempts
to shed some light on the legislative and political objectives of one of the largest unions: the
830,000-member American Federation of Teachers (AFT).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This paper first profiles the Members of Congress that the AFT is supporting and opposing
through their PAC contributions.  To do this, this paper looks at all AFT Congressional campaign
contributions for the 1996 election cycle and matches these up with figures on how supported and
opposed Members voted during the first session of the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress to change the budget.  The
AFT makes all campaign contributions through the AFT Committee on Political Education
(AFT-COPE).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The campaign contribution figures come from AFT-COPE's Federal Election Commission reports,
covering all contributions made from January 1995 through the end of the first quarter of 1996. 
Over this entire period, AFT-COPE has contributed $452,742 to Congressional
candidates.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>From January 1995 through the end of May 1996, the NEA's Political Action
Committee (NEA-PAC) contributed $643,030 to Congressional candidates.  This means that
combined, the two major education unions in America have contributed <em>$1.1 million</em> in PAC
money to congressional candidates a half year before the 1996 elections.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The tool used for analysis of these Members' votes is the VoteTally database of  the nonpartisan
National Taxpayers Union Foundation.  VoteTally tracks every vote by Members  to increase or
decrease the size of government (using mostly Congressional Budget Office cost estimates). 
VoteTally's most recent release, which is used for this report, covers the entire first session of the
104<sup>th</sup> Congress.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All Members of the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress who are running for election in 1996 are included in this
study.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After analysis of the PAC contributions of the AFT, this paper will examine some policy
resolutions adopted by the AFT at their last convention in 1994 as well as some that are pending
before the delegates at the 1996 convention.  These resolutions will shed further light on the
policy goals of the AFT.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II. Supporting Big Government</strong>

<p>The AFT's PAC contributions show a clear pattern of support for larger government (see Table
1).  The AFT is funding Members who want to expand government and working to defeat
Members who want to cut government.  The Senate candidates they are supporting voted during
the first session of the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress to increase the size of government by $34.6 billion.  The
House candidates they are supporting voted for increases of $32.2 billion per year.  The Senate
and House candidates they are opposing voted to cut annual federal spending by an average of
$25.5 and $32.3 billion respectively.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Two further points should be made about this spending data.  First, there is a striking similarity
between the size of the cuts voted for by AFT-opposed Members and the size of the increases
voted for by AFT-backed Members.  Thus, if the cutters have been "radical," the AFT-backed
Members have been just as radical in their record of support for larger government.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Second, in comparison to the NEA, the AFT is backing candidates who have worked for even
bigger government.  Table 2 provides the details.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p align="center"><strong>III. A More Partisan Voice</strong>

<p>While the NEA has been criticized for the sharp partisanship of its PAC contributions and
activities, little notice has been given to the AFT.  However, the AFT has historically been very
partisan in their patterns of support and 1996 is no exception.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Again, as a point of comparison,
the AFT is found to be even more partisan than the NEA.  Table 3 outlines AFT and NEA giving
patterns over the 1995-1996 period.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<table border cellpadding=5 width="70%">
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="40%">
<p align="center"><strong>Table 3. Percent of Congressional Incumbents and

<td valign="top" width="59%"><strong>98.7%</strong></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>NEA</strong></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>95.1%</strong></td></tr></table>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It is crucial to point out that while NEA and AFT union <em>leadership</em> is extremely monolithic in its
partisanship, union <em>membership</em> is decidedly not.  In the case of the NEA, their internal polls show
that 40 percent of union members are Democrats, with the rest split between Republicans and
Independents.  In fact, a majority of NEA members voted for Ronald Reagan both in 1980 and
1984.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Among the AFT's 830,000 members, support appears to be stronger for the Democratic party --
an internal 1994 AFT poll of members found that 54% said they would look favorably upon a
congressional candidate supportive of the Clinton administration and 26% would support a
congressional candidate who opposes the Clinton administration.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>While not a pure partisan
measure, this 2-1 ratio of support for pro-Clinton candidates is probably far closer to a true
measure of union party loyalties than the 49-1 ratio of PAC support for Democrats over
Republicans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While the AFT has been extremely partisan in its campaign contributions, this does not fully
explain the previously-noted large discrepancies in fiscal voting behavior between those who they
are supporting and those who they are opposing.  While Democrats voted for increases in
government and Republicans for cuts in government, the AFT has funded the most liberal
Members, thereby exacerbating the gulf between the spending average of the group they support
and the spending average of the group they oppose.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Among incumbents, the average Democrat running for Senate in 1996 voted for $28.6 billion in
higher spending during the first session of the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress.  The average Democrat running for
the Senate being financially backed by the AFT voted for $34.6 billion in higher spending.  The
average Democrat running for the House in 1996 voted for $31.3 billion in higher spending.  The
average AFT-backed Democrat running for the House voted for $33.4 billion.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The AFT's PAC is thus funding a group of Democratic Members that are more liberal than the
Democratic average.  In the Senate, the AFT-supported Democrats voted for an increase in
spending 21% greater than the average Democrat.  In the House, the AFT-supported Democrats
voted for an increase in spending 6% greater than average Democrats.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>IV. The AFT Legislative Agenda</strong>

<p>In one sense, it is not surprising to find AFT-COPE contributing to Members who have been
voting to expand government -- the union is on record as supporting expansions in government
spending.  While the AFT legislative wish list is not as comprehensive as that of the NEA's,<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> in
many senses it is very similar.  Although the AFT supports increased spending in many areas,
proposed spending cuts or reforms are scarce to non-existent.  And in some cases, their
anti-reform positions are clearly detrimental to the interests of children.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Highlights of Resolutions Adopted in 1994</strong>

<ul>
  <li>A resolution to "actively and aggressively" oppose government privatization.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a></li>
  <li>A resolution calling for "national legislation" for "national health care reform" along the lines
of the Clinton Administration and McDermott-Wellstone (single-payer) proposals.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> During
1993, the AFT secretary-treasurer had regularly met with the Clinton administration's health
care adviser to confer on health care reform.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A resolution in giving "very high priority to work on ratification of the Equal Rights
Amendment."<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p><strong>Highlights of Resolutions Proposed for 1996</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Of the 76 proposed resolutions for the AFT convention, <em>not one would lead to a reduction in
government spending</em>, while 43% (33 out of 76) would increase spending.</li>
  <li>Only about a third (28) of the resolutions that will be considered have anything to do with kids,
education, or schools.</li>
  <li>The AFT will consider resolutions in opposition to government cost-saving reforms such as
privatization, contracting out,<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and block grants.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a></li>
  <li>One of the proposed resolutions for the 1996 convention is to "work vigorously" to defeat the
"drastic cuts" in Medicare that have been proposed in Congress.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> Given recent projections
about the implications of failure to reform our major entitlement programs,<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>AFT's position of
opposing Congressional efforts at reform (and offering no alternative ideas for reform in its
place) is antithetical to the interests of children.</li>
</ul>

<p>One recent study by Neil Howe<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> found that absent major entitlement reform now, total
government spending will rise from today's 34.4% of GDP to anywhere from 43.9% to 54.5% by
2040.  This will translate into correspondingly higher taxes on individuals, but the real kicker is
earnings: if the more pessimistic scenario prevails, after-tax earnings of the average worker will
<em>decline by 59% in real terms</em>.

<p>Thus, by opposing Medicare reform, the AFT is supporting a status quo that will a have
devastating effect on today's children (who will be tomorrow's workers).

<ul>
  <li>The AFT will consider a resolution calling for a "major increase" in spending on "critical"
federal education programs.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The AFT will look at a resolution to continue to support affirmative action programs.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>The
union will also consider a resolution that its Executive Council "move toward reflecting the
gender and ethnic composition" of the AFT membership.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The AFT will evaluate a resolution terming the Congressionally-proposed cuts in Medicaid
"drastic"and therefore opposing these cuts as well as efforts to block-grant the program.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The AFT will consider a resolution calling on companies which are downsizing to notify
employees about layoff plans <em>one year</em> in advance.<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The AFT will look at a resolution endorsing using "labor community capital" such as public
pension funds to "effect positive change in the corporate attitude toward working men and
women."<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p><strong>Other Policy Positions</strong>

<ul>
  <li>An overall education policy agenda of opposition to reforms such as vouchers/scholarships. 
Instead, the AFT has consistently advocated more spending on education.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a></li>
  <li>The AFT has fought against adoption of a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the U.S.
Constitution because it would force cuts in domestic programs.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> The AFT felt so strongly
about the BBA that it made it one of the 11 critical votes upon which it rated Members of the
103<sup>rd</sup> Congress.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><strong>V. Conclusion</strong>

<p>In its PAC contributions and policy resolutions the American Federation of Teachers is
advocating a substantial change in government.  They would like to reverse the efforts of the
104<sup>th</sup>Congress to trim the size of government and instead see it grow.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Relative to the NEA, the AFT is often perceived as less liberal and more open to educational
reform.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> This study shows, however, that the AFT has an agenda to significantly expand
government, is more partisan than the NEA, and is funding the most liberal of candidates -- more
liberal than those backed by the NEA.  The AFT also shares the NEA's dim view of educational
reforms such as school vouchers/scholarships.

<h3 align="center"><em><strong>"The NEA's Fiscal Agenda - Bad News for Kids"</strong></em></h3>
<h4 align="center"><strong>Remarks of John Berthoud</strong></h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong>Vice President, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</strong></h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong><u>July 1, 1996</u></strong></h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>1. Introduction</strong>

<p>One would be hard-pressed to find a legislative and political agenda more damaging to the
interests of America's children than that of the National Education Association.  This is the clear
conclusion of three Tocqueville Institution studies of the NEA.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We have conducted a detailed fiscal review of the NEA's <em>Legislative Program for the
104<sup>th</sup>Congress</em> and this morning, I'd like to outline the <em>Legislative Program's</em> impact on 1) deficits
and 2) entitlements -- two obvious areas of concern for children.  We have also done two fiscal
profiles of the Members of Congress that NEA-PAC is supporting and opposing and I'll provide a
summary of these findings.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II. Deficits</strong>

<p>In our analysis of the <em>NEA Legislative Program</em>, we matched the proposals in their wish list to
CBO cost estimates of corresponding bills and came to several stunning conclusions.  Most
significantly, we found that if every item was enacted, federal spending would increase by at least
$702 billion per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>I should stress that we believe this figure is a conservative estimate.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>If not funded by deficits, the NEA agenda would translate into an annual tax increase of
$10,554 on a family of four.  The tax increase would be 13 times the size of that in the 1993
budget package.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>While the NEA claims they'd like to lower the federal deficit, given the magnitude of the funds
required, we believe that the much more likely result of adoption of the NEA Agenda would be
a) a large tax increase <em>and</em> b) a substantial increase in the federal deficit.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><strong>III. Entitlements</strong>

<p>The NEA of course tries to claim that it is more than a mere union -- they argue that much of its
agenda is driven by the best interests of children.  This contention however, is completely
contradicted by analyzing their entitlements agenda.  On issues like Social Security and Medicare,
their <em>Legislative Program</em> again is diametrically opposed to the interests of America's kids.  Let
me give you several examples:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>All told, the NEA would expand Social Security benefits for today's retirees by $126.8 billion
per year.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>For each dollar in new spending on children and education that the NEA proposes (over $24
billion annually), it advocates $5.24 in new spending on Social Security.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>While the debate in Washington is (correctly, I'd argue) about how much and how fast to raise
the Social Security retirement age, NEA is advocating lowering the retirement age.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>For Medicare, they oppose many common-sense reforms such as means-testing.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>In sum, our major entitlement programs face grave fiscal imbalances in the coming years which
will require big sacrifices by today's children and the NEA not only is doing nothing to correct
these problems but is seriously adding to them.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>IV. PAC Contributions</strong>

<p>The NEA backs up their advocacy of big government with their campaign contributions.  The
Tocqueville Institution has done two analyses on this issue -- one which we just released last
week.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In our new study, we have looked at NEA-PAC contributions to 1996 House and Senate
candidates.  From January 1995 through the end of April 1996, the NEA's Political Action
Committee has contributed $643,030 to Congressional candidates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Analyzing the Members running in 1996 who have served in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress, it is clear that the
NEA is financing candidates who have voted to expand government, while opposing those who
have voted to cut it.  NEA-backed Senate and the House candidates on average voted during the
first session of the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress to increase annual federal spending by $30.4 billion and $28.9
billion respectively.  The Senate and House candidates that the NEA is opposing voted to cut
government by $31.8 billion and $32.4 billion respectively.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Clearly, despite the NEA's rhetoric that their fiscal agenda is just to stop draconian cuts in
government, in reality the net cuts made by the Members they are working to defeat have been
modest -- about 2 percent of total federal spending.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While NEA-backed Members have voted for increases about as big as the cuts voted for by
NEA-opposed Members, there is more to the story.  Of course, many NEA-supported Members
did not have an opportunity to vote for the spending increase legislation they are espousing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We can get a better idea of the real agendas of NEA-backed Members by looking at their
legislative wish lists -- the bills these Members are sponsoring and cosponsoring.  We have done
that in an earlier study of NEA-PAC contributions to House Members running for re-election in
1994 and found that the average NEA-backed Member had an agenda to increase federal
spending by $302 billion per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Thus, the NEA is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in PAC money to a) defeat Members
who have voted for modest cuts in the size of government, and b) support Members who have
voted for modest increases, but who if given control of the legislative agenda would radically
expand government -- by about 20 percent.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>V. Conclusion</strong>

<p>This portrait of the NEA is not pretty, but this is what the numbers tell us.  The political and
legislative agenda of the NEA would a) increase taxes, b) increase deficits, and c) greatly add to
the coming crises of our major entitlement programs.  The net result is devastation for America's
children.

<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong>

<p>While the two most prominent labor organizations in American politics -- the AFL-CIO and the
National Education Association -- claim that their fiscal agenda is simply to stop "draconian"
cutting of government, analysis of their PAC contributions for the 1996 election cycle and voting
records of the 104th Congress reveals a very different story.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>The Members of Congress that they are opposing have voted to cut government, but only by
rather modest amounts -- about two percent of federal spending.</li>
  <li>The Members that these two labor groups are backing, however, have not supported the status
quo, but rather have been voting to increase the size and scope of the federal government.</li>
  <li>The size of the net cuts voted for by labor-opposed Members roughly equals the size of the net
increases voted for by labor-backed Members.  Thus, if the cutters have been "radical," the
labor-backed Members have been just as radical in their record of support for larger
government.</li>

<p align="center"><strong>A Fiscal Analysis of NEA and AFL-CIO Contributions to</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>1996 Congressional Races</strong>

<p align="center">Dr. John E. Berthoud, Vice President

<p align="center"><strong>I. Introduction</strong>

<p>The two most prominent labor organizations in American politics, the AFL-CIO and the National
Education Association, are again poised to take a major role in American national  elections. 
While arguably unions have had a diminished voice in recent elections, labor leaders are
determined to have a substantial impact on the 1996 results.  Gerald W. McEntee, president of the
American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (an AFL-CIO affiliate), has called
the 1996 election "Armageddon."<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Through the end of April 1996 -- half a year before the election -- the two labor groups combined
had already contributed in excess of <em>$850,000</em> to 1996 congressional candidates.  More campaign
contributions will follow, as will independent expenditures -- the AFL-CIO for example is
planning on spending $21 million on ads and $14 million on grassroots organizing.  Members of
the NEA and AFL-CIO as well as political observers should be very interested in knowing where
all this money is going.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II. The NEA's and AFL-CIO's Stated Views on the Size of Government</strong>

<p>The battle over the size and scope of the federal government has been the preeminent topic of the
104th Congress.  Both the NEA and the AFL-CIO have sought to portray the budget-cutting
efforts in the 104th Congress as draconian.  These supposedly drastic cuts are the reason why
both labor organizations have fought many proposed changes in spending and are now seeking to
defeat the Members of Congress who voted for these changes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The NEA claims that Members of Congress supporting cuts have undertaken a "budget blitz that
aims to decimate federal funding for America's classrooms and schoolchildren."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The Congress's
efforts to cut education and training have been termed an "assault on all fronts" and "an
ideologically-driven amputation."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> The NEA has also asked, "How can we tell children we are
cutting the budget to protect their future when the result will be to destroy the present."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The AFL-CIO similarly has tried to portray the efforts of Members of the 104th Congress as
radical.  The group doesn't claim advocacy of big government but rather simply opposition to
budget changes that would "force long-term cuts in education, Medicare, Medicaid and other
programs that serve working families - while they award massive tax breaks to the rich."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> They
have been opposing "deep" spending cuts and "slashes" in programs because "working people,
seniors, students and others would be hit hard."<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While opposing radical cuts and "slashing," the labor groups have tried to portray themselves as
supporting reasonable cuts in federal spending.  Keith Geiger, President of the NEA, suggested
that the 104th Congress adopt the following as a guideline: "Congress intends to relentlessly cut
wasteful spending and to eliminate unnecessary functions of government.  At the same time,
because we believe in expanding opportunity for <em>all </em>Americans, we pledge to accomplish what
previous Congresses conspicuously failed to do: Fully funding Head Start and Title I, and
expanding college grants and loans so that no qualified American is denied a higher education."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
In the aggregate, it seems that Geiger is advocating a policy of budget neutrality -- more spending
in some areas, but less in others.  While perhaps not advocating a net cut in federal spending,
there is certainly no hint of support for expansion in net federal spending.  The NEA seems to be
claiming a position of keeping total federal spending as is, while shifting money from "wasteful"
areas to higher priorities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In sum, both groups are portraying themselves as opponents of radical cuts, but neither wants to
appear to be advocating an increase in the size of government.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This paper seeks to analyze these groups' portrayal of their own agendas through an examination
of the records of Members they are supporting and opposing in 1996.  To do this, this paper looks
at all NEA and AFL-CIO congressional campaign contributions for the 1996 election cycle and
matches these up with figures on how supported and opposed Members voted to change the
budget in the first session of the 104th Congress.  The campaign contribution figures come from
these groups' Federal Election Commission reports, covering all contributions made from January
1995 through the end of April 1996.  Over this entire period, the NEA's Political Action
Committee (PAC) has contributed $643,030 to Congressional candidates.  The AFL-CIO's PAC
has contributed $209,880.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The tool used for analysis of these Members' votes was the VoteTally database of  the nonpartisan
National Taxpayers Union Foundation.  VoteTally tracks every vote by Members  to increase or
decrease the size of government (using mostly Congressional Budget Office cost estimates). 
VoteTally's most recent release, which was used for this report, covers the entire first session of
the 104th Congress.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All Members of the 104th Congress who are running for election in 1996 are included in this
analysis.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>III. NEA Contribution Patterns</strong>

<p>Tables 1 and 2 present an outline of the spending patterns of 1996 candidates that the NEA is
either supporting or opposing through its contributions.

<td valign="top">-$32.4 billion</td></tr></table>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The NEA is financing candidates who have voted to expand government, while opposing those
who have voted to cut it.  The candidates for the Senate and the House that the NEA is
supporting voted on average to increase annual federal spending by $30.4 billion and $28.9 billion
respectively.  The Senate and House candidates that the NEA is opposing voted to cut
government by $31.8 billion and $32.4 billion respectively.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Nine of the eleven Senate candidates receiving NEA donations voted to increase government. 
Only 12 out of 33 House and Senate Members running for the Senate in 1996 voted for bigger
government.  The NEA has thus contributed to almost all the Members running for the Senate
who want to increase government.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<table border cellpadding=5 width="64%">
<tr>
<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="70%">

<tr>
<td valign="top">NEA-opposed House candidates</td>
<td valign="top">100.0%</td></tr></table>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All of the candidates that the NEA has contributed money against voted to cut the size of
government.  But these Members have only voted for modest cuts -- about two percent of federal
spending.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While this study concludes that Members that the NEA is supporting have voted to slightly
increase the size of government, a previous AdTI analysis of their legislative wish lists -- the bills
they are sponsoring and cosponsoring -- suggests much more expansive visions for government. 
That study<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> showed that the average House candidate supported by the NEA during the 1994
election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302.2 billion per year.  While of
course the list of Members opposed by NEA in 1994 and in 1996 will include some different
individuals, it is still probably reasonable to view the two groups as being similar politically.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>
Accepting the fundamental comparability of the two groups, this huge discrepancy between what
the 1994 group was sponsoring and what the 1996 group was voting for (a net increase of $28.9
billion) shows the power of control over the legislative agenda.  Presumably, many of the bills that
NEA-supported Members wished to pass never got  a vote during the 104th Congress.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This conclusion about the importance of agenda-setting is furthered by the relative similarity of
the legislative agendas of the group of Members that the NEA opposed in 1994 and the votes
taken by the group of Members that the NEA is opposing in 1996.  The candidates that NEA
opposed in 1994 had legislative agendas (as reflected in their sponsorship of bills) that would on
average have cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year.  The closeness of this figure to the
average of the votes of the group being opposed this year (a net cut of $32.4 billion) suggests that
these Members had a greater ability to set the agenda.  We can conclude that the group of
Members opposed by the NEA in 1996 have voted in a manner consistent with what the 1994
group "promised" through their sponsorship of legislation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>IV. AFL-CIO Contribution Patterns</strong>

opposing.

profiles of Members that the NEA is supporting and opposing.  AFL-CIO-backed Members have
voted to increase government by about the same amount that the AFL-CIO-opposed Members
have voted to cut it.  The candidates it is backing for the Senate and the House voted on average
to increase annual federal spending by $33.7 billion and $32.2 billion respectively.  Members that
it is opposing who are running for election to the Senate and the House voted to cut government
by $29.9 billion and $33.6 billion respectively.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As was the case with the NEA, all Members that the AFL-CIO is working to defeat have voted to
cut the size of government.  And again, they were on average only voting to cut it modestly -- by
about two percent.  87 percent of AFL-CIO-backed Senate candidates and 92 percent of
AFL-CIO-backed House candidates voted for bigger government.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>V. Conclusion</strong>

<p>While the Members of Congress that these labor groups oppose are not supporting draconian cuts
in government, each of these organizations has made a clear choice in their PAC contributions. 
They are opposing candidates who have voted to trim government and instead they are supporting
Members who have voted to expand it.  "Following the money" has shown that (contrary to their
statements) <em>these groups: a) support bigger government, and b) are opposed to even limited
efforts to cut government.</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>An interesting finding of this paper is that the cuts voted for by labor-opposed Members are
roughly equal in size to the increases voted for by labor-backed Members.  If the Members these
groups are targeting for defeat have been voting for "radical" cuts, that same term must be applied
to the expansive agendas of their supporters.

<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong>

<p>It is said that you can judge individuals by the company they keep.  The same principle can be
applied to interest groups.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A review of contributions by the Political Action Committee of the National Education
Association reveals that the Congress that NEA is seeking to elect would radically change the
direction of American government.  Most significantly, NEA's ideal Congress would vastly
expand federal spending and taxation.  The average House candidate supported by the NEA
during the last election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302.2 billion per
year.  On the other hand, the candidates that NEA opposed had a net agenda to cut federal
spending by $22.6 billion per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Despite NEA's pledge of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it
wanted, it would mean either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on America's families or
hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits for future generations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But regardless of the impact that an NEA Congress might have on America's kids, NEA members
can rest assured.  Despite a very big tax-and-spend agenda, NEA's ideal Congress would still
maintain NEA's special Washington, DC property tax exemption.  The ideal NEA Congress
would also be strongly opposed to educational choice and vouchers for low-income children.

<p align="center"><strong>An Analysis of 1993-94 NEA-PAC Contributions to House Races</strong>

<p align="center">Dr. John E. Berthoud, Vice President, Alexis de Tocqueville Institution

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>I. Introduction</strong>

<p>The National Education Association (NEA) has become one of the most powerful constituencies
in American politics.  NEA and its state affiliates are a major participant in the legislative process
in Washington and in the 50 state capitals.  The national and state organizations also contribute
millions of dollars to political campaigns at all levels.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The amounts that NEA spends to achieve influence in the policy process and elections are
staggering.  They annually spend $39 million on 1,500 field organizers around the
country.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>During the 1994 election cycle, the NEA-PAC spent $2 million on House campaigns,
and was the fifth largest PAC contributor in the United States.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> And beyond legislative and
executive branch battles in Washington and the states, NEA is actively involved in numerous
court battles as well.  It is no wonder that many view the NEA as the nation's most powerful and
influential union.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Given this clout, it is important for both the NEA's members as well as the public at large to see
what kind of Congress the NEA is seeking to create.  Who are the candidates for Congress that
the NEA is supporting through campaign contributions and who are they opposing?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This paper assesses three key measures of significance to voters and/or the NEA to get such an
understanding.  First, the paper examines the aggregate spending agendas of candidates supported
or opposed by the NEA.  This analysis gives a good overall view of the political ideology that we
would see in NEA's ideal Congress.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The paper then looks at two votes that have been of central concern to the NEA during the 104th
Congress: the NEA's District of Columbia property tax exemption and educational vouchers for
low-income Washington, D.C. children.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In all three cases, we cross-index contributions by NEA for and against members with their
records.  AdTI analyzed contributions to House races instead of Senate races since the patterns
for 435 House seats are more distinctive than for the 35 Senate seats up in 1994.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II. Spending Agendas of Candidates</strong>

<p>NEA-PAC, the political action committee of the National Education Association, contributed
money to 306 House races in the 1994 cycle.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> In 259 of those races, there were incumbents
running who thus had a legislative record in the 103rd Congress.  We can analyze the legislative
agendas established by those 259 members during the 103rd Congress to get a good idea of the
kind of Congress that NEA wants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>To achieve an understanding of the agenda of these members, AdTI used BillTally, a
computerized tracking system developed by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF)
that reports a cost estimate for every legislative proposal in each Congress.  The BillTally data
come from the Congressional Budget Office and similar sources.  Agenda totals for individual
members are developed by cross-indexing each member's sponsorship and cosponsorship records
with the cost estimates for the bills.  For this paper, the data for the 103rd Congress are used.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1994, NEA supported 206 candidates who were incumbents and thus had established a
legislative agenda during the 103rd Congress.  Those 206 members had an average agenda in the
103rd Congress to increase federal spending by $302.2 billion per year.  This represents <em>a 20%
increase in the size and scope of the federal government</em>.  NEA opposed 53 incumbents who ran
again.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> These members had a strikingly different profile -- they had legislative agendas during the
103rd Congress that would on average have cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="neapac1.gif" width="504" height="319" align="top" >

<p>We can conclude that if the NEA elected the Congress it wanted, annual federal spending would
radically increase.  This finding corresponds with earlier AdTI research on the NEA legislative
agenda which showed that if every idea that the NEA proposes in their <em>Legislative Program for
the 104th Congress </em>were adopted into law, federal spending would increase by $702 billion per
year.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> Clearly, NEA is supporting candidates who will effectuate the large increase in taxing and
spending proposed in their legislative agenda.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>III. Special Tax Break for NEA</strong>

<p>While NEA's ideal Congress would apparently radically increase spending, and either taxes or
deficits (paid for by future generations, i.e., America's children), there was one vote during the
104th Congress where NEA-supported members acted like fiscal conservatives and supported a
tax break.  Unfortunately, that tax break would only benefit NEA members -- it was to continue
their exemption from property taxes in the District of Columbia.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A special federal charter granted by Congress to the NEA (normally this special treatment is
reserved for non-political groups such as the Red Cross and Boy Scouts) allows the group to pay
no tax on its downtown Washington office building.  Recently renovated, the headquarters has an
assessed value of $65 million.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This special status was granted to the NEA in 1907, at a time when the group and American
education were entirely different, and it could truly be said that the NEA had simply a benevolent
or public purpose.  89 years later, both the NEA and American education have evolved
tremendously.  The change in the NEA was recognized by the IRS in 1978 when NEA was
reclassified as a labor union, a decision which was affirmed by a federal court a year later.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Last fall, in an amendment to the Washington, D.C. appropriations bill, the House voted on
whether to maintain this special break for the NEA.  The measure ultimately failed by a narrow
vote of 213-210.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> A vast majority of members who received 1994 NEA financial support (173
out of 176 -- 98%) voted to maintain the NEA's special tax break.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> Most other members
opposed it.  Among those who had 1994 campaigns where neither candidate received NEA-PAC
financing, 97 of 128 (76%) supported ending the special break.  Among members who had
opponents financed by the NEA, 110 of 119 (92%) supported eliminating the exemption.  The
chart below graphically presents the split in Congress.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><img src="neapac2.gif" width="601" height="352" align="top" >

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It seems clear that the NEA's expenditure of $2 million on House campaigns in 1994 was a good
investment and helped to protect the lucrative tax break which it enjoys every year, valued at $1.6
million according to the Washington, D.C. Department of Finance and Revenue.  Obviously,
NEA's failure to pay its share of property taxes has required city businesses and residents to make
up the difference.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>IV. Vouchers for Low-Income Kids?</strong>

<p>Another issue of central importance to the NEA in the 104th Congress has been the debate over
proposed vouchers for low-income children in the District of Columbia.  Like the NEA tax
exemption, the proposal was also voted on in the House as an amendment to the appropriations
bill for the District of Columbia.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> The vouchers were actually $3,000 scholarships that would be
made available to children of low-income D.C. residents to attend public, private, or parochial
schools anywhere in the greater Washington area.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> The amendment passed the House but
ultimately never became law because of opposition in the Senate and White House.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There was again great polarization on the vote on this issue between those House members
receiving NEA support and all other members.  162 out of 169 (96%) members who received
NEA contributions supported the NEA's position on vouchers for DC kids.  This contrasts sharply
with the members whose opponents were funded by the NEA -- 117 of 120 (98%) voted for the
vouchers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Paralleling the NEA tax exemption vote, the most objective members -- those with 1994 races
where NEA contributed to neither candidate --  opposed the NEA and strongly supported school
vouchers.  117 of 129 members (91%) who had no NEA money for or against them in 1994
supported vouchers.  This perhaps suggests that free from the influence of NEA money and left to
their own devices, members might support school vouchers.  But at least in the 104th Congress,
the NEA succeeded in continuing the denial of vouchers to low-income District residents.  <em>Again,
these are the same residents who have to pay more in property taxes because of NEA's special
exemption.</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="neapac3.gif" width="601" height="352" align="top" >

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>V. Conclusion</strong>

<p>The ideal Congress for the NEA would thus be very strongly opposed to choice and vouchers for
low-income children.  This has always been a central issue to the NEA and it is not surprising that
members who were financially backed by the union strongly opposed vouchers.  What is
interesting is our finding of overwhelming support for vouchers among all other members of
Congress.  Again, 91% of members who had no NEA money for or against them in 1994
supported vouchers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fiscally, NEA's ideal Congress would radically increase federal spending.  Despite NEA's pledge
of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it wanted, it would mean
either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on America's families or hundreds of billions of
dollars in deficits for future generations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Finally, regardless of the impact that an NEA Congress might have on America's kids, NEA
members can rest assured.  Despite a very big tax-and-spend agenda, NEA's ideal Congress would
still maintain the NEA's special property tax exemption.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">Foreword by U. S. Representative Joe Scarborough

<p>George Orwell once said, "We have sunk to a depth at which the restatement of the obvious is the
first duty of intelligent men."  That is the grand and dignified service that the Alexis de
Tocqueville Institution has rendered with this report.  It puts in concrete numbers that which
those of us who have worked on education issues in the Congress have long thought.  Namely,
that the National Education Association has an agenda that is quite extravagant, that does not
have much to do with education, and that is, like so many wish lists unconstrained by reality,
expensive.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If the Department of Education has become the mechanism by which local education dollars are
squandered, it is the National Education Association that has become the most prolific source of
ideas for squandering them.  Hence, the NEA's laundry list of legislative proposals ranging from
"Constitutional, Civil, and Human Rights Protection," to "Voting Reform," to what it terms the
"Preservation and Advancement of Good Public Policy."  Such subjects may be, at a time when
high schools are producing graduates who cannot read, distant from the concerns of the
educational community, but the NEA seems not to have noticed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Not noticing reality, however, is something that the NEA appears to have developed into a high
art, and this is where the AdTI report is most revealing.  According to the report, if the NEA's
proposals were adopted into law, federal spending would increase by $702 billion per year,
resulting in a new tax burden of $10,554 per year for a family of four.  Leave aside the deleterious
effects such spending and tax increases would have on the nation's economy and on the budget of
the average family, the point is that the public rendered its judgment on the size and scope of the
government it wants in the historic 1994 elections and there is no indication that it will be
changing its mind soon.  It seems that for the NEA, time stopped in 1965, or perhaps 1933, and
has not moved since.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>These facts would almost be funny were it not for this: the NEA claims to represent 2.2 million
teachers across the United States.  That is over two million individuals charged with the
responsibility of educating and of helping to shape the character of the nation's future voters.  To
the extent that the NEA's agenda fails to represent those teachers, it is marching under borrowed
banners.  To the extent that the NEA actually is representing its members' views, it is a measure of
the yawning chasm that has developed between the culture of the country and the culture of the
education establishment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The philosophy of the schoolroom in one generation will be the philosophy of the government in
the next,"  Lincoln said.  That is undoubtedly true and it is the reason why Dr. Berthoud's report
on the cost of the NEA's policy agenda is so important.  It has been well said that Americans need
to be summoned to an honest reckoning of the cost of our spending appetites.  The Alexis de
Tocqueville Institution deserves great credit for revealing just how expensive such an appetite can
be.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>I. Introduction</strong>

<p>The National Education Association (NEA) has long billed itself as an advocacy group for
education and not a union.  The NEA claims to be dedicated to the interests of children and
America's future.  However, a review of its <em>Legislative Program for the 104th Congress</em> reveals
that NEA's public policy agenda would be extremely costly for America's children.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II. The NEA Agenda</strong>

<p>The NEA <em>Legislative Program</em>, while representing the group's 2.2 million members,<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is actually
established by the NEA's Legislative Committee and then adopted by the annual Representative
Assembly.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> The program is broken into three tiers, divided according to the level and intensity of
NEA activity on the issue.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution has examined the NEA spending agenda, item by item, and
where possible ascribed a cost to each proposal.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> The primary tool used for this analysis has been
BillTally, a computerized tracking system developed by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation
(NTUF) that reports a cost estimate for every legislative proposal in each Congress.  The BillTally
data come from the Congressional Budget Office and similar sources.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For some items in the NEA agenda, no cost estimate was available, so they could not be included
in this report.  Hence, the numbers in this report <em>understate</em> the total cost of the NEA agenda.  All
cost estimates have been annualized, that is, they are expressed in terms of the average change in
spending in a single year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All told, if every idea that the NEA proposes were adopted into law, <em>federal spending would
increase by $702 billion per year</em>.  Table 1 summarizes its agenda.  The appendix to this paper
provides the detailed analysis used to arrive at the $702 billion total.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If this spending is financed by taxes, it would translate into an added burden of $10,554 per year
for a family of four.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> However, as will be argued below, the most likely outcome is that much of
this new spending will be financed by bigger federal deficits.  This would be ironic given NEA's
statements against deficits during the Reagan administration -- throughout those eight years, the
NEA made numerous pronouncements about the importance of deficit reduction and complained
that "record budget deficits" were responsible for squeezing critical programs.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

<p>The cost of this agenda can be put in perspective by comparing it to the costs of the agendas of
individual Members of Congress which the National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF)
establishes every Congress for each member.  By these standards, it is unprecedented.  Since
NTUF began recording this data, no member of Congress has ever had a spending agenda as large
as that proposed by NEA.  In other words, <em>the National Education Association's spending
agenda is more profligate than that of every single member of Congress since 1991</em>.

<p align="center"><strong>III. A Generational Perspective</strong>

<p>One of the most ironic aspects of the NEA agenda is the huge fiscal burden it imposes on future
generations.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> Despite NEA's claims to be an organization concerned first and foremost with
children, their legislative wish list has a strong bias in favor of today's retirees.  Perhaps this is not
surprising given that over 110,000 members of the NEA are retired.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Beyond the massive taxes and/or deficits that its agenda would bequeath to future generations,
NEA makes no effort at long-term entitlement reform.  In fact, the NEA agenda would exacerbate
the problem posed by entitlements for future generations by actually <em>increasing spending</em> on
today's beneficiaries.  Given the coming financing crisis for programs such as Social Security and
Medicare, these types of policies will clearly harm America's children.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For Medicare and Medicaid, NEA supports a system with "protected benefits" and opposes any
shift of costs to beneficiaries or "any new barrier to eligibility for benefits under Medicare."  It
also opposes "any means test for Medicare" which would limit benefits for the wealthiest
retirees.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For Social Security, NEA opposes reforms that many see as common sense, such as
means-testing.  Not only does NEA oppose increases in the age when benefits begin, but it
actually supports "reductions in the Social Security retirement age."  To put this position in
perspective, the Social Security retirement age is currently 65 and will slowly rise to 67 by the
year 2027.  By any demographic standard, even 67 is far too low.  If the retirement age had kept
pace with changes in life expectancy since the 1930s when Social Security was created, it would
be 76 today.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But the devastating impact of the NEA Social Security agenda becomes clear only when we total
the cost: the NEA would expand federal spending on Social Security by <em>$126.8 billion per year</em>. 
While this is a stunning figure, it is important to note that there are other items NEA supports for
which cost estimates could not be obtained that would otherwise have added tens of billions of
dollars annually to the cost of its Social Security agenda.  For example, NEA also supports
"improved Social Security benefits for participants, especially low-income workers, dependents
and survivors."  Thus, the $126.8 billion is a very conservative figure.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Table 3 presents one point of comparison.  For each dollar in new spending for children and
education that NEA proposes (over $24 billion annually -- not an insubstantial amount), it
advocates $5.24 in new spending on Social Security.

<p>NEA writes of its political clout, "NEA, with an average of nearly 5,000 members in each of the
nation's 435 congressional districts, is in a unique position to use at-home lobbying efforts to
advance the cause of public education and improve the status of security of Association
members."<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> It would appear that the latter concerns about the status of Association members far
outweigh concerns for the cause of public education.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>IV. More Federal Educational Dollars: Good Money After Bad?</strong>

<p>While the total amount of new spending that NEA proposes for children pales in comparison to
what it would like to spend on Social Security and other programs for the elderly, education
funding would still increase substantially.  99 percent ($24 billion) of the money listed under
"Children &amp; Education" in Table 3 is for increased federal education spending.  NEA is thus
advocating spending yet more federal dollars on education rather than enacting fundamental
reforms to solve the problems with America's schools.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Federal education spending in FY 1995 was $32.9 billion, which was 165 percent more than what
was spent in 1979 (29 percent more in real terms).<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> NEA would expand that by <em>73 percent</em>,
thereby furthering the federal role in education which has expanded markedly since the
Department of Education was created in October 1979.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEA would also thereby further increase spending per pupil, and while the United States has been
sinking in recent years in international comparison of educational outputs, inputs (spending) have
been on the rise and already tower over those in most other nations.  With the exception of
Switzerland, the United States spends more on education per student than any other country in
the world -- almost 50 percent more than Germany and 85 percent more than Japan.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> K-12 per
pupil spending, in inflation-adjusted terms, increased by 36.7% in the 1980's.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> The NEA agenda
would thus continue a trend of more spending and more Washington involvement in education,
thus obscuring the importance of the real reforms that are needed for America's schools.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>V. Funding the NEA Agenda: Taxes or Deficits?</strong>

<p>NEA's agenda would vastly expand the size and scope of American government.  As indicated
above, if NEA paid for its agenda today, it would cost the average family of four over $10,000
per year.  NEA states that it supports a tax system which will not only pay for this massive agenda
but which will also collect enough revenues to actually start paying down the national debt.  While
discussing the deficit and its budget policies, NEA notes that while it is not the only priority,
"reducing the federal budget deficit is a priority for the country."<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> But realistically, the likely
outcome of the NEA agenda would be even larger deficits than we have today, which would have
to be paid off by future American families.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are several reasons for this conclusion.  First, the NEA specifically rejects many ideas that
would help pay for its agenda.  For example, while NEA has a very expansive health care agenda,
it opposes ending or even limiting the tax exemption of employer-provided health care
benefits.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>And again, it specifically opposes many basic reforms of either the Social Security or
Medicare systems.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The second reason is simply politics.  It just is unrealistic to expect tax hikes of this magnitude to
be enacted.  The 1990 and 1993 budgets each raised taxes by several hundred billion dollars over
five years and both caused a tremendous outcry and voter rebellion in subsequent elections. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 1993 budget package raised $259 billion over
five years.  Over a five year time period, <em>the NEA agenda would require over thirteen times as
much money as was raised in taxes by the 1993 budget package.</em> Beyond the electoral
consequences of such a tax hike, the damage to the nation's economy would be overwhelming. 
The political impossibility is clear.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="neaage.gif" width="432" height="337" align="top" >

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Furthering this doubt that the NEA would actively champion and get enacted the trillions of
dollars in taxes needed to balance a budget reflecting NEA spending policies is its position that:
"NEA opposes any constitutional amendment imposing limitations on taxes or the federal
budget."<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> This statement reflects a long history of NEA opposition to a federal Balanced Budget
Amendment (BBA).  NEA, in fact, has been a leading opponent of the BBA.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> When the BBA
was debated in the House of Representatives in January 1995, the NEA claimed that a BBA,
"would have forced deep, across-the-board cuts to domestic programs leading to the elimination
of education."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The conclusion seems obvious.  Above and beyond an increase in taxation, enacting the NEA
legislative agenda would lead to massive deficits in America's future.  The NEA argues that
current efforts to balance the budget would be "cutting off our children's future."<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> An
examination of the <em>NEA Legislative Program for the 104th Congress</em> indicates that the charge
more accurately applies to its vision for America.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Appendix: Detailed Analysis of The NEA Legislative Agenda</strong>

<p>NEA's<em> Legislative Program for the 104th Congress</em> can be broken down into 22 discrete
categories.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> Cost estimates for proposals in each of these categories were obtained from
BillTally, a computerized tracking system developed by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation
(NTUF) that reports a cost estimate for every bill in each Congress.  The NEA proposals were
matched to bills with an equivalent purpose.  The BillTally cost figures come from the
Congressional Budget Office and similar sources.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All cost estimates represent the annual change in federal spending for each proposal.  Thus, the
figures for each of the 22 sections represent not the total spending that NEA wants for that areas,
but the annual incremental change.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Care was taken to eliminate double counting, that is, where the NEA agenda repeated itself, these
costs were not counted twice.  Also, every effort was made not to use a bill whose purposes
duplicated those of another bill used elsewhere in this study or use a bill which had some section
later enacted into law.  It is important to note that the cost of many ideas has never been
estimated, and in those cases the particular items are not listed.  Because of the magnitude of the
probable cost of items not included, even if all double-counting was not completely eliminated,
the total cost figures of this paper are conservative.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>1. Increased Federal Funding for Education</strong>

<p>NEA supports two types of added funding for Elementary-Secondary Education.  First, NEA
supports a program of general aid to state and local educational agencies.  Second, NEA supports
categorical assistance to local education agencies for special programs.  The total cost for both
parts of this section of the NEA agenda is conservatively estimated at $5,640 million.

<p>A single-payer scheme creates a system of total government control over health care.  As in
Canada, the federal government would collect the funds for health care and pay all the bills (hence
the name "single-payer").  The federal government would decide the total amount that could be
spent on health care.  States would administer plans, but under tight constraints from Washington. 
Medicare and Medicaid would be combined into the new system and private sector insurance
would  be virtually eliminated.  The estimated cost for a single-payer health care system is

<p align="center"><strong>13. Social Security</strong>

<p>As with Medicare and Medicaid, NEA again does not advocate any reductions in Social Security
spending, despite the fact that most current retirees are receiving benefits two to five times greater
than the actuarial value of what they and their employers put in.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a> Rather than trimming benefits,
the NEA advocates <em>increasing</em> spending on Social Security.  There can hardly be any action more
damaging to the nation's children than adding this type of fiscal burden to America's future
generations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>By way of background, the spending growth in Social Security has truly been phenomenal over
the past 45 years.  In 1950, Social Security represented about one percent of the federal budget. 
Today, it represents about 25 percent.  And were it not for Social Security, federal outlays as a
percent of GNP would today just about equal what they were in 1950.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Combined with other programs, Social Security has meant a tremendous diversion in resources
towards elderly Americans.  Per capita federal spending on the elderly in FY 1990 amounted to
$11,466 compared to a scant $1,020 for those under age eighteen -- including education.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> The
United States spends five times as much per capita on social welfare spending for the elderly as
we do for the non-elderly.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Contrary to popular belief, individuals don't have a special Social Security account containing the
money that they paid in.  Instead, Social Security has always operated on a "pay-as-you-go"
system whereby benefits paid out today come from today's workers and families.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees, just to maintain the current
level of benefits, the Social Security and Medicare combined payroll taxes will have to jump from
16.5% to an astonishing 30.5% in 2025, under intermediate projections, and to 43.0% under
high-cost projections.  Keep in mind that recent trends have placed the U.S. economy closer to
the Trustees' more pessimistic high-cost assumptions than their intermediate assumptions.

<p>Total new spending proposed by the NEA in this section comes to $126,760 million.  The
specifics include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ol>
  <li>NEA supports a complete repeal of the so-called "Social Security Notch Adjustment."</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Cost: $100,000 million</li>
    <li>Source:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Social Security Administration.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Notes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The notch adjustment ended a windfall for retirees born between 1917 - 1926
who received double, and in some cases triple, inflation adjustments to their base
Social Security payments.  In the 1970s, Congress shut off the spigot, indexing
benefits to the rate all other Social Security recipients received.  Consequently,
retirees in this cohort revolted under what they perceived as an unfair "reduction"
in benefits, even though their Social Security checks grew as fast as inflation! 
Roy Ferguson, an actuary who works in the Office of the Actuary at the Social
Security Administration, estimates total repeal of the "notch" at an astonishing $1
trillion over the next ten years, or $100 billion a year.</li>
      <li>Like other current recipients of Social Security, even without the adjustment
repeal, the "notch babies"  are still getting far more in benefits than what they
paid into the system.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>NEA supports "repeal of the spousal offset under Social Security."</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Cost: $640 million</li>
    <li>Source:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>HR 1674, 103rd Congress.  According to the Social Security Administration, the

    <li>Cost: $1,520 million</li>

    <ol>
      <li>CBO.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Notes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>This is the estimate for repeal of the earnings test, the point where working
beneficiaries over sixty-five give up one dollar in Social Security benefits for
every three dollars they earn from other sources. Social Security is a retirement
benefit, not a welfare program for those who chose to continue working past the
retirement age.  Since the inception  of the Social Security program, the earnings
test has been an integral part in maintaining the retirement characteristic of Social
Security.  The benefit is not, nor was it ever intended to be, a wage supplement.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>NEA supports "reductions in the Social Security retirement age."</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Cost: $24,600 million</li>
    <li>Source:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>This figure is derived by using the inverse of the budgetary <em>savings</em> that have
been calculated to accrue from speeding up the currently scheduled increase in
the retirement age to 67.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> The savings figure is the budgetary impact in the
ninth outyear which is not the full impact and thus is conservative (by the 11th
year, when the change is nearly fully implemented, the savings exceed $35
billion).  Given the ambiguous nature of NEA's statement, we opted for a
conservative estimate of the budgetary impact.  The actual impact could be much
larger.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>This is also a conservative estimate since deaths of potential recipients
between the ages of 63 and 67 would mean that lowering the retirement
age would add more beneficiaries than raising it would eliminate.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Notes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>While it certainly sounds nice, as most Americans would like to retire early, such
a policy would lay a heavy burden on future generations.  The Social Security
retirement age is currently 65 and will slowly rise to 67 by the year 2027.  In fact,
by any demographic standard, today's retirement age is far too low, not too high. 
If retirement age had kept pace with changes in life expectancy since the 1930s
when Social Security was created, it would be 76 today.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a></li>
      <li>While most other western industrialized nations have moved to <em>raise</em> the
retirement age as their populations live longer, the NEA would have the U.S. go
the other direction.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>It is important to note that there are several items on the NEA Social Security agenda which also
cost substantial amounts of money but for which there are no cost estimates.  These items include:

<ol>
  <li>NEA supports "improved Social Security benefits for participants, especially low-income
workers, dependents and survivors."</li>
  <li>NEA supports "meaningful survivor/disability benefits for minor surviving children under the
care of parents, grandparents, or other custodial adults."</li>
  <li>NEA supports "Social Security benefit equity for men and women through earnings sharing
and/or benefit changes."</li>
  <li>NEA supports "restoration of the dependents' education allowance under Social Security."</li>
</ol>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEA also opposes modest reforms that have been proposed by very responsible organizations. 
The proposals, which could save billions of dollars, include:

<ol>
  <li>Means-testing Social Security.  NEA supports "Social Security as social insurance, not welfare
or a 'means-tested' program."</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Savings: $45.7 billion to $222.1 billion</li>
    <li>Source:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>CBO estimate.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Notes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Means-testing Social Security -- reducing benefits to upper-income retirees --
would achieve significant budgetary savings and help ensure the actuarial
soundness of the program.  Interestingly,  the NEA states it supports, "protection
of the solvency of the Social Security system through an actuarially sound tax
base that maintains the integrity of the Social Security trust fund and through use
of general revenues, if necessary."  </li>
      <li>What the NEA supports is the continuation of what has become a windfall for all
retirees, but particularly upper-income beneficiaries.</li>
      <li>Over 20% of Social Security benefits go to people with incomes over $50,000. 
This group of well-off Americans collected $115 billion from the federal
government in 1992.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>NEA opposes "any reductions in Social Security benefits, including limits on annual COLA
adjustments."</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Savings: Limiting Social Security COLA's to 2/3's of CPI would save $11.24 billion
annually.</li>
    <li>Notes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>This is a very moderate reform that has been proposed by many analysts as one
way to limit the tremendous growth in Social Security.  The modesty of this
proposal can be seen by virtue of the fact that private pension plans offset only
about 30 percent of the effects of inflation.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a></li>
      <li>Reducing COLA adjustments even by very slight amounts can save billions of
dollars.</li>

<p align="center"><strong>15. Taxation</strong>

<p>Since this paper analyzes the cost of the spending agenda of the NEA, adding in its taxation
agenda would be double-counting, because its tax agenda is, in a sense, the mirror image of its
spending agenda.  Thus, no tax changes are thus included in the aggregate figures of this paper. 
Still, there are several interesting aspects to the way in which the NEA advocates raising the
revenue to pay for its spending agenda.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEA supports a whole host of new exemptions and deductions for taxpayers.  Most significantly,
NEA champions exclusion from federal taxation of state and local sales taxes.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> Providing
exemptions of state and local taxes makes those taxes less burdensome and makes it easier for
other levels of governments to raise them.  Simply put, the exclusion helps advocates of bigger
government at the state and local level further their agendas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Other new tax breaks that NEA supports include various tax exemptions for education
expenditures, expansion of home office deduction provisions, and expansion of employee benefit
tax deductions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NEA does, however, favor ending some tax breaks, which could save money.  NEA supports
eliminating tax benefits to organizations that promote hatred.  Although constitutionally dubious,
the vague nature of the proposal precludes estimating how much revenue this would raise.  NEA
also supports eliminating "unfair tax loopholes or giveaways such as tax abatement and foreign
trade zones that reduce revenues and shelter corporations and high-income individuals from
paying taxes."<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It is also worth noting that NEA opposes tuition tax credits at the elementary, secondary, or
postsecondary levels.  Similarly, NEA opposes vouchers or certificates in education.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a> Over the
past decade, NEA legislative activity has peaked when fighting these types of public policy
proposals.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>No matter what cost or savings come from the creation and elimination of these various tax
provisions, the bottom line of the NEA spending agenda will be hundreds of billions of dollars in
new taxes for Americans.  NEA writes that it supports, "a tax system that provides for education
and other social needs while achieving reduction of the national debt."<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a> To enact the spending
agenda discussed in other sections of this paper would require in the aggregate an enormous
increase in revenues.  Given the public disapproval of the huge (but by comparison far more
limited) tax increases enacted in 1993, it seems unlikely that the NEA would get its wish for taxes
to be raised enough to pay for its massive new spending agenda.  Thus, the most likely casualty of
NEA's agenda would be federal finances -- besides huge tax increases, further deficits and debt are
almost guaranteed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Furthering this doubt that the NEA would actively champion and get enacted the trillions of
dollars in taxes needed to balance a federal budget that reflects the NEA's spending agenda is its
position that: "NEA opposes any constitutional amendment imposing limitations on taxes or the
federal budget."<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> This opposition to any constitutional limitation on the federal budget can
probably be interpreted as opposition to a federal Balanced Budget Amendment.

<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong>

<p>Our August 28 study of the Dole school choice proposal found that there was at least $5 billion in
expenditures from the U.S. Department of Education's Fiscal Year 1996 budget that would be
better spent on publicly-financed scholarship programs.  The recent adoption of the U.S.
Department of Education's Fiscal Year 1997 budget has raised this figure to over $5.4 billion. 
<u>Most notably, there has been over a 13 percent increase in spending on 25 programs that in large
part benefit teachers, bureaucracies, students that are not poor, or that are a relatively small
supplement to existing state and local programs</u>.   

<p>The Dole proposal calls for providing $2.5 billion in federal money to allow four million children
to attend the public, parochial, or private school of their parents' choice.  The $5 billion identified
in our August 28 report included $2.6 billion in 27 federal programs meeting the above
description that could be eliminated (two of the programs, albeit small ones, were in fact
discontinued).  In addition, $2.4 billion could be saved from Title I expenditures that would no
longer be necessary if 2.5 million children left the public schools for private ones under the Dole
initiative.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For Fiscal Year 1997, the $5.4 billion in potential savings is comprised of $2.9 billion that would
be realized from eliminating programs and $2.5 billion that would be offset from Title I spending.

<p>These figures gain added significance when examined against $5.25 million that is being spent by
the state of Ohio to enable 2,000 poor children in Cleveland to attend private schools this year. 
6,000 students sought these scholarships.  Like many cities, the problems of Cleveland's schools
are daunting.  Only seven percent of Cleveland public high school students will graduate with 12th
grade scholastic proficiency, about the same number who each year are victims of crime in the
school system.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The U.S. Department of Education is spending nearly as much money on a literacy program for
prisoners as Ohio is spending on scholarships.  In addition, the Department will spend 93 times as
much money on the Goals 2000 program, under which money is appropriated to bureaucracies,
not individual schools.  At nearly 60 times the Cleveland scholarship initiative, the Eisenhower
Professional Development Program will receive $310 million for "professional development
activities in the core academic subjects to help ensure that teachers, administrators and other staff
have access to sustained and intensive high-quality professional development."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Additional Savings from Title I Program Offsets</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Title I program primarily provides federal funds based on the number of children from
low-income families, to local educational agencies.  If a substantial number of children leave the
public school system because of a scholarship program, there can be a proportional reduction in
Title I aid without negatively impacting those students who remain in the public school system.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to the federal Department of Education, the Title I program serves seven million
children.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> If two and a half million children were to enroll in private schools under the Dole or a
like-minded scholarship proposal, this would reduce the number of children needing Title I
assistance by 35.7 percent, or $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1997 compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal
year 1996.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Title I funding, it should be noted, rose by 6.8% in the current budget.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Recent Comments on School Choice</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When asked about the Dole school choice initiative at the National Press Club in early September,
the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley responded, "Well, the idea of spending public tax
dollars for private school vouchers I think is a real mistake and I thought that for years."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This comment is not surprising given the Administration's past statements and the fact that the
teacher unions, two of the Administration's strongest political allies, have been perennially and
fiercely opposed to all publicly-financed school choice measures.  While Secretary Riley then
addressed specifics of the Dole proposal, his initial remarks appear to also encompass state- and
locally-sponsored choice programs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What is surprising, however, are comments that President Clinton made in the October 3 debate
with Bob Dole.  While discussing his opposition to a federal school choice proposal such as Dole
has offered, Clinton said:  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"I support school choice.  I support school choice ... But if you're going to have a private voucher
plan, that ought to be determined by states and localities where they're raising and spending most
of the money."<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The President later added:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"If a local school district in Cleveland, or anyplace else, wants to have a private school choice
plan, like Milwaukee did, let them have at it."<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The President's support, to be sure, is limited to public school choice.  In cities with systemic
problems, like Cleveland, the benefits would be limited and less immediate.  And while the
President now seems content to stay out of local and state-wide scholarship/voucher debates, this
has not always been the case.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, in an October 1993 speech to the AFL-CIO convention the President spoke out
against a state-wide voucher proposition that was on the ballot in California.  <em>The Los Angeles
Times</em> noted, "Clinton's direct involvement in the school voucher issue is unusual, given that
presidents generally stay out of such state matters and that many statewide officials -- most
notably California Gov. Pete Wilson -- have not yet taken a stand on the question."<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 

<p>As school choice seems likely to be discussed much more at the federal, state, and local levels in
the near future, it should be kept in mind that this is not a new or radical concept.  Virtually all
western democracies permit much more freedom of choice in their schooling arrangements than
does the United States.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> Several teacher unions in other countries also support school choice.  

<p>These issues are addressed in AdTI's recently issued study, "Teacher Union 'Concentration' in 21
Countries" and an upcoming study specifically about the range of school choice in industrialized
nations.  

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The current Department of Education budget takes a business as usual approach with regard to
the federal policy on helping poor children at troubled schools.  It significantly increases spending
on federal programs that at best only provide indirect assistance.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Publicly financed scholarship programs, by contrast, would allow a low-income parent the
opportunity to select a private, public, or parochial school that would immediately improve their
child's education.  It is incumbent upon the advocates of the status quo -- most notably the teacher
unions and the Education Department -- to explain why spending on non-essential federal
education programs should be increased by over 13% while troubled children, like those in
Cleveland, receive no direct assistance via publicly-financed scholarships.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Making Choices:  A Review of Options for Financing </strong></h3>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Bob Dole's School Choice Initiative</strong></h3>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>By:  Gregory A. Fossedal and Paul F. Steidler</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In reviewing Bob Dole's recently announced "opportunity scholarships" program, expenditures of
the U.S. Department of Education, and trends in the school choice debate, several findings are
notable.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>Though the Dole campaign has avoided giving specifics, there are at least $5.0 billion in
expenditures from the current Department of Education budget (Fiscal Year 1996) that would
more directly and immediately benefit poor children if used to sponsor a scholarship program,
or that would no longer be necessary if the scholarship program was enacted.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>More than half the savings, $2.6 billion, would come from programs that in large part benefit
teachers, bureaucracies, students that are not poor, or that are a relatively small supplement to
existing state and local programs.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Savings from the Department of Education's management expenses could lead to additional
savings above the $5 billion.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>While critics of the Dole proposal might charge that it is inconsistent with his call for local
control of education and abolition of the Department of Education, such conclusions are
debatable.  The growing appeal of school choice, and its immense potential in the future, has
up to now been largely thwarted by powerful, special interest teacher unions.  Thus, the Dole
proposal's central function might be to serve as the catalyst of school choice, rather than the
largest or central purveyor of it.    </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>Under the proposal, scholarships would be provided for up to four million low- and
middle-income elementary and secondary school students.  The program would allow parents to
choose public, private, or parochial schools for their children and would be funded through an
annual $2.5 billion federal grant program matched by $2.5 billion in state funds.  Up to 15 states
and the District of Columbia could participate in the competitive, demonstration program which
would run from Fiscal Years 1997-2000.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>I.  Introduction</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The maximum $2.5 billion in annual demonstration federal scholarships that Senator Dole has
proposed would be broken down as follows.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Scholarships would be $1,000 per child in K-8 schools, with $500 coming from the federal
government and $500 from the state.  For high school students, the scholarships would be $1,500,
with $750 coming from both the federal and state governments.  Private donations could be made
on top of these funds.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In announcing the program, the Dole campaign noted, "This new $2.5 billion federal commitment
to America's children is budget neutral and would not increase the federal deficit.  The funding
offsets include:  eliminating the Goals 2000 program, reducing Department of Education
overhead, bureaucracy and wasteful spending; and adopting certain program terminations and
reductions called for in the Clinton Administration's budget proposals."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The stated aim of the Dole proposal is to help poor children go to better schools.  Both sides in
the school choice debate agree that inner-city public schools have serious problems.  According to
Keith Geiger, outgoing President of the National Education Association, inner-city public schools
"are absolutely terrible -- they ought to be blown up."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Overall federal education expenditures are quite substantial, especially when compared to the $2.5
billion Dole scholarship proposal.  The Department of Education's appropriations are expected to
total approximately $29.4 billion in fiscal year 1996.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Other departments and agencies also spend
considerable amounts on education.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics,
federal support for education was an estimated $100.1 billion in Fiscal Year 1995.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>II. Options for Paying for the Program </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The aim of any choice program is to immediately place poor children in a much better school, one
that parents believe will provide an improved education here and now.  In a book about
Milwaukee's pioneering publicly financed private school choice experiment that began in 1990,
author Dan McGroarty makes clear that low-income parents have championed school choice
because of a "simple and strong desire to do right by their children."<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The results of the Milwaukee program are quite impressive.  A recent study co-authored by Paul
Peterson of Harvard University's Program in Education Policy and Governance and Jay Greene of
the University of Houston found that after three and four years in the Milwaukee choice program,
reading scores of low-income minority students receiving scholarships/vouchers were,
respectively, an average of three and five percentage points higher than those of comparable
public-school students.  Math scores were five and 12 points higher for third- and fourth-year
students respectively.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>By contrast, nationwide per pupil spending, in inflation-adjusted terms, has increased by 30%
since 1983.  However, SAT scores have remained basically flat, rising a mere 1.0 percent, and
actually declining in 23 states.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Against this backdrop it should be noted that many federal education programs can at best only be
said to indirectly help poor students.  Indeed, there are many programs that primarily benefit
teachers as well as students that are not poor or that supplement existing state or local programs
which provide the preponderance of spending.  The federal share of expenditures to elementary
and secondary educational institutions, in fact, was under nine percent in Fiscal Year
1995.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>Funds for the programs may also be provided based on who writes the best grant
proposal, rather than on where there is the greatest need.     

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following chart illustrates some specific programs, all from the Department of Education, and
their Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> The value of each program, particularly when  compared
to a direct scholarship for a poor child, is highly questionable.  Some, such as a program to help
law students gain experience, are simply absurd. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A description of the programs can also be found in Appendix A.

<p>College Fine Arts Center    $    3.7 million

<p>Total:   $2.607 billion

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This $2.6 billion, it should be noted, did not include any reductions in some politically sensitive
areas nor from department management expenditures.  This includes:  Title I funds
(Compensatory Education for the Disadvantaged -- Local Funds, FY 1996 appropriation $6.7
billion)<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>, Collegiate Student Financial Assistance, including Pell grants, (FY 1996 appropriation
$4.9 billion)<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and management funds for the Department of Education, (FY 1996 appropriation
$417.5 million)<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>.  In these three areas alone the Department has been provided over $12.0
billion in new budget (obligational) authority in Fiscal Year 1996.  There are significant savings
that could be obtained here and elsewhere.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>III. Title I Program</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Title I program, for example, primarily provides federal funds based on the number of
children from low-income families, in each county, to local education agencies.  If a substantial
number of children leave the public school system because of the scholarship program,  there can
be a proportional reduction in Title I aid without negatively impacting those students who remain
in the public school system.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to the Department of Education, the Title I program serves seven million children.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> If
we assume that two and a half million poor children enroll in private schools under the Dole
scholarship program, this would reduce the number of children needing Title I assistance by 35.7
percent.  A corresponding reduction in Title I spending would amount to $2.4 billion, while
providing the same per capita amount of aid to those students who remain in the public schools.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are indications that other substantial savings could be found by revising Title I.  For
example, the fifteen richest counties in the U.S. will receive over $56 million this year in Title I
funds (see chart).<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> 

<p>In addition, the nation's five wealthiest states as measured by per capita income -- Alaska,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Maryland -- are receiving a total of 

<p>$273 million in Title I money in the current fiscal year.   Given the financial strength of these
counties and states, one can question the amount of Title I aid they are receiving.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Helping Those in Need?</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The 15 wealthiest counties in the U.S. will receive over $56 million this year from the U.S.
Department of Education's Title I program.  Money is granted to "local educational agencies"
based "primarily" on the number of low-income families in each county.  Given that the vast
majority of education spending is already paid for by local taxpayers, as well as the counties'
significant resources, it is highly questionable whether these areas truly need these funds.  A list of
the counties and the amounts they will receive in Fiscal Year 1996 follows.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Total:  $56,054,704

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>IV. Department Management</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>An always tempting target (and one that Bob Dole cited) to call for cutting is the education
bureaucracy's administrative costs.  There undoubably are significant savings here, though we
have omitted them from the $5 billion calculation.     

<p>In Fiscal Year 1996 the Department of Education has a $417.5 million department management
budget.  (One questionable expenditure, in light of the needs of poor children, is the appropriation
of $7 million in Fiscal Year 1996 to renovate the Department's headquarters. The money can be
spent over a three year period.)     

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Assuming that the Department is managed as efficiently as possible, the transfer of two million
students to non-public schools would reduce the overall population of public elementary,
secondary, and post-secondary students by 3.4 percent.  A 3.4 percent reduction in the
Department's management budget would amount to $14.2 million.  If  the assume that the
Department is not managed as efficiently as possible (i.e. it could benefit from a reengineering),
and that it would have less to manage based on the above cuts, the savings in Department
management expenses could be significantly higher.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>V. Federalism and Related Issues </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Dole demonstration proposal raises some obvious questions, specifically:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>Is it consistent with Bob Dole's views about the federal role in education?</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Does the federal government need to become involved in school choice?  Should it?  If so, how
extensive should its role be? </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>The scholarship program, as we have noted, does not preclude significant overall reductions in
federal education spending, not to mention the myriad of accompanying regulations and mandates. 
At the same time, school choice proposals have been growing rapidly and can be expected to stay
part of many cities' and states' debates on education for some time.  Thus, it is conceivable that
the Dole initiative could serve as the catalyst for school choice programs and transition these
programs over to states after the year 2000. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We elaborate on these inter-related issues below.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In opposing the creation of the U.S. Department of Education in 1979, Senator Dole stated, "The
business of educating our students must be done close to home, close to the providers of
revenues, and close to the students who reflect the educational process.  Parents, teachers,
students, and administrative officials should all participate in the process."<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> This was reiterated
recently when his campaign noted he "supports local control of education, school choice and
eliminating the Department of Education."<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While the Dole proposal would establish a federal scholarship program, it also comes on the heels
of proposals considered in an increasing number of states over the past two years, including such
large ones as California, Texas, Connecticut, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  Union
opposition has been viewed as a significant factor in defeating or stonewalling these measures.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The issue, however, has inherent and lasting appeal.  In addition to the aspirations of low-income
parents, a growing number of state officials recognize that students in troubled areas can be
educated in private schools often at less than half the per pupil expenditure in public schools.  This
thus saves the taxpayers a significant amount, while allowing the student to attend a school his or
her parents have judged to be superior.  A win-win situation is created for students, parents, and
budget conscious legislators.  The losers are teacher unions who feel a threat to their oligopoly in
providing education.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The unions unrivaled financial and organization strength compared with these groups, has been
pivotal to their winning most of the battles in the school choice debate.  In fact, the largest
teachers union, the National Education Association, has 1,500 field organizers.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Some specific examples of the unions' influence are noteworthy:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>Bill Clinton, after initially praising the Milwaukee school choice program, later reversed his
position in what appears to have been an obvious attempt to obtain the endorsement of the
National Education Association<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>;  </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Teacher unions have been involved in numerous lawsuits to stop school choice programs in
Milwaukee and Cleveland, the two major cities where fledgling choice programs have been
established; </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Vehement teacher union opposition to a scholarship program was a primary obstacle in holding
up the District of Columbia's entire Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations bill.  As <em>U.S. News &amp;
World Report</em> noted, "The Senate sank an aid package for the nearly bankrupt District of
Columbia government, essentially because one part of the plan could have given some poor
D.C. parents vouchers or scholarships for children to attend private schools .... the pressure
(from the NEA) was so intense that the Democrats preferred   </li>
</ul>

<p>'a looming crisis of Congress's own making' as <em>The Washington Post</em> put it, rather than  keep alive
the possibility that some poor Washington children might be able to attend  nonpublic school."<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>Approximately one out of eight delegates at the 1992 Democratic convention was a member of
the NEA.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> A similar if not greater representation is expected at this year's convention.      </li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>The NEA is the largest and richest American union, with 2.2 million members and an estimated
$785 million in revenues.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>The Dole proposal might thus provide one way to help level the playing field in this emerging
public policy debate. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another reason the trend toward school choice does not appear likely to abate soon is that the
traditional approach of government control of all facets of education is coming under increased
scrutiny.  In a recent report, the prestigious investment firm Lehman Brothers noted, 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The shift we see (in public education) is a system going from a government-run  monopoly with
little accountability and, by definition, no competition, to a market-driven system that competes
on price and quality ...  we are certain that the traditional way that  education and childcare have
been delivered and funded will continue to change, and   there is no going back."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>It adds:    

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The Education Industry represents the final frontier of a number of sectors once  dominated by
public control that have generally failed to achieve the standards of quality  and cost effectiveness
that were originally intended.  These industries have either voluntarily or forcibly (in response to
external pressure) opened themselves up entrepreneurial innovation and public/private
restructuring."<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>VI. Conclusion</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Dole proposal is an ambitious undertaking as it would aid many students and provide impetus
to the burgeoning school choice movement nationwide.  There is a ample room to fund the
program through reductions in existing Department of Education programs which are not directed
at poor children.  Additional savings could be realized by reducing federal programs that are no
longer necessary because poor children are attending private schools.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Federal involvement in the demonstration program would counter the tremendous power of the
teacher unions whose opposition has largely helped thwart school choice proposals to date.  The
overall appeal of school choice, and general trends in American education, might make the federal
role in this program temporary and truly of a demonstration nature.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Description of Select Federal Education Programs</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Goals 2000:  </strong>A program that provides grants to support state and local education improvement
efforts to help all students reach challenging academic standards.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> The program provides money
to fund bureaucracies, not individual schools, and imposes expensive mandates on states and
localities.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>School to Work Opportunities:</strong> States use grants to establish partnerships representing
education, industry, and labor and to develop new assessments and accountability procedures for
their school-to-work systems.  This program does little to benefit students -- it primarily funds
states bureaucracies and duplicates many programs already operated by the states.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Impact Aid:</strong> Provides financial assistance to school districts affected by federal activities, the
presence of tax-exempt federal property and/or federally connected children.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> The program was
established during World War II to relieve the sudden financial pressure on school districts in
which enrollment increased sharply because of an influx of relocated military personnel.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a> The
program is thus based on the premise that military bases and other facilities are a "cost" for local
communities, a peculiar argument in light of many communities' recent opposition to having
defense bases closed in their areas.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Eisenhower Professional-Development Program:</strong> A program that is designed to improve
education through "professional development activities in the core academic subjects to help
ensure that teachers, administrators and other staff have access to sustained and intensive
high-quality professional development."<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Law Schools Clinical Experience Program:  </strong>Provides grants and contracts to accredited law
schools to help fund up to 90 percent of the cost of continuing, expanding and establishing
programs to provide clinical experience for law students.<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Inexpensive Book Distribution:  </strong>Supports the distribution of books to children from birth
through high school.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

<p><strong>Education for Native Hawaiians:</strong> Funds provide supplemental education services to Native
Hawaiians.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> To the extent that native Hawaiians already meet the eligibility criteria that are
applied to all citizens, they are already eligible to participate in existing federal and state
programs.

<p><strong>Ellender Fellowships:</strong> Provides a grant to the Close-Up Foundation to promote knowledge and
understanding of the federal government through fellowships to low-income students and their

videos, and educational media for persons who are hearing impaired; provides transcribed tapes
and cassettes of textbooks and other educational publications and materials.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>

activities for vocational teachers and academic teachers working with vocational education
students, including corrections educators and counselors and educators and counselors in

promote excellence in teaching.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>

the special educational needs of gifted and talented students.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a>

with funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities as well as private foundations.  The

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p align="center"><strong>Foreword by U. S. Representative Steve Chabot</strong>

<p>The difference between what supporters promised at the time the federal Department of
Education was created and what actually has emerged as bureaucratic reality is the difference
between dreamy fiction and dismaying fact.  <em>Who Got It Right?</em> pulls together some fascinating
evidence on the subject.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now, it's not always easy for those of us whose prognostications are preserved in print to see our
words reexamined after time has passed -- but I just can't summon much sympathy for DoEd
proponents, because I simply cannot understand how anyone ever could have imagined that a
federal Department wouldn't grow, that it wouldn't squander valuable education dollars, or that it
wouldn't impose real burdens on local communities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Those education advocates who opposed creation of the Department were far closer to the mark. 
Indeed, Representative Pat Schroeder (with whom, it is safe to say, I do not always agree) seems
to have had it right.  Dr. Berthoud quotes her as warning: "No matter what anyone says, the
Department of Education will . . . meddle in everything.  I do not want that."  Nor do I, nor do
parents across the country.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a former school teacher and as the father of two schoolchildren, I am committed to improving
the quality of education in this country.  That goal will be accomplished best, I believe, by
eliminating the federal Department and restoring control to parents, teachers, and local
communities.  To that end, I have been proud to work with Representatives Joe Scarborough and
John Boehner in drafting the Back to Basics Education Reform Act, a bill that has attracted wide
support in the House and across the land.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The very pro-education Governor of Ohio, George Voinovich, wants the federal Department
eliminated because its "highly prescriptive and heavily regulated" programs are "substituting
Washington's judgments for those of the states, communities, and families.  This
micromanagement often imposes burdensome mandates on local communities, which can least
afford the intrusion."  That hard truth is very different from the wildly wrong prediction of the
(Republican!) Representative quoted within who claimed in 1979 that the federal Department
"does not create a new education bureaucracy.  In fact, it reduces the bureaucracy."  The
Congressman's claim may never have made much sense, but contrast it with Governor Voinovich's
report today that, "a recent Ohio study determined that a local school may have to submit as many
as 170 federal reports totalling more than 700 pages during a single year, consuming vital
resources without any improvement in the quality of education children receive."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This retrospective analysis is very helpful as we again confront the issue of whether local schools
are helped or hindered by the bureaucratic federal Department.  The research also provides a
useful reminder that even the best intended public policy forays frequently fall victim to the
hazards of unintended but nevertheless predictable adverse consequences.

<p align="center"><strong>Introduction</strong>

<p>"The creation of this department is a response, by both the president and the Congress, to one
specific organization, the National Education Association.  The NEA represents many, but not all,
of the people who are employed by public school systems.  It is always questionable policy to
establish a large public agency whose constituency is the same people whose work that agency
oversees." <em>Washington Post</em>editorial, 1979<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While the original fight over the creation of the Department of Education was one of the most
heated political controversies of 1979, after a short period much of the debate died away.  The
recent resurgence in concern about Washington encroaching on the prerogatives of state and local
governments has raised anew the debate about the Department's existence.  Opponents have
argued that the Department is an expensive failure that has added paperwork and bureaucracy but
little value to the nation's classrooms.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As the above quote from the <em>Washington Post</em> indicates, it is quite interesting and often surprising
to go back in public records to find out what was said about particular legislative action -- what
were the purposes of a given bill and what were the expectations for that bill?  This paper
examines the promises of supporters and the concerns of opponents that were aired during the
debate 16 years ago over the establishment of the Department of Education.  Then it makes an
assessment of what has occurred since the Department's creation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The main findings are that supporters substantially over-promised on the benefits of a separate
department and failed to acknowledge many potential problems.  On the other hand, opponents
were right on target in terms of many of their fears.  The contrasting projections came in six key
areas: 1) benefits for school children; 2) overhead &amp; bureaucracy; 3) efficiency; 4) local control;
5) cost; and 6) values.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>I. Benefits for School Children</strong>

<p align="center"><em>What Supporters Promised . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Representative Jack Brooks, (D-TX) one of the lead sponsors of the bill in the House, argued
that a separate department, "will enable us to better serve 100 million men, mothers, fathers,
parents, children, and teachers."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Elliott Levitas (D-GA) argued that a separate department would mean,
"stronger and better educational opportunity for the boys and girls and the young men and
women in America.  There is no question about that."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Speaker of the House Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill (D-MA) stated, "We need a special Department
of Education.  We are doing it in the best interests of ourselves, of our children, and of our
Nation's educational future."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>What Opponents Predicted . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Senator S. I. Hayakawa (R-CA, and former President of San Francisco State College)
passionately argued, "Senator Moynihan and I have joined in opposing this bill.  We have both
been teachers for a long time.  But it appears that our colleagues would rather listen to the
unfounded pleas of people who know only that there are problems in our schools today, but
who do not know how to solve them.  Having this new department is rather like grasping at
straws.  We see there is a problem and attempt to solve it by creating a new department.  I
wish someone would tell me how this new department is going to make our children literate? 
Or how it will erase the violence that has erupted in our schools?  Or how it will ensure that
we get what we pay for with our tax dollars?  Or how it will make our children better prepared
for their futures?"<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) observed, "This is back-room deal, born out of a
squalid politics.  Everything we had thought we would not see happening to education is
happening here."<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Bob Michel (R-IL) stated, "The establishment of a new department is irrelevant
to the needs of American children."<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Michel also argued that a vote against the bill creating DOE is, "a vote for American children. 
Once this silly idea is consigned to the oblivion it richly deserves, let us have the courage to
admit that the Federal Government does not know what it is doing in education, and we had
better go back to square 1 and begin all over again."<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Thomas Evans (R-DE) stated, "Very few reasons are even suggested by the
proponents of this bill to demonstrate that a sixth grader in a Delaware elementary school will
receive an improved education as a result of the creation of a Federal Department of
Education.  In fact, there is nothing in this proposal that provides any promise or even any
hope that anyone will learn more, or faster, or more happily."<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>The Reality</em>
<ul>
  <li>SAT scores since the creation of the Department have basically stagnated: the national average
was a combined 890 in 1980 and 910 in 1995 (428 on verbal and 482 on math).  But even this
small progress may merely reflect changes in methodology in the SAT.  There are now fewer
questions but students have longer to finish.  And, along with other changes, calculators are
now allowed.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>In 1978, eight percent of eighth graders failed to complete high school.  By 1992, that figure
had reached 12 percent.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<ul>
  <li>According to tests in 1994, 30 percent of high school seniors were not even "basic" readers. 
Only 11 percent achieved satisfactory scores on U.S. history.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Almost half of adult Americans are barely literate and literacy rates among younger adults are
falling.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li><em>The Washington Post</em> concluded in a 1994 editorial that, "America's schools are not noticeably
better because a Department of Education was created."<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Former Secretaries of Education Lamar Alexander and William Bennett observe that the
Department, "has come to contain bad ideas, harmful practices, needless expenditures, obsolete
programs, dysfunctional regulations and the depredations of special interests that care more
about the well-being of education's 'producers' than for its 'consumers.'"<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Because of the sliding performance of America's children, growing doubts have been raised
about America's public schools.  In a recent study, Public Agenda asked Americans where they
would send their kids if money was not an issue; 57 percent said they'd send them to private
school.<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Given the dearth of any discernible results from the Department of Education, it is hard to
understand the words of Representative Major Owens (D-NY) writing in 1995 that the idea to
eliminate the Department of Education "represents a headlong plunge back into the dark
ages."<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><strong>II. Overhead &amp; Growth in the Bureaucracy</strong>

<p align="center"><em>What Supporters Promised . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>The House bill provided for no more than 100 overhead personnel in the new department.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<ul>
  <li>Robert Severs, Director of Federal Programs of the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools
claimed, "The charges that a Department of Education would result in greater federal controls
and a larger bureaucracy have little basis in fact.  In reality, the new Department of Education
will greatly improve the management of federal education programs."<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Senator Birch Bayh (D-IN) stated, "We are not creating a new bureaucracy with the creation
of a Cabinet-level Department which will channel all its energies into education matters. 
Instead, we are reorganizing and streamlining a bureaucracy which already exists.  The
legislation includes prohibitions on allowing the Department to grow in size."<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Frank Horton (R-NY) stated, "It does not create a new education bureaucracy. 
In fact, it reduces the bureaucracy."<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>What Opponents Predicted . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Representative Henson Moore (R-LA), who opposed creation of a separate department,
predicted, "We will see increases in [the Department's] number of employees, regulations, and
expense."<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Ed Bethune (R-AR) stated, "Current estimates indicate that the new
Department could add nearly 1,000 pieces of paperwork to every school district annually.  In
establishing a new department, we become more efficient at producing cumbersome
regulations and increasing Federal redtape, not streamlining our educational system."<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>The Reality</em>
<ul>
  <li>In FY 1995, the Department of Education will spend $372 million in departmental
management.<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<ul>
  <li>Growth in personnel has been particularly marked in recent years.  In FY 1990, the department
employed 4,596 people.  By FY 1995, that number had increased to 5,100.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>During floor debate, Representative Bob Walker (R-PA) argued that despite promises of
supporters and supposed guarantees in the bill that growth in the bureaucracy would be held in
check, many were already planning its expansion.  He noted, "I have here a letter written by
the President of the United States in which he is already talking about adding a new Assistant
Secretary to this Department.  The bill has not even cleared Congress and they are already
adding high level, top echelon bureaucrats."<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>During the government shutdown of November 1995, 89.4% of Department of Education 
employees were deemed nonessential.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><strong>III. Efficiency</strong>

<p align="center"><em>What Supporters Promised . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Representative Brooks claimed that by creating a separate department, "We will have done
what we always talk about doing; that is, just to make the Federal Government a bit more
efficient, a bit more responsive."<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Supporters argued that the new department would be more efficient.  James R. Kirkpatrick,
Senior Associate Director of the American Association of School Administrators wrote,
"Local school administrators advise us they find the present structure unwieldy and
unresponsive.  Duplicate regulations generated in different departments are often conflicting;
they are confusing and burden schools with unnecessary paperwork.  AASA members are
convinced that a Cabinet level Department of Education will be a significant improvement. 
AASA's 1979 delegate assembly approved a resolution urging 'establishment of a position of
Secretary of Education at cabinet rank.'  In addition to consolidating education programs, we
believe this would result in a more efficient organization."<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Levitas said creation of a separate Education Department, "will provide
accountability.  It will actually limit the number of people now in the bureaucracy for the first
time.  For the first time we will have a smaller agency rather than a larger one; we will have a
legislative veto over all of the regulations that come out of this bureaucracy; we will be cutting
back, not increasing Government."<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Levitas went on to remark that, "We will end up with less bureaucracy, more efficiency, more
economy in Government, and better education."<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT) stated that the new Department of Education would have a,
"lean, tight, simple, and efficient structure."<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Horton stated, "There will be less redtape and better service to States,
localities, educational institutions, and students."<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative David Bonior (D-MI) claimed, "By processing regulations faster, by eliminating
layer upon layer of bureaucracy and redtape, by eliminating at least 500 positions by the end of
the first fiscal year after the act becomes effective, and by bringing these Federal education
programs under one roof, we are making our Federal support services more available to serve
local needs."<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>What Opponents Predicted . . .</em>

Education grows."<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<ul>
  <li>Representative Evans stated, "There is absolutely no guarantee that the promised operational
efficiencies from a Cabinet-level department would ever materialize."<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative John Erlenborn (R-IL) stated during a floor debate, "Here we are again with a
reorganization bill to create a new Department.  We had one not too long ago, a bill to create
the Department of Energy, and I heard the same claims then that I hear today.  It was going to
consolidate programs.  It was going to make Government work better and be more responsive. 
I believed that then.  A lot of us believed that, and we created the Department of Energy.  And
what has happened? I think we all know.  I have heard Member after Member in the Halls of
the House say what a mistake we made to believe those claims.  'Fool me once, shame on you;
fool me twice, shame on me.'  That is an old saying and I think it is one we had better believe. 
We have been fooled once.  Do not be fooled again."<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>The Reality</em>
<ul>
  <li>One of the driving motivations of supporters of abolishing the Department of Education is the
excessive paperwork burdens that it places on local schools.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>A recent General Accounting Office study of the Department of Education found, "The
Department's history is replete with long-standing management problems."<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a></li>

  <li>Public policy expert Herbert J. Walberg notes,  "The U.S. Department of Education creates a
great deal of red tape that has little to do with learning."<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Interestingly, the Heineman Commission of 1967, which looked at reforming government,
argued, "Efforts should be made to reduce, merge and realign the number of departments
substantially in the grip of parochial interests and resist proposals to create additional
departments likely to be dominated by narrow, specialized interests or special
clientele."<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>Similarly, the Ash Council of 1971 argued that the number of departments should
be reduced.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a></li>

<p align="center"><strong>IV. Local Control</strong>

<p align="center"><em>What Supporters Promised . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Senator Ribicoff argued, "Without the remedies offered by the Department of Education, the
threat of more Federal intrusion in the local control of education can only increase."<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Levitas claimed, "There is not one single word in this bill that creates any more
Federal presence in education than currently exists."<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Levitas also claimed, "Written into this legislation are specific prohibitions
against the new Department's having any control over curriculum, personnel, libraries or
anything else.  Local control is maintained."<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>According to Representative Brooks, the new department would provide for, "more
involvement of State and local officials in the Federal Government's education programs."<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>What Opponents Predicted . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Representative Shirley Chisholm (D-NY) noted that by creating the new department, "We will
be minimizing the roles of local and State education officials; we recognize that the States are
responsible for the educational policies of the children in this country."<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Joseph Early (D-MA) noted, "A national Department may actually impede the
innovation of local programs as it attempts to establish uniformity throughout the Nation."<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Pat Schroeder (D-CO) predicted, "No matter what anyone says, the
Department of Education will not just write checks to local school boards.  They will meddle
in everything.  I do not want that."<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Moore warned, "I expect the Department of Education will be oppressive by
usurping control properly administered now by State and local authorities. . . State and local
control will likely continue to erode as the centralized power of the Department of Education
grows."<a href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Representative Evans stated, "I am absolutely certain that a new Federal Department of
Education would eventually have the power and the inclination to tamper with areas in both
public and private education that rightfully belong to parents and the local community."<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><em>The Reality</em>
<ul>
  <li>Herbert J. Walberg has written, "the U.S. spends 25.1 percent of its public school budget on
non-teaching staff, more than twice the average of other countries surveyed by the OECD. 
Such excess, largely administrative, costs stem primarily from the federal government's clumsy
efforts to interfere with and subsidize local schools.  Although it pays only 7.6 percent of
school costs, the federal government imposes many mandates and regulatory burdens on  state
departments of education and local school boards."<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Thanks to legislation such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1994, federal
guidelines now cover topics such as how schools discipline students, the content of sex
education courses, and the gender of textbook authors.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>One of the most prominent examples of the U.S. Department of Education overriding local
control has come in the area of special education.  According to DOE, states and localities
must pay for and continue alternative special education for special education students who are
expelled or placed on long-term suspension for disciplinary infractions -- such as drug dealing
and weapons possession -- that are unrelated to their disability.  States that do not comply with
DOE's policy risk losing millions of dollars in federal educational funding.  The department has
interpreted the law to require that states must provide educational services to all special
education students regardless of their disciplinary profile.  States such as Virginia have fought
the DOE requirements for several reasons: school safety, the ability to provide the proper
learning environment for all students, and the right of state and local authorities -- those closest
to the children -- to make educational decisions.<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<ul>
  <li>Former Department of Education officials Chester Finn, Jr. and Diane Ravitch write of the
Department of Education that, "the agency and many of its programs -- micromanaged at every
turn by Congressional subcommittees and staffers -- are the captives of Washington-based
education lobbies and special interests.  The country would be better off without it: the
department does little to improve education while imposing countless unnecessary burdens."<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Former Secretaries of Education Lamar Alexander and William Bennett have stated that the
Department has, "an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to stick its nose into areas where it
has no proper business.  Most of what it does today is no legitimate affair of the federal
government.  The Education Department operates from the deeply erroneous belief that
American parents, teachers, communities and states are too stupid to raise their own children,
run their own schools and make their own decisions."<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Interestingly, the National Education Association, when testifying before Congress in 1979
stated that, "the Federal Government ought to be paying as much as a third of the cost of
public education."<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> At the time, the federal government was providing only about eight

context: other parts of the budget experienced austerity during the past 15 years.  In the
decade prior to the establishment of the Department of Education, spending on education rose
at only about half the rate of the rest of the non-defense discretionary budget (35% versus
65.4%).  In the period since the establishment of the department, <em>education spending has risen
at a rate over three times as fast as non-defense discretionary programs</em> (29.5% versus
7.9%).<a href="#N_66_"><sup>(66)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Interestingly, <em>The Washington Post</em> observed in a June 5, 1979 editorial, "Of all the claims
being made for the proposed Department of Education, the most incredible is that it would not
grow."<a href="#N_67_"><sup>(67)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><strong>VI. Values</strong>

<p>While supporters made few comments on this topic, values were a significant concern for
opponents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><em>What Opponents Predicted . . .</em>
<ul>
  <li>Representative Evans observed, "The new Department would, over time, have the effect of
shaping the values of future generations of Americans according to the political, social, and
economic values held by a group of faceless bureaucrats in Washington.  The creation of this
Department provides the ripe potential for the centralization and control of ideas."<a href="#N_70_"><sup>(70)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Stanford University President Richard Lyman noted, "The 200 year old absence of a
department of education is not the result of a simple failure during all that time to notice that
virtually every other nation in the world has come to have one.  On the contrary, it derives
from the notion that we do not want the kinds of education systems that such arrangements
seem to produce."<a href="#N_71_"><sup>(71)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Senator Moynihan, in arguing against creation of the department, stated, "we risk the
politicization of education itself, and that it will come about in ways that the system of
education itself will not be able to resist."<a href="#N_72_"><sup>(72)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Many opponents saw the drive for creation of a separate Department of Education as the pet
project of the National Education Association.  In this view, creation of DOE was simply part
of an effort to centralize educational policy.  Representative John Ashbrook (R-OH) argued,
"An integral part of the NEA design is to siphon ever more control of public education from
the grass roots to Washington, closer to its own powerful lobbying influence, farther from the
parents and taxpayers who elect the school boards and pay the bills."<a href="#N_73_"><sup>(73)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><em>The Reality</em>
<ul>
  <li>Today, parents across the country are fighting against educational standards and norms that are
coming down from the Department of Education.  Thomas DeWeese of the American Policy
Foundation has stated that because of federal standards, "The indoctrination methods . . . start
in kindergarten, where students are filled with horror stories of ozone holes, dying species,
homelessness and war."  "Yet many schools today have ceased teaching such basic skills as
spelling and multiplication tables."<a href="#N_74_"><sup>(74)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>Discussing Goals 2000 and H.R. 6, the two main education efforts of the 103rd Congress,
former Secretaries of Education Lamar Alexander and William Bennett note, "it becomes plain
that their authors want to substitute decisions made in Washington for decisions made by
individual households and communities. . . They use federal funding in a deceptive way that is
designed to elicit the behaviors that other parts of the legislation declare to be 'voluntary.' 
They throw obstacles onto such promising reform pathways as school choice and private
management of public schools."<a href="#N_75_"><sup>(75)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center"><strong>Conclusion</strong>

<p>As was noted in the introduction of this paper, intense debates over a separate Department of
Education waned after it was established but have been resurrected during the 104th Congress. 
Representative Robin Beard (R-TN) prophesied at the time of the creation of the Department, "A
great deal of attention and debate has centered on the growth, size, cost and efficiency of the
Federal Government -- and rightly so.  That debate stems from the many governmental
departments and agencies that continue to receive matter-of-course funding, in spite of the clear
evidence that many of them have long since outlived their usefulness.  Ten years from now, we
may be saying the same thing about other governmental agencies, including the proposed
Department of Education."<a href="#N_76_"><sup>(76)</sup></a> Mr. Beard's prediction was pretty close to the mark.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Opponents of a separate Department of Education in 1979 were not anti-education.  They had
numerous ideas for bettering education, but with a radically different approach.  Representative
Moore observed, "A constructive alternative to H.R. 2444 [creating the Department] is a
concerted commitment by local communities and their citizens to support local education.  This
may be in the form of approval of bond issues, recommendations for higher tax bases and levies,
or parents taking more of an interest in the education their children receive."<a href="#N_77_"><sup>(77)</sup></a> Representative
Evans and others called for simply a reorganization of the existing Office of Education rather than
creation of the new Department.<a href="#N_78_"><sup>(78)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The same is true today.  Those in Congress wishing to dismantle the Department of Education are
supporting not simply ending all education spending, but turning much of it over to the states and
localities.  For example, the bill sponsored by Representative Joe Scarborough (R-FL), H.R.
1883, would take $11 billion in aid to elementary and secondary schools and aid to colleges and
make it into a single block grant which the states could spend as they wish.  What opponents of
the department then and now want to eliminate are federal controls, red tape and the excess cost
of a federal bureaucracy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Given the dismal performance of the department over the past sixteen years, were supporters
simply oblivious to the probable consequences of their actions?  Perhaps not.  Representative
Benjamin Rosenthal (D-NY -- who was opposed to creating the department) noted, "In the
history of the Republic, 14 Cabinet-level departments have been created.  We may or may not
create one this afternoon.  If it is created, it will not be on the merits.  It will be because this has
been the most intensely lobbied reorganization bill that has ever appeared in Congress.  There is
nobody who is really for this new Department in this Chamber.  Everybody who says they are
going to vote for it say, 'Well, I made a commitment or a promise to some people back in the
district.'"<a href="#N_79_"><sup>(79)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Similarly, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported one liberal House Democrat admitting, "The idea of
an Education Department is really a bad one.  But it's NEA's top priority.  There are school
teachers in every congressional district and most of us simply don't need the aggravation of taking
them on."<a href="#N_80_"><sup>(80)</sup></a> Representative Bob Michel termed the DOE the "Special Interest Memorial Prize of
1979."<a href="#N_81_"><sup>(81)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But whether or not the creation of the Department of Education was simply a political payoff,<a href="#N_82_"><sup>(82)</sup></a>it
is exacting a steep price today.  The price can, of course, be measured in the billions of dollars
that are annually wasted on the Department but more importantly can be seen in the failure of our
school system to deliver the quality education that America's children deserve.

perhaps explains the fact that public opinion leaned against creation of a separate department.  A
Gallup poll  in mid-1979 asked the question, "In your opinion, should education be taken out of
the present Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and made a separate department of the
Federal Government?"  40 percent said yes, while 45 percent said no.  Among those parents who
had children in public schools, opposition was slightly higher, 49 percent to 40 percent.

<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong>

<p>Recent concerns about the close relationship of business and other interest groups with the
Republican Party raise the question of how partisan are these groups' campaign contributions
vis-a-vis the campaign contributions of labor unions?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A review of new Federal Election Commission PAC data for a select list of major business
groups, major labor groups, and several other prominent interest groups reveals:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>While the leading business groups have been pro-Republican in their contributions, they have
still given more than 20 percent of their funds to Democratic candidates.  Their partisanship
ratio (Republican contributions relative to Democratic contributions) is just under 4:1.</li>
  <li>Labor groups are almost completely partisan in their contributions, with barely 2 percent of
their funds going to Republican candidates.  Their partisanship ratio is over 44:1.</li>
  <li>The <em>least partisan</em> of the labor groups analyzed (the Teamsters) is as partisan in their
contributions as the <em>most partisan</em> business group (the NFIB).</li>
  <li>In percentage terms, the NRA has given nine times as much to Democratic candidates (19.9
percent) as these labor groups have given to Republicans (2.2 percent).</li>
  <li>Despite some suggestions that they were going to be more bipartisan in 1996, both major
teacher unions remain just as monolithic in their support of Democratic candidates as they've
been in the past, giving them 99 percent of their PAC funds.</li>
  <li>The trial lawyers are quite partisan in their giving patterns, contributing to Democratic
candidates over Republican candidates at a ratio of about 7:1.</li>

<p align="center"><strong>I. Introduction</strong>

<p>The role of American business in the 1996 elections has been much commented on.  Critics have
focused on two issues: the amount of money and influence that the business groups hold, and the
extent of their partisanship.  The groups are seen as closely linked with the Republican Party, and
the GOP in turn has been labeled as beholden to these interests in general or specific corporate
interests in particular.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The GOP has also been portrayed as closely linked to the National Rifle
Association.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>On the NRA connection, one national pundit recently wrote,  "The Republicans and the
National Rifle Association are as one."<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A recent Associated Press story gave key attribution for the fund-raising success of the
Republican Party vis-a-vis the Democratic Party to "the help of some corporate friends."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a></li>
  <li>Discussing corporate funding of the Republican Party, Marvin Rosen, the finance chairman of
the Democratic National Committee, told <em>The New York Times</em> that, "It's going to be very hard
to match them because of the large corporations and what they're giving to the Republicans."<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>These claimed links naturally raise the question of relativity -- how close are the party connections
of these groups relative to the connections of other groups?  In particular, this paper seeks to
discover how partisan are these groups' campaign contributions vis-a-vis the campaign
contributions of labor groups.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II. Partisanship Findings</strong>

<p>To analyze this issue, this paper reviews the partisanship of contributions by the Political Action
Committees (PACs) of five major business groups and five major labor organizations.  Three
other prominent interest groups are reviewed as well.  The information was obtained from the
Federal Election Commission and is the latest data for the 1995-6 election cycle.  The groups
reviewed are:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">Business
<ul>
  <li>Business-Industry Political Action Committee - BIPAC represents a cross-section of corporate
interests.</li>
  <li>Health Insurance Association of America - HIAA is a leading player in the health reform
debate, representing the interests of health insurers.</li>
  <li>American Bankers Association - the ABA's approximately 9,000 members are commercial
banks and trust companies whose assets account for approximately 95% of the U.S. banking
industry.</li>
  <li>Tobacco Institute - the Washington research and representation arm of the major tobacco
firms.</li>
  <li>National Federation of Independent Businesses - NFIB represents 600,000 small business
owners.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center">Unions
<ul>
  <li>American Federation of Teachers - the nation's second largest teacher's union, affiliated with
the AFL-CIO.</li>
  <li>AFL-CIO - while not a union per se, this umbrella organization for labor unions has a total of
13 million members.</li>
  <li>National Education Association - the nation's largest union with 2.2 million members.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a></li>
  <li>Teamsters - the second largest union in America, with 1.5 million members.  The Teamsters
are affiliated with the AFL-CIO.<a href="pacstudy.gif"><sup>(6)</sup></a></li>
  <li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees - AFSCME has 1.3 million
members and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p align="center">Professional &amp; Other
<ul>
  <li>American Medical Association - the AMA represents 375,000 doctors.</li>
  <li>Association of Trial Lawyers of America - ATLA has a membership of 54,000, most of whom
are trial lawyers.</li>
  <li>National Rifle Association - the NRA has approximately 3 million members.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>The analysis includes only PAC contributions and does not include independent expenditures of
these groups' PACs for or against candidates.  The analysis also does not include contributions
from individual members of these groups (individual companies, individual doctors, local union
affiliates, etc.)

<p>A review of this PAC data (see Table 1) reveals:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>While the leading business groups have been pro-Republican in their contributions, they have
still given more than 20 percent of their funds to Democratic candidates.  Their partisanship
ratio (Republican contributions relative to Democratic contributions) is just under 4:1.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Labor groups are almost completely partisan in their contributions, with barely 2 percent of
their funds going to Republican candidates.  Their partisanship ratio is over 44:1.</li>
  <li>The <em>least partisan</em> of these labor groups (the Teamsters) is as partisan in their contributions as
the <em>most partisan</em> business group (the NFIB).</li>
  <li>The partisan tilt of the National Education Association (99 percent of their funds going to 
Democratic candidates), which is not a member of the AFL-CIO, is as great or greater than
that of the AFL-CIO affiliated labor groups analyzed.</li>
  <li>Despite some suggestions that they were going to be more bipartisan in 1996, both major
teacher unions (the NEA and the AFT) remain just as monolithic in their support of
Democratic candidates as they've been in the past, giving them 99 percent of their PAC funds.</li>
  <li>The trial lawyers are quite partisan in their giving patterns, contributing to Democratic
candidates over Republican candidates at a ratio of about 7:1.</li>
  <li>The AMA and the NRA are far less partisan than these labor groups, each contributing to
Republican candidates over Democratic candidates at a ratio of about 4:1 each.</li>
  <li>In percentage terms, the NRA has given nine times as much to Democratic candidates (19.9
percent) as these labor groups have given to Republicans (2.2 percent).</li>
  <li>Overall, the business groups analyzed, along with the NRA and AMA, tend the most towards
bipartisanship.  Labor is the least bipartisan, followed by the trial lawyers.</li>

<p>These findings about the unions being far more partisan than any of these other groups should be
of interest to union members -- especially since these ratios of partisan support by union
leadership are almost certainly not reflective of union rank-and-file.  In the case of the NEA for
example, their internal polls show that 40 percent of union members are Democrats, with the rest
split between Republicans and Independents.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>III. Conclusion</strong>

<p>To the extent that concerns raised about the partisanship of business groups in general or specific
industries in particular are legitimate, even greater concerns should be raised about the influence
of labor organizations over the Democratic Party.  This is also true to a lesser degree with the trial
lawyers.

<h3 align="center"><strong>"Why Subsidize Sports?"</strong></h3>

<p align="center">John E. Berthoud

<p align="center">Vice President

<p align="center">The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The past couple of months have witnessed an unprecedented number of sports headlines
trumpeting multimillion dollar deals.  Alonzo Mourning signing with the Miami Heat after
rejecting a seven-year $78.4 million deal from the Charlotte Hornets as inadequate.  Art Modell
accepting a deal from the city of Baltimore after not getting the terms he wanted for his Browns in
Cleveland.  In Washington state, as the Mariners proceeded into post-season, the state legislature
adopted a multi-million dollar package of public financing for the Mariners' stadium under threats
that the now-successful team would otherwise leave the city.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The capitalist spirit felt by players and team owners wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact
that today hard-pressed taxpayers are being continually asked to provide them millions in
subsidies through the financing of stadiums.  These kind of economic development projects which
have become a fact of life in the sporting world are corporate welfare at its worst.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The biggest problem with these corporate giveaways is that our major cities are the ones least able
to afford them.  Urban taxpayers already suffer under a punishing tax burden.  Combined with
fears of crime, high taxes are driving huge segments of the urban tax base fleeing into suburbia. 
During the 1980's, city operating costs rose by 22 percent.  These costs were passed onto
taxpayers.  In the 41 largest cities during that decade, $13 billion more taxes were collected, after
factoring in inflation and changes in population.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>What is worse, often the taxes to pay for the teams are regressive.  For example, Cleveland
residents have been asked to pay special cigarette and alcohol taxes to keep the Browns.  Given
the skyrocketing prices of tickets for many major league sporting events, this has meant franchises
have played a cruel joke on the declining ranks of the urban middle class.  They pay the taxes to
keep these teams in their cities, but then can't afford to go to the games (and don't have access to
corporate sky boxes).  In Washington state, some of the new $300 million in public financing will
come out of a sales tax.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In those cases where stadiums or other economic development projects get tax abatements, if
these aren't paid for by a special surtax, then often they end up simply eroding the tax base.  By
giving special breaks to one group, cities and states, which unlike the federal government can't run
deficits, will have to make up that lost revenue somewhere else.  While it would be nice to
imagine that this means a cut in spending somewhere, in reality, all too often it simply means
higher taxes on businesses that are less visible or have less political clout.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But despite these problems, proponents of stadiums and all economic development projects
always claim that these schemes will pay for themselves because they will create thousands of jobs
and generate millions in revenues for the cities and states that are lucky enough to offer the most
lucrative package of special breaks.  In their view, individuals or businesses should be happy to
pay higher taxes for these teams.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A key problem with much of the analysis put forward by proponents of economic development
projects like stadiums is that the data presented on job creation or revenue generation is often
only really the gross figures.  This type of analysis often misses much of the picture.  For example,
there is something that economists term the "substitution effect" -- those spending their
entertainment dollars on a football game will not be spending them at the movies or on golf. 
Viewed this way, there may be little economic benefit from such deals.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Indeed, investigations of the question of whether special economic development projects result in
a net economic gain have turned up little.  For example, Robert Baade did a regression analysis of
stadiums and city economics in 48 major U.S. cities for the Heartland Institute and found no
relationship between stadium projects and higher economic growth.  Baade writes, "After a
thorough examination of an unprecedented quantity of data related to professional sports and host
area per capita personal income, the author finds no factual basis for the conventional argument
that professional sports stadiums and teams have a significant impact on a region's economic
growth."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One of the key reasons why economic development projects end up as a net loser for cities and
states is that these type of projects also open a pandora's box for politicians.  While one project
may sound very justifiable on economic or civic grounds, as David Stockman used to say, "pork
travels in herds."  Economic development soon becomes a way to simply channel dollars into the
favored projects of powerful politicians.  It gets government into the business of picking winners
and losers, which it is ill-equipped to do.  And the politically un-organized businesses always lose
out to the politically astute (usually this means the big guys win out over the little guys), which is
not the way to achieve economic growth.  If supply-side economics has had one enduring lesson
for the nation, it is that the best way to ensure real growth is to treat all businesses in an
even-handed manner with special breaks for none and minimal taxes and regulations for all.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If stadiums and by implication other great "economic development" projects paid for by corporate
tax rebates are no great economic deals for cities and states, why do they persist in undertaking
them?  The answer is politics.  While the job creation from a big tax subsidy may be a zero sum
(the jobs created on the tax-favored projects are offset by job losses in other industries that have
to pay higher taxes) the jobs created in the tax-favored project are usually more high profile.  A
tax abatement for a large manufacturer allows politicians to claim the credit for creating hundreds
of very visible jobs.  The jobs lost because of higher taxes elsewhere are mostly invisible.  Plus,
when government begins to contemplate getting into the "economic development" racket this
provides politicians with the irresistible opportunity to meddle with the economy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now undoubtedly, there are some city pride issues associated with stadiums.  But even still,
asking hard-pressed city taxpayers to subsidize multi-millionaire owners and eight figure-salaries
athletes is hard to justify.  And in an era when teams exhibit no loyalty to local fans, while cable
TV and satellite TV can each week bring in dozens of sporting contests to any household, it
becomes harder to argue that cities and fans need these teams at the taxing price they are
charging.  Like with drugs,  its time that big cities "just said no" to this type of extortion.

<p>The Clinton Administration is trying to claim credit for substantial cuts in the federal bureaucracy. 
According to the White House, "President Clinton has already cut the federal bureaucracy by
more than 100,000 positions.  Under the recommendations of the National Performance Review,
the federal bureaucracy will be reduced  by 272,000 -- its lowest level since the Kennedy
Administration."<a href="#N_1_">(1)</a> What the Administration has not publicized is that almost all the cuts have
come from the Department of Defense.  Table 1 provides an overview of the facts.

than one in five have been eliminated in non-defense agencies.  It is difficult to reconcile this

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><em><strong>Executive Summary</strong></em>

<p>A survey of mayors and city officials in America's highest-immigration cities shows that these
officials generally believe that immigration has had a positive impact.  Combined "positive" and
"very positive" responses were 77 percent. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>None of the respondents suggested a need to reduce the annual levels of legal immigration to the
U.S. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sixty-nine percent cited needs for the federal government to increase border enforcement to
reduce the flow of illegal immigration, or to compensate for the costs associated with recent
immigrants.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We asked whether, if they were given the authority, they would stop funding the education of
children of illegal immigrants.  (A legislative proposal passed by the House of Representatives
would give states that option.)  All but one responded "no;" one deferred to the local school
board.

<p align="center"><strong>Immigration:  The View from City Hall</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>A Survey of Mayors and Officials</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>in High-Immigration Cities</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">by Philip Peters, Senior Fellow

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) surveyed mayors and municipal officials in
high-immigration cities to find out how they view the impact of immigration on their communities. 


<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We surveyed the seventeen American cities that have over 200,000 population and over 20
percent foreign-born residents.  We received thirteen responses from the seventeen cities:  seven
from mayors and six from their designees. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While this is not a large-scale opinion poll, these officials' views do indicate the ways immigration
affects America's largest high-immigration communities, and the ways that managers of local
governments assess the benefits and costs.  While our questions focused almost exclusively on
local impacts, the answers make an interesting contribution to the national debate over
immigration policy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>High-immigration cities are not homogeneous.   Miami and Hialeah, Florida have absorbed
successive waves of immigrants, while Glendale, California had a pronounced influx that was
largely responsible for a 25 percent population increase from 1985 to 1989.  Some have pools of
generally unskilled immigrants, others (e.g. Fremont, California) have large numbers of
professionals, while the immigrant pools in others (e.g. San Francisco) span the spectrum.  Recent
immigrants to south Florida generally speak Spanish or Haitian Creole; in other cities, extremely
diverse immigrant communities pose enormous challenges for schools and all providers of public
services.  For example, 130 languages are spoken in the home in Fremont, California; 60 in
Glendale, 20 in Boston.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The responses to our survey lead us to the conclusion that sweeping conclusions about the local
impact of immigration are wrong.  The impacts are as diverse as our nation itself and the
immigrants that we receive each year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>However, there were five general tendencies expressed in the responses:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.  Immigration's local impact is viewed as positive.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a></strong> Asked to describe the general impact of
immigration in their communities, our respondents answers were 77 percent "positive" or "very
positive:"  3.5 were "very positive," 6.5 "positive," two "neutral," 0.5 "negative" and 0.5 "very
negative."  (Two split their answers between "positive" and "negative" and "very  positive" and
"very negative.")

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2.  No recommendation to cut legal immigration.</strong> In response to an open-ended question
seeking recommendations for federal immigration policy actions, none of the respondents called
for a reduction in legal immigration.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>3.  Immigration brings growing pains and adjustment problems.</strong> The officials described a
variety of challenges they face in absorbing new immigrants, including the difficulty of providing
education and public services to new residents, and meeting the cost of incarcerating illegal
immigrants.  Children have language adjustment problems, and parents have language barriers and
difficulty getting involved in school matters when parents are working.  Municipal governments
have to make special efforts to teach immigrants about the use of public services, for example
when to use and when not to use "911," or how to work with the police in reporting crimes.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>4.  Immigrants fill economic niches.</strong> We asked whether immigrants have impacts on sectors of
local economies.  The answers indicated that immigrants do fill particular niches in the
communities where they settle.  The following are examples:

<ul>
  <li>Jersey City:  Latin American and Indian retail businesses, Filipinos in health professions.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>San Francisco:  retail, services, professionals, international trade.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Hialeah:  new small businesses, skilled labor for garment industry. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>El Paso:  labor for service sector.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>New York:  services, academia, research, home care, international trade.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Anaheim:  new business starts, and labor for light manufacturing industries, such as cellular
phones and other telecommunications equipment.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Miami:  services, international trade.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Los Angeles:  services, new garment manufacturing businesses, international trade.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Glendale:   Filipinos in health care professions.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Stockton:  Southeast Asians starting small businesses.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Boston:   service sector.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Fremont:   high-tech entrepreneurs, physicians, health professions.  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Santa Ana:  retailers, industrial labor force.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p><strong>5.  No desire to stop educating children of illegal immigrants.</strong> The Gallegly amendment to the
immigration bill passed by the House this year would give states the option to stop paying for the
education of children of illegal immigrants.  Asked whether they would exercise that option if they
had the authority, none of our respondents said "yes."  Twelve responded "no;" one mayor
deferred to his school board.  Nine respondents (69%) called for the federal government to do
more to reduce illegal immigration or to compensate localities for the costs of absorbing recent
immigrants.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Local Impacts</u></strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We asked respondents to note whether the flow of immigrants into their communities had an
impact on any of a list economic and social indicators, and if so, to characterize that impact.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If they perceived no strong link between immigration and the indicator in the question, they did
not respond, or they replied "neutral." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Combining "very positive" and "positive" to form a "favorable" rating and "very negative" and
"negative" to form an "unfavorable" rating, these are the impacts mentioned by 30 percent or
more of respondents:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Poverty level   38% unfavorable

<p>New business starts  62% favorable

<p>Property values  31% favorable

<p>Household income  31 % favorable

<p>Job creation   46 % favorable

<p>Crime rates   31 % unfavorable

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For example, five of thirteen respondents believed that immigration increased their city's poverty
level, so we record that 38% of respondents mentioned an unfavorable impact.  (This does not
imply that the remaining 62% believe the impact is opposite.  On this question, of the remaining
respondents, five did not respond, one replied "neutral," and two said immigration reduced the
poverty level.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Excerpts from Responses</u></strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following are excerpts from the author's phone interviews with the respondents, with the
exception of Mayor Brown of San Francisco and Mr. Millard of New York, who responded in
writing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Glendale -- Mayor Sheldon Baker</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"The impact of immigration has been anything but neutral.  Immigration has enriched our
community, broadened the horizons of this city, brought new value systems, made us re-think a
lot of things.  It has also taken us from above to below the county average income.  It has created
a tremendous demand for health care, education and other services such as libraries and parks."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On the strain of Glendale's dramatic population growth:

<p>"It's not because they're immigrants -- you just don't throw that many people into a community,
regardless of who they are, without strains on services and schools.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On federal immigration policy:

<p>"I won't address whether immigration should be tightened or loosened.  But resources need to be
released to the local level.  The federal government's looser policy has caused governments at the
city and county level to face challenging issues of social services, and we haven't had the
resources to adequately meet those challenges."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>San Francisco -- Mayor Willie Brown</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"Immigrants have made this city what it is:  San Francisco is defined by its ethnic neighborhoods
and its diverse population....This is the model of the immigrant city -- we're as diverse as
anyplace, and that's our strength."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"Immigrants have made a positive impact everywhere they have gone...[they] have moved into all
sectors of the economy; they are part and parcel of it, and San Francisco's international trade
benefits from the personal and professional ties our immigrants keep with their homelands."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On federal immigration policy (referring to a bill since signed into law):

<p>"The immediate crisis is the federal welfare bill working its way through Congress, which  I
vehemently oppose.  The bill would deny benefits to millions of <em>legal</em> immigrants, creating
unbearable hardship on families in San Francisco and throughout the nation, as well as shifting an
undue financial burden to local governments for which they are not prepared."

<p><em>Stockton -- Mayor Joan Darrah</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After enumerating some of the costs of educating and administering city programs for new
immigrants:

<p>"So why do I say the impact [of immigration] has been positive?  This kind of diversity is really
good for a city in the long run.  It's going to pay off.  These are industrious people; they work
hard, they are in our community college system....We're still in the adjustment period, but we're
doing a pretty good job of handling it.  I just believe that diversity enriches a community, it's
going to pay off for us." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Miami -- Acting Mayor Willie Gort</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"You have to realize it's different here than in other states.  Years ago the immigrants had a lot of
trouble at first, but they got established and this made it easier for the newer immigrants, like the
Central Americans in the 1980's.  The city is bilingual now.  It used to be that it was difficult to
get a license to start a business and get going, but now lots of [city government] departments and
businesses are bilingual."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"[Sometimes in reaction to immigration] established residents move out because they don't want
to see changes."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On federal immigration policy:

<p>"We should ensure that immigrants coming in are not going to be a burden on the state.  If you're
sponsored by a family, then that family should be responsible for you."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Hialeah -- Mayor Raul Martinez</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On labor market impact:

<p>"You always have jobs that people here don't want to do...people on the bottom of the ladder
come up..."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On housing:

<p>"Our first time homebuyers work hard, save, buy their houses...as soon as they move in they start
fixing up.  You can see it immediately on our southeast side -- old wooden homes with additions,
everybody likes to add a pool or a terrace.  They're very proud owners."

<p>On the Gallegly amendment, to permit states to stop funding public education of children of illegal
immigrants:

<p>"The Statue of Liberty would fall over if they did that.  You see kids come here from Cuba and in
6 or 9 months they're speaking English...why deny them the opportunity we all had?  If that were
to happen I would propose creating our own school system in Hialeah and paying for it ourselves
one hundred percent."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Fremont -- Mayor Gus Morrison</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"Our immigrants haven't created a demand for social services because they've been scientists and
professionals, technicians, engineers and entrepreneurs.  We didn't get poor immigrants."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"Speaking as a son of Scottish immigrants, I 'm grateful for the fact that we have open borders so
people can come here to make a new start."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Jersey City -- Mayor Bret Schundler</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"A good number of our immigrants are professionals or highly skilled...their economic life was not
great back home, they come from countries where entrepreneurialism is not easy, so they're
looking to make it...most immigrants come with the American dream."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On immigrants' positive impact on household income:

<p>"They come with little income, but if they weren't here you wouldn't have people coming into the
city."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On federal immigration policy:

<p>"We should maintain a reasonable level of legal immigration, but we should target and give
greater weight to factors such as skill levels, education and investment capital."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Los Angeles -- Mayor's Deputy Chief of Staff Greg Dawley</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"If managed correctly, immigration is a very important resource for LA.  But we don't like the
fact that the federal government hasn't lived up to its obligation to control illegal immigration. 
There has not been effective reimbursement for impacts we've seen in the last 4-5 years.  This is a
burden we're bearing for the entire country.  The federal government has to focus on the points of
entry, and deport those [illegal immigrants] who commit crimes."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"We're the largest international trade region in the country...immigration creates great trade
relationships in Asia, Europe, Central and South America..."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>Santa Ana -- Council Services Manager Lorraine Lazarene</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"I am concerned about crime prevention.  But these are people who want to work hard and
contribute to our community.  They shop downtown, and [our shopping district attracts]
Hispanics from all over the county.  That's very important to our tax base."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"There's a tremendous burden on public school system.  We're strapped for classroom space. 
Many of the kids are poor, they have no quiet study space at home, their parents are both
working.  They need as much assistance as they can possibly get." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em>New York -- Economic Development Corporation President Charles Millard</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"...almost all [New York City] neighborhoods are touched by immigrant settling patterns.  In
areas of high immigrant presence, we see increased occupancy, an entrepreneurial spirit, cultural
and culinary expressions.  More than anything, however, we perceive a sense of hope, promise
and family values.  This may be exhibited in business start-ups and home ownership."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>"Immigrants have stabilized the City's population base and prevented the major shrinkage
experienced in other large urban centers."

<p>The author contacted respondents between July 8 and August 22, 1996.  The respondents were
Mayor Sheldon Baker of Glendale, California; Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, California;
Mayor Joan Darrah of Stockton, California; Acting Mayor Willie Gort of Miami, Florida; Mayor
Raul Martinez of Hialeah, Florida; Mayor Gus Morrison of Fremont, California; Mayor Bret
Schundler of Jersey City, New Jersey; Mayor's Deputy Chief of Staff Greg Dawley of Los
Angeles, California;  Council Services Manager Lorraine Lazarene of Santa Ana, California; New
York City Economic Development Corporation President Charles Millard; Director of Federal
Relations Dina Siegal of Boston, Massachusetts; Executive Assistant to the Mayor Mark Smith of
El Paso, Texas; and Intergovernmental Relations Officer Christine Thalman of Anaheim,
California.  The mayors of Yonkers, New York and San Diego, Long Beach and San Jose,
California declined to participate in the survey and declined to designate a representative to
participate.

<p align="center"><u><strong>Notes</u></strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="N_1_">
<p>1. </a> Our respondents from Santa Ana and Stockton, California, and Miami are among those who
said immigration's impact was "positive."  These are three of the five high-immigration cities
examined in <em>A Tale of Ten Cities</em>, a 1995 report by the Federation for American Immigration
Reform.  In his foreword, the author of that study was "flabbergasted" by his findings that
high-immigration cities are "overwhelmed" and that less immigration yields "a higher quality of
life for everyone."  AdTI interviewed low-immigration city mayors.  Mayor Larry E. Chavis of
Richmond, Virginia, said immigration has no substantial impact, but that the small and growing
Asian community is "great."  "Diversity adds to a community, makes it more vital.  We need new
ideas, new work ethics," he said.  Asked whether an influx of immigrants would be beneficial to
Jackson, Mississippi, Mayor Kane Ditto said:  "Yes.  In general, I believe immigrants help
wherever they are.  We have a very difficult labor shortage problem in Jackson, across the board,
in construction, white collar work -- most every businessman I talk to talks about it."
<a name="N_2_">
<p>2. </a> In his response, New York City Economic Development Corporation President Charles
Millard noted a lack of data isolating the effect of immigration on the economic and social
indicators in our question, but noted that "from 1980 to 1990,  New York City's foreign-born
population increased 24.7 percent, median household income increased 28.4 percent and the
number of families below the poverty line decreased 6.1 percent.  Crime rates have dropped
dramatically -- 24.5 percent since 1993."

<h3 align="center"><strong>Invented in the USA: Immigrants, Patents, and Jobs</strong></h3>

<p align="center">by Philip Peters, Senior Fellow

<p align="center">March 6, 1996 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><em>Executive Summary</strong></em>

<p>In an effort to quantify the contribution of immigrants to U.S. technological innovation, the Alexis
de Tocqueville Institution performed a study of recent U.S. patents.  Using a random selection of
1988 and 1994 patents, we found:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li><em>Based on the responses to our survey, about one patent in four (26.4%) is created by
immigrants alone or by immigrants collaborating with U.S.-born co-inventors.</em></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li><em>Based on our entire sample (i.e. counting nonresponses as nonimmigrant inventors),  about
one patent in five (19.2%) involves immigrants as sole or co-inventors. That's a conservative
estimate with a 5% margin of error.</em></li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>Immigrants account for about 8.7% of the U.S. population.  Hence, the study shows immigrants
to be more than twice as likely as the general population to generate patented innovations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong><em><u>Overview:  Immigrants Contribute Twice Their Share of Patents</strong></u></em>

<p>Scores of anecdotes have created a poetic image of immigrants who arrive as refugees, students,
laborers or professionals and go on to create products, companies and even entire industries.  But
beyond the anecdotes, can the contributions of immigrants to America's industrial cutting edge be
<em>quantified?</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) endeavored to do this by using a well known
indicator of technological innovation -- issuance of new patents -- to measure immigrants'
inventiveness and spirit of enterprise.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Examining 250 recently issued U.S.  patents chosen at random, AdTI found that over 19% of
the patents in our sample (48 patents) were issued to immigrants alone or to immigrants
collaborating with U.S.-born co-inventors.  This is over twice immigrants' proportion of the
U.S. population -- 8.7%<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</strong></em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The immigrant inventors identified in our study include researchers, executives, entrepreneurs and
an MIT professor.   Four started their own businesses, generating over 1,600 jobs.  Their
innovations include:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>a system that protects American troops inside a front-line combat vehicle from chemical,
biological and nuclear contamination;</li>
</ul>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<ul>
  <li>100 sensors used on the space shuttle, all produced by a company founded by an immigrant
inventor, now employing 1500 people;</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>components of GE electric power generators that are exported to Japan;</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <li>a machine made by a Montana company that generated $10 million in sales last year, and is
expected to generate $15 million in sales to both U.S. and export markets this year.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"></ul>

<p>The economic contributions of immigrant inventors are worth considering at a time when
Congress is debating legislation to reduce all categories of legal immigration, including specially
skilled workers.  American high-tech firms rely on skilled foreign workers to meet particular
needs.  For example, Microsoft software developers are about 95% U.S.-born, yet the company
finds it "absolutely essential" to draw on the technical and cultural knowledge that foreign-born
employees can bring, according to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.  New restrictions on the entry
of skilled foreign workers or their families "will really put pressure on us to do a major portion of
our software development outside the United States," Gates says.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> A U.S.-born inventor
contacted in this study said immigrants are a "very valuable asset for American science and
technology....You need a constant influx of new ideas and new points of view."<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Our findings seem to justify concerns long expressed by foreign governments about the "brain
drain" -- the economic loss they suffer when highly skilled citizens emigrate to pursue careers
overseas.  For example, nearly 2,000 professional or semi-professional South African citizens
emigrated in 1994.  As a result, some South Africans are concerned that emigration means fewer
jobs, a smaller tax base and zero return on the state's investment in educating physicians and other
professionals.  "For every emigrant -- they are mostly highly qualified -- at least ten local people
lose their jobs," said Karen Theron of South Africa's Central Economics Advisory Services.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong><u>Immigrant Inventors' Stories</strong></em></u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As immigrant inventors were identified in the study, the author conducted interviews with many
of them.  They described their work and their motivations for coming to America, and offered
some thoughts as to why the United States attracts inventive people and why they are productive
in the U.S. work environment.  Some of the information gathered in those interviews follows. 
The inventors' patent numbers are noted in parentheses.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Fred Kavli</u> </strong>is Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Kavlico Corporation in Moore Park,
California.  Kavli immigrated from Norway in 1956 with a physics degree in hand, and founded
the company on a shoestring two years later.  "This was the land of opportunity -- especially
then," he told us.  "There was no other country I could go to to do that." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Kavlico makes sensors, primarily for aeronautical controls and automotive pollution controls. 
One hundred Kavlico sensors operate on the space shuttle.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Kyong Park</u></strong> is Kavlico's Vice President for Research and Development.  A physicist, he came to
the U.S. from Korea in 1969 to pursue his education.  Park  joined Kavlico in 1977 and holds 24
patents.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With Kavli's assistance, Park was able to stay in the United States to pursue his career.  He
preferred to stay here because Korea was under a "corrupt" military government in the 1970's,
where bribery was rife and "only people with connections had opportunity," he said.  "Here, if you
work hard you have opportunity.  People from outside really appreciate this society and this
culture."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>According to Kavli, Kyong Park was "instrumental" in the pressure sensor development that
brought Kavlico into the automotive pollution control market.  This has helped to propel
Kavlico's growth from $4 million in sales and 120 employees in 1977 to $150 million in sales and
1500 employees today.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Park was reticent to be interviewed, explaining that he does not seek special recognition for his
work.  But he did describe an experience at a recent company picnic.  A colleague pointed to the
3,000 employees and family members and told Park, "See, all these people are making a living
because of your hard work."  "I never thought of it that way," Park said.  "I felt good that I have
helped not just my family, but many of those people too."  (Kavli/Park joint patent 1988/4735098) 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Ram Labhaya Malik</u> </strong>of San Jose, California immigrated from India in 1971.  An engineer, he is
co-inventor of an air purification system now in use in the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a
front-line troop carrier.  The system protects personnel inside from nuclear, chemical and
biological contamination.  One of his co-inventors immigrated from the Netherlands, the other is
U.S.-born.  (1988/4793832)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Richard Baker</u></strong> is founder and president of Membrane Technologies of Menlo Park, California. 
A native of the United Kingdom, he came to the U.S. to pursue post-doctoral studies, was offered
a job and immigrated in 1966.  He holds a Ph.D. in chemistry and has 57 patents.  His company
employs 30 people.  Membrane Technologies produces and sells air purification systems and
conducts scientific research under government contract.  (1994/5364629)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Aleksander Owczarz</u></strong> is a mechanical engineer at Semitool Inc., a Kalispell, Montana company
that makes capital equipment for the semiconductor industry.  Dissatisfied with the system in
Poland ("It was not my cup of tea"), he emigrated in 1978 to seek new opportunity in the United
States.  He stopped counting his patents when his 25th was issued.  His latest patent is for a
precision cleaning machine for wafer boxes and wafer carriers.  Over 20 Semitool employees
work full-time manufacturing that machine.  It is sold in the U.S., Europe and Asia; sales were
$10 million in 1995 and are projected to grow to $15 million this year.  "It's not just bright
people" that lead to technological innovation, he said.  "The combination of bright individuals and
the right  environment is what makes people productive here."  (1994/5357991)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Ernesto Blanco</u></strong> immigrated from Cuba in 1960 and teaches engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  He holds thirteen patents.  In our sample, we found a design for a
flexible arm for medical endoscopes (diagnostic and surgical devices) that he and a student
created for Johnson &amp; Johnson.  Discussing the propensity of immigrants to work hard in
scientific and technological research, he said, "It's the environment here and the way we
immigrants think about the United States as a land where great inventions are being made. 
Immigrants feel the way to break the economic barrier is to invent something that will be of use to
large numbers of Americans.  We become worthy by using our brains."  (1994/5348259)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Anatoly Galperin</u></strong>, an engineer, came to the U.S. as a refugee from Russia in 1989.  He works
for the Miller Edge company in Concordville, Pennsylvania.  In Russia, he worked in
telecommunications; here, his field is sensors, including the invention found in our sample:  a
safety feature ("sensing edge") of mechanical doors sold throughout the U.S. and to some
overseas customers.  (1994/5299387)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Michael Pryor</u></strong> of Woodbridge, Connecticut immigrated from England in 1953 with a doctorate
in metallurgy.  He holds 130 U.S. patents, and became Vice President for Metals Research at the
Olin Corporation in 1973.  He is now retired.  At Olin, he calculated that the research department
he directed produced a three-to-one monetary return.  Its innovations include alloys,
manufacturing processes, and the process used to produce the metal composites needed to mint
quarters and dimes ever since the 90% silver-10% copper blend was discontinued.  Pryor
recruited both U.S.-born and immigrant scientists for his labs, and expressed particular admiration
for Indian and Asian metallurgists.  "I didn't hire immigrants because I wanted to," he said, "there
were just not enough U.S. citizens graduating to fill up the ranks -- there was too much
competition from other labs and universities."  (1988/4781050) 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Angela Michaels</u></strong> of Elkhart, Indiana is a chemist who works for the Bayer Corporation.  She
immigrated from Italy in 1962.  She holds six patents; all are in use in Bayer's products, including
"dip and read" urinalysis strips for kidney disease detection.   (1988/4717658)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Sung Kwon</u></strong> of Burnsville, Minnesota was among many inventors drawn to the United States for
educational opportunity.  After completing his undergraduate work at the best university in
Korea, he came to the University of Minnesota in 1965 to pursue the advanced engineering
studies that was "not available in Korea."  He is now employed at Thermo King Corporation (a
Westinghouse division) and holds seven US patents.  (1994/5288643)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Jacob Haller</u></strong> and his family immigrated to the United States from the former Yugoslavia in 1955. 
An engineer, he founded the Emconn Tool company of Wheeling, Illinois and holds six patents. 
Emconn makes equipment for the electrical connector industry; its customers are the major
telecommunications companies.  After building the company up to 20 employees, Haller sold the
manufacturing operation and now works with one other employee developing new products. 
(1988/4718167)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>David Lomas</u></strong> of Arlington Heights, Indiana is a chemical engineer with the UOP corporation. 
He came to the United States from England in 1973.  He holds over 30 patents; the invention in
our sample is a "catalytic cracking" process used in petroleum refining.  (1988/4757039)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Mohamed Hashem</u></strong>, a chemist, is an Egyptian-born immigrant working for the Rhone-Poulenc
corporation's unit in Cranbury, NJ.  He holds about two dozen patents, several of which are in
commercial use, principally polymers for paints and coatings.  (1988/4760152)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Ian Crawford</u></strong>, an electrical engineer from Scotland, was offered a job in the U.S. while here on a
sales trip in 1980.  Dissatisfied with the opportunities before him in Scotland, he took the job,
came to the United States and went on to found his own company.  Analog Modules of Orlando,
Florida  now employs over 60 people in the design, development and manufacture of laser
electronics.  (1994/5311353)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Mitchell Budniak</u></strong> of Skokie, Illinois is an electrical engineer who holds six patents.  He and his
parents were taken from their native Poland to Germany during World War II where, he said, his
parents "were basically slave labor."  When the war ended, Budniak was eleven years old, and
they came to the United States.    His patents include a blood analysis unit and a computerized
unit that monitors the vital signs of at-home patients and dispenses medication.  (1988/4740080)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The late <strong><u>Stephen Slovenkai</u></strong> of Leominster, Massachusetts had a 30-year chemical engineering
career, including a patent for a polymer fabrication method.  In 1940 at age 14, he came to the
United States from the former Czechoslovakia.  His family settled in northeastern Pennsylvania,
where his father worked as a coal miner and he graduated first in his high school class.  He joined
the U.S. Army and served in the postwar occupation forces in Italy.  (1988/4730027)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Ranjit Gill</u></strong> of Schenectady, New York is an engineer who immigrated from India in 1970.  The
invention we encountered in our study is a cooling system that his employer, GE, has put to use in
the world's largest electrical power generators, which are exported to Japan.  (1994/5374866)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Dodd Wing Fong</u></strong> of Naperville, Illinois is a chemist who came to the United States from Hong
Kong in 1962 to attend graduate school.  He holds over 70 patents; the one encountered in our
study is a polymer used in water purification.  (1988/4731419)

<p><em><strong><u>How this Study Was Conducted</em></u></strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Sample.</u> This study was performed by contacting inventors whose inventions resulted in U.S.
patents issued in 1988 and 1994.  To generate a random sample of 250 patents approved in 1988
and 1994, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution created a random list of patent numbers from
those years, and drew our sample from that list.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> This process generated patents issued to both
U.S. and foreign inventors.  Excluding the patents issued to inventors living overseas, we were
left with a sample of 122 1988 patents and 128 1994 patents.  The years 1988 and 1994 were
chosen to yield a sample  including both very recent patents and patents that might have been used
in commercial applications. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Canvassing.</u> Using the home addresses in the patent applications, we attempted to reach these
inventors by phone and/or letter.  When we could not reach an inventor by mail or telephone, or
through a representative such as a patent attorney, that patent was listed as "no response."  The
canvassing took place between January 15 and March 4, 1996.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Margin of error.</u> This survey's margin of error is 4.9% at a 95% confidence level.  That is, there is
95% likelihood that identical surveys will yield results within a range 4.9 percentage points higher
or lower than the result found here (19.2%, or 48 immigant inventors/250 patents).  Because we
effectively counted as non-immigrants those inventors who did not respond or could not be
reached, our finding of 19.2% immigrant inventors is probably conservative.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Five Reasons We Need To Cut Taxes</strong></h3>
<h4 align="center"><strong>Dr. John E. Berthoud, Vice President, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</strong></h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong>AdTI ISSUE BRIEF - No. 135</strong></h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong>October 18, 1996</strong></h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p></strong>The central policy debate in this fall's election has been about taxes and economic growth.  Bill
Clinton in the past has championed a reduction in federal taxation.  Bob Dole and Jack Kemp
have now made a new and much bolder call for a reduction in both the aggregate amount of
taxation as well as tax rates.  Their tax package is the central part of a plan to boost our current
2.3 percent rate of economic growth.  These calls for cutting taxes are correct, for five key
reasons.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Democrats and Republicans Have Made a Commitment to the American People in the
Past Two Elections.</strong> These commitments have been cornerstones around which Bill Clinton built
his electoral victory in 1992 and the Republicans built their Congressional victory in 1994.  For
that matter, George Bush promised to hold the line on taxes in 1988.  The American people voted
for these candidates on the expectation that they would deliver on their tax promises.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Bush and Clinton of course failed to deliver what they promised and in fact produced just the
opposite -- hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes.  The 104<sup>th</sup> Congress elected in 1994 tried
to deliver on its promise of tax relief, but it was vetoed by President Clinton.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The American people deserve what they have entrusted politicians to deliver -- much needed tax
relief.  And politicians should be mindful of the retaliation voters exacted at the polls after both
the Bush and Clinton reversals.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>2. A Responsible Congress Will Mean That The Tax Cut Will Have the Requisite Spending
Cuts and the Budget Will Balance.</strong> In the past, while tax cuts have generated some new
revenues by virtue of the economic growth they generated, Congress has balked at making the
spending cuts needed to fully pay for these cuts.  Thus, for example, in the 1980's the Congress
passed President Reagan's proposed tax cuts, but then never finished the spending cut job that
was needed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The 104<sup>th</sup> Congress has shown they are committed and can craft packages to make a significant
reduction in the growth of government.  The new crop of freshmen elected in 1994 recognized the
futility -- proven numerous times in recent years -- of raising taxes to balance the budget.  Last
year, Congress cut tens of billions of dollars in appropriations bills that Bill Clinton signed and
proposed hundreds of billions of dollars more in cuts in the reconciliation bill that the President
vetoed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>And of course, beyond the fact that we now have a more responsible Congress, the next President
of the United States will have a line-item veto with which he can cut pork barrel spending.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>3. The Take-Home Pay of Too Many Americans Has Been Stagnant Over The Past Several
Decades.</strong> One of the key themes of all major Presidential contenders in 1996 -- from Pat
Buchanan to Bill Clinton to Bob Dole -- has been the need for increasing GDP growth and raising
stagnant incomes.  A good target would be a return to the nearly 4% rate of real GDP growth
during the Reagan years, 1981-1988.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Concerns about aggregate growth are in turn translated down into worries about stagnant wages. 
While incomes have stagnated for many, the same is not true for government.  The "take-home
pay" for the federal government (total revenues) rose 82 percent in real terms from 1973 to 1996. 
All this new revenue, of course, was reflected in spending.  In 1996, the federal government will
spend approximately 89 percent more in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 1973.  Not many
American families can boast such a staggering increase in their consumption patterns over the past
23 years.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Clearly, part of the "incomes puzzle" that economists have pondered has been caused by the great
increase in societal resources being absorbed by government.  If government can relinquish its
grip on at least some of its share of the economy, numerous studies have shown that higher
growth rates will result.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>4. Taxes On the American Public Are Too High.</strong> While a host of economic arguments can be
made on behalf of the idea of cutting taxing and spending, there is a simple fairness issue as well. 
Government today is taking too much of the money earned by Americans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1996, the federal government will take over $1.4 trillion from taxpayers.  According to new
data from the Department of Commerce, federal, state, and local states consumed a record share
of GDP last year (higher even than at the height of World War II).  Thus, the average American
today pays more in taxes than they do for food, clothing, and housing combined.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> And defenders
of big government always forget the fact that the money belongs to the people.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For the future, over the period 1997 through 2002, absent policy changes, the federal government
will take an estimated <em>$10.2 trillion</em> from taxpayers.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> While some have labeled Dole's tax cut
proposal as risky, the real threat to the American economy comes not from trimming taxes by a
total of $550 billion between now and 2002, but by the damage that can be caused by the $10.2
trillion scheduled to be taken.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>5. We Owe It To Our Children.</strong> Long-term projections for federal entitlement finances are
dismal.  Both the Medicare and Social Security systems will face financing crises after the turn of
the century.  A properly designed tax cut that stimulates a long-term increase in economic growth,
combined with a reduction in government expenditures and entitlement reform is the only path to
restore the long-term financial security of our children.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Proponents of the status quo will argue that we can't cut taxes, because we can't reduce the
growth of government.  Additionally, they will make the claim that economic improvement can be
made through greater government involvement in the economy.  The reality is, however, that the
key to long-term economic growth lies in the hands of the private sector as it always has.  It is
time to shift more of our resources back where they belong.

<h4 align="center"><strong><u>The Lessons of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings</u></strong></h4>

<p align="center">John E. Berthoud

<p align="center">Vice President, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As the nation grapples with the federal deficit dilemma, it is critical that we understand the nature
of the problem and the limits to statutory remedies for it.  The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
reduction law provides the best example to date of these limits.

<p>Historically, the whole problem of deficit spending arose because of the Keynesian revolution. 
Keynes work in the 1930's led to the removal of the former taboo on deficit finance by convincing
leaders that governments, unlike households, do not have to maintain budget balance.  He claimed
that much of the debt run by government is burdenless, since we owe it to ourselves.  Government
fiscal policy should, according to Keynes, be counter-cyclical -- deficits or surpluses should be
strategically used to offset the natural oscillations of the economy.

<p>The problem came because while the theory looked good on the blackboards of Cambridge,
politicians got much greater short-term benefit from deficits than they did from surpluses.  Soon
after Keynes introduced his ideas, demands by constituents for spending and low taxes coupled
with little public concern (and often little understanding) about deficits or something called
"counter-cyclical policy" made unbalanced budgets natural for re-election driven politicians. 
Thus, the federal government has run deficits in 31 of the past 33 years.

<p>However, when deficits hit $200 billion in the early 1980's, there was finally motivation for
Congress to seek to reverse this pattern.  Partly out of true concern over such shocking numbers
and partly to have something to show to a public that was finally cognizant of the issue,
Gramm-Rudman was first passed in 1985.  The law altered the federal budget process by
attempting to make fighting deficits the primary consideration in the decisions of politicians.  The
timing and procedures of the budget process were revamped, deficit targets were set and enforced
through a new process called  "sequestration."  Sequestration was the elimination of any excess
deficit solely through spending cuts; half from some domestic programs -- entitlements and many
programs were exempt from cuts -- and half from defense.  Besides the specifics, the law itself
was to aid the fight as a symbol of the determination of the government.  The law was re-passed
in 1987 with rolled back deficit targets.

<p>There was great fanfare surrounding the law and we probably won't do much better statutorily
(even though Gramm-Rudman was flawed because of such problems as exempting large parts of
the budget from sequestration and because of its lack of efficacy once the fiscal year began).  So
the question remains, what did Gramm-Rudman do during its five year history until it met its
untimely death in the 1990 Budget Act?

<p>It is not enough to look at deficit or spending trends during the Gramm-Rudman era and
depending on the pattern one sees conclude that Gramm-Rudman worked or didn't.  After all,
there are too many other variables besides the nature of the budget process itself affecting these
aggregate numbers, including the rate of unemployment, the rate of economic growth, inflation,
and the Soviet military threat to name a few.  The task for social scientists is to isolate the role of
particular casual variables and undertake "counterfactual analysis" -- what would the world have
been like if everything else stayed the same but there was no Gramm-Rudman?  To achieve this,
historical trends of the relationship between relevant independent variables (all variable that
impact taxing, spending and deficits such as the variables for the domestic state of the economy,
variables for the foreign military threat, and variables for the political make-up of the U.S.
government) and dependent variables (taxes, spending and deficits) need to be established,
baselines then have to be created for what budgeting would have been like without
Gramm-Rudman and then the resulting estimates of spending, taxing, and deficits have to be
compared to actual history.

<p>The research for my just-completed dissertation did just this.  Through my regression analyses, a
series of interviews with budget insiders, and borrowing on the regression findings of Sung-Deuk
Hahm, Mark Kamlet, David Mowery and Tsai-Tsu Su, I was able to draw several conclusions:

<p>1. In terms of Gramm-Rudman's impact on deficits, the law possibly did have an effect, but only a
small one, along the lines of $15 billion per year, mainly through limiting spending.  The second
version of the law had more impact on deficits than did the original 1985 version.

<p>2. In terms of budgetary gamesmanship, Gramm-Rudman definitely spawned some, and possibly a
quite significant amount of budgetary chicanery.  Beyond abuse of the annual margin of error,
which was supposed to be a cushion for economic changes, but turned out to be simply a $10
billion extension of the deficit target, there was a statistically significant shift in spending from
programs subject to sequestration to those that were exempt.  Proponents of the former were
simply at a strategic disadvantage vis-a-vis supporters of the latter.  There also were numerous
small games (that I could find no macro statistically significant evidence for, but which interviews
with key budget players linked directly to the law) such as shifting programs off-budget and
shifting government pay days into the previous year when writing a budget so as to meet the
current year Gramm-Rudman target.  One Senate staffer, when discussing a shifted payday stated,
"Clearly the shifted payday was entirely Gramm-Rudman.  That was gamesmanship to deal with
an outlay imbalance.  You shift it into another year to free up space in this year's budget.  It was
part of a pattern of games invented during the Gramm-Rudman age."  Another staffer added,
"The law was the driving force.  The focus became how you meet the targets, not how you reduce
the deficit.  Reducing the deficit became a secondary consideration."

<p>Of course, by far the biggest game, and the downfall of the law, derived from the fact that it was
statutory and thus the targets could be rolled back when the political pressure got too high.  Most
probably, no matter what the scheme, politicians will find a way to play with the numbers to some
degree and not do absolutely the right thing.  But when a budget balancing law is only statutory,
this opens up a whole new dimension of games and can lead to the complete undoing of legislative
intent.  Such is the case here as the original law promised $0 deficits by now but of course we are
saddled with $300 billion-plus deficits, as far as the eye can see.

<p>Thus, proponents of controlling deficits by law should recognize the limits of statutory remedies. 
The meager results of Gramm-Rudman prove this.  If we really want to address the deficit, it is
time to amend the United States Constitution and permanently re-instate on politicians the
discipline of the pre-Keynesian era.

<h3 align="center">The Moral Imperative for a Tax Cut</h3>
<h4 align="center">Dr. John E. Berthoud, Vice President, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong>AdTI ISSUE BRIEF - No. 114</strong></h4>
<h4 align="center">November 20, 1995</h4>

<p><hr>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Congressional Democrats and some moderate Republicans have tried to make the case that while
the government is going through the "rigors" of lowering the growth of federal spending, it should
not be cutting taxes.  The argument is that at a time when some people have to take the pain of a
lost government job or a cutback in federal benefits, others should not get a reduction in taxes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This argument fails on two very significant grounds: economic and political.  Either of these
provide sufficient reason for Congress and the President to enact the tax cuts being currently
proposed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">The Economic Case

<p>In terms of economics, over the past twenty years, about the only grouping in society that has
done truly well in terms of income is government.  While incomes rose during the expansion years
of the 1980's, for many Americans over the entire period since 1973, income growth has been flat. 
Among the lowest forty percent of income earners, between 1973 and 1993, annual income
growth declined by about half a percentage point.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> President Clinton and Labor Secretary Reich
have made concern for boosting incomes, particularly of the middle-class, a central theme of their
speeches.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While incomes have stagnated for many, the same is not true for government.  The "take-home
pay" for the federal government (total revenues) rose 58 percent in real terms over the 1973-1993
period.  By 1995, the federal government was collecting approximately $1.346 trillion, 75 percent
more (in real terms) than 1973.  This new revenue, of course, was reflected in spending.  In 1995,
the federal government spent 88 percent more in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 1973.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
Not many American families can boast such a staggering increase in their consumption patterns
over a comparable period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="moralimp.gif" width="481" height="374" align="top" >

<p>Clearly, part of the "incomes puzzle" that economists have pondered has been caused by the great
increase in societal resources being absorbed by government.  If government can relinquish its
grip on at least some of its share of the economy, numerous studies have shown that higher
growth rates will result.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">Politics: Keeping Faith With the American People

<p>In terms of politics, the American people in 1990 and 1993 were sold a bad bill of goods.  Two
Presidents (one Republican and one Democrat) and the Congress proposed a bargain.  If the
American public agreed to hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes, Washington would cut
spending and bureaucrats.  The end result would be deficit reduction, or so the public was told.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The American people certainly upheld their end of the bargain, forking over ever-greater amounts
of their take-home pay.  What has Washington done?  Adjusting for inflation, non-defense
discretionary spending was 23 percent higher in 1995 than 1990.  The federal government spent
approximately $282 billion on domestic, non-entitlement programs in 1995 which is eight percent
higher in real terms than in 1993 when President Clinton assumed office.  What cuts that have
come over this five year period have come from defense.  In inflation-adjusted terms, the nation
spent 24 percent less on defense in 1995 than in 1990.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Like total spending, the bureaucracy of domestic agencies, far from contracting, has actually
grown over the past five years.   Since 1990, non-DOD employment has risen by 16,000 to a total
of 1,184,000.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> This increase has come despite protests from public employee union leaders that
the federal government has already been cutting their ranks to the bone.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Quite simply, in executing these budget deals, Washington politicians once again broke faith with
the American people.  Tax dollars were extorted for deficit reduction, but they ended up simply
fueling the growth of government.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The tax cuts proposed in Congress will only partly offset the hundreds in billions in new taxes
now being taken from the American people because of the 1990 and 1993 budget deals. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 1990 tax hike increased taxes by .54 percent
of GDP.  The 1993 tax hike increased taxes by .73 percent of GDP.  The proposed tax cut would
only lower taxes by .4 percent of GDP.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> Thus, these tax cuts will only roll back one-third of the
tax increases that have already been enacted in this decade.  Total federal revenues will rise from
$1.357 trillion this year to $1.820 trillion in 2002 -- hardly a recipe for starving the government.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were both elected on platforms of change.  The best
change they can make is to right the wrongs of these two previous budget deals and follow
through on the promises made in the 1992 and 1994 campaigns to cut taxes.

<h3 align="center">"How Special Interest Politics Slows Tax Reform"</h3>
<h4 align="center"><em>The Indianapolis Star</em>, Sunday, September 1, 1996, Page D3.</h4>
<h4 align="center">John Berthoud, Vice President, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The fortunes of the tax reform movement -- based around the idea of flattening marginal tax rates
-- have waxed and waned over the past couple of years since Dick Armey introduced his flat tax
bill in 1994.  The flat tax concept was perhaps the most ballyhooed idea in Washington politics in
1995, but it suffered a slow-down in political momentum in the early part of 1996.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>However, hopes for reformers have been reinvigorated by Bob Dole's tax proposal and his
promise that this package is the first step on the road to meaningful reform.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The idea of tax reform has great appeal, so the natural question arises, why have there been any
slippages in forward movement since 1994?  The answer lies in the politics surrounding the issue. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Most significantly, Washington special interests who believe they benefit from the status quo have
endeavored to slow the progress of tax reform.  And none has had a bigger presence in the battle
over tax reform than the 750,000-member National Association of Realtors.  The NAR's role in
this debate sheds light on what is wrong with business-as-usual in Washington.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The driving force for the Realtors' position is of course the home mortgage interest deduction. 
Such a deduction would disappear under the flat tax proposals of Dick Armey and Steve Forbes
and that has the Realtors' Washington lobbyists worried.  The NAR views the one out of four
households in America that takes the home mortgage interest deduction on their tax return as a
natural constituency and has tried to use this group as leverage.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During the presidential primary season, an NAR-front group euphemistically called the Coalition
to Preserve Home Ownership spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of ads decrying the effects
on the housing market of a flat tax which would end the home mortgage interest deduction.  The
ads compared the effects of eliminating the home mortgage interest deduction to that of a tornado
or other natural disaster.  The Realtors undertook mailings to home owners (especially in key
primary states), created video tapes, and even made audiotapes peddling their message on the flat
tax.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Inside the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress, besides having to fight Armey's flat tax, the Realtors have had to
contend with other ideas such as a 1995 Senate Finance Committee proposal which would have
paid for a pro-growth tax rate cut by lowering the limit for deductible interest on mortgages from
$1 million to $250,000.  In response to pressure from the Realtors, politicians, including many on
the key Senate tax-writing committees, fell into line and came out against lowering the mortgage
deduction limit.  The NAR, after all, contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to
congressional campaigns.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Besides these special efforts, the Realtors have regularly brought forth studies purporting to show
the beneficial impact on the housing market.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But any adverse impact of a flat tax on the real estate market will be offset by lower interest rates
which will occur because a flat tax ends taxation of all interest.  Professors Robert Hall and Alvin
Rabushka write, "The parallel removal of interest deduction and interest taxation under the flat
tax will bring about lower interest rates.  Lower interest rates reduce monthly mortgage
payments, which offsets the loss of mortgage interest deduction for most taxpayers."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>John Golob, an economist with the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, projects mortgage interest
rates would drop from 8% to 6% on 30-year home mortgages under a flat tax.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Will a stronger economy and lower interest rates completely make up for the loss of the
deduction?  Perhaps not in all cases, but consider the example of Canada which has no home
mortgage interest deduction but has a rate of home ownership that is similar to that in the United
States.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The facts notwithstanding, the Washington office of the NAR has fought against the flat tax tooth
and nail.  The actions of the Realtors during the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress should not surprise us.  Their
50-person Washington office has a $7 million budget and their power in past tax reform battles is
legendary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the 1986 tax reform effort, brief consideration was given to ending the home mortgage interest
deduction by Treasury officials, but President Reagan, after being brow-beaten by NAR lobbyists,
gave in on the deduction in a speech before the Realtors.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As the prospects for reform are again on the rise, we should expect a reinvigorated attack by
groups such as the NAR.  As in 1986, it will take real political courage and leadership to face to
the special interests, but if it can be done, the American people will benefit greatly.  And the
consequent political rewards for those who bring us tax reform could be even greater.

<h3 align="center">Ending State &amp; Local Income Tax Deductibility</h3>
<h4 align="center">John E. Berthoud</h4>
<h4 align="center">Vice President, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Free-market economists have long made the argument that individuals respond to incentives.  This
basic assumption is at the core of the entire flat tax movement.  There are many clear examples of
this in the private sector but the public sector follows the same dictates of rationality.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The 1986 federal tax reform created a disparity in federal tax treatment of state and local income
and sales taxes.  Prior to that, both were deductible on federal tax returns.  The 1986 reform
eliminated deductibility for state and local sales taxes but retained it for income and property
taxes.  For state politicians, many argued that this would create incentives for them to look more
to the income tax (property taxes are primarily local), since the net effect of raising a dollar of
revenue this way would be less painful (on the face of it) to their constituents.  After all,
constituents could continue to write off some of what they paid in state income tax, but this was
no longer true of sales taxes.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Analysis of state revenue legislation in recent years and in the final years before tax reform
indicates that politicians in the states have indeed responded to these incentives and have altered
their preferences between these two tax sources.  When states look to raise taxes, the income tax
has become much more popular relative to the sales tax.  In 1984-1986 (the final three years
before federal tax reform), income tax increases represented 30 percent of all sales or personal
income tax hikes enacted by the states.  By 1992-1994, that figure had risen to 43 percent.  In
1984 for instance, there were 13 sales tax increases adopted by states and only two income tax
increases.  Ten years later, there were 17 income tax increases but only 10 sales tax increases.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Likewise, when states are cutting taxes, prior to tax reform, income tax cuts were far more
popular among state politicians than sales tax cuts, but no more.  In the three years prior to tax
reform, income tax cuts represented 73 percent of all sales or personal income tax cuts.  That
figure dropped to 50 percent for the 1992-1994 period.  Again, 1984 and 1994 illustrate the point
-- in the former year, income tax cuts outnumbered sales tax cuts by a ratio of 2 to 1.  By 1994,
there were exactly as many of each.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>There are two fundamental problems -- economic and political -- with the federal government
leading states by the nose to shift their tax base towards income taxes.  First, this disparity in
deductibility encourages states to utilize taxes on productive activity rather than consumption and
the former are more economically damaging.  Comparative analysis by Dr. Richard Vedder of
Ohio University has shown that there is a very strong inverse statistical relationship between
income tax changes in the states and economic growth.  Vedder found only a weak inverse link
between sales taxes and economic growth.  Vedder's conclusion: "Policymakers can improve the
rate of economic growth by moving towards lower taxes on income."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>But beyond economics, in leading states to enact one kind of tax over another, the federal
government is engaging in a type of subtle coercion that undermines our federalist system.  As De
Tocqueville argued, if the central government, "after having established the general principles of
government . . . descended to the details of their application; and if, having regulated the great
interests of the country, it could descend to the circle of individual interests, freedom would soon
be banished from the New World."  This type of federal intrusion on state tax decisions is exactly
the type of arrogance that helped fuel the voter rebellion of 1994.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The solution to the problem is not a return to the deductibility of the sales tax, but elimination of
deductibility for all taxes.  Deductibility of any taxes provides incentives for states to tax and
spend more than they should.  By providing approximately $50 billion a year in tax relief to those
paying state and local income and property taxes, the federal government is easing the full impact
imposed by those levies.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Besides burdening citizens with too much government, state government largesse again slows
economic growth.  Vedder and others have clearly shown in cross-state comparisons that higher
state taxing and spending is associated with lower economic growth.  Vedder has demonstrated
this through complex regression analysis, but the findings are clear in more simplistic analysis of
states.  For example, Vedder has looked at the northeast and assessed trends over the past several
decades.  He points out that in 1960 New York levied a higher tax burden on its citizens than
surrounding states and while neighboring states raised taxes over the next three decades, New
York raised them even more, so the differential widened.  The result was that New York's rate of
per capita income growth was less than any of its neighbors.  New Jersey's per capita income,
below New York in 1960, surpassed it by 1990.  High-tax New York politicians in 1986 fought
for deductibility of taxes because there were political benefits from making their tax increases less
onerous.  The people of New York, however, ended up losers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Should Congress and the President ever get serious about tax reform, there are many special
breaks that must be eliminated.  It is hard to imagine that elimination of many would have greater
overall economic benefit than elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes, most
importantly, the income tax.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Are Human Health and the Environment Partisan?</strong></h3>
<h4 align="center">John Shanahan</h4>
<h4 align="center">Vice President and Counsel, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong>AdTI ISSUE BRIEF - No.  136</strong></h4>
<h4 align="center"><strong>October 21, 1996</strong></h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>Summary</strong>

<p>An analysis of Federal Election Commission records and internal Sierra Club documents reveals
the often partisan nature of environmental politics.  Environmental Political Action Committees
have spent $539,720 in the 1995-96 election cycle.  Of total PAC spending, 95.2% was spent to
aid Democrats and Independents, or to defeat Republicans.  In California, which had more
candidates supported by the PACs (37 of them, or 68.5% of the delegation) than any other state,
every candidate receiving aid is Democrat while the only candidate against whom money was
spent is Republican.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Sierra Club spent $313,326.  Of incumbents it endorsed, 90.9% are Democrat, 4.5% are
Independents, and 4.5% are Republicans. Of incumbents it targeted to defeat, 4% are Democrats
and 96% are Republicans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>I. Introduction</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The growing rhetoric by the environmental community that they must "take back" Congress raises
the question: take back from whom?  The membership of environmental organizations is made up
of large numbers from both major parties.  For instance, the National Wildlife Federation reports
that thirty percent of its members are Republicans.  To explore if environmental groups are
partisan or bi-partisan in their political support of candidates, this study examines the amount of
money given by environmental Political Action Committees (PACs), as well as the number of
candidates from each party endorsed by the politically active Sierra Club.  The findings indicate
strong leanings by these groups toward Democrats.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>II.  Methodology</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>This paper looks at the funding patterns of environmental PACs as well as internal campaign
strategy documents of the Sierra Club to discern a pattern of partisan support.  Funding was
determined by analyzing the latest  Federal Election Commission (FEC) records available of the
eight environmental groups that expended funds for the 1995-96 election cycle.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The analysis
includes not only contributions to candidates, but also independent expenditures on behalf of, or
against, candidates.  The groups reviewed were:<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Sierra Club Political Action Committee

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>League of Conservation Voters Political Action Committee (LCV Earth Fund)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>California League of Conservation Voters Political Action Committee

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>New York League of Conservation Voters Political Action Committee (Education fund)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Oregon League of Conservation Voters Political Action Committee

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Citizens for Waters Political Action Committee

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Ecology and Environment Committee 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Environment and Political Reform Political Action Committee

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Three internal documents of the Sierra Club also were reviewed.  The first is a June 1, 1996
memorandum on the subject of "Guide on Use of Various Kinds of Money," from the President of
the Sierra Club to "WOE Managers, WOE Team, Field Offices, WOE CSC, Conservation
Government Committee, EVEC Steering Committee, Chapters, and Chapter Staff in joint federal
/ state project locations."  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The second document is a June 3, 1996 memorandum on the subject of campaign strategy from
the Sierra Club's Conservation Director to the "Chapter Chairs, Chapter Conservation chairs,
Group Chairs, Board of Directors, RCC Chairs, WOE CSC, EVEC CSC, Conservation
Government Committee, Senior Volunteer list, Chapter Staff, and Conservation Staff." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The third document is a June 3, 1996 list of Congressional candidates entitled "Sierra Club Tier 1
Priority List."  This list identifies candidates that the Sierra Club opposes or supports. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>III.  Results of Analysis </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Federal Election Commission records on PAC money from 8 environmental groups showed:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Total money expended by the eight PACs: <em>$539,720</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Percent Of Contributions directly to or on behalf of campaigns (not including funds spent to
defeat specific candidates):

<p>Democrat <em>90.3%</em>

<p>Republican <strong> <em></strong>6.7%</em>

<p>Independent    <em>3.0%</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Percent of money spent to <em>defeat</em> specific candidates (which equaled <em>28.0%</em> of total PAC
spending) spent against each party:

<p>Democrat       <em>0.0%</em>

<p>Republican <em>100.0%</em>

<p>Independent     <em>0.0%</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Percent of total PAC money spent that was "anti-Republican" (contributions to or on behalf of
Republican opponents or spent independently against Republican candidates):  <em>95.2%<strong></em> </strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>States in which the most PAC funds were expended:

<p>Oregon <em>$311,090   or 57.6%  </em>

<p>California <em>$  53,158 or   9.9%</em>

<p>Illinois <em>$  26,854 or   5.0%</em>

<p>Michigan<em>$  20,706 or   3.8%</em>

<p>New York <em>$  20,391 or   3.8%</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In California, which had more candidates supported by environmental PACs than any other state
(37 candidates, or 68.5% of the delegation), every candidate receiving aid is Democrat while the
only candidate against whom money was spent is Republican. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>IV.  Results of Sierra Club Analysis</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Sierra Club internal documents and FEC records showed:<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Total money expended: <em>$313,326</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Percent of incumbents endorsed by Sierra Club for reelection, whose seats they want to "SAVE":

<p>Democrat <em>90.9%</em>

<p>Republican   <em>4.5%</em>

<p>Independent  <strong> <em></strong>4.5%</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

"TAKE BACK":

<p>Democrat  <em>4.0%</em>

<p>Republican <em>96.0%</em>

<p>Independent <strong> <em></strong>0.0%</em>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Internal Sierra Club documents make clear that the impact of environmental political activities is
much more than simply a function of funds expended.  For instance, the Sierra Club's
Conservation Director indicated that not only is the organization running paid advertisements for
and against various candidates, but has been actively seeking to "join with Public Citizen and LCV
to generate free media around the ad buys."  The Sierra Club also is conducting a vigorous
outreach program to groups such as hunters and anglers.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>All Sierra Club's expenditures on individual campaigns are merely the second stage of a two part
strategy.  The first part funded by the Sierra Club was the 1996 Environmental Public Education
Campaign (EPEC), which was a large public outreach campaign including media buys.  The
figures reported to the FEC merely indicate those funds which they are required by law to report
as they "now move into an effort to more directly educate voters on the political choices they face
in November."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Sierra Club's internal documents indicate their leanings and strategies.  The internal
memorandum from the Sierra Club's Conservation Director stated, "Throughout the Presidential
primaries our volunteers in New Hampshire and Iowa 'bird dogged' the Republican candidates by
appearing at public meetings and calling in to radio shows and asking the candidates pointed
questions about the environment. . . Throughout the remainder of the year we want to encourage
volunteers to bird dog their candidates."<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Sierra Club by implication identifies Republicans as "anti-environmentalists."  It criticized the
"Republican Study Conference" for issuing a booklet to members about the environment, stating
"we expect [to continue] to see anti-environmentalists trying to mislead the public with this
'greenscamming.'"<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><strong>V.  Conclusion</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Environmental groups in general, and the Sierra Club in particular, tend to display strong leanings
in favor of Democrats in their financial support, endorsements, and grassroots efforts in support
of candidates.  At a time when a great deal needs to be done by both parties working together to
refocus EPA on its core mission (protecting human health and cleaning up the environment) and
away from agency proposals driven by flawed science and special interests, it is unfortunate that
major environmental groups have turned this into a partisan issue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="N_1_">
<p>1. </a> The information is current as of October 11, 1996.  Although groups such as the
Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, and World Resources Institute did not contribute directly
through PACs, leaders of these organizations control the Board of Directors of the League of
Conservation Voters, which is one of the two biggest environmental PACS.
<a name="N_2_">
<p>2. </a> These groups represent all the strictly environmental PACs that were identified after a
thorough search.  No attempt was made to include non-single issue groups that devoted money
for environmental issues or media spots, even though substantial amounts of money have been
spent this way; these types of expenditures are not identified in Federal Election Commission
records in a manner that allows them to be broken out.  Note that the bulk of funds from the eight
organizations came from the Sierra Club PAC and League of Conservation Voters PAC.

<p align="center">Summary

<p align=:left">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last year helped create an innovative state-led group
to deal with the problem of smog in our cities that could have been a model for dealing with
highly technical environmental problems.  Now EPA itself stands as the biggest barrier to the
group's efforts to recommend more effective, cost-conscious, approaches to on-going progress in
reducing the nation's smog. Although the actions taken as a result of this group's work were
supposed to be based on the first comprehensive scientific assessment of the problem and
designed to meet specific air quality goals, EPA has consistently undermined the process.  Now
this initiative, which likely will cost billions of dollars and may be counterproductive, stands as a
model of how not to govern.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><hr>
</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The reinventing government initiative, at least in the environmental arena, has been a failure.  A
classic case in point is the initiative begun last year when the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) assembled a group to address America's smog problem (low-level ozone).  To date, the
process has been the fastest, most comprehensive, and decentralized air pollution analysis to date. 
Yet after having created this innovative process, the Administration, through a variety of means,
has undermined what it created.  Now this initiative represents more of a threat to the
environment and economy than a solution.

<p>Smog levels have been falling steadily across the country for some time, with a 12 percent
decrease over the last decade.  Even hazy Los Angeles has 25 percent fewer unsafe ozone days
than a few years ago.  And many major Northeastern cities, including New York City and
Washington, DC, have 70 percent fewer unsafe ozone days than 15 years ago.  In short, air
quality is substantially better across the country and rapid progress continues.  Instead of letting
that progress continue unimpeded, however, EPA last year made the questionable decision to
intervene and may have upset the apple cart. 

<p>EPA set up an advisory group called the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG), made up
of state environmental officials from the eastern half of the country.  The group has been meeting
since last June to model the way ozone travels across jurisdictions and then develop solutions
based on these models.  The group's recommendations will carry great weight in the directions
taken by States, which must make enforceable commitments by changing their State
Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet current standards.  So the integrity of the process is
important because implementing OTAG could have enormous implications for both the
environment and economy.

<p>OTAG held promise because it was run outside of Washington -- usually a good idea -- and the
recommendations were supposed to be based on solid science -- always a good idea. 
Unfortunately, what could have been a model for solving other complex, highly technical
environmental problems in the future has become mired in controversy and now represents a good
example of how not to govern.

<p>There are three main reasons OTAG has been undermined.  The first is that EPA may be trying to
skirt the requirements of an important law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act which
applies to groups advising federal agencies.  Industry groups have concerns over the legal
accountability of this unofficial organization and the lack of representation of those most affected
by the deliberations.  The suspicions are compounded by EPA's promise to spend $100,000 to
hire a public relations firm that would sell OTAG's so far nonexistent recommendations to the
public.  The PR firm will "educate" the public and press about the need for and benefits of
whatever measures OTAG comes up with. 

<p>The second problem is EPA's unreasonable timetable.  Due to unforeseen technical problems,
OTAG has fallen behind by a few months in its modeling efforts of how ozone flows, known as
ozone transport.  Illinois EPA Director Mary Gade, who heads up the OTAG effort, recently told
the World Conference on Transportation Fuel Quality that the modeling effort was slowed down
at times to get the science right.  She now expects recommendations incorporating the models will
not be ready until "the March-April timeframe." Yet OTAG has been pressured to develop its
recommendations by this December -- even though they would be without the assistance of the
models upon which OTAG's recommendations are supposed to be based.  If they do not,  EPA
has said it will ignore any belated guidance and impose its own solution, thus encouraging OTAG
to make December recommendations regardless of the science.  EPA watchdogs are very
concerned about this drift into unsound science to set policy, which has been a severe problem in
the bureaucracy for many years.  Since adopting OTAG's recommendation would likely impose
billions of dollars in costs on the economy, it's important that the policy meets the goal of cleaner
air, at a minimum, and not act as an impediment to the progress now being made.

<p>The third problem is that EPA recently announced it will reexamine ozone National Ambient Air
Quality Standards -- which are rules implementing the Clean Air Act -- leading experts to expect
EPA will propose tightening them further based on relatively thin scientific justification.  Even on
the worst days within existing legal limits,  the health effects of smog on the most sensitive people
are now minimal -- and nonexistent for most people.  Yet tightening the standards would
dramatically raise the cost of consumer goods such as electricity, gasoline, and cars. 

<p>Moreover, such a change would mean that OTAG's solutions, which are being designed to meet
the current ozone air quality standards, would be ineffective in reaching the new tighter standards. 
Worse, they may prove counterproductive.  Since pursuing OTAG's approach may preclude
taking another approach later, there would be fewer future choices available to EPA.  For
instance, the flexibility EPA would need to meet much stricter air quality standards could be
hamstrung by agreements EPA or the states reach with industry in implementing OTAG's
recommendations.

<p>If EPA is serious about a clean and healthy environment, it should become a partner in the process
of ensuring our air quality continues to improve, instead of being an active obstacle to that goal. 
Only then would the federal government truly begin to reinvent itself.

<h3 align="center">Firms Contend With Worst 10 Washington Regulations</h3>
<h4 align="center">By John Merline</h4>
<h4 align="center">Investor's Business Daily - August 20, 1996</h4>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Call it the top-10 list that doesn't leave you laughing.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Two free- market groups - the Virginia-based Alexis de Tocqueville Institution and the
Lewisville, Texas-based Institute for Policy Innovation - joined forces to ask like-minded experts
to come up with the 10 worst regulations from Washington.

<p>These rules, the report says, do little to improve the lives of Americans while costing taxpayers
and industry billions of dollars.

<p>A sampling:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>WETLANDS REGULATIONS. The regulatory machinery to protect wetlands stems from a
24-year- old law, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. It banned dumping dredged materials
into ''navigable'' waters without a federal permit.

<p>The law never mentioned ''wetlands,'' according to Jonathan Tolman, an environmental expert at
the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

<p>Over time, the meaning of the law stretched not only to include wetlands, but areas that aren't
even wet.

<p>Tolman says that permits to do work on wetlands take an average of more than a year to
complete, and then only a third are approved.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>OFF-LABEL DRUG USE REGULATION. Drugs approved for one use often end up getting
prescribed for others - a practice known as ''off-label'' use. It's legal to do so, but the FDA forbids
drug firms from advertising these uses.

<p>Aspirin companies, for example, can't tell people that taking the pain killer regularly can cut the
risk of heart attacks.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''By forbidding manufacturers from spreading the word, needless illnesses and deaths are
occurring,'' said Michael Herson of the de Tocqueville Institution.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SPECIAL EDUCATION. Federal rules often force local school systems to pay for disruptive kids
who meet special education requirements.

<p>A San Diego student's parents, for example, claimed their son, who had brought a gun to school
and was suspended, was disabled. The child won his readmission.

<p>In Virginia, the U.S. Department of Education forced the state to continue to pay education costs
for expelled special-ed students, although the kids were kicked out for behavior unrelated to their
learning disabilities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''By getting special treatment for conduct not related to their disability, special education students
are taught that they don't have to be responsible for their own behavior,'' said John Berthoud, vice
president of the de Tocqueville Institution.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>PEANUT PROGRAM. Peanuts are grown under a quota system managed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Prices are supported through price and import controls.

<p>As a result, the domestic peanut market has declined. Since 1990, the food use of peanuts has
declined more than 11%, the report said.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>DRUG APPROVAL. The Food and Drug Administration claims it has sharply cut the approval
times for new drugs and medical devices. Others disagree. They say approval times are still too
long and costly, forcing many U.S. firms to do research overseas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SUPERFUND. ''After 15 years of Superfund, the Environmental Protection Agency has not been
able to implement the statute effectively or efficiently,'' said Steven Milloy of the Environmental
Policy Analysis Network.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''The EPA tends to exaggerate site risks, frighten communities and waste public resources,'' he
added.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>TOXICS RELEASE INVENTORY. After the 1986 Bhopal tragedy, where an accident at a
pesticide plant killed 2,000 in India, Congress passed a bill to give people information about
hazardous chemicals in their community.

<p>The law forces industries to report any chemical releases or transfers each year to a federal
inventory.

<p>The EPA says it costs each plant about $3,500 to file a report on one chemical - with a total cost
of the program pegged at $546 million. The problem: the list can include substances that pose
little or no risk to humans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>''The benefits associated (with the program) have not been quantified, measured, or otherwise
directly or empirically evaluated,'' Milloy said.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>THE 60-40 RULE. The Department of Defense requires that no more than 40% of depot
maintenance work can be done by private firms. The Defense Department spends some $13 billion
on maintenance.

<p>Letting more private firms compete for the business could save up to $2 billion a year, argues
Loren Thompson of the de Tocqueville Institution.

<p>The other two rules on the list deal with second-hand smoke and the Delaney clause, which
banned any level of cancer-causing additives to food. As of yet, no regulations have been issued
on second-hand smoke. Congress repealed the Delaney clause last year.

<P>This book is an effort to explain what must be done to improve elementary and secondary education in the United States. In view of the thousands of publications devoted to this subject, let me begin by pointing out why this one differs fundamentally from the overwhelming majority and on a smaller but significant scale form the rest.  I shall then provide an overview of the topics to be discussed and the intended audience for this book.</P>
<P> Most other publications on educational reform (hereinafter referred to as &quot;conventional approaches&quot;) either accept the existing governance structure of public education or would increase producer control of it; the latter category includes proposals to &quot;increase teacher autonomy,&quot; or &quot;empower teachers,&quot; or otherwise weaken teacher accountability to parents or school board. In my opinion, educational reform cannot be achieved through these conventional approaches.</P>
<P> Such approaches emphasize the need for better school boards, more qualified teachers, higher teacher salaries, strong antidrug measures, more homework requirements, the elimination of superficial  courses, and strengthening student discipline, to mention just a few staples in the reform reports.  For the most part, the actions required would be taken at the local level.  The argument to be made here, however, is that any of the local actions required cannot be widely successful under our present system of education.</P>
<P> Essentially, the inability of local school boards to implement needed reform is due to three kinds of factors.  One kind is encompassed in the decision-making structure of education.   This structure includes but is not limited to the statutory provisions governing pupils, teachers, administrators, school board members, and support personnel; the ways funds for education are raised and distributed; and the legal requirements governing a broad range of educational and administrative affairs.</P>
<P> The second major set of factors blocking reform are the interests that would be adversely affected by it. The reformers typically rely on a vast uncoordinated effort by legislatures, governors, school boards, chief state school officers, institutions of higher education, teacher unions, foundations, and a host of other parties to work for common policies regardless of how the policies would affect each group's interests.  In addition to neglecting the role of interest groups, reform efforts also ignore the tremendous importance of the short-range view to most political and educational leaders and their much greater personal stake in the appearance of reform than in the reality of it.  What is to be done?</P>
<P> My view is that contrary to conventional reform proposals, the only ways to improve American education are to (1) foster private schools that compete with public schools and among themselves and/or (2) foster for-profit competition among service providers within the public school system.   Such competition might be structured at the state, school district, school, department, grade, and/or teacher level; as I see it, competition at any one of these levels could be beneficial under certain circumstances.</P>
<P> Both of these proposed ways to improve education require &quot;privatization.&quot;  As used herein, the term denotes transferring activities conducted by public employees to the private sector.   The activities transferred may include the funding as well as the actual delivery of services; in this analysis, however, the emphasis is on the delivery of educational services.</P>
<P> The relationships between privatization and educational choice are an integral part of my analysis.  &quot;Educational choice&quot; refers to choices made by students and/or parents. In some contexts &quot;educational choice&quot; denotes only choice of school, public or private.  But it can also refer to choice of program, course, or teacher.  These various choices have very different ramifications; for example, choice of public or private school has financial implications that are not present in choice of teachers or courses within a school.</P>
<P> Privatization and educational choice may or may not be interrelated in practice.   A school board that contracts out education of the disabled to a for-profit company is privatizing education; educational choice is not involved if the students are required to use the contractor's services.  If educational choices are restricted to options within public school systems, we would have &quot;choice,&quot; or some versions of it, without privatization.</P>
<P> Nevertheless, there are strong reasons to consider privatization and choice in the same analysis. The extent of privatization may limit choices.   For instance, under current circumstances at least, parents cannot  choose to provide their children with a denominational education in a public school.  One of the crucial issues to be explored is the extent to which privatization is essential to provide the kinds of choices parents and students wish to make.  In addition, privatization has significant implications for the cost, variety,  and quality of educational services provided in response to choice mechanisms in public and private schools.  Finally, the politics of educational choice is greatly affected by whether the choices are available in the private sector.  In brief, we must consider the specifics of choice from the provider as well as the consumer side in order to assess the potential of choice policies.  Choice of subjects or teachers within public schools differs more than it resembles choice of school, public or private.  Treating such widely disparate modes of choice as substitutes for each other can only lead to hopeless confusion.</P>
<P> The distinction between educational choice and vouchers should also be noted to provide a potential source of confusion.   Vouchers are defined as entitlements that may be used to implement educational choices.  Usually voucher plans envisage public financial assistance to attend a school of choice, but they could be used for other purposes as well.  For instance, vouchers might be used to pay for a course instead of enrollment as a full-time student.  Most forms of educational choice, such as choice of subject or teacher, are implemented without vouchers, but vouchers to cover the costs of education at a private school are the primary objective of the educational choice movement.  Partly for this reason, my discussion of educational choice emphasizes voucher issues.  Such issues have received a great deal of attention over a long period of time.  I discuss them here because previous discussions are deficient.  For instance, the literature on educational vouchers typically ignores the distinction between nonprofit and for-profit schools.  In my analysis, the distinction is crucial to the resolution of several basic issues in both privatization and voucher controversies.</P>

<P> Educators often view privatization as synonymous with educational vouchers or tuition tax credits.  In fact, however, privatization can be implemented in a variety of ways, some of which receive little or no attention in educational analysis.  These ways include:</P>
<P> 1.  Contracting (with independent contractors)</P>
<P> 2.  Vouchers</P>
<P> 3.  Load shedding</P>
<P> 4.  Franchising</P>
<P> 5.  Subsidies to non governmental suppliers.</P>
<P> 6.  voluntary service</P>
<P> 7.  Sale of government assets</P>
<P> 8.  Construction or purchase of public facilities with leaseback arrangements</P>
<P>Although the various forms of privatization will be discussed in more detail later on, a brief explanation of them here will help to clarify the discussion.</P>
<P> <I>Contracting out</I> of public services is defined as the contractual utilization of nongovernmental entities to provide or help to provide public services.  &quot;Nongovernmental entities&quot; can be companies, partnerships, individuals, nonprofit organizations, and/or independent contractors, whether for-profit or nonprofit. The test is whether the persons providing the service are school district employees.  If they are and are also acting in that capacity, their services are not contracted out.</P>
<P> Contracting out applies to support services as well as instruction.  In other words, the concept that applies to any activity required to provide education.  Furthermore, the contractor need not be a for-profit company or an individual entrepreneur.  Nonprofit organizations can and often do contract with public agencies to provide services.  We cannot assume, however, that the outcomes of privatization are the same for both nonprofit and for-profit service providers.  On the contrary, the distinction vitally affects some of the most important issues discussed in this book.</P>
<P> <I>Vouchers</I> are government payments to consumers or on behalf of consumers who may use the payment at any institution approved by government for the purpose of the voucher.  Thus in both contracting out and vouchers, government pays the service provider; under a voucher plan, however, parents choose the service provider.</P>
<P> Ordinarily, vouchers are assumed to be pieces of paper that can be used like cash or as a credit toward a purchase approved by the government; food stamps illustrate this point.  In education, however, vouchers are typically envisaged as a credit to be claimed by a school.  The parents choose the school, and the school would apply for the payment according to procedures established by statute and/or regulations.</P>
<P> <I>Load shedding</I> refers to government withdrawal from both funding and providing a service.  Although there is very little popular or academic support for educational load shedding at this time, my analysis will suggest some reasons support is likely to increase in the future.</P>
<P> A <I>franchise</I> is an arrangement whereby a private organization is awarded monopoly privileges to provide a service.  For example, a school district may allow McDonald's the right to operate the school cafeteria for a stipulated period of time.  Unlike vouchers, the consumer does not necessarily use funds provided by government to pay for the services.</P>
<P> <I>Subsidies</I> are government payments or credits to producers to minimize or eliminate the costs to service users.  In effect, tax exemptions for nonprofit schools are subsidies.  Education tax credits may also be considered to fall within this category of privatization.</P>
<P> <I>Voluntary service </I>is simply the provision of service by parents or other volunteers.  Home schooling and the presence of Planned Parenthood representatives in sex education courses illustrate this form of privatization.</P>
<P> <I>The sale of government assets</I> is a transfer of property rights to tangible assets from government to the private sector for an agreed upon price.</P>
<P> <I>Leaseback arrangements</I> are the construction or purchase of public facilities by private parties who then lease the facilities to public agencies under mutually agreed upon terms.  An example is a school district that cannot get voter approval required to build a new school and arranges for private construction - - after which the school leases the facility at a rental amount agree upon prior to construction.</P>
<P> In terms of relevance to public education, these forms of privatization vary widely.  It would be premature, however, to dismiss any of them as irrelevant to education.  Religious history provides an illustration of the possibility of a basic change in attitudes toward privatization.  In some countries religion was formerly a state affair.  Governments forced individuals to accept the state religion, and state supported schools fostered adherence to a state supported religion.</P>
<P> Today, however, religion has been left to individual decision and support in many of theses countries.  Although important differences still exist on the matter, the American people as a whole clearly support the privatization of religion; this support is frequently expressed as support for &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;  In terms of our categories of privatization, the separation of church and state is an example of load shedding - - that is, government withdrawal of support as well as provision of service,</P>
<P> Many persons who support the privatization of religion oppose the privatization of public education.  This is not necessarily an inconsistency.  It may make sense to support privatization in one field and oppose it in another, such as education.  Support or opposition should not be based on a preconceived idea that &quot;privatization&quot; is good or bad.  Instead, we should look to what is being privatized and why.  We should also consider how privatization is being implemented, since one way may be worthy of support but other ways may not.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Privatization Movement</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Whatever one's attitude toward privatization, it is a major economic and political movement in the United States.   There are a number of reasons why this is so.  First, a number of foundations and policy institutes are actively encouraging it.  The Reason Foundation, a free enterprise oriented foundation that has supported research on privatization for several years, publishes an annual report on privatization.  Its 1986 report lists the following foundations, policy institutes, and research organizations as active in the privatization movement:</P>
<P> Academy for State and Local Government</P>
<P> Adam Smith Institute - USA</P>
<P> American Legislative Exchange Council</P>
<P> Cato Institute</P>
<P> Center for the Study of Market Alternatives </P>
<P> Citizens for a Sound Economy</P>
<P> Council of State Governments</P>
<P> Council on Municipal Performance</P>
<P> Heartland Institute</P>
<P> Heritage Foundation</P>
<P> International City Management Association</P>
<P>  Manhattan Institute for Policy Research</P>
<P> National Center for Privatization</P>
<P> National Center for Policy Analysis</P>
<P> Political Economy Research Center</P>
<P> Privatization Council Inc.</P>
<P> Reason Foundation</P>
<P> Sequoia Institute</P>
<P> Urban Institute</P>
<P> Privatization Research Organization, Pubic Management Center, Baruch  College, CUNY</P>
<P> In addition, university departments, such as those devoted to health care or transportation, and various centers not devoted primarily to privatization frequently sponsor research and service activities on privatization issues.  Elsewhere, university centers with a broader agenda, such as public policy or public administration, are also active on privatization issues.  In addition, the Reason Foundation's annual survey lists eight trade associations that are actively promoting privatization as well as several others less systematically involved.  Journals devoted exclusively or substantially to privatization have also been established recently - <I>Privatization Review, State and Local Government, and Fiscal Watchdog</I>.  Furthermore, articles about privatization have become commonplace in a wide range of journals.  Influential mass media have also devoted increasing attention to privatization developments; between November 2, 1985 and January 20, 1986, at least twenty-six articles on privatization appeared in the <I>New York Times, Washington Post, </I> and the <I>Wall Street </I><I>Journal.</I></P>
<P> Significantly, the privatization movement is not confined or even centered in the United States; it is worldwide in scope, with the &quot;privatizers&quot; achieving greater influence in all geographical areas.  Although the most publicized developments have been the expansion of the private sector in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, a trend toward privatization is evident in every continent and within nations of widely different political systems.  This is not to say that the trend toward privatization characterizes every nation or that is may not be halted or even reversed in some nations; on the other hand, there is no question that we are witnessing a worldwide trend toward private instead of government service delivery.</P>
<P> What are the reasons for the growth of the privatization movement? One is the allegedly greater efficiency of the private sector; the case for regarding this  reason as relevant to public education will be considered in subsequent chapters.  In the context of privatization, however, &quot;increased efficiency&quot; is not just a fiscal concept.  Instead, it should be viewed as a response to widespread dissatisfaction with government services; the belief that the private sector can deliver services more economically is only one factor underlying the growth of privatization.</P>
<P> This growth has an intellectual base in the &quot;public choice&quot; approach to government decision making.  Simply stated, public choice theory asserts that the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats can be explained by the same principles that govern behavior in private economic affairs.  In the latter, persons generally act so as to enhance their self-interest.  According to public choice theorists, public officials also act in this way:  They act either to get reelected or to enhance their pay, perquisites, and status.  These are said to dominate political as well as economic activity.  Needless to say, this view of public affairs is consistent with our recent widespread disenchantment with political leaders and public services.  It may also help to explain the growing interest in- using market systems to deliver public services that are funded by government.</P>
<P> The public choice framework has its critics, but it is widely recognized as an important perspective from which to analyze the conduct of public officials.  The perspective does not assume that a calculus of self-interest determines all decision making by public officials.  Nevertheless, it does offer a rational explanation for our persistent inability to solve long-standing social problems by means of government services.  To put it in the educational context, public choice theory suggests that the obstacles to educational reform may be inherent in government delivery of services.  Obviously, if this should be the case, policies that do not privatize education are bound to fail.  The fact that public choice theory is at least as applicable to public education as to any other public service gives this possibility added significance.</P>
<P> Privatization also has roots in studies of the political role of interest groups.  Such groups are often viewed as manipulating our political processes to their own advantage but to the public's disadvantage.  By having certain decisions made in the political instead of the economic system, privatization seeks to avoid such subordination of the public interest.</P>
<P> As we shall see, privatization faces vigorous intellectual as well as political opposition, at least in the United States.  Proponents and opponents agree on the dangers of ideological rigidity and the importance of evaluating proposals on the basis of their specific features and circumstances.  Unfortunately, as evidenced by the way they consistently disagree over just about everything else, partisans on both sides tend to ignore this advice as soon as they have given it.</P>
<P> At any rate, neither the broad arguments for nor against privatization are equally applicable to all its forms, or to specific proposals within each category.  Assessing privatization proposals in the context of public education often turns out to be an extremely complex task.  In many cases the complexity results as much or more from the difficulties of assessing the status quo as form the uncertain consequences of privatization.  Understandably, persons strongly critical of the educational status quo are more willing to run the risks of changing it.  For this author at leas, the deficiencies of public education are less acceptable than are the uncertain ones of changing our educational system.  There is, however, a critical difference between accepting policies despite risks that are understood and accepting them because of failure to understand the risks in the first place.  Essential, in this book my objective is to provide a broader understanding of privatization issues, not to convert readers.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>To Whom Is This Book Addressed</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The intended audience for this book has perhaps only one common characteristic:  an interest in improving elementary and secondary education.</P>
<P>Within this large and diverse group, I hope to reach the leaders who are especially situated to act on or influence the issues discussed herein.  Realistically, this means state leaders, because education is primarily a state responsibility in the United States; while changes are needed at the local level, such changes are usually dependent on system changes at the state level, such changes are usually dependent on system changes at the state level.  Consequently, my analysis is addressed to state leaders with the poser to implement such changes.</P>
<P> In this respect, the analysis differs from reform proposals that envisage parents and taxpayers persuading their local school boards to initiate need reforms.  Later on I shall suggest some actions at the local level that might improve matters, but I emphasize the limited effectiveness of such action more than its potentially beneficial outcomes.  Local action is essential to improving education, but such action must focus primarily on support for changing our system of state regulation, financial support, and governance of local school districts.</P>
<P> Similarly, federal officials can influence but not effectuate the needed system changes.  Federal leverage on states and local school districts consists of making funds available if recipients adopt certain policies or practices.  As federal funds for education decline, as compliance with federal mandates or incentives is difficult to monitor, and as federally sponsored policies are the most difficult to enact or change, this approach offers little prospect for achieving education reform.  In short, if system change is needed, the movers and shakers will be found primarily among political and educational leaders at the state level.</P>
<P> Despite the importance of state leadership, my target audience is a much broader group.  Business leadership is becoming increasingly concerned about the effectiveness of our educational system.  If that concern is to lead to improvement, it must be based on an accurate diagnosis of what must be done and by whom; such a diagnosis requires that business leaders understand both the underlying obstacles to educational improvement and the strategic role of state action in overcoming them.</P>
<P> School boards, school administrators, teachers, and parents are not in a position to achieve more than marginal improvements as matters stand.  Often any improvements are achieved only by actions that result in marginal deterioration elsewhere - - districts that hire good teachers or administrators from other districts improve their own situation by actions that weaken others.  Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons for addressing this book to this wider audience.  First, state leaders are unlikely to bring about the changes required without a significant measure of support form the educational community.  Changes that are overwhelmingly opposed by local school boards, school administrators, teacher unions, and parents are much less likely to be implemented than changes that command some significant level of support among one or more of these groups.  Eventually the educational community will have to confront the system issues either on its own initiative or, as is regrettably more likely, that of others.  Whatever the circumstances, well-informed followers as well as leaders will be essential; it is hoped that the analysis will help to create both.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Why Reforms Fail:  An Illustrative Scenario</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Obviously, whatever school deficiencies exist have a past.  In some cases erroneous policies were decades or even generations ago.  Others may have been initiated more recently.  For whatever reason, educational authorities once deemed them to be the right course of action.  A policy that is harmful now may have been the right one when it was initiated; the underlying circumstances may have changed.  Or the policy may have been based on the best information available at the time; now, in the light of better information, a policy change may be needed.  Unfortunately, change frequently turns out to be impossible under current circumstances.  Let us see why this is the case.</P>
<P> Suppose you are a concerned parent who wants your school board to adopt two reforms widely advocated by educational reformers.  First, you want to strengthen the mathematics curriculum.  Second, you want to introduce merit pay for teachers (a system that pays good teachers more than average or poor ones).</P>
<P> For the sake of argument, let us assume that these changes should receive a high priority.  Unfortunately, the incumbent school board does not share this view.  You and a fellow citizen who shares your views therefore become candidates for the school board.  One year after you became active on the issue, you and your colleague are elected to the school board.</P>
<P> About 94 percent of the school boards in the United States have five to nine members; there is an almost equal division among boards with five, seven, or nine members.  Let us, therefore, assume that you now have two votes on a seven-member school board.  Undaunted, you organize a caucus that elects two additional board member in the next election, which takes place two years after your own.  It has been a long, hard struggle, but you are now the leader of a majority on the board committed to the reforms you seek.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, you are still unable to implement your proposed changes in the mathematics curriculum.  Such implementation requires changing the district-adopted textbooks as well as retraining most of the mathematics teachers.  Neither action is easy to accomplish.  Any textbooks adopted by the board have to be included on a state-approved list.  The textbooks you would like to adopt are not on the list.  As the state textbook commission revises the list each course every five years, you may have to wait several years before the mathematics textbooks are reviewed again.  Since there is no assurance that the textbooks you prefer will be included on the new state-approved list, you decide to press for adoption of a less preferred series of mathematics textbooks and turn your attention to training your teachers to use them.</P>
<P> The teachers, comfortable with the current texts and uninterested in learning to use a new series, have been opposed to any change for the outset.  Their union insists that any in-service training to use the new series effectively be provided during the regular school day at board expense.  Needless to say, the disruption of regular classes may be quite expensive.  After training is provided at board expense, the newly trained teachers may leave for better jobs.  The older mathematics teachers may be nearing retirement, so there may be little return on any district investment in their in-service education.  The new board members may also be committed to a sex education program that would require most of the board's discretionary funds.  The upshot is that several years have gone by and your goal of improving the mathematics curriculum is not much closer to reality than it was at the beginning of your efforts.</P>
<P> Meanwhile, your plan to pay good teachers more than average or ones has encountered even greater difficulties.  Again, let us pick up the course of events after you have achieved a bard majority.  Although four years have elapsed since you became an activist on the issue, you can do absolutely nothing about it until the collective bargaining contract with your teachers' union expires, which will be in two years.  Salary incentive plans are a mandatory subject of bargaining, so you must bargain on your merit pay proposals before you can implement them.</P>
<P> Prior to the expiration of the teacher contract, you discover that your administrative staff does not really support merit pay for teachers.  While that staff cautioned you that the teacher union would oppose it, it now becomes evident that they also oppose merit pay.  The principals believe strongly that they will upset nine teachers for every one they recommend for merit pay. Your negotiating team responds very slowly and very cautiously to your request for some concrete proposals on the subject.  Also, you discover that what concerns the administrative staff as much as anything is the fact that their teacher evaluations will be scrutinized intensively if merit pay is implemented.  Consequently, you begin to appreciate something that was not apparent at the outset:  Merit pay is a severe test of administrative judgment and competence.  At bottom, administrators prefer to avoid this test, but they also wanted to avoid expressing this preference.  After all, their tenure, salary raises, and promotional opportunities depend on the school board, so they have avoided open opposition to its policies.  Nevertheless, their foot dragging has become too obvious to be ignored.</P>
<P> In at least one respect, the administration has advised you correctly:  The teachers' union is adamantly opposed to merit pay.  In fact, the union has privately and publicly emphasized that it will strike, if necessary, to force the board to drop its merit pay proposals.  Moreover, while the entire agreement is being held hostage to this issue, the union has launched an aggressive campaign depicting you and your fellow board members of scheming to reward board lackeys and undermine the union by rewarding antiunion and nonunion teachers.</P>
<P> As the impasse drags on and your fellow board members become increasingly reluctant to insist on merit pay, effort consists of an off-the-record meeting with the union president alone in order to ensure candor.</P>
<P> Candor is what you get.  The union president says flatly (but off the record) that the union is not overly concerned about merit pay for bootlickers or antiunion teachers.  On the contrary, it is more concerned that merit pay would be implemented objectively.  &quot;If you award $3,000 more to ten outstanding teachers, there will be ninety others who believe, rightly or wrongly, that they deserve it as much or more than the recipients.  They will come to me as union president and ask me to do something about it.  What can I do?  I'm not going to tell them the $3,000 was awarded fairly and they have no case.  That's not the way I got to be a union representative and  it's not the way I'll continue to be a union representative.&quot;</P>
<P> You ask why the union can't agree to merit pay with an appeal procedure for teachers who regard themselves as unfairly passed over.  The union president points out that such appeals would place the union in the middle of a battle between union members.  The union would either have to support the teacher who is appealing or the teacher(s) who allegedly did not deserve merit pay  as much as the appellant - - a no-win situation for the union.  The only way to avoid it is to avoid merit pay, at least in cases where local administrators are responsible for deciding who receives it.</P>
<P> &quot;Do not forget,&quot; the union president continues, &quot; the union is a political organization.  It's controlled on the basis of one person, one vote.  Union members aren't interested in large rewards for a few members.  They are interested in more for themselves, not rhetoric about the need to reward the better workers.  That stuff is for kids, not teachers.  Think of my situation as if I were a political leader, which I am essentially.  Political leaders are concerned that no small group of constituents be perceived as benefiting excessively compared to others.  I have the same problem with merit pay, except that the small group of constituent receiving excessive benefits is not a geographical or separate interest group.&quot;</P>
<P> &quot;I have several other objections,&quot; the president continues, &quot;but let me ask you a question.  How will you know whether merit pay is 'successful'?  You might be able to ram it down my throat, although I doubt it; after all, no other school district in the area has it, and you're going to look worse every day holding out for something that is not included in any other contract in the area.  Sure, the idea seems like common sense, but when we hit the bricks, the parents aren't going to support you.  They'll be much more concerned about getting their kids back in school than about merit pay.  Most people don't work under merit plans anyway.  But my question is this:  What do you expect to gain from all this that is worth the headache - - and when do you expect to get it?  The headache is now - - I doubt whether you will even be around when it comes time to evaluate the plan in a way we could both accept.&quot;</P>
<P> You were going to say that the benefits would be visible immediately as teachers worked harder to receive the additional cash.  Now this response seems unrealistic, perhaps even naive, so instead, you thank the union president for being candid and depart.  The futility of what you are (or were) trying to do seems so obvious - - why was it not obvious before you had wasted all this time and effort?  And if you could just get your hands on the prestigious educational reformers who had peddled this snake oil from one end of the country to the other, you would tell them a thing or two.  Unfortunately, your immediate problem is how to abandon merit pay without antagonizing your supporters and appearing to have knuckled under to the union.  The board and the union accept the contract without merit pay but with an agreement to appoint a joint committee to study the problem and submit their recommendations before the next contract negotiations.  The same education reporters who naively believed the union really feared favoritism treat this like a statesmanlike compromise, and the issue never comes up again.</P>
<P> The preceding scenario is intended to illustrate the rationale that underlies my analysis.  To begin with, my analysis treats the interest group stake in reform (or in blocking reform) as just as important as educational policies to be initiated, changed, or terminated.  Furthermore, conventional approaches assume that the changes required can be made within the existing governance structure of education.  This assumption is not explicit, but it is a logical inference from their neglect of governance issues.  In contrast, the approach adopted here assumes that a laundry list of educational changes is inadequate for two reasons.  First, without basic changes in the way educational decisions are made, it is virtually impossible to implement them, regardless of their merit.  Second, even if the proposed changes could be implemented, it would soon be necessary to eliminate or modify many of them.  Consequently, we would soon find ourselves in a situation similar to the one in which we find ourselves today.</P>
<P> Let us bear in mind what is at stake here.  Suppose that by waving a magic wand we could effectuate the agenda recommended by the reformers.  Several recommendations make no sense and/or are inconsistent with each other, but let us assume that all embody the best thinking on the issues currently available.  Over time, and not much time at that, we would want to change or eliminate some of the policies.  New information, new technologies, new careers, new educational and economic demands, new civic and cultural developments, new demographic situations - - all would require changes in our educational system.  As our scenario suggests, however, it would be practically impossible to effectuate them.</P>
<P> This is not idle speculation.  Most recent reform proposals are not new.  Many are simply reiterations of policies proposed decades, even generations, ago.  In my opinion, many of these policies will never be implemented under our existing governance structure, but let us waive the point.  Instead let us assume that at some point in the future, near or remote, the proposed reforms have been achieve.  For conventional reform, this would be the end of the matter.  Yet a critically important question is left unanswered:  What can and should be done to ensure that the system does not deteriorate again?  Clearly, our existing system of education is inadequate protection against deterioration; we already have it.  Of course, no system can guarantee good results in all cases and situations, but what will prevent slippage if improvements are made?</P>
<P> Conventional approaches have no answer to this question because they have never raided it.  What is needed, however, is an educational system that will generate continuous improvement, either in educational outcomes or in our efficiency in achieving them.  As education analyst Ted Kolderie has suggested, the basic issue is not how to improve the educational system; it is how to develop a system that seeks improvement.</P>
<P> To illustrate, Americans who study the Japanese educational system usually reach two conclusions about it.  One is that the system is extremely successful in meeting the objectives of literacy and academic competence.  The other is that Japanese education is characterized by an emphasis on competition and testing that would supposedly be undesirable, not to say intolerable, in the United States.  I do not intend to advocate this emphasis here but simply to comment on one aspect of it.  If we do not rely on frequent testing and public awareness of results, what should we rely on to maintain the pressure on all concerned to get the job done effectively?  In the reform literature, specific proposals simply do not come to grips with this issue.  To resolve it, we need to change our decision-making system in education.  At least, that is a possibility to be explored in the following chapters.</P>
<P> From this perspective, we can fairly asset that educational reformers show a pervasive bias in favor of the status quo.  At first glance the assertion seems paradoxical, even contradictory.  Minimally, a &quot;reform&quot; is a proposed change:  How can reformers be charged with supporting the status quo?  The bias in favor of the status quo, however, refers to the bias in favor of the existing decision-making structure of education.  The reformers are trying to change policies that cannot be changed within a governance structure that is taken for granted.  In this respect they are like the critics who point to deficiencies in the federal budget but are silent on the budget-making process that underlies those deficiencies.  Analogously, it will be argued that educational reform must focus on the educational policy-making process itself, not the specific policies emerging from the process.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Plan of This Book</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The modes of privatization have different utility and political prospects from state to state.  In many states, however, the most promising approach to privatization in the near future will be through purchasing instructional services from independent contractors instead of teachers.  Consequently, chapter 2 is devoted to the rationale for contracting out, its development in other public services, and its advantages and disadvantages, both generally and in public education.  Chapter 3 continues this discussion by focusing on two issues that are critical to all forms of privatization:  comparative costs and the evaluation of outcomes.  Chapter 4 is devoted to previous efforts to contract out instruction and to issues that must be resolved to do so more effectively in the future.  These issues illustrate again the fact that effective action at the local level usually requires changes in the state framework for education.</P>
<P> Chapter 5 opens up the discussion of educational choice.  Proposals to empower parents to choose the schools, public or private, that their children will attend are considered first.  After explaining why my analysis will be limited to voucher plans, the chapter sets for the argument that educational vouchers would result in educational improvement.  This argument is essentially an illustration of the voice or exit controversy that has dominated policy analysts in recent years.</P>
<P> Chapter 6 focuses on the competition issues raised by voucher proposals.  It first discusses the potentially negative effects of the competition anticipated to result from voucher plans and then probes whether competition would really result.  The suggestion is that the nonprofit status of private schools would be a major limiting factor in this regard.  This possibility leads to consideration of the role of schools for profit in voucher plans.</P>
<P> In chapter 7 I take up four additional independent arguments for vouchers.  My objectives are to explain their rationale, their implications for voucher plans and for policy.  Chapter 8 is devoted mainly to a political analysis of voucher plans and an assessment of their chances for enactment.</P>
<P> Chapter 8 raises the broad issue of whether privatization in education will develop as a cottage industry or as a large-scale enterprise.  Experience in education and in other fields, especially the health industries, is cited to show that both approaches are likely to emerge, depending on the particular activity that is privatized.  The possibilities of franchising certain kinds of educational services are also explored in this chapter.</P>
<P> Chapter 10 is devoted to load shedding - - proposals that government withdraw support as well as provision for education.  The home schooling movement is analyzed to illustrate the possibilities in this neglected mode of privatization.  The conclusion is that load shedding has much greater potential than is commonly realized, especially if its substantive and tactical flexibility are clearly understood and there is adequate recognition of demographic and social changes affecting load-shedding issues.</P>
<P> Chapter 11 analyzes the ethical and professional issues raised by privatization in education.  These issues do not simply emerge as a consequence of privatization; they often constitute barriers to it when they are perceived as not being subject to satisfactory resolution.  Because certain issues frequently arise under different modes of privatization, they are considered generally, not in the context of any specific way of privatizing.  The analysis then concludes by suggesting a rationale for privatizing education that is ignored in the field of education but widely accepted outside of it. </P>
<P> Most emphatically, this analysis is not presented as an infallible guide to educational improvement.  It is presented to suggest the policies that offer the best chance of improving education, but &quot;the best chance&quot; may not even be a fifty-fifty one.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Two Caveats</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The chapters that follow recommend a more significant educational role for privatization, competition, and profit-making organizations in the field of education.  The recommendations apply, however, only to certain circumstances; frequently it is impossible to say how widely these circumstances prevail or can reasonably be made to prevail.</P>
<P> One additional cautionary note cannot be over-emphasized.  This is the danger of applying a double standard, or an unrealistic standard, to the policies recommended.  For example, reliance on for-profit organizations to perform a service does not guarantee that the service will always be provided satisfactorily.  No approach ensures perfection, and no approach should be unacceptable because it fails on occasion.  The policies proposed here may or may not make sense, but they should not be held to a standard that is impossible for any policy to meet.  Our options are not between policies that are always successful and policies that are not.  It is between two or more policies, each with some desirable and some undesirable consequences - - and often with some unknown ones also.  Formulating sound policy is difficult in any case; it is hopeless if the standard for evaluating the status quo tolerate a variety of undesirable consequences while those for evaluating proposed changes tolerate none.  I will return to this problem later, but sensitivity to it is essential throughout this analysis.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>2 Should Government buy or Make Education</B></FONT></A></H2>
<P> We begin with a simple question that has perhaps several complex answers.  Should governments (primarily states and school districts) buy education?  Or should they make it?  Before attempting to answer this question, let me first try to clarify it.</P>
<P> At a personal level, the ubiquity of the buy-or-make decision is taken for granted.  Eat in or eat out, wash one's dirty clothes or take them to a laundry, repair a garment or leave it with a tailor -- such decisions are made every day.  Likewise, there is widespread recognition of the fact that companies face similar decisions on a daily basis.  Should company reports be printed in-house or contracted out?  Should cleaning and custodial services be provided by employees or contractors?  Should employees be asked to work overtime or should an independent contractor be asked to provide temporary help?  Should the company have guards or should it hire a security agency that will in turn employ guards?  As in personal life, corporate (and public agency) make-or-buy decisions are pervasive.  While a particular decision may be controversial, the need to make them frequently is not.</P>
<P> When governments are involved, the decision is inherently political as well as economic.  This dual nature of the decision often complicates it in ways that do not arise, or are not so critical, when the decision is made by individuals or companies.  Although contracting out always has economic consequences, government officials often subordinate such consequences to political ones.  For this reason, the political dimensions of contracting out public services are at least as important as the economic ones.</P>
<P> I do not mean to suggest that make-or-buy decisions in the private sector are always purely economic ones.  Corporations as well as individuals sometimes make these decisions on non economic grounds.  In fact, the greater the economic consequences of an economic decision, the more likely it is to involve political considerations of some kind.</P>
<P> From a legal standpoint, the make-or-buy decision involves the distinction between employees and independent contractors.  Although the distinction can be difficult to make in borderline cases, it is usually clear in practice.  Employees are subject to the control and direction of the employer; independent contractors are employed to provide a service, but they exercise a high degree of independence in doing so.  If you hire a secretary to work in your office, he or she will ordinarily be an employee.  On the other hand, if you employ a secretary to perform secretarial services in an office he or she owns, and the work is performed without your on-site supervision, the secretary is an independent contractor.  </P>
<P> In brief, both employees and independent contractors perform services under contract; if the individual(s) performing the services have legal control over how the service is to be performed, they are independent contractors.  If the service buyer controls both what is to be done and how, the persons performing the services are employees.</P>
<P> In some situations, individuals will perform services as employees at certain times and as independent contractors at others.  An example outside the field of education illustrates this possibility.   Public transportation companies often experience severe employment problems as the result of their rush-hour needs.  If they use employees to cover rush hours, the companies may be forced to pay the employees for unnecessary layover time.  Or because the use of their employees may require excessive overtime pay, companies may employ independent contractors to perform rush-hour services.  Regular company employees may be allowed to bid on contracts for rush-hour services as independent contractors.  If successful, they serve as regular employees at certain times and as independent contractors at others.  As we shall see, similar possibilities could arise in education.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Make-or-Buy Decision in Public Education</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Let us first consider the make-or-buy decision from a state perspective Public education is a state function in the United States.  As noted previously, the states establish most of the legal operational framework for education.  Also, the states provide more school revenues than either the federal or local governments; in fact, the state share is roughly equal to the federal and local share combined.</P>
<P> Clearly, therefore, the states are buyers, not makers of educational services.  As buyers, however, the states have adopted policies that buyers elsewhere try to avoid.  Most buyers are better off if there is competition among their vendors, whether we buy automobiles or haircuts, houses or hospital services.  When we sell our own services, we may welcome monopoly  status for ourselves, but not for our vendors.  Nevertheless, as buyers the states have established a monopoly (public schools) and in effect buy educational services only from the state-created monopoly.  To be sure, its supporters contend that there are valid reasons why public education is an exception to the general rule.  Yet the burden of proof is on them.  On its face, it appears to be an inefficient way to procure educational services.</P>
<P> This conclusion appears also to apply to local school districts.  At the local level, virtually all school districts utilize both employees and independent contractors.  Independent contractors, however, are utilized primarily to provide non-instructional services, such as transportation, legal and medical services, data processing, security guards, maintenance services, and labor negotiations.  On the other hand, school districts are much more likely to make instead of buy instructional services.  One exception occurs when school districts do not include all the grade levels.  In such cases, the district often contract with other districts to provide the required grade levels of instruction.  Another common practice is to use independent contractors to provide instructional services for students who are severely disabled (blind, mentally retarded, deaf, and son).  It is often impractical, especially in smaller districts , to provide instruction for such students because the specialized teachers, facilities, and equipment needed are prohibitively expensive if used by only a small number of students.  Generally speaking, however, school districts prefer to make rather than to buy instructional services.  In fact, the make option is largely taken for granted; the buy option is considered only when some unusual situation renders the make option especially impractical.</P>
<P> The preceding discussion might be criticized on the grounds that school districts are legally agencies of the state governments.  That is, the states control school districts to whatever extent the states deem desirable.  For this reason, states are not buying education from independent contractors.  Instead they are making it through their agents, the local school districts.</P>
<P> It can be conceded that local school districts are agents of the states, no independent contractors.  Nevertheless, the agency relationship here is very different form the agency relationship in an employment context.  States do not control local districts in the same sense as employers control employees.  State control over local school boards exists -- indeed, such control underlies my contention that local districts are frequently unable to act effectively.  Nevertheless, such state control is not tantamount to state production of educational services.</P>
<P> In summary, then, public education does not share a consistent approach to make-or-buy decisions.  One reason is that voters are characterized by inconsistencies on the same issues.  As taxpayers, voters want to spend as little as possible for education.  As educational consumers, especially in their role as parents, voters want government to pay for whatever services the parents might wish to use.  In other words, the citizen's role as consumer conflicts with the citizen's role as taxpayer.  Individuals relate to these roles in various ways; even the same individuals relate them differently over time.  Parents who support higher school taxes while their children are in school may oppose such taxes when their children have left school.</P>
<P> Regardless of the criterion of consistency, it should not be assumed that a consistent approach would always lead to the absence of any rationale or policy to guide specific decisions.  In view of our enormous expenditures for public education ($184 billion, or $4,538 per pupil in 1987-88), this policy gap merits thoughtful consideration.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Contracting Out:  Some Caveats</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In terms of our previous terminology, contracting out is the &quot;buy&quot; decision.  In common usage, however, the phrase &quot;contracting out&quot; often gives rise to some erroneous assumptions.  One is that employees are not under contract.  Another is that employees are always replaced when contracting out occurs.  This is not necessarily the case.  The legal status of the persons performing the work may change from employee to independent contractor while there is no change in the physical composition of the work force.  We must be careful to distinguish what contracting out means from the consequences that may or may not occur in contracting out situations.</P>
<P> It is also essential to avoid rigid assumptions about what can or should be contracted out.  Legal considerations aside for the moment, it might be possible to contract out the entire operations of a school district.  At the other extreme, employees might provide all services needed by a district.  Between these extremes, there is an extremely broad range of possibilities.  Specific support services, such as pupil transportation, or specific instructional services, such as remedial instruction, might be contracted out.  Or certain functions that cut across subject lines, such as management or achievement testing, might be contracted out.  In other words, contracting out is an extremely flexible practice.  I would not exclude the possibility of contracting out district operations in toto in special situations, but this possibility is not my major concern or objective.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Contracting Out By Level Of Government</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Before considering the policy issues involved in contracting out by school boards, let me comment on the practice in other government services.  Because contracting out is a common practice at all levels of government and in virtually every type of public service, a detailed summary would be impractical; on the other hand, a few highlights may help to clarify some issues that arise, or would arise, in the educational context.</P>
<H3><A ID="I5" NAME="I5">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Contracting Out at the Federal Level</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Although the federal government uses all forms of privatization, contracting out is undoubtedly the largest in dollar value.  The federal government contracts out an enormous number of services, from the operation of one-person postal stations to complex defense installations and services all over the world.  It would require volumes merely to list the services involved, but they include such diverse activities as ship repair, hospitals, maintenance, personnel recruitment, data processing, operation of correctional and detention centers, transportation, and research in scores of field.  Indeed, it has been estimated that expenditures for contracted services amount to approximately one-fourth of all federal expenditures. </P>
<P> At the federal level, privatization was vigorously advocated in the 1983 report of the Privatization Task Force of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control.   Widely known as the Grace Commission (after the chairman of the executive committee, J. Peter Grace), the task force recommended various privatization measures that it estimated would result in federal savings and increased revenues of over $28.4 billion over a three-year period.  Although the procedures and conclusions of the Grace Commission have been severely criticized, the widespread attention paid to the commission's report has undoubtedly led to increased support for privatization. </P>
<P> For example, the commission recommended legislation to ensure that the federal government does not embark on any new ventures that can be carried out just as well by the private sector.  Significantly, legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate in 1987 provided that with certain exceptions, &quot;an executive agency may not start or conduct any commercial activity in the executive agency to provide goods or services for the use of or in behalf of the agency if such goods or services can be procured from any responsive and responsible profitmaking business concern.&quot; </P>
<P> The recommendation of the Grace Commission were devoted entirely to federal agencies.  Partly for this reason, the President's Commission on Privatization was established in 1987 and submitted its report in March 1988.  The report recommended strengthening parental choice in education.  It also recommended that &quot;. . . private schools should be able to participate in federal programs providing educational choice to parents.&quot;  In explaining these recommendation, the commission suggested that the following governance patterns might emerge:</P>
<P>1.  Private schools declining government assistance and regulation.</P>
<P>2.  Private schools accepting government assistance and related regulation.</P>
<P>3.  Public schools with choice programs.</P>
<P>4.  Public schools not participating in choice programs as a result of local  decision.</P>
<P> The report also emphasized the importance of &quot;civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution&quot; and of ensuring  &quot;that any system of assistance to private institutions not violate the constitutional clause prohibiting any establishment of religion.&quot;  In view of its failure to give equal emphasis to the importance of protecting the free exercise of religion, the report did not support privatization as unequivocally as might have been expected from its auspices.  On the other hand, given the fact that the commission included prominent Democrats as well as Republicans, its unanimous support for choice and privatization in education is impressive.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Contracting Out at the State Level</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> States as well as local governments have been contracting out a wide variety of services in recent years.  Perhaps the most highly publicized state efforts have been private operation of state prisons, but many prison operations have been contracted out for a long time:  food and health care, education and job training, work release, and juvenile detention are examples.  In any event, few if any state services have not been affected by privatization in one way or another. </P>
<P> At this time, the most important state activity relating to contracting out is their legislation on the subject.  Local governments, including school boards, can contract for services only within the parameters set by state law.  These parameters can apply to the invitation and bidding procedures, avoidance of conflicts of interest, duration of contracts, bonding and performance guarantees, compliance with affirmative action policies or policies relating to minority contractors, flexibility in accepting bids that are not the lowest in dollar amounts, adherence to prevailing wage or minimum wage requirements, and so on.  Restrictive legislation on some of these matters can have major negative effects on contracting out. </P>
<P> State collective bargaining laws are also very important considerations.  About thirty-five states have such laws covering at least some state or local public employees.  In most states that have enacted such legislation, contracting out of work that is or might be performed by employees represented by a union is a mandatory subject of bargaining.  In these states school boards ordinarily must give notice of intent to contract out and bargain on it.  Inasmuch as the unions are usually opposed to such action, they will often do their utmost to prevent it, especially if some employees would lose their jobs or benefits or if the union would lose members.  For our purposes, however, the important point is that state statutes and judicial decisions control whether a school district is required to bargain on contracting out.  The situation varies widely, even among states with bargaining statutes. </P>

<P> At the local level, a wide variety of public services are contracted out.  In 1986 the Local Government Center (LGC) of the Reason Foundation noted about 28,500 instances of local and state privatization.   Table 2.1 shows the services contracted out by local governments in 1987.  The figures in the table are based on questionnaires sent to every city with a population of 5,000 or more and every county in the United States, with a 19 percent response rate.  School districts were not included in the survey, so the table substantially understates how much contracting is done by local governments.</P>

<P> Overall, our nation spends more for education than for any other local public service.  It is therefore somewhat surprising that the interest in contracting out has largely ignored education. -- and education has largely ignored the growing interest in contracting out.  Undoubtedly, the governance structure of education helps to explain its isolation from the privatization movement.  Mayors, city managers, and city councils are typically responsible for a wide range of municipal services.  They are therefore much more likely to be exposed to the theory and practice of contracting out.  Their publications, organizations, conferences, and political activity are also likely to touch upon the subject.</P>
<P> In contrast, school boards and administrators tend to be preoccupied with instructional services; as a result, they receive relatively little information regarding contracting-out developments.  Not that contracting out per se is unknown; as previously noted, most school districts do contract out some support services.  Nevertheless, as discussed, the prevailing attitude in public education is not to contract out unless there is no alternative.  Municipal officials tend to be more receptive to the practice.  This difference in attitude understandably leads to differences in the attention paid to alternative ways of delivering public services.  The rationale for privatization is that achieving efficiency in government is not so much a matter of will or personality or ad hoc leadership.  Instead, it is a way of dealing with the structural problems that work against efficiency.</P>
<P> Essentially, privatization is based on the view that conventional approaches to improving public services fail because they are based on factors that cannot be controlled by policymakers.  This is why orthodox approaches to achieving efficiency in the public sector -- efficiency drives, programs to eliminate waste, dropping unnecessary or marginal public service programs, or spending limits on public officials -- are bound to fail.  In the long run, they are unsuccessful because they do not affect the incentives or the means to reduce public expenditures.0   For example, when spending limits are imposed, public officials do not cut &quot;the fat&quot; or &quot;the waste,&quot; or the unnecessary or marginal programs.  They cut the most visible and popular programs in order to rally public opinion against the limits.  Campaign promises to introduce &quot;business practices&quot; in government fail to materialize because businesspeople elected to government office behave like politicians, not businesspeople -- just as politicians who go into business behave like businesspeople, not politicians.  Similarly, attempts to institute other methods of government efficiency encounter pitfalls of their own that destroy their effectiveness in the not so long run.</P>
<P> It should also be emphasized that the proponents of privatization do not regard contracting out as a panacea for all government ailments.  In fact, some privatizers are fearful of contracting out and see no long-range advantage to it.  Furthermore, even the most partisan advocates of contracting out agree that it is not the proper method for all public services.  At the same time, the most partisan opponents of the practice concede that it is necessary under certain conditions.  In effect, this means that the feasibility of contracting out in education is not necessarily similar to its feasibility in other public services.  Experience from other fields can be helpful in education if we are also sensitive to any differences that might be relevant to contracting out issues.  Needless to say, it is for the reader to decide whether my analysis satisfies this important criterion.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Efficiency and Management Incentives</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Management incentives under contracting out differ from the incentives that motivate public managers.1   The differences are conducive to greater efficiency under contracting out, at least if the contractors are for-profit organizations.  For-profit contractors generally try to operate as efficiently as possible.  Their incentives to be efficient are their need to avoid losing market share to competing contractors, who could provide the service for less if they are more efficient, and their desire to maximize profits.</P>
<P> These incentives contrast markedly with those of public officials, who typically do not share in the savings generated by increased efficiency.  for this reason, they have less incentive than for-profit managers to foster or demand efficiency in the operations they manage.  As a matter of fact, public officials may have strong incentives to be inefficient.  This happens often when the public employees under their supervision are politically influential.  Public management may tolerate inefficiencies that benefit those employees in exchange for the political support the employees provide.</P>
<P> Another dimension of this argument concerns pensions and retirement benefits.  Some groups of public employees (police, firefighters, teachers) are very influential politically.  Public officials may foster political support from these groups by approving excessive pension benefits For them.  As such benefits do not raise taxes immediately, they are often approved without protest or even the knowledge of most taxpayers.  By the time the excessive nature of the pension benefits becomes widely known, the public officials who voted for them have left public service, thereby avoiding completely any accountability for their actions.2 </P>
<P> To appreciate the differences in incentives between public and private managers, let us suppose the public services had been contracted out.  In that case, management would have had strong incentives to oppose the excessive pension costs.  acceptance of them would immediately have depressed the value of the company's stock, including any shares owned by management.  For this reason, managerial opposition to these costs would be immediate also.</P>
<P> The rationale for contracting out also emphasizes the importance of incentives to innovate.  The lure of rewards and the concerns about competition lead private sector managers to develop and introduce more efficient services and products and/or more efficient ways to provide and sell them.  Public management, which doesn't have to worry about competition, lacks this incentive to foster innovation.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Economies of Scale</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> From an economic point of view, the most efficient scale of production depends on the nature of the service.  Large-scale production of automobiles is much more economical than small-scale production.  At one time books were produced by scribes and there was no alternative to small-scale production.  The development of the printing press made it possible to produce books on a larger and more efficient scale.</P>
<P> Clearly, the economies-of-scale rationale is applicable to public education.  School districts vary in size.  many districts will not be the optimum size from an efficiency point of view, for providing instruction, pupil transportation, or whatever.  contracting out, however, can help provide solutions to this problem.  If a school district is too large for efficient service, it can be subdivided.  If the district is too small, a contractor can achieve optimal size by also selling its services to other nearby school districts.  As I hope to show, economies of scale are an important consideration in virtually all modes of privatization.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Job Redundancy Issue</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> An important reason for the greater efficiency of the private sector is its greater freedom to fire employees who are no longer needed.  To fully appreciate the importance of this reason, we must first recognize its role throughout our economy.</P>
<P> About 20 million workers change jobs every year in the United States.  About half change voluntarily.3   The other half do so involuntarily -- they are fired, or their business fails.  Offhand, this appears to be a source of great instability, and in a sense it is.  Nevertheless, involuntary termination's are not a disaster to our economy as a whole or to most of the workers who lose their jobs.  Essentially, the reason is that the process that creates jobs is also the process of eliminating them.  Airlines have generated an enormous number of jobs, but in the process they wiped out many jobs based on inter city bus transportation.  New goods and services do not always eliminate existing jobs, but a significant amount of job destruction.  Keep in mind, however, that the elimination of jobs is not the same as unemployment.  a person whose job becomes redundant may find another position the same day.</P>
<P> For our purposes, it is essential to recognize the differences between job redundancy in the political system and in the economic system.  In the latter, the process typically is regulated informally but effectively by the market.  If the service you provide can't be sold at a price sufficient to maintain the enterprise, the jobs disappear.  If a job is not needed to provide services, competitive factors and the search for profits result in elimination of the job.</P>
<P> What happens to redundant employees in the public sector?  What serves the function of markets and competition as an incentive to terminate public employees who are no longer needed?  Because redundancy in the public sector is a political issue, its economic aspects are frequently ignored; taxpayers, employees on the public payroll.  Although the taxpayer costs in particular cases or services may not be very large, the aggregate costs of keeping redundant employees on the public payroll are probably substantial.</P>
<P> Whether redundancy decisions are made on a political or an economical basis is an extremely important matter.  In the soviet Union, most economic activity is state operated.  Consequently, redundancy is resolved through its political instead of its economic system.  The result is an extremely inefficient economic system.  In Western Europe and the United States, 3 percent of the work force or less produces more food than the population can eat; in the Soviet Union, 20 percent of the labor force is on the land and shortages of agricultural products are chronic.4   Indeed, as this is written, the political leaders of the USSR have announced plans to have redundancy decisions made on economic grounds by economic managers, with the government assuming responsibility for retraining and relocating redundant employees.</P>
<P> The reference to the Soviet Union may seem farfetched, but it is not.  It is intended to underscore the fact that political control of employment decisions has economic consequences, and the consequences may not be economically desirable regardless of the political system involved.  From this perspective, the teacher tenure laws are only one aspect of a much larger problem characterizing public education in the United States.  These laws were enacted to protect individual teachers from arbitrary dismissal.  Regardless of their intent, the laws unquestionably protect many incompetent and marginal teachers.5   The critical point, however, is that the protection of such teachers is not the major problem created by the emphasis on teacher security.  Most employees who lose their jobs involuntarily in the private sector are not incompetent.  Their jobs were eliminated for reasons having nothing to do with their competence.  On the other hand, eliminating teacher jobs (as distinguished from firing teachers for incompetence) is very difficult to do, even in the absence of tenure laws.  Teacher job security in the United States comes at a price, and the price is an extremely inefficient educational personnel system.  Contracting out would be much more likely to avoid this inefficiency, at least insofar as termination would be an economic instead of political decision.</P>
<P>  Of course, even if contracting out instruction avoids an inefficiency, that would be only one of several factors to be considered in the make-or-buy decision regarding instructional services.  To formulate wise policy, our attention should focus on all the consequences of the systems, not  the outcomes of particular cases or issues.  Regardless of whether teacher tenure is decided in the political or the economic system, we can cite horror stories that imply that the decisions should be made in the other system.  We must also recognize that assessing the system consequences requires some assessment of individual cases.  What is objectionable, however, is the preoccupation with individual cases without regard to the system costs of the remedy.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Avoidance of Bureaucracy</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Providing services through the private sector minimizes the size of government bureaucracies.  The more government provides services, the more government employees are needed to provide it, supervise it, keep records of it, monitor it, and so on.</P>
<P> Suppose that instead of food stamps, government-operated stores provided food to those deemed eligible for it.  In the latter situation, the government would have to buy, sore, insure, display, and transfer and account for the food.  This would require a large number of additional government employees.  In contrast, the use of food stamps enables the government to avoid being the grocery business and thus to avoid expanding the number of government employees.</P>
<P> Actually, there are two dimensions of the bureaucracy issue.  Contracting out requires fewer governmental employees to provide a service.  On the other hand, it may also require an increase in regulatory personnel.  Overall, fewer government employees are needed, but the regulatory issues should not be ignored.  If contracting out instruction should increase, increased state regulation of contractors may also.  Even now the contractors who provide services directly to children (e.g., bus transportation) are sometimes required to meet special requirements, such as having screened their employees for prior drug use or sex offense.  Of course, in addition to any special restrictions, school contractors mush also comply with the regulatory measures applicable to business generally in their state.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Capital Outlays</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> School districts may wish to avoid purchasing expensive capital equipment, such as fleets of buses or vocational equipment or data processing facilities.  Contracting out the relevant service may enable districts to avoid such purchases and contribute to increased efficiency in a variety of ways:  prompt use of new equipment, predictable costs, and avoidance of sunk costs in outmoded equipment.</P>
<P> In some states, various tax limitations have made it difficult for local governments to raise money for construction.  Local governments must often seek bonding authority, which may be turned down by the electorate or lead to bond issues that come on the market at an inopportune time.  In many instances, therefore, private companies have built the needed facilities in conjunction with a management contract to operate them for a specified number of years.</P>
<P> To facilitate arrangements of this sort, states have found it necessary to change their statues on municipal contracts, taxes, bonding, debt, and related issues.  Although such changes were a response to noneducational needs, they  may be suggestive of things to come in education.  In fact, companies seeding to become contractors over a range of municipal services have emerged in recent years.  That is, instead of being established to provide a particular public service, such as waste disposal, the companies are not service specific.6   Given the fact that school districts also may be unable to finance school construction by conventional procedures, the possibility that schools may be built and operated under contract by the private sector is discussed in Chapter 3.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Avoidance of Single-Supplier Problems</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The arguments for contracting out emphasize the fact that it avoids single-supplier problems.  Such problems fall into two categories:  the effect on the service providers and the effect on the service users or receivers.  Let us consider these problems briefly.</P>
<P> The employees of a monopolistic employer have more power to achieve concessions than employees in a competitive industry.  A strike at one automobile plan is not a threat to car buyers as long as other companies can make and sell new cars.  Because the strike will not be a threat to the consumer, employees must moderate their demands.  I they insist on excessive salaries and continue the strike, they will be jeopardizing their own jobs.  This would not be the case if the employees enjoyed monopoly status.</P>
<P> In education, the public is the ultimate employer.  It would seem to be in its interest to avoid union/employee pressures based on the monopolistic nature of public services.  In this connection, strikes by public school teachers are often extremely effective because no alternative supply of teachers is readily available.  </P>
<P> Even if a service is not contracted out, a realistic possibility that it might be helps to keep employee demands at a reasonable level.  Just as the threat of strikes often achieves concessions, the threat of contracting out may also achieve concessions by public sector unions.  The failure of legislators and school boards to be more concerned about this issue points to a widespread inconsistency in public policy.  In the private sector, public policy treats monopoly as undesirable and competition as desirable.  Paradoxically, public policy does not adopt the same posture toward monopoly in the public sector, even in those services where competition is quite feasible.</P>
<P> The effects of single-supplier status on service users must also be considered.  Public employees are not as likely to be responsive to citizens concerns as service providers who can be replaced from time to time.  Significantly, many contracts to provide public services specify how complaints are to be recorded and processed.  The data is subsequently used in the decisions on contract renewal.</P>
<P> The responsiveness issue seems especially pertinent to education because a large share of school revenues comes from state governments.  State aid is usually allocated to local districts on the basis of the number of students.  Quality of service or responsiveness is not considered.  Therefore, unless school districts establish other potential sources of supply, their reliance on a single noncompetitive source (their own employees) is bound to affect system responsiveness adversely.</P>
<P> Generally speaking, responsiveness issues are not as relevant to contracting out as they are to some other forms of privatization, especially vouchers.  One reason is that under contracting out, the school district, not the parents, still chooses the service providers.  Responsiveness issues will be discussed again in connection with proposals to strengthen parental rather than school district choice of service providers.  Needless to say, however, school boards and school administrators seldom concede any private sector advantage in responsiveness.  For one thing, the rhetoric of education emphasizes &quot;meeting the needs and interests of pupils.&quot;  In smaller communities, school board members frequently receive calls from parents. -- over rowdyism on a bus, a poor grade, failure to make a team, too much homework, to little homework, whatever.  In such communities the school board functions as a group of ombudsmen as much as it does a policymaking body.  As school district size increases, however, school boards cannot be as responsive to individual complaints and grievances.  Efforts to ameliorate this problem by decentralizing governance or administration have not been very successful, partly because of the difficulties in establishing clear-cut lines of responsibility.</P>
<P> The fact is, however, that school boards are not especially responsive institutions.  Even in small districts, the ability of the boards to be responsive is severely limited by state mandates and restrictions, such as collective bargaining, tenure, and textbook laws.7   Indeed, since small districts often require more flexibility because of their limited resources, they often suffer more than large districts from state mandates.</P>
<P> Like most local governments, school districts seldom conduct market research or anything that could reasonably be equated to it.  Responsiveness in school districts, as in public agencies generally, is usually directed at the politically influential or the most aggressive complainers.  The fact that many citizens have deep concerns but lack the time or the temperament or the sophistication to articulate them is widely ignored.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Inefficient Public Sector Business Practices</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> All levels of government come under pressure to spend (obligate) their funds by a certain date or lose them.  That is, funds are appropriated for expenses, usually on a fiscal year basis.  If a government agency approaches the end of the fiscal year with excess funds, there is strong and usually irresistible pressure to spend the money so that it does not revert to the general fund or to another department that may not have been so efficient.</P>
<P> In the case of school districts, funds unspent by departments are usually available to other departments.  If the district as a whole showed a surplus, the excess funds might be subtracted from its allocation for the following year.  Regardless of how or to whom the excess funds are distributed, this common policy constitutes a strong deterrent against efficiency.  School districts are just as likely to be subject to the policy, and to make sure that all the money is spent, as any other unit of government.  Indeed many school boards would be embarrassed, not gratified, by a surplus.  They would be in a weak position to deny employees wage increases or to object on cost grounds to various demands of their constituents.</P>
<P> The relevance of the issue to contracting out seems indisputable.  The contractor does not lose the unspent funds; on the contrary, such funds can simply be held in reserve for contingencies or improvements in following years.  That is, eve if the excess funds are not distributed as profits, they can be used more efficiently in providing services because they do not have to be spent by an arbitrary date (&quot;arbitrary&quot; from the standpoint of efficient service).  This advantage of contracting out is probably more significant than is generally realized.  Government restrictions also impair efficiency in purchasing services.  Purchase may be limited to local firms.  For legal reasons, it may be necessary to limit flexibility in the terms of a contract, so that it is impossible for bidders to make the best overall offer to provide services.  Payment procedures may be so slow that firms fear cash-flow problems and are reluctant to bid.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Public Awareness of Service Costs</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> When services are provided by government, citizens have relatively little awareness of costs.  Inasmuch as the revenues to pay for public services do not come primarily or at all from service users, the relationships between costs and services are not widely understood.  The more we separate those who pay from those who receive services, the more we foster unrealistic perceptions about both services and costs.</P>
<P> Under pressure from public employees and/or service users, public officials find it politically advantageous to increase both the services and the wages of the public employees who provide them.  Because the required tax increases are only a small part of the entire public budget, public officials tend to vote for them for the political rewards they bring.  Meanwhile, citizens who receive the services tend to underestimate their costs, often by a wide margin.</P>
<P> If services are privatized, however, the costs are more likely to be visible within the public budget.  At first glance this seems implausible.  Why expect citizens to know more about the cost of a service when provided privately, with no public access to the contractor's financial records, than when it is provided by a public agency whose financial records are open to public inspection?</P>
<P> Perhaps an analogy will help to answer this question.  When you buy a car, you don't know the manufacturer's internal breakdown of costs.  That is, you are not informed about how much of the sales price went into final assembly, transportation, research and development, insurance, advertising, and so on.  You don't get this information partly because there's no way you could use it; you aren't likely to offer $250 less because the manufacturer's advertising costs were excessive.</P>
<P> Similarly, when you purchase a service, you ordinarily rely on the price of the service, not the service provider's internal breakdown of costs.  Your protection is your ability to shift to another service provider.  At the present time, however, we don't know the real costs of public education, nor are we protected from excessive costs by competition among service providers.  As I will show in the next chapter, school district budgets simply do not provide accurate estimates of the costs of education.</P>
<P> If a service is privatized, however, all the costs must be identified.  Contractors need to know all the costs in order to avoid a contract that neglects some costs that they must pay.  Public officials need to know the costs in order to avoid contracts based on inflated cost estimates.  Thus the dynamics of contracting out lead to more accurate estimates of the service costs.  The same process applies to outcomes.  Contracting out forces public agencies to be clear about outcomes.  Otherwise it is impossible to know how adequate a service is.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Case Against Buying Public Services:  An Overview</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Thus far I have outlined several arguments supporting decisions to buy educational services.  These arguments have been general in nature; they do not take into account specific circumstances that might justify a different decision.  For example, if there are no contractors, the theoretical advantages of contracting out cannot be achieved in practice.  Just as it is important to consider the general arguments for contracting out, it is likewise essential to consider the general arguments against the policy.8   After doing so I shall review briefly the evidence on contracting out public services other than education.  The next chapter will come to grips with the issues that are especially pertinent to make-or-buy decisions in education.</P>
<P> A major criticism of contracting out is that it does not eliminate the use of political influence to maintain inefficient services.  contractors often contribute to political candidates with the exception of being awarded a contract to provide services.  Their activities can be just as harmful as public employee support for candidates who support employee interests.  Undeniably, there is some validity to the criticism.  Lobbying by contractors for contracts may be as serious a problem as lobbying  by public employees and their unions for concessions that serve their interests.</P>
<P> Indisputably, the criticism has an empirical basis and is not to be taken lightly.  In my opinion, no approach can totally prevent leaders from rewarding their supporters in ways that are not in the public interest.  Whether the underlying problem is more manageable under contracting out depends in large part on whether there is sole-source or competitive bidding.  In the latter case it is much more difficult for any one contractor to gain an unfair advantage by means of political influence; the other contractors will be alert to the problem.  They will have a larger stake in taking remedial action than citizens have in monitoring politically motivated concessions to public employees or public sector unions.</P>
<P> To what extent is there meaningful competition to deliver public service?  The critics of contracting out emphasize how often only a small number of qualified bids are received on most contracts.  Obviously, the likelihood of collusion instead of competition among bidders increases as their number decreases.  Even when there is more than one bidder, the incumbent contractor is often able to manipulate the bidding and cultivate the key contracting officials to ensure that others are frozen out.  In some cases cost-plus contracts have been negotiated; such contracts are often conducive to inefficiency because the contractor receives a percentage of the costs.  </P>
<P> These criticisms do not undermine the rationale for contracting out.  Instead, they point to some conditions that must be satisfied for it to be fully effective.  If there is only one bidder, there is less competition than if several contractors bid.</P>
<P> Unquestionably, incumbent contractors tend to have advantages.  it is also true that contractors sometimes submit extremely low bids to win initial contracts, anticipating that they will be able to recoup any losses in subsequent renewals.  I have seen health insurers submit such bids, anticipating that they will be firmly entrenched at the next round of bidding.</P>
<P> It seems to me that whether public agencies are disadvantaged by this practice depends on the sophistication of public officials.  Knowledge about a public agency is worth something.  If a contractor is willing to pay for it by submitting a low bid, I see nothing wrong in the practice; it may be a recognition of the efficacy of competition, not a denial of it.  We should be cognizant of the conditions under which contracting out is most effective, but this does not mean that it is necessarily undesirable if there is only one bidder.  At least, if the only alternative is having the work performed by district employees, one outside bidder is preferable to none.</P>
<P> A related objection is that contracting out can lead to undesirable government dependency on contractors.  This argument is hardly persuasive since it assumes that government dependence on a sole-source supplier is acceptable if the sole source is the government employees themselves.</P>
<P> The contention that government may become too dependent on contractors is often related to the possibility that a contractor may go bankrupt, thereby forcing government to provide services on short notice without adequate personnel or facilities.  Although contractor bankruptcies do occur, any serious problems usually can be avoided by demanding appropriate information and financial guarantees from contractors.</P>
<P> A less frequent objection is that contracting out is contrary to the spirit of veterans' preference legislation.  By removing positions from the public payroll, contracting out allegedly removes opportunities for veterans to be appointed to public positions.  This objection, however, is unpersuasive for at least three reasons.  First, veterans' preference laws have not, or should not, require inefficient modes of delivering public services in order to maximize the numbers of veterans on the public payroll.  Second, contracting out does not necessarily require the dismissal of veterans (or even nonveterans) on the public payroll.  Current employees frequently are allowed to remain in their positions and are replaced, if at all, only through attrition.  Quite often employees can be transferred, reassigned, or induced to retire by special benefits.  Finally, we cannot assume that more veterans are disadvantaged by contracting out than by government provision of service.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Corruption Issues in a Systems Perspective</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Another line of criticism emphasizes the corruption, influence peddling, and kickbacks sometimes associated with contracting out.  These practices weaken the argument that contracting out will result in greater efficiency.</P>
<P> Unquestionably, corruption can be a serious problem.  One difficulty with the objection, however, is the lack of systematic data on it.  another is that it is often very difficult to draw the line between corruption and legal activities that also constitute policymaking for special interests.  Suppose, for example, that although contracting out would be beneficial in a given situation, public officials do not utilize it because the unions involved have been instrumental in their election.  Obviously, the public officials are not going to say this explicitly, but it would be naive to suppose that it does not happen.</P>
<P> Again, we must consider the issue from a systems, not an anecdotal, perspective.  Whether public services are bought or made, public officials may subvert the process for their private gain.  Under certain conditions, contracting out is more likely than direct provisions to avoid this outcome; under the conditions, it is less likely to do so.</P>
<P> For example, school districts typically require competitive bidding to provide their milk requirements.  The contracts are largely similar.  It is quite clear what products and services dairies must provide and how much they are paid for these things.</P>
<P> The losing bidders are in a strong position to monitor the alleged reasons why their bids were unsuccessful.  For this reason, corruption and kickbacks to get the contact are not so great a danger.</P>
<P> When it comes to instructional services, however, the analogy is not so persuasive.  It is relatively easy to specify the amount and quality of dairy products; this does not hold true for instructional services.  On the contrary, it is much easier to manipulate the description of the instructional services or the service providers in order to favor a particular bidder.  Yet this hardly resolves the issue of which system or service is more vulnerable to manipulation for private gain.  The reason is implicit in our previous discussion of public awareness of service costs.  The dynamics of contracting out are conducive to greater specificity in describing the services being purchased.  If only one district buys foreign-language instruction, it would be difficult to demonstrate favoritism in awarding the contract.  If twenty-five districts in a metropolitan area do so, it becomes much easier to compare services and costs as a check against corruption.</P>
<P> To summarize, the subordination of the public interest to private interest must be viewed as a systems problem.  In my twenty years of experience as a labor negotiator for school boards, the legal ways of doing this (for example, concessions to public employees in exchange for their political support) were vastly more harmful than the illegal ways, such as bribes and kickbacks.  of course, school district purchasing agents may have a different story to tell.  Regardless, both ways of subverting the public interest raise legitimate questions to which we lack good answers.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>A Summary of the Evidence</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The foregoing objections to contracting out are by no means exhaustive.  At this point, however, it may be more helpful to review the evidence on contracting out in fields outside of education.  The next chapter will then take up several additional issues for and against contracting out instruction</P>
<P> One cautionary note has been mentioned but bears repeating.  We should not apply a double standard in evaluating the evidence on contracting out.  Although anecdotal evidence may be suggestive, our underlying concern must be with systematic data.  Furthermore, it should be recognized that whatever system is used to deliver services, there will be instances of inefficiency and poor quality.</P>
<P> The most difficult problem in assessing the evidence on contracting out is simply the sheer number of studies on the subject.  In the United States alone there have been hundreds of such studies; worldwide there may have been thousands.  Contracting out of virtually every public service, and at every level of government, has been studied somewhere.  It was not feasible to analyze each study, desirable as that might have been.  Instead, my comments will be based on publications that review a substantial number of studies and that are deemed representative of the research on the subject.  Although my approach is not ideal, it reflects widespread albeit not unanimous agreement on the results of contracting out.9 </P>
<P> In general, the research supports the idea that contracting out is often more efficient, or provides higher quality service, or both.  Let me cite just one of several studies that supports this conclusion.</P>
<P> A study of 121 cities in the Los Angeles metropolitan area covered eight services:  payroll preparation, road paving, residential refuse collection, tree maintenance, turf maintenance, traffic signal maintenance, janitorial services, and street cleaning.  Comparisons were made only if at least ten cities provided the services directly and ten contracted out for them.  The study found that with the exception of payroll maintenance, costs for the contract services averaged 54 percent less than direct provision by the cities.  Service costs under contracting out were less because contractors (1) used less labor; (2) experienced less absenteeism; (3) used more part-time labor; (4) employed younger workers; (5) fired more incompetent employees; (6) used more capital equipment; and (7) held managers responsible for equipment as well as personnel.0 </P>
<P> Several summaries of the research in other fields reach similar conclusions.  The research that does not is predominantly in the area of welfare and human services -- job training, counseling, employment, and other services intended to change the behavior of service recipients in some way.1 </P>
<P> One interesting summary concludes that the change from public to private service delivery results in greater efficiency because the change is usually made when the existing mode of delivery is noticeably inefficient.  In fact, the study contends that changes from private to public sector delivery also show savings because the prior mode of delivery was highly inefficient.  In other words, either mode of service delivery can become extremely inefficient; when this happens, a change is likely to show savings, regardless of whether the change is from public to private or from private to public delivery.2 </P>
<P> This study may well explain some of the efficiency gains attributed to contracting out.  It does not seem plausible, however, that it accounts fully for the savings in so many services and jurisdiction.  Furthermore, the possibility of contracting out as an option may have forestalled a great deal of inefficiency in service delivery by public agencies;  minimally, the point underscores the value of contracting out as an option.</P>
<P> Marc Bendick, Jr., an economist who favors increased federal spending on various social services, probably reflects a common if not the prevailing view.  Referring to the results of a 1973 survey on contracting out, he comments:</P>
<P>Where controlled evaluations have been undertaken, verifiable cost savings were observed, if not universally, more often than not. . .</P>
<P> In extrapolating from these generally favorable findings to social welfare services, it is important to note the nature of the services encompassed within this pool of experience.  Contracted-out municipal functions are predominantly straightforward, immediate, measurable, monitorable, and technical in nature -- such as refuse collection, data processing, and street light maintenance.  As one moves from such examples to (relatively rare) examples of contracting out for more complex, undefinable, long-range and &quot;subjective&quot; services such as are characteristic of the social welfare field, the record of successful experience rapidly things.3 </P>
<P> Bendick's conclusions reflect the predominant view among the comprehensive surveys of contracting out.  Inasmuch as the argument for contracting out is based on the advantages of market over political systems, we could expect research to support it widely, if arguments are valid ones.  Granted, some research supporting contracting out is sponsored by organizations already committed to it; this fact, however, does not justify automatic rejection of their arguments and data.  For that matter, it is more significant that the only groups consistently opposed to contracting out are public employees and public employee unions.  If their objections are valid, it is surprising how little research on the subject supports them.  Such research does not show that contracting out is always beneficial; on the other hand, it frequently supports the practice even when the issues raised by unions are taken into account.4 </P>
<P> Actually, the support for contracting out would be incomprehensible if the union objections to it were valid.  For instance, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) publications emphasize that contracting out is less efficient than service by public employees.  If this argument is valid, the taxpayer organizations and supporters of economy in government who support contracting out are badly mistaken.  To this observer, it seems unlikely that the unions are more interested in cutting the government costs than their critics -- especially when approximately 70 percent of the costs of local and state government are for employee wages and benefits.</P>
<P> Developments in the private sector also weaken union arguments against contracting out.  Union efforts to restrict contracting out are often a major issue in the private sector.  They are currently a major issue in the automotive industry, as automobile manufacturers seek to purchase parts from outside (often foreign) suppliers, instead of manufacturing the parts themselves.  It would be absurd for the unions to argue that General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler really do not understand that contracting out is more expensive, and the unions involved do not make any such claim.  In the contrary, they contend that for one reason or another, it is unfair for the companies  to rely on the least expensive suppliers.  Incidentally, this line of argument illustrates how semantics often dominates the discussion of these matters.  In the automotive industry, the union argument is that the companies should not allow cheap foreign labor to undermine the wages and benefits of U.S. workers.  Similarly, public sector unions allege that contracting out undermines the wages and benefits of public employees.  In the public sector, however, the argument overlooks the fact that public employees generally receive higher pay and benefits than their private sector counterparts.  This is indisputable, especially in education; total compensation for public school teachers averages 25 percent more than compensation in private schools.5 </P>
<P> The opposition to contracting out by public sector unions also ignores the trend toward it in the private sector.  For several years the proportion of the U.S. labor force engaged in the production of services has been increasing.  contrary to popular opinion, however, the change is not due to a larger proportion of the labor force being employed in retail or personal service enterprise.  Instead, it is primarily due to the increasing proportion of workers who provide producer services; as one recent study notes, the growth in services is primarily a &quot;transformation at the level of intermediate outputs.&quot;  This transformation has resulted in the growth of specialized producer services, &quot;both in-house (in the central administrative facilities of the corporation) and out-of-house (among producer service firms).&quot;6   Thus the service revolution is not simply a shift in the kind of work being performed; it also reflects a private sector trend toward contracting out instead of internal production of goods and services.  In the long run, the economics of contracting out may overcome the opposition to it in both sectors.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>3 Efficiency Issues in Educational Perspective</B></FONT></A></H2>
<P><B>T</B>his chapter is devoted to various efficiency issues in contracting out, especially of instructional services.  A preliminary statement of my assumptions and rationale may be helpful.</P>
<P> Generally speaking, approaches to privatization fall into two categories.  One category emphasizes the ideological dimensions of privatization.  Supporters of this view see privatization as much more than a management option; it is a way of diminishing the role of government, of enhancing the role of the private sector, and of avoiding inefficient government activities that would be difficult if not impossible to eliminate.  Supporters in this category regard efficiency as important, but they tend to view it as intimately related to the functions of government, the role of our economic system, and the relationships between political and economic freedoms.</P>
<P> By the same token, privatization also has its ideological detractors.  Some critics of privatization also do not separate the broader philosophical issues from the immediately practical ones.  Whereas the supporters view privatization within a favorable philosophical framework, the ideological opponents view it within an unfavorable one.  Although both groups agree that privatization proposals should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, they seldom agree on the merits of specific proposals.</P>
<P> The other major approach to privatization analyzes it primarily as a management tool.  In this context, efficiency issues are resolved without much regard to their philosophical implications.  I shall label this group &quot; the practical decision makers.&quot;  To this group, contracting out does not raise any brad philosophical issues.  If contracting out is a more efficient way to get the job done, so be it.  To these people a decision on whether to contract out instruction is similar to one on whether to drive the car or take the bus to a football game.  After all important practical considerations are taken into account, what is the best way to get there?  There is no need to relate the decision to the role of public transportation.  Similarly, practical decision makers might see no need to relate make-or-buy decisions in education to ideological issues.</P>
<P> In this chapter I shall discuss contracting out instruction primarily from the standpoint of practical decision makers.  In doing so I do not imply that the ideological issues are unimportant, or that I have no views about them, or that the discussion can always avoid the broader issues.  Instead, it is due to the fact that the major audience for this book are practical decision makers, not of ideological supporters or opponents of privatization per se.  Furthermore, although efficiency issues are  not the whole story, they are a large part of it.  If we could reach a workable consensus on the efficiency issues, the ideological ones would be much easier to resolve.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Efficiency Issues and State Regulation</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Arguably, at least, the efficiency argument for contracting out is much stronger in education than it is in most state and local public services.  This is because state regulation of education is usually more detailed, more restrictive, and more conducive to inefficient than it is in other public services.  People not professionally involved in public education find it difficult to grasp the sheer volume of regulation or the myriad ways that it results in inefficiencies.  Let me fist outline the broad categories of statutory regulation before citing some specifics.</P>
<P><B>Regulation of Governance and Financial Procedures</B> -- State statutes normally govern eligibility for:  school board election; board meetings; financial and business procedures; budget categories and budget schedules; board authority to contract; school district bond and insurance requirements; bidding procedures; power to appoint administrators, teachers, and support staff; and health and safety standards and procedures.</P>
<P><B>Regulation of the Educational Program and of Students</B> -- State statutes often prescribe:  the minimum and maximum age for compulsory education; subjects to be taught; the student work day and work year; the choice of instructional materials; graduation requirements; maximum class size; vaccination and medical examinations; how to deal with disabled, migrant, and/or delinquent children; and so on.</P>
<P><B>Regulation of Teachers and Administrators</B> -- Statutes control:  eligibility to teach or administer schools (often by grade level or subject); discipline and dismissal procedures; layoffs and recall; mandatory leave benefits;' retirement eligibility, procedures, and benefits; duty-free lunch periods; seniority; and teacher evaluation.</P>
<P><B>Regulation of Support Staff</B> -- In general, state regulation of support staff (secretaries, bus drivers, custodians, cafeteria workers, groundskeepers, data processing technicians, and other support staff) differs in degree but not in kind from state regulation of teachers and administrators.</P>
<P> It is hardly possible to overemphasize one basic point about state regulation.  Very little state regulation restricts what teachers teach, or how they teach.  The vast majority of state statues affecting teachers provide teacher benefits and were enacted at the behest of state teacher unions.  They are restrictive, but the restrictions overwhelmingly apply to school management, not to teaches.  When teachers are restricted in the classroom, it is usually an indirect result of a direct restriction on management.  For example, if a state law restricts a district's choice of textbooks to those approved by a state textbook commission, the restriction on teacher choice drives from the restriction on management choice.  </P>
<P> Although the amount and nature of state regulation varies enormously from state to state, some regulatory elements force districts to be inefficient everywhere.  Let me cite just a few examples from California and New York simply to illustrate the tremendous variety of these inefficiencies.</P>
<P> First in California:</P>
<P> 1.  According to the California Education Code, &quot;It is the intent and purpose of the Legislature to encourage, by every means possible, the reduction of class sizes and the ratio of pupils to teachers in all grade levels in the public schools and to urge every effort to this end be undertaken by the local school administrative authorities.&quot;   Although average class size in California's schools overall is among the highest in the United States, this statement of policy does not take into account the possibility that class size is often extremely low.  Regardless, the next section of the Education Code penalizes school districts if their class size exceeds thirty in grades 1 to 3 and 4 to 8, or thirty-one or thirty-three in kindergarten.</P>
<P> There is no credible evidence that these limits have any relationship to educational achievement or productivity.  Let us suppose, however, that adding another first-grade pupil to a class of thirty has a discernible negative effect on class members' educational achievement.  To decide whether to split the class or to add another pupil to the existing one, we should compare the costs as well as the educational outcomes.  The costs of splitting the class would perhaps be $40,000 (average salary plus benefits for an additional teacher).  The underlying issue, however, is not the impact of the additional student on the class as a whole.  It is whether spending $40,000 for an additional teacher is the optimum educational use of the money.  It is not possible for a legislature, or anyone else, to make this judgment sensibly without understanding the district's other needs and resources.  In the vast majority of cases, adding a pupil to a class of thirty would not result in any perceptible educational loss; failure to do so, however, would cost the district a substantial amount of money, which could be used more productively on other needs.  Nevertheless, Sections 41375 and 41376 penalize a California school district for making the most cost-effective use of its resources.</P>
<P> Let me cite just one additional dimension to the inefficiencies resulting from the class size statute.  Under California law, class size is a mandatory subject of bargaining between teacher unions and school districts.  The bargaining law authorizes additions but not reductions in the statutory benefits of teachers.  Thus in conjunction with the state's bargaining law, the class size statute forces school districts to begin bargaining on class size at a level that is already advantageous to teachers.</P>
<P> 2.  School districts cannot assign teachers to extra duty, even with the extra pay agreed upon by the union, against the teacher's wishes.  I have seen cases in which teachers who had been employed partly because of their ability to handle certain extracurricular duties declined to perform such duties after receiving tenure.  When the districts were unable to recruit individuals not on the regular staff to take the assignment, they were forced to overpay existing staff or drop the extracurricular activity. </P>
<P> 3.  Any benefits provided full-time support personnel must be prorated for part-time employees.  Thus if a school district increases vacation benefits for full-time cafeteria workers or bus drivers who work a full year, it must as a matter of law increase vacation benefits for such employees who work four or even only two hours a day for only 180 days a year.   Not surprisingly, the legislation was enacted at the behest of the California School Employees Association (CSEA), the state union representing most noninstructional employees in the state.  CSEA sought the legislation primarily to avoid internal conflicts between part-time employees seeking health benefits (a significant proportion of its membership) and regular full-time employees.  The legislation was also intended to discourage part-time employment.</P>
<P> 4.  A specified minimum percent of school districts' operating budgets must be spent for teacher salaries.  The minimum is 50 percent for elementary districts, 55 percent for districts including both elementary and secondary schools, and 60 percent for high school districts.   The effect of this legislation is to discourage school districts from introducing any changes that would reduce the proportion of their budgets devoted to teacher salaries.  Districts that are able to operate satisfactorily while paying teachers less than their state-mandated share of the district budget are nevertheless forced to increase teacher salaries.  In some cases the increases result in higher salaries than the teacher unions have already accepted.  A private company would never try to become more efficient by requiring itself to be labor intensive.</P>
<P> 5.  If a district wants to suspend a teacher for as little as one day, the procedure that must be followed is the same as for firing a tenured teacher.  The district and the employee each appoint someone to a three-member commission to conduct a hearing on the suspension.  (The third member is a state-appointed hearing examiner.)  If the school district loses, it must pay any compensation lost by the employee and the employee's hearing expenses as well.   Not surprisingly, only about one teacher in 10,000 is suspended annually in California.</P>
<P> California is supposed to be a leader in the school reform movement.  Nevertheless, the California Education Code includes scores of such indefensible statutes, virtually all of which have been ignored by reform leaders in that state.  In fact, some were enacted at their behest or at least without their overt disapproval.  If California regulated garbage removal as it does education, its laws would prescribe what days garbage would be picked up, between what hours, the qualifications for the supervisors of garbage disposal, the standards and procedures for disciplining or firing sanitation workers, the insurance policies governing equipment and personnel, policies governing layoff and recall of sanitation workers, the size and safety requirements for sanitation department trucks, and so on.  all these regulation would be imposed on a statewide basis, without regard to a community's economy or the citizens' wishes.  Under such circumstances, it would be astonishing if garbage removal by public employees was even close to efficient.</P>
<P> To illustrate how pervasive state-mandated inefficiencies are, let me cite a recent development from New York.  In 1987 the state enacted legislation that required school districts to provide training for teachers who did not meet regular certification requirements.   Under the statute, New York City could continue to employee teachers on emergency certificates, but such teachers could be required to teach only 80 percent of a normal teaching load.  During the remaining time the school districts were required to provide the teachers with additional training to aid them in achieving regular certification.  The school districts, therefore, lost 20 percent of the teachers' instructional time and also had to pay for their additional training.  New York City school officials estimated the district's additional costs in 1987-88 would be about $25 million. </P>
<P> Whatever the costs, they will not have contributed much if anything to better teaching in the city's schools.  The reasons some teachers are not certified have nothing to do with their teaching effectiveness.  Where additional training might be helpful, there is no assurance that qualified persons are available to provide it.  The district recruited retired teachers to provide the training, but their qualifications do not necessarily meet the needs of the teachers they supervise.  Once teachers acquire a regular certificate, they may seek teaching positions outside the state. And so on.</P>
<P> These specifics from California and New York illustrate how public education operates under a crushing burden of mandated inefficiency, that those who preach &quot;educational reform&quot; are often the ones most responsible for its absence, and that there is not the slightest let-up of legislation mandating inefficiencies.   As numerous as they are, however, the inefficiencies mandated by statute are probably outnumbered by those in collective bargaining contracts.  Approximately 75 percent of the nation's public school teachers work under such contracts.  In varying degrees, these contracts impose a wide range of inefficiencies on school districts; they restrict district flexibility to employment, assignment, transfers, scheduling, work day, work year, class size, and in a host of other matters.  Although some school board leaders have become more outspoken against these restrictions, there is no reason to believe they can eliminate them, absent some form of privatization.</P>
<P> Realistically, there is no movement within public education to change its governance structure or operating procedures.   Although they are desperately needed, such changes are not even being discussed in our political forums.  Even a rollback in teacher collective bargaining, which will happen as a result of  judicial decisions if it happens at all, would not overcome most governance and regulatory obstacles to better education.  Ideally, school board members are supposed to be pubic-spirited citizens who volunteer for public service in order to help children.  In the real world, however, school board candidates have the same need for support as other candidates for public office.  At the same time, teacher support personnel unions have a larger stake in who is elected to the board than does any other group.  Parents may be interested, but it is practically impossible or prohibitively expensive for most to try to change school district policies or practices.  Furthermore, parental interest in school affairs wanes when their children graduate, whereas employee interests in school board affairs are permanent.  In addition, as school board elections are often conducted separately from general elections, the political influence of teacher unions in those election is greatly enhanced.</P>
<P> This analysis also applies to those school boards that are appointed instead of elected; usually the appointments are made by a mayor, who must be sensitive to the wishes of the public sector unions.  Nor is the underlying argument weakened by the fact that, nationally, over half of school district revenues come from state governments.  Again, the dynamics are the same -- elected officials, primarily governors and members of state legislatures, frequently make legislative concessions in exchange for political support from unions.</P>
<P> The foregoing considerations underscore the potential importance of contracting out.  Because the employees of independent contractors are not public employees, they are not subject to the statues and collective bargaining contracts that cripple school management.  Thus private contractors may be able to avoid both the statutory and collective bargaining sources of inefficiency in school district operations.  Reforms that propose to &quot;empower teachers&quot; or accord &quot;professional autonomy&quot; to teachers are ludicrous intellectually but devastating in their political and policy consequences.  Such proposals are tantamount to prescribing the HIV virus to cure AIDS.  The only question is how long the patient can survive these misguided prescriptions.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Costs And Benefits In Educational Contracting Out</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Do the preceding considerations establish a case for contracting out instruction?  Objectively, the answer is &quot;Not thus far.&quot;  The analysis has shown that conceptually, contracting out instruction might achieve increased efficiency and/or higher quality education.  In order to decide whether to make or buy education, however, school boards must be able to compare the costs and outcomes under each decision.  These may not be the only relevant considerations, but they are obviously important.  If school boards know the costs but not the outcomes, they would not be able to make an informed decision.  Similarly, if they know the outcomes but not the costs, they would lack an adequate basis for their decisions.  Knowledge of both costs and outcomes is essential because school districts should not necessarily choose the option that results in greater learning.  If this option results in a very small increase in learning but requires huge additional resources, it will usually be less desirable.  At some point, educational improvement is not worth the cost of achieving it.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult, perhaps even impossible in some cases, to ascertain either the costs or the outcomes of public education.  For one thing, as previously noted, the costs are virtually always understated, often by substantial amounts.  These understatements vary from district to district and state to state.  In this analysis I can only illustrate some patterns of cost understatement; the actual amounts involved have to be ascertained from state and local data.</P>
<H3><A ID="I4" NAME="I4">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Local Costs Not Shown on School District Budgets</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Some of the local costs of public education do not even appear on school district budgets.  Let me first cite a simple example from my own experience.  Most school districts are contiguous with local governments, such as cities, municipalities, or counties.  It often happens that the local government tries to achieve a common labor relations position for all public employees within its borders; for example, it may not wish to give teachers an 8 percent salary increase if other public employees are receiving only a 5 percent increase.</P>
<P> In some areas, especially when the school district receives some funds from the local government, the latter provides negotiating services for the school district.  Such services may include the time of a chief negotiator and members of the negotiating team, use of data processing facilities and personnel, and reproduction and communications costs incidental to bargaining.  In large-city school districts, mayors and mayoral staffs may devote considerable time to school district bargaining.  Such time is not shown as a cost of public education.  Similarly, several municipal overhead costs are often not shown on school district budgets.  These costs may be for legal, accounting, financial, or personnel services, to cite just a few.  In some cases, such as the costs of school board elections, the understatements of the costs of public education are not relevant to cost comparisons of contracting out and direct provision of service.  In other situations, such as school board utilization of the city's legal staff, the understatements are or may be relevant.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Costs Not Shown on Any Local Budget</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In some states the state governments pay the contributions for teacher pensions.  As a result, these contributions do not show up in the budget of either the school district or of any local unit of government.0   Similarly, textbooks are sometimes provided by states at no charge or at a reduced charge to local school districts.  These costs, especially the former, can involve substantial amounts relevant to cost comparisons.</P>
<P> In addition, the costs of state regulation of education (as distinct from the costs of compliance) are not included in estimates of the per-pupil costs of education.  Unlike pension and textbook costs, the costs of state regulation would not normally affect comparisons between public and private provision.  This is certainly true when states regulate educational activities regardless of whether they take place in public or in private schools.  On the other hand, if one's purpose is to ascertain how much public education <I>in </I><I>toto</I> costs the taxpayers, the costs of state educational agencies, and even of noneducational agencies devote some of their resources to education, should be included.</P>
<H3><A ID="I6" NAME="I6">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Costs Not Shown on Any Budget -- Local, State, or Federal</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The market value of school district land and property is ordinarily not included in estimates of education costs.  Economically, this makes no sense; nobody operates a business without factoring in the costs of land and buildings.</P>
<P> It is important to recognize that &quot;cost&quot; does not necessarily refer to initial cost.  A school district may have acquired a school site fifty years ago for $1,000.  Today the site may be worth $1 million on the open market.  Conventional school finance would show the cost as zero, since the land is already paid for.  Realistically, the cost to the community is the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; -- the $1 million the district could get by selling the site at fair market value.  We should not assume there are no costs merely because there are no cash outlays.</P>
<P> The largest opportunity cost systematically ignored in school finance is student time.  This omission does not affect comparisons of public to private provision of educational services because the opportunity costs would be the same, regardless of whether a student was educated in a public school, a private school, or by a for-profit contractor.  Opportunity costs are, however, relevant to several important educational policy issues, such as the maximum age for compulsory education or the desirability of subsidies to students in higher education.  Needless to say, opportunity costs are closely associated with student age; a college student would ordinarily earn more than a first-grader if neither were in school.</P>
<P> Depreciation, of buildings or capital equipment or both, is routinely omitted from district budgets.  The omission not only distorts the cost picture but is conducive to inefficiency.  Failure to take depreciation into account often distorts comparisons of private to public school costs, even when the item is omitted from the financial statements in both sectors.</P>
<P> In economic terms, depreciation is the cost of using capital facilities or equipment.  The depreciation costs of public education include the decline in the value of buildings and capital equipment.  If the district builds a school, the costs should be prorated over the life of the school.  Likewise, if it buys trucks or typewriters or computers, the costs should be spread out over the useful life of the equipment.</P>
<P> When this is not done, the costs are overstated when purchases are made and understated in other years.  Quite often the outcome is excessive costs for repairs, with only lip service paid to preventive maintenance.  Budgets may allow for repairs but not for replacement, so repairs are made until the building or equipment is beyond repair.</P>
<P> Recent developments in New York illustrate how and why the neglect of depreciation results in significant underestimates of the costs of public education.  During 1986-87, the <I>New York Times</I> published several articles on the deplorable physical condition of New York City schools.  These articles portrayed an appalling picture of deterioration and neglect.  the articles asserted or quoted school officials as stating:</P>
<P>1.  Many school buildings had not been painted in twenty years.</P>
<P>2.  Holes in some classroom floors were large enough for students to fall through.</P>
<P>3.  A school visited by Mayor Ed Koch had broken window shades, peeling paint and  plaster, and no soap or paper for teachers or students.</P>
<P>4.  Almost ten years were required to build a school; only one new school had been  built from 1975 to 1987.</P>
<P>5.  The schedule for painting schools was once every thirty-three years.</P>
<P>6.  Most request for repairs (for example, for broken windows) went unheeded for years  unless the repairs were deemed an emergency.</P>
<P>7.  The only way to have maintenance work done was to have a powerful   political leader visit the school.1 </P>
<P>How could such a situation arise?  One reason is the time perspective of political leaders.  Inevitably, their major concerns are focused on the next election or on their political careers generally.  This generates enormous pressure to sacrifice long-range interests for immediate political advantage.  In practical terms, it results in a political tendency to overspend on employee benefits and underspend on capital equipment and maintenance for public facilities.  The benefits have an active, politically potent constituency; maintenance has only a diffuse public constituency that is unlikely to be effective in the budgetary process.</P>
<P> The politics of the New York City situation illustrate this point with unmistakable clarity.  In 1982 Mario Cuomo barely defeated Edward Koch for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York.  By all accounts, the all-out support of Albert Shanker, president of both the United Federation of Teachers in New York City and the American Federation of Teachers, was a critical factor in Cuomo's victory in the primary and in the general election for governor.2 </P>
<P> In July 1986 New York enacted special state aid legislation for the New York City schools.  The legislation provided $31 million in state aid.  It specified, however -- over the objections of Mayor Koch and the New York City Board of Education -- that the aid could be used <I>only</I> for teacher salaries.3   In view of the fact that the deterioration of the city's public school facilities had been widely known for years, it would be difficult to characterize the restriction as anything but a political payoff.</P>
<P> Although the physical deterioration of New York City schools may be exceptional, underfunding of maintenance needs is not.  In 1987 the backlog of school repairs nationally was estimated to be $25 billion and was expected to increase rapidly as many schools built in the 1950s and 1960s require major repairs.  The cost of meeting these needs is expected to be one of the most urgent problems facing state legislatures in the immediate future.4   Whatever the outcome, it is not likely to include realistic treatment of the costs of educational facilities.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Unfunded Pension Costs</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Another major cost that may not be shown on any budget is unfunded pension obligations.  Typically, teachers pay a specified percentage of their salaries to a state teachers retirement system.  The local school district and/or the state also contributes to the retirement system according to formulas set by the legislatures.  Teacher and public agency contributions are invested, and the total revenues are available for payments to retirees.</P>
<P> Essentially, there re two different approaches to funding.  One is &quot;full funding&quot;; under this approach, the funds contributed every year plus the anticipated earnings from investing prior contributions cover the costs of the anticipated obligations of the retirement system.  The other approach is &quot;pay as you go&quot;; here the assets of the retirement system meet current obligations (if they can ) and states make up any shortfall.  Some states have also added cost-of-living supplements from time to time to be paid from state, not local, funds.</P>
<P> Most teacher retirement plans are &quot;pay as you go,&quot; and they often have substantial unfunded pension liabilities, regardless of whether the nonteacher contributions come from the local school district, the state government, or some combination of the two.  Over the years the age of retirement and required number of years of service have been reduced.  Benefits have been extended to spouses and children; disability and service-related handicaps have been liberalized.  Meanwhile, beneficiaries' longevity has increased, so benefits must be paid over a longer period of time than was initially anticipated.</P>
<P> The extend of unfunded teacher retirement obligations varies widely from state to state.  In some states it is not a problem, or at least not a serious one.  In many others, however, it clearly is or will be.  In some states the state teacher retirement system needed to add over $11,000 per teacher to their assets (1985-86) to be fully funded.  These obligations amount to as much as $142 per resident of the state (the adult population minus those under eighteen years of age).5   Furthermore, taxpayer obligations are increasing; in the near future we can expect several state financial crises from the underfunding.  Regardless, the state teacher retirement systems are government agencies, and any shortfalls have to be made up by state governments.  This means that the pension costs for teachers currently in service cannot be ascertained by analyzing either the state or the local district budget, or both of them together.  Insofar as such budgets do not show either future cost-of-living supplements or underfunded pension obligations, they understate the costs of public education.</P>
<P> To appreciate the importance of pension issues to contracting out, it is essential to recognize the difficulties of remedying the problems of excessive public employee pensions.  Over the years most state courts have held that the pension benefits of public employees are contractual obligations of government; most state supreme courts have rejected the view that pension benefits are matters of legislative policy that can be changed by legislatures.  In most states, therefore, it is legally impossible to reduce benefits for retirees and current employees, regardless of how much greater than anticipated the required payments turn out to be.  At the same time, efforts to reduce benefit levels for new employees meet enormous resistance from public sector unions, including teachers'.  Apart from their general opposition to reducing benefits, they fear that reducing benefit levels for new employees will weaken the union.  Eventually the union would be divided between the new employees seeking to equalize pension benefits (thereby reducing the benefits that could be made available to the senior employees) and the senior employees seeking to add benefits to their existing ones.</P>
<P> Regardless of whether a state makes up a shortfall in contributions or adds a cost-of-living supplement, its additional contributions are not payments for current services.  They are additional payments for services that have been rendered in the past.  In pay-as-you-go plans, the cost figures for pensions are a mix of costs for present and for past services.  To fully assess the cost of present services, we should deduct the costs for past services and add the unfunded pension obligations that will be owed to current employees.  In effect, public school employees are being paid partly in cash and partly in promissory notes, but the cost figures show only the current cash payments to them or on their behalf.</P>
<P> Large unfunded liabilities have to be paid by future taxpayers; they are the big losers when political leaders increase retirement benefits without immediate appropriations or tax increases.  Future teachers and students are also big losers.  When the costs have to be paid, it becomes more difficult to increase or even maintain existing levels of public services.</P>
<P> Clearly, contracting out would tend to avoid most of these problems.  Private employers have less incentive to conceal unfunded pension costs; even when they have such incentives, shareholders and the investment industry are likely to monitor the situation.  The citizens who monitors public employee pension costs receives an insignificant benefit from detecting excessive pension costs; virtually all of the savings would go to other taxpayers.  In contrast, shareholders may benefit immediately, since the future dividend stream would be reduced.  For this reason, pension costs are monitored more carefully in the private sector, especially by large institutional investors.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Neglected Costs in Contracting Out</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Unfortunately for policymakers, cost comparisons can and sometimes do overlook some significant costs associated with buying services.  At least three kinds of costs are sometimes omitted.  First, the costs of the process of contracting out -- &quot;transaction costs,&quot;  to use the economists' term -- are often omitted.  Minimally, such costs include the process of preparing and advertising bids, evaluating offers to provide services, and negotiating and drawing up the appropriate contracts.  Obviously, the nature of the service involved is an important cost factor.  If the service requires substantial investment by the contractor or would idle district facilities, equipment, or personnel in the absence of a carefully crafted contract, transaction costs can be substantial.  Resolving the parties' rights to terminate and the allocation of payments and costs on termination may also involve substantial transaction costs.</P>
<P> Although transaction costs should not be ignored, they are not likely to affect the desirability of contracting out in most situations.  First of all, organizations of public officials have accumulated thousands of service contracts, many of them drafted by legal talent as good as any.  For this reason, school districts that are contracting out a service do not confront a tabula rasa on which the first good contract must be drafted.  Furthermore, whatever the transaction costs of the first contract, they are likely to be much lower for future contracts.</P>
<P> Like transaction costs, the costs of implementing rather than negotiating an agreement are sometimes overlooked.  Such costs may be due to litigation, labor problems, contractor delay or failure, and a host of other unanticipated problems that turn out to be very costly, politically as well as financially.</P>
<P> Once negotiated and implemented, service contracts must be monitored, and adequate monitoring can involve significant costs.  The basic issue is how the monitoring costs affect realistic comparisons of total costs.  Outside of education, monitoring for contracted services typically range from 5 to 10 percent of direct costs.  Obviously, omission of costs of this magnitude could lead to invalid comparisons.  Sometimes public agencies do require private contractors to specify monitoring costs even while failing to consider the costs involved in monitoring the performance of its own employees.  Quite clearly, valid comparisons include monitoring costs of both public and private service delivery.6 </P>
<P> Overall, it is very likely that inclusion of the neglected costs in cost comparisons would strengthen the case for contracting out.  First, the most substantial costs that are frequently ignored, such as pension costs, are virtually always higher in the public sector.  Second, the political pressures to underfund long-range needs, such as maintenance, are not as strong in the private sector.  For example, I doubt whether private contractors in New York City have underfunded their maintenance needs to the same extent as the city's public schools.  In other words, there appears to be less pressure in the private sector to conceal or minimize costs; if anything, the reverse is the case.  The major exception seems to be the costs associated with corruption in awarding and monitoring contracts.  These costs can be substantial, but they cannot be estimated accurately.</P>
<P> Studies indicate that contracting out is utilized most effectively when the service involved can be readily identified, measured, and evaluated.  Refuse collection illustrates this.  Is the refuse picked up by a certain time each day?  How many complaints are there?  Does the contractor respond within a specified time to complaints?  Questions such as these can be answered in a relatively straightforward way.   With education, however, it is more difficult to know what the outcomes should be, what they are, and how much weight to give them.</P>
<P> In the first place, schools have multiple objectives, such as literacy, computational skills, respect for others, patriotism, perseverance, creativity, and vocational/recreational/cultural skills.  Unfortunately, there is no consensus on these objectives or on how much weight to give them, even when their desirability is not in question.</P>
<P> In addition, the technical problems of assessing the school contributions to these outcomes are virtually insuperable.  Herbert J. Walberg, a leading scholar of school effects, has cited a number of major factors that influence affective, behavioral, and cognitive learning.  First are the <I>student aptitude factors</I>.  These include ability or prior achievement, as measured by the usual standardized tests; development, as indexed by chronological age or state of maturation; and motivation, or self-concept, as indicated by personality tests or the student's willingness to persevere intensively on learning tasks.</P>
<P> <I>Instructional factors</I> include:  The amount of time students engage in learning; and the quality of the instructional experience, including psychological and curricular aspects.</P>
<P> <I>Environmental factors</I> include:  the educational climates of the home, the classroom social group, and the peer group outside the school; and use of out-of-school time (specifically, the amount of leisure-time television viewing).7 </P>
<P> Clearly, some of these factors are largely or even entirely outside educators' control.  In any case, it is frequently impossible to distinguish school from nonschool effects on most of the objectives of education.  As Walberg comments:</P>
<P>It seems ironic that schooling and other educative experiences which constitute such a large fraction of human time and which may have immense consumption and investment value, are so narrowly and poorly measured.  Much more information is available on automobiles -- for example, base price, accessory and maintenance costs; information on speed, safety, size and reliability; and ratings on style and handling.  Comparatively little information of this kind is available on the costs and benefits of education.8 </P>
<P> In addition to these difficulties, the opponents of contracting out assert that some of the objectives of instruction are not subject to measurement.  Consequently, it is allegedly impossible to determine whether or not the contractor is performing adequately with respect to these objectives.  On the other hand, if only the measurable objectives are specified in contracts, contractors will focus their efforts on them to the neglect of others that do not lend themselves readily to measurement.  This would be undesirable.</P>
<P> Although these problems cannot be ignored, it is highly debatable whether they can constitute a valid argument against contracting out instruction.  Indeed, some problems may even strengthen the case for it although that may not be the intent of those raising the objection. </P>
<P> Granted, most of what we know about the outcomes of education is limited to what has been measured by tests.  Furthermore, most test measure verbal achievement and verbal skills.  Although significant, this limitation nevertheless should be viewed in perspective.  People devote a large part of their time to verbal activities; a 1978 study found that the typical worker was involved in some type of reading for 141 minutes, or 29 percent, of the average work day.  In addition, a great deal of leisure time is devoted to reading; for example, the mean time devoted to reading a newspaper the previous day was thirty-three minutes.9 </P>
<P> Other studies show that an extremely wide variety of jobs require a high degree of reading competence.  In fact, all types of workers placed a higher value on reading as a key to success than did high school students.  Given the tremendous amount of time devoted to verbal activities, their importance outside the workplace, and the fact that verbal skills do not require substantial sacrifice of other educational objectives, tests of verbal achievement are valuable albeit incomplete.</P>
<P> In any event, the most important issue is whether contracting out would fail because of evaluation problems or lead to a resolution of them.  Contractors will naturally try to demonstrate that conventional operations are not as effective as contracting out the service.  Their critics will try to identify negative outcomes that are ignored by the contractors.  Thus the process of contracting out facilitates clarity and specificity with respect to both costs and outcomes.  This outcome is independent of whether the contracts can provide equal or better service at a lower cost; what ever the real costs of public education (or any aspect of it), contracting out will tend to show what they are.  Public awareness of the costs is likely to help keep them to reasonable levels.</P>
<P> For all the rhetoric about nonacademic objectives, schools and teachers rely almost entirely on test of academic achievement to measure student progress.  It hardly makes sense to allow public schools but not private contractors to ignore nonacademic criteria.  Granted, education should have several objectives in addition to educational achievement.  If, however, public school officials can't tell us the criteria used to evaluate progress on these other objectives, how do they know -- how can they know? -- whether the public schools are fulfilling them?  And if the school officials themselves don't know, it's difficult to believe they regard the objectives very seriously.  It is at leas arguable that contracting out instruction would force school districts to come to grips with this issue.</P>
<P> Indeed, the assertion of behavioral and attitudinal objectives and the simultaneous absence of criteria to evaluate school performance on them is no accident.  A criterion is a two-edged sword.  It can be used to show progress -- or it can be used to show lack thereof.  Public schools, like public agencies generally, show little interest in developing criteria for evaluating their performance.  In the absence of such criteria, school personnel are invulnerable; no matter how poorly students perform in any given area, it can be asserted that other objectives that can't be measured must be taken into account.  In the meantime, the deficiencies are useful; for example, if students aren't learning, schools need more money for remedial programs, to attract better teachers, and to improve instructional materials.</P>
<P> Granted, it may be easier to compare public and private garbage removal or mail delivery than  the outcomes of education.  I think the difficulty is exaggerated, but whether it is or not is of secondary importance.  We must ask ourselves why parents and taxpayers lack usable criteria for evaluating school performance and what can be done about it.  Viewed in this light, the alleged absence of criteria for assessing educational outcomes is an argument for contracting out, not a reason to reject it.</P>
<P> I believe schools do have attitudinal and behavioral objectives, however poorly articulated they may be.  The reason that schools do not ordinarily evaluate progress on these objectives is not the inherent technical difficulty of doing so.  It is that no one has any stake in establishing the criteria necessary to do so.</P>
<P> Contracting out would provide the incentives for establishing such criteria.  Contractors need to know how their services will be evaluated.  School districts need to know whether contractors fulfilled district objectives.  Consequently, the process of contracting out forces districts to define their objectives and specify the criteria for evaluating contractor success in achieving them.</P>
<P> Let us get down to specifics.  Suppose we assume that public schools try to teach respect for others, patriotism, and good work habits, such as punctuality and perseverance.  Although these attitudes and habits are distinct objectives, they are not &quot;subjects&quot; like mathematics or reading.  Whether students learn these things depends on whether the teachers as a group and the school administration foster them  Although all teachers are responsible for helping to achieve these objectives, no individual teacher is held accountable for them.  There is nothing necessarily wrong with this, since it may be practically impossible to disentangle individual teachers' contributions to the objectives.  Yet it is still feasible to evaluate how effectively schools inculcate these habits and attitudes.  The reason it is not done is not the technical difficulty of formulating the criteria to be used.  The problem is managerial, not technical.</P>
<P> The foregoing analysis might be criticized as follows.  Teachers have multiple objectives.  If they are evaluated solely or primarily on the basis of objectives that can be measured, they will disregard the others.  To avoid neglect of objectives not subject to measurements, we must avoid evaluation solely on academic criteria.  Inability to measure nonacademic objectives should not lead us to adopt policies that will lead to ignoring them.</P>
<P> There is merit in the premise of this argument.  If teachers are evaluated solely on specified criteria, they are more likely to ignore others no matter how important.  Nevertheless, I regard the argument as weak.  First, many of the nonacademic objectives of education, such as good work habits, are instrumental to the academic objectives.  Even if these instrumental objectives are not measured directly, it is probably safe to assume that schools which show good academic results would show good nonacademic outcomes as well.</P>
<P> To the extent this analysis is valid, there is probably little to fear from contracting out.  There is no reason why contractors would be less likely to foster the desirable habits and attitudes in question.  These objectives are not so much a matter of expertise as they are of being clear about goals and being determined to achieve them.  I see no basis for assuming public schools would do a better job than private contractors; if anything, the latter should be expected to perform better, since their livelihood will depend on performance.</P>
<P> Recent trends in school finance underscore this point.  Over 50 percent of school revenues now comes from state governments.  All that counts in the allocation of state aid is the number of pupils in various grade levels or categories, such as the disabled or non-English speaking.  As state funds flow in regardless of performance on any criterion, there is no pressure on school districts to develop criteria for assessing performance.</P>
<P> In considering the difficulties of specifying instructional criteria, it is imperative to avoid a double standard of evaluation.  It ill behooves public school personnel who lack criteria for accountability to demand that a contractor be held to higher standards.  Initially, the same criteria that are used to evaluate conventional instruction can be used to evaluate instruction that is contracted out.  Those who  teach or allow teaching to go on in the absence of any criteria should not be allowed to block contracting out for this reason.  Like public school personnel, contractors might prefer not to be evaluated, but they could hardly prevent school boards from doing so.  No doubt contractors will propose criteria favorable to their efforts, but school boards need not accept them without change.  Over time, especially if contracting out instruction becomes more common, the criteria can be refined and expanded.  Furthermore, national and state organizations of school boards, school administrators, and teachers will provide feedback on contracting out in other school districts.  In short, it is essential to visualize the development of contracting out over time, not to view it simply as a static and repetitive process.</P>
<P> In this connection, department stores provide some useful models for school districts.  It is currently common practice for such stores to lease space to independent contractors.  This may happen because certain product lines, such as large appliances, require service that store management is not prepared to provide.  Or sometimes management wants to provide certain services, such as shoe repair, that do not provide an adequate return on investment; in such cases,  lessees may be willing to operate at lower costs or be willing to accept lower returns.  Sometimes leasing is used to introduce new products, or is required by vendors the store wishes to keep.  Perhaps significantly, the major opposition to leasing comes from store buyers who would lose their positions if leases replace direct store operation.0 </P>
<P> Some of the reasons for department store leasing would apply to schools; some would not.  We can also visualize reasons to lease school space that would not necessarily apply to the department store situation.  For example, such leases might be the only way to avoid statutory or bargaining restrictions that impair the quality of service.  In any event, the relationships among the school districts, independent contractors, students, and parents would be governed by the lease arrangements, just as they are in the department store situation; the leases spell out performance requirements, the application of store policies, dress codes, responsibilities for maintenance, and other potential sources of friction.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Private Ownership of Public Schools</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Thus far we have assumed that school boards would be the agencies that would contract for instructional services.  Let us now consider a much different approach, albeit one that is gaining widespread acceptance in other public services.</P>
<P> In chapter 1 we noted the increasing resort to sale and leaseback arrangements in the public sector.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements have forced many public agencies to build waste disposal and water purification facilities.  At the same time, public agencies have been limited by statutory restrictions on capital investment and voter resistance to the tax increases.  For these and other reasons, local governments often contract with private companies that build a required facility and then lease it to the public agency for a stipulated period, at which time ownership may or may not revert to the public body.  Frequently the lease also provides for the private operation of the facility.  In some cases where the revenues come form user fees, the leases include profit-sharing arrangements between the owner-operator and the local government.</P>
<P> Although such arrangements are virtually ignored in education, sale/leaseback arrangements may be especially appropriate in school operations.  The reason is that private owners of a school leased to a school district would be able to generate income that is lost under public ownership.  This is apparent if we compare the profit-making potential of a school with a waste disposal facility.  The latter has one service to sell.  Depending on the lease arrangements, it may be able to sell its services to other local governments, but its potential for generating revenue will be limited to waste disposal.</P>
<P> Let us now consider a public secondary school, which is typically in operation only 180 days a year.  On the days when it is used, most facilities may not be needed after the students have departed in mid afternoon.  Food facilities could be used as a restaurant or for take-out service.  Meeting rooms, parking spaces, an auditorium, audiovisual and copying equipment, school buses, and perhaps several other facilities could be used commercially.</P>
<P> Why are these facilities not rented when they are not required for school operations?  Essentially, there are no personal incentives for school management to do so.  On the contrary, school management would be criticized for competing unfairly with private business.  Furthermore the &quot;profits&quot; would not go to management but to the school district -- perhaps with the result that its tax revenues would be decreased because funds were available from these other sources.</P>
<P> Suppose, however, that a commercial company owns the facility and leases it to the school district for specific times.  At other times the owners are free to use the school as a profit center.  They can lease the kitchen facility for a restaurant or take-out service after school hours.  They can rent space to hotels that need meeting rooms or organizations needing an auditorium.  In other words, private sector owners would be able to generate the income in ways that school districts cannot.</P>
<P> Granted, school districts and other public agencies sometimes engage in such commercial efforts.  Nevertheless, it would be unrealistic to expect the same outcomes, regardless of whether a public agency or for-profit company owns the facilities.  If a private sector company seeking to earn profits owns a facility, we can expect much greater sensitivity to entrepreneurial opportunities.  In contrast, if ownership is invested in a political body, as is the case now, facility utilization will be governed by a different set of incentives and a political, not an economic, calculus.  Inasmuch as school districts can protect their interests in drawing up the sale and leaseback agreement, these arrangements should be at least as useful in education as in other municipal services.</P>
<P> As previously noted, there are problems with leasebacks; legal liability is a major one.  The important point is that these problems are being solved every day in other public services.  Furthermore, one of the problems in education may also turn out to be its biggest advantage:  companies may participate because of the presence of secondary youth while they simultaneously provide students with much-needed employment opportunities.  In any event, many teachers might be entrepreneurs if circumstances were  appropriate.  As currently structured, education does not encourage or foster entrepreneurial talent; to be an entrepreneur, teachers are forced to leave the field.  If and when this changes, we may see the emergence of educational leaders oriented more to the creation of value than to the redistribution of it.</P>

<P><B>O</B>ur analysis to this point might be characterized as cautiously optimistic.  Contracting out has been shown to result in significant savings and/or quality improvements under the proper conditions.  Although the extent of these conditions in education is difficult to estimate, we certainly can expect them to exist in many areas.  The major problem seems to be that as one moves away from readily observable and quantifiable services, the promise of contacting out is less encouraging.  Another problem is the perception that contracting out instruction has been tried and has failed miserably as a means of achieving educational improvement.  As one publication commented in 1975:</P>
<P>Performance contracting has been pronounced dead again, with the latest autopsy performed by the Education Testing Service.  Except for an occasional rumor that the deceased has been seen alive and well in Michigan, not many doubt the demise of the phenomenon that put private enterprise into the classroom a few years ago.  What's surprising is how many people keep reopening the grave to see if the corpse is still there. </P>
<P> To the extent that such an attitude still exists, it is likely to be based on experience with &quot;educational performance contracting&quot; in the early 1970s.  This experience resulted largely from a series of contracts funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to improve reading and mathematics skills among disadvantaged children,  Inasmuch as this experience was widely characterized as a test of contracting out instruction, it deserves a careful review.</P>
<P> As will soon be evident, every aspect of the OEO project was highly controversial.  Although some discussion of the controversies is unavoidable, my purpose is not to resolve them.  Rather it is to show what the project can tell us about contracting out instruction.  After all, a great deal has been learned about contracting out since 1970, so we are better able now to assess our earlier experience with the process.</P>
<P> </P>

<P> The OEO was established in 1964 as the major federal agency to administer programs to alleviate poverty.  At the time, federal strategy was to reduce poverty by improving the educational skills of disadvantaged youth.  This strategy called for substantial federal support for programs of compensatory education.  One such program was Head Start, the major federal program intended to enhance the school readiness of disadvantaged preschool children.  As it turned out, however, Head Start was not very effective in improving the educational skills of disadvantaged minorities. </P>
<P> In the late 1960s, however, a new and promising approach to the education of disadvantaged minorities developed in Texarkana, Arkansas.  The Texarkana school district had contracted with Dorsett Educational Laboratories, a private firm, to provide reading and mathematics instruction.  The contract provided that Dorsett would not be paid unless student achievement reached specified levels within a specified time.  This feature led to the notion of &quot;educational performance contracting&quot;; as implemented in Texarkana, contractor compensation was based on student achievement.  When early reports indicated that educational achievement was increasing dramatically under this contract, visitors from every state went to Texarkana to see for themselves what was going on; many were sufficiently impressed to launch their own educational performance contracts in 1970-71.</P>
<P> OEO representatives visited the Texarkana district in March 1970.  In April the agency announced its intention to conduct experiments* (* I have reservations about whether the term experiment should be applied to the OEO project, but as it has been used widely there is no point in fighting this semantic battle ) in educational performance contracting; in these experiments, which were to be conducted in grades 1 to 3 and 7 to 9, private contractors were to be paid on the basis of gains in student performance in reading and mathematics, as measured by standardized tests.  Thirty-one firms responded to the invitation to be considered for participation; eventually six firms were selected, based on their capability, experience, and proposed approach.  Factors emphasized in selection were use of technology, student incentives, and use of paraprofessionals; firms that appeared to have the best chance of achieving high benefit-cost ratios were selected.</P>
<P> The school districts were chosen from a group of seventy-seven that expressed an interest in participating.  These seventy-seven districts were screened on the basis of the following criteria:</P>
<P>1. At least 80 percent of the district population had poverty-level incomes, as defined by Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.</P>
<P>2. District students were below national norms in reading and mathematics.</P>
<P>3. The district enrolled the required numbers of students in the grades covered by the study.</P>
<P>4. The district had recent, valid, and reliable test achievement data so that it was feasible to assign students to experimental and control groups.</P>
<P>5. The absence of any problems that might interfere with the experiment.</P>
<P> Twenty-two districts reelecting a reasonable good geographical and demographic distribution met these criteria.  After four withdrew during negotiations, the remaining eighteen were assigned, three to each contractor.  Within each district, the most deficient students in the most deficient school were designated as the experimental group, and the school with the next most deficient student population was designated as the control group.  The experimental group consisted of the students to be taught by the private contractors; the control group, in theory a group of equal achievement at the beginning of the school year, continued to be taught by regular teachers.  Arrangements were also made to take into account transfers out of the participating schools.</P>
<P> Despite a host of difficulties, the project got underway in the late summer of 1970.  At the beginning and end of the 1970-71 school year, Battelle Laboratories, an independent testing and analysis organization under contract to OEO, tested the students in both groups.  Using each grade at each site as a unit of comparison, the test results showed that the experimental groups scored better than the control groups in 28 cases, or 13 percent of the total number of comparisons.  In 60 cases -- 28 percent of the total -- the students in the control group scored higher than the experimental group.  In 124 comparisons -- 59 percent of the total -- there was no significant difference between the two groups.  As Battelle Laboratories summarized the outcome:</P>
<P>There is very little evidence that performance incentive contracting, as implemented by the technology companies at the 18 school districts in this study for a period of one year, had a beneficial effect on the reading and mathematics achievement of students participating in the experiment, as measured by a standardized achievement test. </P>
<P> As a result of this negative evaluation, educational performance contracting virtually disappeared.  Districts that had been contemplating similar projects dropped their plans to do so; districts that had contracts usually did not renew them.  For our purposes, however, the issue posed by the OEO project can be formulated this way:  Assuming that the negative results of the experiment were accurate, what were the reasons for them?  More precisely, were the reasons for the negative results inherent in contracting out?  Or were they primarily situation-specific reasons that could reasonably be avoided in other efforts to contract out instruction?</P>
<P> Although my answer to these questions does not depend on the experiment's deficiencies, it will be useful to discuss them briefly.  In most cases, the deficiencies are indisputable; what is controversial is the extent to which they impaired the significance of the results.</P>
<P> One goal of the project was to accretion whether contracting out could improve the reading and mathematics skills of students deficient in these areas.  On the other hand, the experiment was also deigned to test the use of student and teacher incentives.  As previously noted, Battelle Laboratories stated its major conclusion in terms of &quot;performance incentive contracting.&quot;  As a Brookings Institute study points out,</P>
<P>A fundamental shortcoming of the performance contracting experiment concerned confusion over the basic goal of the enterprise . . the underlying concept of performance contracting could have been tested in two quite different ways:  either to determine whether private firms with 1970 vintage technology could teach better than traditional schools, or to determine whether economic and contractual incentives would in the long run encourage better teaching and would therefore be a preferable means for local school boards to purchase educational services than the current procedures.  There was confusion about these two partially incompatible objectives from the outset. </P>
<P> Actually, more than two incompatible objectives undermined the experiment from the outset.  As Charles Blaschke, a knowledgeable participant, pointed out:</P>
<P>Many school boards view performance contracting as a vehicle for introducing merit pay into public education, especially if contractors are permitted to reward their employees on the basis of student performance.  At the same time, since most contractors utilize differentiated staffing, efficient practices by school systems during turnkey phases must also follow similar staffing patterns. . . </P>
<P> While most guidelines of federal programs (for example, Elementary and Secondary Education  Act Title I) require equality in terms of comparable inputs, such as facilities or student teacher ratio, performance contracting introduces the concept of equity of results. . . </P>
<P> A proper analysis of the Office of Economic Opportunity experiment must separate contracting as a technique of experimentation from that of a technique of instruction. </P>
<P> These comments highlight several basic points.  First, they underscore the fact that at least some school districts viewed the project as a means of introducing or testing incentive plans for students, teachers, and/or parents.  In and of itself, there was nothing wrong with this.  It must be emphasized, however, that contracting out per se has no inherent relationship to incentive systems for compensating employees.  The two concepts are separate and distinct.  For example, if a bus company contracts to operate a school bus system for profit, it does not <I>necessarily</I> follow that its drivers (who may still be district employees) will be paid on an incentive basis.  Of course, a school district could require a contractor to use an incentive pay system for its employees or for district employees covered by the contract.  In such a case, however, we would have a contract to test an incentive system; the incentive system, not contracting out, would be the subject of the test.  This point is especially crucial because the incentive systems sought to be implemented in the OEO experiment were certain to arouse widespread teacher opposition.  It was as if a hospital contracted with a company to administer a drug that had never been effective and that would arouse intense opposition from doctors -- and declared afterward that contracting out was a failure.</P>
<P> Blaschke's comments also reveal another fundamental distinction between the OEO approach and the normal practice in contracting out.  In the OEO project, it was assumed that after the companies had demonstrated the success of their approach, the entire operation would be &quot;turnkeyed&quot; over to local school districts.  That is, it was envisaged that district management would incorporate successful approaches on a day-to-day basis.  Using contracting out in this way has little in common with proposals to use private contractors on a regular basis to provide services.  About the only thing the two ideas do have in common is that in both cases there is a contract with a private firm.  The differences, however, are fundamental.</P>
<P> First of all, the OEO approach had little relevance to the efficiencies of contracting out.  With a contract for only one year, contractors are not likely to invest in the capital equipment, training, and other costs associated with a long-range investment.  The contractors in the project did make some investment in these areas, but hardly what would be expected in a multi-year contract that had the possibility of renewal.  Second, although contracting out might be useful as a way to test procedures that can be incorporated by the public agency, that is not its basic rationale.  To some extent, it is actually inconsistent with it.  Ordinarily the goal of contracting out is to achieve efficiencies that are not available under direct provision of services by a public agency.  Viewing contracting out as a way to identify practices that can be incorporated by public agencies is a crippling limitation on its use, even experimentally.</P>
<P> This point highlights another example of the goal confusion characterizing the OEO project.  After pointing out that the cost differences between experimental and control schools did not appear to affect the outcomes one way or another, Gramlich and Koshel point out:  &quot;One of the initial goals of the project, progressively abandoned as it ran its course, was to see if performance contracting companies could teach more cheaply than the control schools.&quot; </P>
<P> This comment illustrates the extremely limited applicability of the OEO project.  Contracting out can be the clearly preferred mode of service delivery solely on cost grounds, without any improvement in student achievement or service effectiveness.  Suppose, for example, that in dealing with brain-damaged children, no type of instruction results in greater student achievement.  Suppose also, however, that whatever is the maximum achievable level of student achievement, private contractors can achieve it for half the cost of public delivery, with no negative side effects.  It would be ridiculous to argue that contracting out is a &quot;failure&quot; merely because there is no improvement in student performance.  This conclusion would make sense only if costs were totally irrelevant in choosing delivery systems.</P>
<P> If we want to find out whether contracting out can bring about the same or higher levels of educational achievement but at a lower cost, we should not add costs intended to test whether the use of incentives can increase educational achievement.  Inasmuch as either hypothesis could be valid while the other was not, combining the two in the same experiment results in conclusions that may not be valid for either hypothesis.  When more goals are built into the experiment, the conclusions about any particular goal become even more suspect.</P>
<P><B>Teacher Union Opposition</B>  In choosing school districts to participate, OEO tried to select districts without problems that would interfere with the project.  In retrospect, it is difficult to see how the agency could have selected districts more problematical than some of those selected.</P>
<P> One of the sites was part of the New York City school district.  In 1969 the district had experienced the longest and most divisive teacher strike in the history of American education.  The major issue in the strike was an effort by predominantly black community school boards to replace white teachers supported by the union with black teachers supported by the board.   Coming as it did less than a year after an unprecedented racial confrontation in the city's schools, the teacher union leaders perceived the OEO project as a way for the school board to have its way.  As with most of the other districts the OEO chose to participate, the union was not consulted prior to the contract; participation was treated as a fait accompli.  Not surprisingly, this particular site turned out to be a disaster area.  As one study describes it:</P>
<P>There were also a few sites where extraordinary difficulties occurred, much beyond anything that might have been anticipated beforehand and sometimes so serious as to make the test results next to meaningless.  The worst was the Bronx.  In the late sixties the New York City school system had moved toward a decentralized, community-controlled system that had antagonized its strong local teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers.  This union, a chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, was as opposed as its parent to performance contracting, and its president, Albert Shanker, announced on the radio that he believed the OEO Bronx program to be illegal and threatened action to prevent its continuation.  The teachers in the experimental schools took this cue and were continually at loggerheads with the contractor, Learning Foundations.  There were reports that they threw some of the Learning Foundations equipment out of second-story windows and told students to throw away their parent questionnaires.  Discipline in the junior high schools involved in the experiment became so bad at one point early in the fall that all testing and instruction were halted and a full-time policeman had to be stationed in one of them.  Instruction could only be resumed when the president of Learning Foundations, Fran Tarkenton, at that time also quarterback of the New York Giants football team, was able to rally community support around the project.  Even so, records from the project are very incomplete.  The tests at the end of the school year were given in a ballroom a few blocks  from the school and a new form of attrition was introduced as students walked from the school to the testing room.  Moreover, some of the ninth grade control students were not post-tested because the school principal assigned Battelle a testing date that was after the school year was over, the parent questionnaires and student information cards were never filled out, and the project director kept very poor records of who was and who was not in the program.  Fortunately, this experience was out of the ordinary.</P>
<P> The situation in Hartford and Philadelphia was almost as disorganized. </P>
<P><B>Contract Errors and Miscalculations</B>   Every evaluation of the OEO project agreed that the contracting process was too brief, with serious errors and omissions on all sides as a result.  As Gramlich and Koshel point out, &quot;Performance contracting became a hot educational issue in the early months of 1970, and in its haste to take advantage of this opportunity, OEO rushed precipitously into the planning of the experiment.&quot;0 </P>
<P> A brief chronology may help to explain just how inadequately all parties were prepared for the experiment.  OEO representatives visited Texarkana district in March 1970.  By April the agency decided to launch the experiment and advertised for contractors on April 27, 1970.  At this time, it sent request for proposals (RFPs) to over twenty firms and also negotiated a contract with Educational Turnkey Systems to provide management support services.  Within two months OEO selected the six contractors and the eighteen participating school districts; most of the contracts were signed by mid-July 1970, at which time OEO sent RFPs on the evaluation to approximately fifty companies.  This contract was awarded in August to Battelle Memorial Institute, which began conducting the pretests two weeks later.</P>
<P> All of the parties encountered major problems as a result of their lack of preparation.  The contractors had very little time to hire teachers and to establish lines of communication with school officials and local teaches.  Equipment and instructional materials did not always arrive in time, necessitating changes in programs and materials.  School district officials had to identify the students to participate in the project, explain and hopefully gain the support of teachers and administrators in participating schools, and employ a project director and two aides.  It appears, however, that most teachers and principals were not informed about the project until they returned to school in the fall.</P>
<P> Battelle Institute, the contractor responsible for testing and evaluation, was also severely handicapped by the lack of time.  Almost 30,000 students in six grades at eighteen sites had to be tested within weeks after Battelle was awarded the contract.  As the institute had no previous experience in such large-scale testing operations, the arrangements to test students at the beginning of the school year were frequently inadequate, for both experimental and control students.  Battelle itself noted disciplinary problems, overcrowding, excessive heat, student disruptions, and even a fire drill during a pretest; in some cases it was necessary to retest students a few weeks latter.</P>
<P> Ordinarily, when a contractor undertakes a project with substantial indeterminate costs, there is provision fro payment on the basis of actual expenses plus a percentage to allow for some profit.  Such contracts are highly susceptible to abuse; if profits depend on the amount of expenses, it will be in the contractor's interest to run up the expenses.  Intensive auditing can minimize the risks of abuse, but some risk is always present.</P>
<P> For whatever reasons, all of the OEO contracts were on a fixed-fee basis.  This turned out to be a major mistake from any point of view.  Unanticipated problems leading to unanticipated expenses not only rendered participation highly unprofitable, but ultimately led to lengthy litigation as contractual deficiencies became apparent to all parties.  In addition to underestimating their costs and overestimating their ability to achieve educational improvement, the contractors naively accepted an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; system of payment; they received no payment at all for students who did not advance at least a full grade beyond normal expectations.  Such a clause is likely to encourage contractors to concentrate their efforts on the students who were most likely to fulfill the payment conditions.  Although it is impossible to determine whether this happened, it is an example of the poor drafting that characterized the contracts.</P>
<P> A General Accounting Office (GAO) study of the OEO project listed several major additional deficiencies.
<BR>1   It pointed out that the bidding procedures for the management support contractor provided only &quot;token acquiescence to requirements for competition&quot;; the RFP was drafted in such a way that it rationalized the selection of two contractors who had already been negotiating with OEO for the contract.  OEO did not apply the RFP criteria to the selection of contractors, none of whom had the experience specified in the proposal.  In addition, some did not meet the standards of financial responsibility required by federal procurement regulations.  These regulations were also violated in other ways; for example, changes in the RFP were not incorporated in it in a notice sent to all bidders.  Five of the six firms did not provide a repayment bond as required in projects of this sort; such a bond was especially needed because the payment provisions allowed substantial payments prior to the definitive determination of the amounts due.  The GAO also concluded that two of the six contractors did not meet the conditions of financial responsibility required by federal regulations.</P>
<P> The GAO report also listed several major deficiencies in the project implementation.  For example, no attention was paid to the amount of time students in the control group received instruction in reading and mathematics.  Obviously, failure to control this variable might have discredited all the conclusions -- differences between the experimental and the control group that were attributed to incentives (or lack thereof) might have been the result of differences in instructional time.  Whether or not this particular oversight affected the outcome, it was typical of the sloppiness at every phase of the project.  The procedure for selecting the experimental and control groups was seriously flawed; the racial composition was different in seven of the eighteen sites and unknown in four others.  Personnel were often hired just a few days before the project was to begin and even afterward, in some cases.  The contracts with the school districts were inconsistent with those with the contractors; the former stated the contractor was responsible for testing, the latter stated that the districts were responsible for it.  Regardless, the test guidelines were frequently violated.  Initially the results were to be evaluated on a site-by-site basis.  In this way, it might have been possible to evaluate the performance of the different contractors.  Instead, the results were aggregated.  Furthermore, although the project was supposed to test different approaches throughout the year; it would have been impossible to draw any valid conclusions about their approaches even if the data had not been aggregated.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Implications of the OEO Project for Contracting Out</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> OEO's report on the project, released in June 1972, states:</P>
<P>The results of the experiment clearly indicate that the firms operating under performance contracts did not perform significantly better than the more traditional school systems.</P>
<P> Thus while we judge this experiment to be a success in terms of information it can offer about the capabilities of performance contractors, it is clearly another failure in our search for means of helping poor and disadvantaged youngsters to develop the skills they need to lift themselves out of poverty.2 </P>
<P> The GAO report flatly asserted that the OEO's conclusions were not justified:  &quot;Because of a number of shortcomings in both the design and implementation of the experiment, it is our opinion that the question as to the merits of performance contracting versus traditional educational methods remains unanswered.&quot;3 </P>
<P> Essentially, it is not necessary to decide whether the deficiencies of the OEO experiment affected the test results.  Even if the results were unimpeachable in every way, they would not affect the case for contracting out, for instruction or anything else.  One reason relates to the limitations of the experiment.</P>
<P> According to the Battelle evaluation:</P>
<P>First, the analysis evaluated performance incentive contracting as <I>implemented by the six </I><I>technology companies involved in the study.</I>  The evaluation makes no pretense of generalizing results and conclusions to the effectiveness of performance incentive contracting in general . . .  Indeed, the obtained outcomes for the six companies involved in the study could be different if they were to implement their program in a different way as a result of experiences gained during the experimental year.</P>
<P> Second, the analysis evaluated performance incentive contracting as implemented <I>for a period of one year.</I>  The evaluation makes no pretense of generalizing results and conclusions to the effectiveness of performance incentive contracting implemented for more than one year.</P>
<P> Finally, the analysis evaluated performance incentive contracting <I>using a </I><I>standardized achievement test</I> as the basis for assessing program impact.  The evaluation makes no pretense of generalizing results and conclusion to the effectiveness of performance incentive contracting using some other method  of assessing program impact.4 </P>
<P> Actually, the OEO project was neither an adequate not a comprehensive test of incentives, whether for students, teachers, or contractors.  In addition, the project shed no light on the effects of incentive systems not approved by OEO and the participating school districts.  In any event, subsequent events have discredited any rejection of contracting out instruction on the basis of the OEO project.  Today private contractors are providing instructional services for school districts in such areas as remedial reading, foreign languages, education for the disabled, and teacher training.5   The &quot;experiment&quot; that proved it couldn't be done has turned out to be irrelevant.</P>
<P> In retrospect, the irrelevance of the OEO experiment to contracting out seems obvious.  Why was it not obvious in the early 1970s?  To answer this question, it is essential to understand the origins of the project.  In 1970 there was much more opposition to school integration than there is today.  There was also a great deal of concern among federal policymakers over both the persistence of de facto segregation and the educational deficits among disadvantaged minorities.  These problems were seen as closely interrelated.  School districts were frequently caught in a dilemma between legal mandates to end segregation and local political opposition to integration.  Much of the opposition was due to the perception that black students' lower educational achievement levels would have a negative effect on white students if integration took place.  Reading and mathematics skills were not only important in their own right but they were the primary, if not the only, academic skills that had been tested nationally.  For this reason, they were a natural focus for the early efforts to contract out instruction.</P>
<P> Understandably, the OEO's concern was not to test contracting out per se.  It was how to improve reading and mathematics skills of disadvantaged minorities, especially blacks.  Apart from this, OEO had no interest in educational contracting out.  The possibility that contracting out instruction might have been a better way to provide educational services in general, or to students who were not disadvantaged and performing poorly, was not an underlying concern.  This is not a criticism of OEO; it was not primarily an educational agency.  Furthermore, there was nothing wrong with the OEO objective; it was a worthy one.  On the other hand, the educational problems is sought to resolve were -- and still are  -- largely intractable to remedial treatment.  In effect, therefore, the OEO selected the most difficult student population in the most difficult problem area -- and the, &quot;failing&quot; to show significant progress in one year, abandoned the effort.  I cannot criticize the abandonment, especially after the way the project was initiated; what should be criticized is the contention that the OEO project is evidence that contracting out instruction won't work.</P>
<P> What the OEO project really demonstrated was not the inability of the for-profit sector to contribute to improving public education; it was how federal spending for educational research is dominated by short-term political considerations and is, therefore, largely a waste of money.  Needless to say, however, the opponents of contracting out took full advantage of their opportunity to discourage any wider interest in the subject.  Like the youngster who murdered his parents and then pleaded for mercy because he was an orphan, the teacher unions did everything possible to block or sabotage the project; then, having contributed so much to its demise, they pointed to the latter as proof that union objection to contracting out had been right all the time.  In the antimarket environment of public education, this argument was persuasive.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Overcoming Union Opposition to Contracting Out</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> As we have seen, the major opposition to contracting out comes from the employees and/or the unions that represent them.  Can this opposition be overcome or neutralizes?</P>
<P> Three basic principles should guide school management on this issue.  One is that no special interest group should be permitted to block an action that is in the district's interest.  Occasionally it may be impossible to adhere to this principle, but it is better to recognize a violation of it than to rationalize it away.  the second principle is to deal fairly with employees who are adversely affected by contracting out.  What this requires in any specific situation may be controversial, but it should not be interpreted to give employees or their unions veto power over proposed changes.</P>
<P> The third principle is not always recognized, but it is critical from a strategic point of view.  The principle is that union and employee interests are not identical, and the differences can sometimes be used to neutralize union opposition to contracting out.  On this issue, there is much to be learned from the way Margaret Thatcher's government in Great Britain has facilitated privatization.6   From the out set it has sought not merely to neutralize employee opposition but to gain employee support for privatization.  To achieve this objective, it has offered employees a variety of benefits; for example, employees have had opportunities to buy stock at a deep discount in companies taking over former government enterprises.  Similarly, to overcome management opposition to privatization, incumbent management often remains when the enterprise is privatized.  In many instances even the unions that opposed privatization ended up purchasing a substantial number of shares in the new companies -- as did large numbers of union members.</P>
<P> By and large, the specifics of the British approach are not applicable to public education in the United States; the underlying philosophy and attitude, however, are quite relevant.  It is especially critical to recognize that the union's underlying interests are not necessarily identical to those of the employees.  This is especially evident when the work is contracted out to a nonunion employer.  Even when the contractor's employees are or can be unionized, they may come under the jurisdiction of a different union.  For this reason, the union representing school district employees is likely to oppose contracting out regardless of the union status of the contractor's employees.  </P>
<P> When employees would be adversely affected by contracting out, there is no conflict between union and employee interests.  In many situations, however, employers can satisfy employee interests in ways that do not accommodate the union's.  For example, in order to overcome employee opposition to contracting out, the employer may offer early retirement, severance pay, and/or transfers on conditions highly favorable to its employees.  In some situations employers can assure employees against layoffs and depend on attrition or voluntary departures to carry out the commitment.  In contrast, union staff who rely on dues income for their livelihood will accord preservation of the union a higher priority than the employees protected against loss of income.</P>
<P> In some cases union opposition to contracting out may be perceived as contrary to employee interests.  Suppose that school boards in a given area propose to contract out instruction in a field in which they are unable to recruit enough teachers.  Some teachers in the fields of shortage may feel that with extensive use of paraprofessionals and technology, they can meet district needs as contractors instead of as employees.  The teacher unions in these districts, however, will be concerned about the precedent and the loss of dues-paying members.  Even if the local teacher unions are not concerned, their state and national affiliates are likely to oppose such a development.</P>
<P> Of course, in any such situation, the unions would be denying teachers an opportunity to promote their own welfare by providing services as contractors instead of as employees.  For this reason, the union's position would be difficult to defend.  It is impossible to predict how often such situations will arise; the underlying issue is the extent to which contracting out will be a cottage industry or be the outcome of large-scale contracting in which contractors operate entire schools or even districts.</P>
<P> In the normal course of events, the union will be adversely affected by contracting out, at least in the short run.  Although it would always be desirable to have union approval (if it can be achieved without excessive concessions, it will usually be withheld, except under heavy pressure.  Such pressure may include benefits that are contingent upon acceptance of contracting out.  The benefits may apply to employees not affected by contracting out as well as those directly affected by it.  Efforts to overcome union and/or employee opposition could include one or more of the following provisions:</P>
<P>1. The employees remain on the district payroll but work pursuant to arrangements between the contractor and the district.  This is a common procedure in certain types of support services.</P>
<P>2. As part of the contract, the contractor may be required to employ district employees on a preferential basis.  The preference may be limited to a certain time (for example, up to five years).  The district may supplement the contractor's payments.  Some type of joint payment often occurs when employees would lose pension or health insurance benefits if forced off the district payroll.</P>
<P>3. Severance pay and/or maintenance of health insurance benefits might be considered to ease the transition.</P>
<P>4. Liberalized early retirement might be made available in certain situations.</P>
<P>5. Transfers or reassignments might ensure continuous employment without loss of pay or benefits for employees who would otherwise suffer from contracting out.</P>
<P> Of course, the saving achieved by contracting out over time must take into account the transition costs and the costs of contract monitoring.  The important point is to analyze the circumstances to see what can and might be done to mitigate employee/union opposition.</P>
<P> Undoubtedly, salary and pension problems can be a major obstacle to contracting out instruction.  Teacher salary schedules reward years of service.  Although significant savings might be generated without loss of quality by using part-time and/or younger teachers, teachers with many years of service will be strongly opposed to a new system that does not pay as much for longevity.  Pension issues often exacerbate the salary problem.  Teachers are members of state teacher retirement systems, which usually base pension payments on the number of years taught and the average salary of the final one to three years.  As a result, teachers within a few years of retirement may oppose contracting out because it jeopardizes their anticipated level of pension benefits.  One question is whether such teachers can be retrained as district employees until retirement or can be bought out without giving up the economic advantages of contracting out.  Obviously, the answer will vary with such factors as the age of the teaching staff, but the issue has to be considered carefully.</P>
<P> Pension problems illustrate the point that the most difficult aspect of contracting out is its impact on public employees.  On the other hand, it is not desirable to maintain an inefficient delivery system because some employees will be disadvantaged by change.  In chapter 2 we noted the enormous costs of political bailouts for redundant public employees.  The problem is not temporary government support to ease a transition; it is that all too often, the transition is not made in the public sector.</P>
<P> On the other hand, there is no clear-cut standard for government to apply in resolving situation of inefficiency or redundancy.  How much protection or compensation should be accorded public employees when more efficient ways to deliver services eliminate or reduce the need for their services?  In practice and in the absence of any economic guidelines, the question is answered on a short-term political or bureaucratic basis:  How would a proposed cut affect reelection prospects or bureaucratic objectives?  The result is a substantial tilt toward inefficiency in public employment.  Essentially, we have to find ways to use the savings from more efficient procedures to gain the support, or at least neutralize the opposition, of public employees adversely affected by such procedures.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Role of School Management in Contracting Out</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Unlike teacher unions, school management has no reason to oppose contracting out as an option to be exercised when circumstances warrant.  In fact, school management has strong reason to resolve any close calls in favor of contracting out.  Let us see why this is so.</P>
<P> In conventional operations, school management hires staff:  teachers, principals, custodians, bus drivers, cooks, and so on.  On the other hand, management also is responsible for evaluating these employees.  Inasmuch as no one likes to admit having employed incompetent employees, especially if there is a political cost to the admission, there tends to be a management bias in favor of favorable evaluations.  When the legal and practical difficulties of terminating incompetent employees are added to the inherent management bias in their favor, the outcome tends to favor the employees over the service consumers.  Teacher rhetoric notwithstanding, public schools suffer much more from pro forma evaluation, or none at all, than from unjustified negative evaluations.</P>
<P> The conflict of interest in employment situations is only one example of a broader conflict that limits the effectiveness of school management.  On the one hand, it is the producer of educational services; on the other, it is also responsible for representing the consumers of the service.  Although widely ignored, this conflict of interest constitutes a serious problem in efforts to improve education.7 </P>
<P> Suppose, however, that management had no direct responsibility for hiring employees.  would it not be in a better position to evaluate their performance objectively?  Not having any stake in their employment, management would probably be more candid in expressing its conclusions about service quality.  Also, since it would need less time for its producer activities (for example, hiring teachers), management would also have more time for its consumer responsibilities, such as evaluating services and educational outcomes.</P>
<P> To some extent, therefore, contracting out would help management minimize the conflict inherent in being both the producer and the consumer of educational services.  Management can focus on evaluating the services rendered under less political pressure to justify the results.  Nor would bias resulting from the employment of individual employees simply be replaced by bias resulting from selection of a contractor. (This could happen if there was sole source bidding and school management was clearly responsible for selecting the sole source).  When bidding is truly open and competitive, management is less likely to have a political stake in a favorable evaluation of the services received.</P>
<P> Furthermore, there is an important difference in the two situations.  In conventional operations, management must evaluate each individual employee.  Under contracting out, however, management can focus on service outcomes; evaluation of employees is likely to be the contractor's responsibility.  Granted, in some cases it may be difficult, even impossible, to evaluate a service without some attention to the performance of individuals.  Nevertheless, despite some overlap, the focal points are different.  Education is excessively oriented to evaluation of inputs and simultaneous neglect of outcomes.  Contracting out could help redress this imbalance.</P>
<P> Whether contracting out saves management time, and how much time, obviously depends on several factors.  Nevertheless, contracting out clearly has the potential to save a great deal of management time.  Because they are public agencies, school officials are required to approve many items of little or no practical significance.  For example, to avoid approving purchases that have not been considered, school managemtn has to devote many hours to plowing through minutiae of no importance whatsoever to the educational program.  Contracting out could help to minimize some of these problems.  If the competitive process provides assurance that the overall cost is reasonable, there is no reason why management needs to be involved in the details of providing the service.</P>
<P> In a 1982 survey board members indicated that they spent about forty-five hours a month on board business.  Asked how they would like to devote more time, 19 percent said curriculum-related matters, 12 percent said policy matters, and 9 percent said visiting schools.  When asked how they could save time, 13 percent -- the highest of any time-saving option -- preferred reducing the number of board meetings.8   None of the other options even questioned whether boards could make better use of their time by contracting out some of the services they manage to the private sector.</P>
<P> In considering these possibilities, it must be emphasized that contracting out is not an abdication of management responsibilities.  Instead, it is another way of fulfilling them.  Furthermore, contracting out does not imply that the public agency can safely ignore what happens after a contract is signed; as will be discussed shortly, contract management, including an adequate reporting system, should be considered an integral part of the process,</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Allocation and Distribution of Instructional Time</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The prospects for contracting out instruction may depend on school district willingness to restructure the allocation and distribution of instructional time.  While there is good reason for such restructuring in any case, contracting out could stimulate and benefit from it.</P>
<P> To illustrate, districts short of mathematics and science teachers might contract with companies instead of individuals for instruction in these areas.  With a contract to provide services, the companies would be able to recruit teachers and tutors from a variety of sources:  retired college and public school teachers, college students, individuals in the private sector, and so on.  Changes in the allotment and distribution of instructional time might enable or greatly facilitate the use of these resources.  Instead of providing mathematics instruction an hour a day, five days a week, arrangements might be made to provide two to three hours twice a week.  Such arrangements would enable contractors to provide instructional service to several districts in the same area.</P>
<P> To appreciate the potential of such arrangements, it must be recognized that individual school districts frequently lack the scale to utilize certain specialist effectively.  It is prohibitively expensive for a district to employ teachers for only ten students who want to study any particular subject.  There are two choices:  not to offer the subject at all or to have it taught by nonspecialists.  Districts willing to restructure instructional time to take advantage of economies of scale could avoid this dilemma.</P>
<P> There is ample educational reason to do this.  The existing allocation and distribution of instructional time, especially in secondary schools, are not based on any educational reason or rationale.  This is evident from comparing the ways instructional time is allocated in colleges and high schools.  In typical high schools, students attend five classes every day for almost an hour a day.  In college, total classroom instruction is usually reduced to fifteen to eighteen hours a week, in subjects that are taught only two to three times a week.  Obviously, the students do not change that much from high school in the spring to college in the fall; if they do not have to attend class for the same subject five days a week in college, they probably do not need to do so during their high school days.  In any case, the more flexibility school districts show in scheduling instruction, the better their chances of finding individuals and companies willing to provide it.</P>

<P> Regardless of the services involved, the possibilities for contracting out will vary widely from district to district and region to region.  Even so, school districts can investigate the possibilities at a relatively low cost.  To see how, it is necessary to understand the differences between an invitation for bid (IFB) and a request for proposal (RFP).  With an IFB, the service sought and the conditions of delivery are specified, and contractors compete largely on the basis of price.  An RFP allows more flexibility and requires negotiation between the district and contractor before an agreement is reached.  When a district is getting into a new area, and it is not clear how services can be provided most efficiently, RFPs are preferable.  Table 4.1 summarizes the differences between IFBs and RFPs.</P>
<P> Assume there is a shortage of calculus teachers.  Districts could jointly request proposals from potential contractors.  The RFP should include essential data, such as the number of students who would study calculus, their location, and the beginning and ending dates of instruction.  Contractors might be asked to submit proposals that require the students to assemble at a given location and/or proposals that envisage instructors going out to the participating districts.  Instead of district personnel drawing up plans, potential contractors can suggest ways and means of delivering the services efficiently.</P>
<P> John Tepper Marlin has provided a useful comparison of IFBs and RFPs.  Most school boards are somewhat familiar with the two procedures because they have already had to contract for products and services.  Nevertheless, boards may lack the experience needed to decide which approach to use for instructional services.  Although IFBs may be useful in certain situations, RFPs will probably be utilized more in contracting for instructional services.  Until contracting out instruction becomes more widespread, it is especially important to foster a wide variety of approaches to the practice.</P>

<P>not self-executing.  Management must designate officials who understand the contracts, monitor employee and union adherence to them, confer regularly with union representatives, and maintain adequate records to protect management's interests in case of a dispute and in order to propose appropriate changes in successor contracts.</P>
<P> Contract management is also essential when services are contracted out.  Designated management officials must monitor contractor performance, note complaints and problems, maintain liaison with contractors, and apply what is learned to negotiations on successor contracts.  The time and resources required to do these things should be considered a cost that must be offset by savings resulting from contracting out.  Experience with other municipal services indicates that the costs of contract management will run about 5 to 10 percent of the amount of the contract; obviously, what would be an acceptable cost will vary from contract to contract.</P>
<P> It is not feasible to explore the gamut of contract management issues here.  Fortunately, there are several useful publications on the subject, including at least one comprehensive &quot;how-to-do-it&quot; manual that is an invaluable resource.0   The following discussion, therefore, is intended only to illustrate how various concerns about contracting out can be resolved in the contract itself.</P>
<H3><A ID="I11" NAME="I11">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Complaint Procedures</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> An issue that must be resolved under contracting out is whether the contractor or the school district will handle complaints.  This issue does not arise when a management support service, such as data processing, is involved, but it can be very important when the services directly affect students, parents, or others in the community.  If complaints are made to the district, there is a danger of interposing a level of administration between the contractor and the public.  If made to the contractor, there is a danger that the responsible public officials may not be fully aware of problems associated with contractor performance.</P>
<P> A partial solution is to encourage citizens to express their concerns in whatever way is most convenient for them, but to require that the district be notified of all complaints and their resolution in timely fashion.  As in the labor relations field, complaints should be reviewed carefully for significant patterns and for negotiating needed changes in the contract.  Furthermore, contract monitoring should include some calls or visits to ensure that the contractor followed up on complaints promptly.  Legislative bodies such as school boards play an important role as ombudsmen; contracting out should be handled in a way that does not impair this role.  This does not mean, however, that districts can or should simply wait for complaints to be made.  Districts can conduct surveys or interviews to ascertain how various parties feel about the services the contractor provides.</P>
<P> As previously noted, one of the objections to contracting out is that it renders public agencies vulnerable to undue pressure from contractors.  For example, a municipality might have sold all of its street-cleaning vehicles after contracting out this service.  Subsequently, when the city must resume direct service because of contractor failures, the city would be in an untenable position.  It could not rush out and purchase a new fleet of vehicles and employ a new staff to use them.  Yet the alternative might be to accept undesirable deficiencies or changes by the contractor in midstream, as it were.</P>
<P> Again, the point is not to deny the danger of such an eventuality.  Rather it is to emphasize that the danger can be avoided by the way the contract for service is drafted.  The contract may provide that the capital equipment be owned by the district or left in place for a certain time after termination.  Or it may specify liquidated damages in case of default, with the amounts covering district costs for restoring adequate service.  In other cases, the contractor will be using district employees who remain on the district payroll.  Again, in drafting the contract, the district should always raise the question of what happens if contract termination becomes necessary.  The OEO contracts did not cover termination procedures adequately, and the termination costs were the subject of extensive litigation.  Good drafting would have avoided at the outset this litigation.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Low Bid Versus Best Bid</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> State legislation regulates most elements of contracts for services resulting from competitive bidding.  As a result, school districts in some states are required to accept the lowest or &quot;lowest responsible&quot; bid, even though another bid may be preferable when quality of service and/or contractor history are taken into account.  Sometimes statutory  language is ambiguous and sometimes it is silent on the issue, but the way the issue is resolved has important implications for contracting out.</P>
<P> If a school district must accept the lowest bid, there is an obvious danger that other important criteria will be neglected.  Of course, bids are bids to provide something, and the &quot;something&quot; is supposed to be spelled out in the IFB.  On the other hand, since it is virtually impossible to specify all the criteria that should be considered, IFBs may omit some that would change the outcome.  Indeed, we can cite this as another example of the greater efficiency of the private sector.  Private companies are not as restricted as are public agencies in purchasing services; private companies are free to contract for the optimum arrangement, without being restricted arbitrarily by &quot;the lowest price.&quot;</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Contracting Out and the Improvement of Public Education</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The educational reform reports pay no attention to contracting out as a means of improving education.  Furthermore, the omission is not explained.  It might be due to deliberate rejection of its potential to improve education.  More likely it is due to failure to consider the issue, a failure that might be explained in many ways.  Whatever the explanation, what is the future of contracting out in public education?</P>
<P> In my opinion, this question cannot be answered with a high degree of confidence.  There are approximately 15,000 school districts in the United States.  They differ in size, resources, leadership, regulatory environment, student enrollment, socioeconomic breakdown, political structure, and just about every other dimension that comes to mind.  At the same time, a wide variety of developments in the private sector, in other public services, and in the media could conceivably affect interest in and resort to contracting out in education.  Under the circumstances, it seems futile to try to quantify the future of contracting out in education.</P>
<P> Three basic considerations, however, suggest a much greater resort to educational contracting out in the next decade.  One is that the educational reform movement is not achieving any basic improvements in public education.  As this conclusion becomes more widely expressed and accepted, interest in other approaches is likely to grow.</P>
<P> The second critical point is that other efforts to privatize education will continue to encounter massive resistance from all of the major interest groups associated with public education.  The National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the American Federation of State Count and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the National School Boards Association (NSBA), the American Association of School Administrators (AASA), the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) -- all are opposed to education vouchers and tuition tax credits.  Their opposition, even in conjunction with other organizations opposed to family choice, may not always be successful; the enactment of tuition tax credits in Iowa in 1987 demonstrates that the public education lobby is not always all-powerful.  Nevertheless, policies that are supported -- or at least not opposed -- by important elements of the public education lobby are more likely to materialize than policies that face its united and adamant opposition.  As we have seen, school boards and school administrators have good reason to support contracting out as a management option.  Union opposition will certainly be a factor, but assuming that such opposition is insuperable is as unrealistic as ignoring it completely.</P>
<P> The basic advantage of contracting out is the fact that it does not require basic changes in the governance structure or the statutory framework of public education.  To be sure, certain statutory changes would be very helpful, especially in states in which the statutory framework is not as conducive to the practice as it should be.  Nevertheless, contracting out has enormous advantages over other forms of privatization, such as vouchers or tuition tax credits, which require new and highly controversial legislation.</P>
<P> If a reform requires a state law, it will be slower in coming than if school districts can implement it on their own.  This is the case with contracting out.  Its outcomes may be uncertain, but at least we may be able to find out what they are within a reasonable time.</P>
<P> In the not so long run, public school management may come to view contracting out instruction as a necessity instead of as an option.  Those who favor increased public support for education are caught in a dilemma.  Clearly, there has been a significant erosion of confidence in public institutions, including public schools, in recent years.  This is the major reason why efforts to achieve more financial support for public schools are increasingly tied to &quot;reforms&quot; of one sort or another.  As resistance grows to paying more for the same old services, educators show a corresponding tendency to treat cosmetic changes as basic reforms.  Nevertheless, claims that public education is undergoing significant reform are becoming increasingly suspect, and public education may be closer to the brink than is commonly realized.1 </P>
<P> What the public education establishment fears most are vouchers and tuition tax credits -- that is, efforts to strengthen private schools.  Contracting out instruction may constitute the only serious alternative to a quantum shift in this direction.  As a matter of fact, Bendick makes precisely this argument with respect to spending for social welfare services.  The American people appear to be willing to spend more for such services, but not through government delivery of them; the same argument may be applicable to education.  Public school leaders may, therefore, be forced to reconsider their opposition or indifference to contracting out as a vehicle for educational improvement.</P>
<P> Even where contracting out instruction is legally possible, various restrictions on the practice may severely limit its implementation.  The following suggestions are intended to eliminate or ease some of the most harmful restrictions.</P>
<P>1. Long-term contracts should be available, especially when contractors build educational facilities or would have to undergo heavy start-up costs.</P>
<P>2. Contracting out should not be a mandatory subject of bargaining.  In negotiations at the local level, districts should seek a union waiver on the right to bargain on contracting out before any particular effort to contract out materializes.  When it does, the district should have a plan to deal fairly with employees adversely affected.</P>
<P>3. Districts should be free to accept  the best,  not necessarily the lowest, competitive bid.</P>
<P>4. Districts should be allowed to dismiss employees on payment of a lump sum, based on their anticipated salary, years of service, and pension status.  The lump sum payments should come from savings generated by contracting out.</P>
<P>5. National and/or regional centers should be established as centers of research, training, and assistance to states and local districts interested in contracting out.</P>
<P>6. School finance should be restructured so that it shows the actual costs of public education and the various components thereof.</P>
<P> While such suggestions do not cover all the important actions necessary to facilitate contracting out, they would be a major step in the right direction.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>5 Educational Choice as a Means to Educational Improvement</B></FONT></A></H2>
<P><B>I</B>n recent years the real or alleged deficiencies  of public education have stimulated proposals that would enable parents to choose the school their children will attend.  One type of proposal is educational tax credits, more commonly refereed to as tuition tax credits.  Such proposals call for income tax credits or tax deductions for the expenses of sending children to school.  Another type of proposal is for government to provide parents with educational vouchers, redeemable for tuition and perhaps other expenses at a school chosen by the parents.  Collectively, tuition tax credits and vouchers are widely known as family choice proposals.  Their underlying assumption is that the best way to strengthen parental choice of schools is to strengthen parental ability to pay for education, whether in a public or a private school. </P>
<P> Why should public policy seek to achieve this objective?  We can identify at least five major arguments for doing so.  I refer to them as the religious rationale, the educational improvement rationale, the civil rights rationale, the taxpayer rationale, and the political rationale.  Theoretically, each rationale is or can be independent of the others.  That is acceptance of any one does not imply or require acceptance of any of the others; likewise, rejection of any does not necessarily imply or require rejection of the others.  Each rationale can be implemented in some ways that are consistent with the other rationales and in other ways that are not. </P>
<P> The following analysis attempts to explain these important points through an analysis of voucher proposals.  One reason is that tuition tax credits and vouchers are based on essentially the same arguments.  If an argument is valid for either tax credits or vouchers, it applies (or can be made to apply) to the other.  Because each form of family choice can be modified to meet specific objections, the fundamental issue is whether the underlying rationale for either has merit.  The focus on vouchers is also based on the fact that the most widely discussed family choice proposals, such as those made by noted economist Milton Friedman, favor vouchers over tuition tax credits.</P>
<P> Some analysts believe that voucher plans are likely to be administered by state education departments whereas tuition tax credits are more likely to be administered by state or federal agencies responsible for tax matters.  For this reason they contend that tuition tax credits will require less government regulation of private schools than educational voucher plans.  The issue is a debatable one but does not fundamentally affect the following analysis; in my opinion, the latter is as applicable to tuition tax credits as it is to vouchers.</P>
<P> The rest of this chapter and chapter 6 are devoted to the broad issue of vouchers and their potential for educational improvement.  Chapter 7 surveys the noneducational arguments for vouchers.  Chapter 8 then summarizes my view of the substantive issues and the political prospects for them.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Educational Improvement Rationale for Family Choice</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The educational improvement rationale for educational vouchers asserts that vouchers are the way to improve education, public and private.  This rationale is a relatively recent development.  Most analysts agree that publications by Milton Friedman in 1956 and 1962 provided the intellectual basis for it.  For this reason, a brief summary of his argument may be a helpful introduction to the issues.</P>
<P> Friedman's argument for educational vouchers was set forth in a chapter of his book <I>Capitalism and Freedom</I>.   His major argument is that a free enterprise economic system is essential to a democratic political system.  As part of this general argument, Friedman contends that, insofar as practical, we should avoid providing goods and services through our political system.  Instead he urges that services be provided through our economic system whenever it is feasible.</P>
<P> Turning to education, Friedman first considers whether government should fund it all.  He concludes that it should fund elementary and probably most of secondary education because of its &quot;neighborhood effects.&quot;  Some economists refer to such effects as &quot;positive externalities&quot; or &quot;public goods.&quot;   These are effects that cannot be provided to <I>A </I>without simultaneously providing a benefit to<I> B.  </I>An example is national defense; it is impossible to protect <I>A</I> from invasion without also protecting <I>B</I> from it.</P>
<P> Although <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> both benefit from national defense, neither can be expected to purchase it individually.  First, neither could afford it.  Second, inasmuch as each benefits if national defense is paid for by others, each has an incentive to be a &quot;free rider.&quot;  For this reason, we rely on taxes raised through our political system to finance national defense.  Similar reasoning led Friedman to accept government support for education albeit up to somewhat lower grade levels than is the practice today.</P>
<P> The view, however, that government should pay for a service does not lead automatically to the conclusion that government should <I>provide</I> the service.  Government funds medical services through Medicare, but the services are provided mainly by physicians in private practice, not by those who are government employees.  The government funds food for the indigent, but the food is made available through the use of food stamps at for-profit supermarkets.  The government does not normally operate the grocery stores that redeem food stamps.</P>
<P> Analogously, Friedman outlines several reasons for educational vouchers.  First, he regards public education as a huge, unresponsive bureaucracy.  He views its lack or responsiveness as the inevitable outcome of its freedom from competition.  To Friedman, most dissatisfied parents have only two options.  They can enroll their children in private schools, in which case they have to bear the costs in addition to paying taxes to support public schools.  Or they can resort to political action, an option Friedman regards as ineffective.</P>
<P> At this point, Friedman contrasts the delivery of educational services to the delivery of services in a market system.  In the latter, dissatisfied customers can normally change service providers; for example, if you don't like your attorney, you can change to another.  This consumer option forces attorneys to be more responsive to consumers' needs and preferences.  Furthermore, in a market system, service providers are constantly under competitive pressures to improve their services.  Such pressures do not exist in public education because it operates like a monopoly, although there is a small private sector.  To end this monopoly, and to bring the benefits of a market system to education, Friedman proposes that government provide parents with educational vouchers that could be redeemed for cash by whatever school enrolled the children.  Although he specifically proposes to make for-profit schools eligible to receive vouchers, Friedman does not elaborate on this issue.  He suggests that the amount of the voucher be equivalent to the cost of education pupils in the public schools and that parents should be free to add to the voucher if they so desired.  Although he does not favor stricter government regulation of private schools, Friedman points out that such regulation is always an option if necessary to protect pupils and parents under a voucher system.</P>
<P> In discussing why the voucher idea did not emerge earlier, Friedman suggest two reasons.  One is that the technology needed to implement a voucher system was not available in earlier periods.  We did not have large-scale government transfer payments to individuals until well into the twentieth century.  In his view, new technology, such as computers, created policy opportunities that were not feasible in an earlier era.  Also, voucher plans did not emerge earlier because the American People were much more adverse to government assistance in earlier generations.  Such assistance was widely perceived as a handout; those accepting it suffered somewhat in public esteem.</P>
<P> In a later publication, Friedman explicitly rejected the idea that education should be compulsory and government financed.   Recognizing the absence of public support for this view, he devoted most of his analysis to refuting criticisms of his voucher proposals.  In his view, the way to get better education at a lower cost is to make it available through a market system.</P>
<P> Writing about vouchers in 1979, Friedman raised this question:  &quot;What reason is there to suppose that alternatives will really arise?&quot;  His answer lies at the heart of our discussion:</P>
<P>The reason is that a market would develop where it does not exist today.  Cities, states, and the federal government today spend close to $100 billion a year on elementary and secondary schools.  That sum is a third larger than the total amount spent annually in restaurants and bars for food and liquor.  The smaller sum surely provides an ample variety of restaurants and bars for people in every class and place.  The larger sum, or even a fraction of it, would provide an ample variety of schools. . . .</P>
<P> Many of the new schools would be established by nonprofit groups.  Others would be established for profit.  there is no way of predicting the ultimate composition of the school industry.  That would be determined by competition.  The one prediction that can be made is that only those schools that satisfy their customers will survive -- just as only those restaurants and bars that satisfy their customers survive.  Competition would see to that. </P>
<P> Essentially, Friedman's argument is based on two assumptions.  One is that a voucher plan would result in competition between schools for students.  The other is that such competition would have positive effects on educational achievement.  Our first task is to assess the validity of these assumptions.  Such assessment must recognize that &quot;competition&quot; is a matter of degree, not a simple dichotomous alternative to &quot;no competition.&quot;  Economists have spelled out the conditions of competition, but there are few, if any, situations in which all the conditions exist without limitation or qualification; &quot;pure competition&quot; is the exception, not the rule, even in industries where competition has proved effective.  Consequently, we will focus on the conditions required in order for competition to be effective.  Then these conditions will be related to the situation likely to prevail in education under a voucher plan.  The objective is to assess whether such a plan will result in the kind of competition envisaged by voucher supporters.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Expansion of Supply and the Mobility of Resources</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> For competition to exist, it must be easy to expand supply in response to increased demand.  Otherwise, increases in demand will be frustrated by supply shortages.  Assuming that vouchers increase the demand for education in private schools, how will such schools expand promptly to meet the increased demand?</P>
<P> Regarding physical facilities, increases in the supply of private education could occur in two ways.  One is by using any underutilized capacity; the other is by adding to capacity by building new schools.</P>
<P> There do not appear to be any systematic data on the capacity of existing private schools to absorb additional students.  The following factors would limit this capacity.</P>
<P>1. Some private schools are already operating at capacity and have waiting lists.  Furthermore, these are likely to be the most desirable private schools.  Such schools have shown little or no interest in expansion for decades at least. </P>
<P>2. Most private schools are denominational and may not wish to enroll pupils outside of their own denomination.  This is especially likely for those schools, such as Amish or Hebrew ones, that do not proselytize outside of their own faith.  Often even Catholic schools accept non-Catholics only out of economic necessity.  In brief, religious schools may not be willing to utilize excess capacity by enrolling students with a different religious orientation.</P>
<P>3. Undoubtedly, many private schools have some flexibility regarding enrollments -- they may be able to increase class size to some degree.  On the other hand, as they do so, they increase the risk of alienating their current clients.  Fist, the latter may have been attracted by the small class size, or at least be willing to  accept it, whereas they might withdraw if class size is increased.  Furthermore, as enrollments increase, so does the likelihood of enrolling disruptive or difficult pupils who will detract from the educational attractiveness of the school.</P>
<P>4. As students are added to private school classes, the schools become less attractive to teachers.  Private schools  currently rely heavily on their ability to employ teachers willing to work for substantially lower salaries than public school teachers receive.  Superior nonsalary conditions of employment are an important compensating factor in many cases.  Increased enrollments weaken this tradeoff, so some private schools may opt for higher fees instead of increased enrollments under a voucher plan.</P>
<P> Thus the ability of private schools to increase enrollments with their existing facilities is highly problematic.  What are the prospects for the construction of new private schools?</P>
<P> At best, they are not very promising.  Schools construction is expensive.  This is why most private schools are established by religious organizations.  These organizations provide a great deal of the required financial support for new school construction.  Raising the funds required for freestanding private schools is much more difficult.</P>
<P> Denominational schools are likely to gear capacity to their denominational needs, not to more general demands for better education.  In any event, the construction of new nonprofit schools would face some formidable problems.  First, funds for construction and possibly land acquisition have to be raised.  Nonprofit schools have three sources:  donations, retained earnings, or loans.  All pose difficult problems of one kind or another.</P>
<P> Potential donors may exist, but the task of identifying and persuading them takes time.  Significantly, donations have dwindled as a source of revenue for nonprofit hospitals; in fact, the later rely overwhelmingly on retained earnings for revenue.  Donations to religious organizations may also decline precipitously for a variety of reasons; significantly, a recent study documents a substantial long-term decline in donations to the Catholic church.  From 1960 to 1984, contributions to Catholic churches declined from about 2.2 to 1.1 percent of parishioners' income.  Although average Catholic income exceeded average Protestant income, the typical American Catholic church contribution was only $320 compared to $580 for the typical Protestant.  Furthermore, the decline in Catholic contributions was greater among the better educated, the more devout, and the more liberal Catholics.  The decline is due at least in part to opposition among Catholics to church positions on abortion and premarital sex, but the implications are much broader.   As circumstances and social attitudes change, any denomination runs a risk that its doctrines will generate opposition from church members.  Such potential opposition adds an element of uncertainty to religious organizations' ability to raise funds for capital construction.</P>
<P> Retained earnings are the excess of revenues over expenses; they would be &quot;the profits&quot; in for-profit enterprise.  Efforts to raise funds for capital construction from retained earnings require several years.  While increasing the spread between costs and fees might reduce the time required, such increases might also reduce enrollments.  They would certainly be contrary to the goal of increasing choice.</P>
<P> The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) study provides some data on the issue.  The study received financial data from 763 active member schools, 91.6 percent of all active membership schools.  Because the coeducational day schools enrolling both elementary and secondary schools are the subgroup most similar to public schools, let me cite the 1984-85 data relating to such schools.</P>

<P>SOURCE:  National Association of Independent Schools, NAIS Statistics, Spring, 1986, p. 7.</P>
<P> The results for 1983 - 84 were very similar.  Thus overall, about 22 percent of the schools in this group showed fairly sizable net income; a much smaller number showed a net loss.  Clearly, however, the data do not give much cause for optimism.  The NAIS schools tend to be small and much more expensive than most private schools, especially the large number of denominational schools.  If only 22 percent of the most affluent private schools show net earnings of 5 percent or more, there is little reason to believe that the vast majority of private schools can utilize net earnings to expand capacity.</P>
<P> A recent study by NAIS raises the possibility that the main beneficiaries of vouchers would be private school teachers, not potential students.  The study showed that the average teacher salary in NAIS schools in 1986-87 was $21,043, compared to $25,313 for public school teachers.  The comparisons did not include all forms of teacher compensation, such as retirement benefits; had they done so, the compensation gap between public school and NAIS teachers would have been even larger.  We should also note that teacher compensation in NAIS schools was substantially higher than in private schools generally.  Even so, over 86 percent of the headmasters and trustees in the NAIS survey said they would raise teacher salaries if they &quot;suddenly&quot; had more money.   If vouchers are enacted, private school teachers are certain to insist on higher salaries, especially if their school raises fees and/or enrolls more students.  For this reason alone, it is unrealistic to estimate transfers on the basis of prevoucher tuition and fees.</P>
<P> Efforts to finance school construction from retained earnings would have to overcome several other practical and ethical problems.  Religious leaders might find to difficult to justify higher fees for current constituents in order to enroll later ones.  Church members also might not be pleased by the prospect.  Furthermore, the competitive position of religious schools could suffer if their fees covered future construction (as distinguished from depreciation).  There would also be significant managerial problems.  Not everyone is capable of managing the location, planning, financing, and construction of new schools.  Note also that nonprofit schools would face difficulty negotiating loans for new construction.  An empty school is not strong collateral.  Location and zoning might inhibit other uses.  Lending institutions would naturally demand a higher return than on a conventional loan for construction.  Actually, because nonprofit organizations cannot use equity financing, they usually experience greater difficulty than for-profit firms in borrowing for construction; if these difficulties are compounded by reliance on a risky revenue stream, nonprofit schools are likely to pay interest rates above market rates.  If money is lent to construct an office building and the borrower defaults, the lender presumably has adequate collateral.  If school buildings are not readily converted to profitable use, the interest rate on the loan has to be higher to cover the additional risk.0 </P>
<P> The religious organizations that operate private schools typically support other service activities:  hospitals, senior citizen programs, feeding the indigent, and so on.  Consequently, decisions about the amount of resources to be devoted to education must take account of these other needs.  Suppose that a religious organization is operating an educational program at the break-even point.  A voucher plan might enable the organization to raise tuition and expand the educational program.  The increase in tuition might also enable the organization to devote more resources to subsidize some of its other activities.  In some cases, this latter course of action will be chosen, at least to some degree.  Here the impact of the voucher plan primarily would be increased assistance for other denominational activities.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Vouchers and the Number of Educational Suppliers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> It can hardly come as a surprise to voucher proponents that the number of suppliers is a critical factor; after all, the educational improvement argument rests squarely on the idea that the existence of only one supplier, or one overwhelmingly dominant supplier, is the basic cause of educational deterioration.</P>
<P> Effective competition requires a large number of suppliers who do not collude with each other in the market and who are free to act as opportunities for expansion arise.  The number must be large enough so that no combination of suppliers can affect the price of the service.  Again, there are strong reasons to doubt whether these conditions would prevail widely under voucher plans.</P>
<P> All observers agree that vouchers are unlikely to facilitate choice in sparsely populated area.  Below a certain population base, per-pupil costs become prohibitive.  As population density increases, the number of competing schools may increase also.  Obviously, transportation, terrain, and weather will affect the competitive range of most schools.  Nevertheless, given just the difficulties mentioned so far (more are forthcoming!), parents are not likely to find several new schools competing for students.</P>
<P> In my own research in recent years, I have encountered companies that had to abandon plans to operate for-profit schools because the cost of establishing new schools was prohibitive.  Even purchase of existing schools was not feasible for the same reason.  Granted, these decisions not to go into the school business were made in the absence of a voucher plan, but they point to a major obstacle to competition.  Note also that as population density increases, so will the operating as well as the construction costs of new schools.  Teacher in urban areas must be paid more than teachers in rural area.  Insurance, food, maintenance, and other costs will vary roughly with population density.</P>
<P> Effective competition also requires that buyers and sellers be free to act in response to market conditions; for example, sellers must be free to expand supply promptly in order to meet increased demand.  This brings us to the role of state regulation of private schools.  The extent of state requirements relating to private school construction is not clear, but both state and local requirements and codes could be major obstacles.  Extensive building programs are not likely until legislation is enacted.  Legal challenges could delay every aspect of school construction for years. </P>
<P> Where state approval is mandatory, extensive delays before construction can begin are a possibility, especially if the state department officials are not sympathetic to private schools.  Note also that state approval is often required for other aspects of private school operations -- teachers may have to be certified, school buses must meet state standards, and so on.</P>
<P>  Needless to say, strong efforts will be made to tie increased state regulation to any voucher legislation.  For this reason, existing regulation is more likely to be favorable to vouchers than postvoucher regulation.  If increased regulation of private schools is the political price that must be paid to enact vouchers, some groups that would otherwise support voucher legislation may turn against it.  If the legislation is enacted, they may refuse to enroll any voucher students.  Voucher opponents will publicize incidents of private school abuse or deficiencies to terminate vouchers or intensify state regulation of private schools.  As the possibility of increased regulation already deters some private school leaders from supporting vouchers, state regulation must be seen as a deterrent even where it has not been enacted into law.</P>
<P> In addition to problems emanating from state regulation, local zoning ordinances may also present difficult obstacles to overcome.  Such obstacles may or may not be due to opposition to vouchers per se.  Significantly, local school boards that have voted to close certain schools and lease the buildings have sometimes refused to lease them to private schools.  Although such leases do happen, discontinued public schools are not likely to be widely available for expansion of private schools.</P>
<P> Considered in toto, the delays just discussed will undoubtedly deter some transfers in private schools.  The evidence from other fields, such as automobiles, indicates that some consumers who have to wait for their preferred choice simply abandon this choice rather than wait.1   This situation might happen more often in education than in the purchase of consumer durables.  Car buyers waiting for an imported car do not lose a great deal by waiting.  In contrast, parents who want to enroll their child in a first grade that has no openings may not be willing to countenance a delay.  By the time an opening is available, the parents may be unable to change arrangements made or to complete the arrangements (such as transportation) that have to be made.  The parents may have changed their views about the public school or believe that a transfer during the school year would not be in their child's best interests.  Finding a convenient car pool during the school year, or in the following year, might not be as easy as it would have been initially.  In short, delays in enrollment will probably lead to some losses that would not be made up by replacements.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Competition:  Service Dimensions</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Competition is most effective when it involves a standardized product or service.  The educational implications of this point are so important that it is necessary to elaborate on it briefly.</P>
<P> Consider a consumer who wants to buy a car.  The easiest situation to resolve is when two or more dealers offer the same car, equipment, and warranties, but at different prices.  Outside of distance factors and dealer reputations for fulfilling warranty obligations, the decision as to which car to buy is easily resolved -- the consumer buys the least expensive car.</P>
<P> Suppose, however, the consumer is considering two or more cars that differ in size, comfort, price, warranties, convenience of repair, mileage, and just about every other criterion.  In this situation, there may still be some &quot;competition,&quot; but it is highly attenuated and may not even be a factor in the final decision.  Because of a disability, the consumer may decide to buy  the car that is easiest to enter and operate, regardless of all other factors.  True, we could say there was &quot;competition&quot; with respect to ease of entry and operation, but the decision to buy would not be based on any comprehensive assessment of value to most car buyers.</P>
<P> Let us now visualize how the principles involved would work in education.  Suppose <I>A</I> is a public school and <I>B</I> is a denominational school with the same program, facilities, quality of teaching staff, and so on.  Let us say the only two differences in the schools are that <I>B</I> provides religious instruction and that <I>A</I> does a slightly better job of teaching science.</P>
<P> Now let us suppose that parents with full knowledge of these differences use the voucher to send their children to <I>B</I>.  this would be a perfectly plausible outcome.  Could we say there was &quot;competition&quot; in this case?  To do so would certainly create a dilemma for proponents of the educational rationale.  The educational improvement rationale does not assert that public schools can or should compete with denominational schools in indoctrinating religious beliefs.  Thus there is a question as to whether competition really existed in this situation.  If it did, the school that performed second best on secular education criteria won.  This would be contrary to the educational improvement rationale for vouchers.</P>
<P> To avoid any confusion here, let me elaborate.  Essentially, it is important to distinguish between the different arguments for vouchers.  If you accept the religious or the political rationale, then transfers out of public schools for religious reasons are not a problem, regardless of the secular educational consequences.  If, however, you support vouchers as a means of improving education on nondenominational criteria, transfers for religious reasons -- at least those that result in lower educational achievement -- are at least a potentially serious problem.</P>
<P> The basic problem here is that vouchers run a risk that services provided directly by government do not -- vouchers may be used for purposes not envisaged or even antithetical to the objectives of the voucher plan.  For instance, providing housing vouchers instead of public housing has generally been successful in terms of cost, efficiency, and housing quality.  At the same time, it has not generally resulted in increased expenditures for housing; in fact, less than 20 percent of the increased purchasing poser made available by housing vouchers actually is spent for housing.  Most of the additional purchasing power goes for food, clothing, medical and dental care, and so on.2   Similar examples can be cited from other types of voucher plans.  In short, if the policy is to give the consumers control, it is more difficult to impose taxpayer preferences that the money be spent for a specific purpose, such as educational improvement on secular criteria.  The important question is the extent to which parental decisions would weaken the educational improvement rationale.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine why parents enroll their children in private schools; frequently the motives are mixed, and even the parents may be hard pressed to assess their influence.  In any case, if transfers to private schools are based on private benefits, such transfers will not necessarily be a means to educational improvement.  Furthermore, religious motivations will not be the only basis for transfers that are irrelevant to, or even inconsistent with, the educational improvement rationale.  Suppose a private school is not as good as the public school, but the former offers day-care services after the regular school day.  Because of this service, parents may enroll their child in the private school; this could be a rational course of action, even though it is contrary to the educational improvement rationale.  Again, vouchers would not   necessarily be used as the policymakers had envisaged.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Competition:  Parents as Consumers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Vouchers have sometimes been characterized as the way to restore &quot;consumer sovereignty,&quot; that is, as the way to enable educational consumers instead of producers to control the kind and quality of services.  Our concern here is whether the conditions under which competition is effective would apply to parents as consumers.  Ideally, these conditions include adequate information about the service, knowledge of market condition (what others are paying and charging for the service), convenience in changing to a better service, and minimal costs of getting the necessary information and making the change.  As we shall see, none of these assumptions can be taken for granted.  </P>
<P> Private schools, especially at the secondary level, frequently do not offer certain curricula that may be important to parents who would like to transfer their children from a public school.  For example, private secondary schools often do not offer vocational-technical programs.3   Whether a voucher plan would induce private schools to offer such programs is problematical; the outcome will depend on the specifics of the plan, such as the amount of the voucher.</P>
<P> Educational choice has also been criticized on the grounds that individuals often sacrifice long-range interests for short-range benefits; for example, smokers and gamblers often choose the pleasure of immediate gratification to the detriment of their long-range interest in good health.  Inasmuch as most of the benefits of education are long-range ones, family choice proposals allegedly place the long-range benefits of education at unacceptably high levels of risk.  Indeed, to be realistic, some voucher proposals treat the ideal parents as average ones.  Reading their idealized versions of parents, one would never realize that millions of children are the offspring of parents who were not living together at the time of conception or that millions of fathers contribute nothing to the support of their children.</P>
<P> It is also contended that parents cannot evaluate the quality of educational services until after the services are purchased.  Choosing a school is more like choosing a career than like choosing a necktie.  In the former, some of the most important information about the wisdom of the choice is not available until years after the choice is made.  Although the same problem may arise with respect to products, it can usually be resolved by warranties.  For example, in buying a car, maintenance costs are an aspect of quality but are not know when a car is purchased.  Even so, buyers can factor in the cost of a warranty, so the uncertainty factor is not so critical.  Such protection is thought to be impractical in education because we cannot readily fix responsibility for the outcomes.  The diagnosis of why a car doesn't run usually clarifies whether the seller or buyer should bear responsibility for poor performance; the diagnosis of why a student hasn't learned is more likely to be inconclusive.  For this reason, parents may lack reliable bases for comparison and choice, thus undermining the market rationale for vouchers.  As will be explained in chapter 11, I disagree with this conclusion, but its widespread acceptance is undeniable.</P>
<P> A related argument is that parents may not know or care about the side effects of their individual decision.  For instance, parents may choose private schools on the basis of their exclusivity; the wider social effects of this exclusivity may be undesirable.  Market models do not necessarily take into account such side effects -- they are not based on all the relevant information concerning choice of school.</P>
<P> Public opinion polls reveal some interesting data relevant to &quot;the parents can't choose&quot; objection to vouchers.  As table 5.2 shows, public support for vouchers appears to have increased in recent years; in a 1983 Gallup poll,</P>

<P> In some nations, the government allots a certain amount of money for each child for his education.  The parents can then send the child to any public, parochial, or private school they choose.  This is call the &quot;voucher system.&quot;  Would you like to see such an idea adopted in this country?</P>

<P>51 percent of those polled supported the voucher concept, with 38 percent opposed and 11 percent expressing no preference.  The increase in voucher support suggest that &quot;the parents can't choose wisely&quot; objection is losing ground, since it would not be sensible to support vouchers if the objection were deemed valid.</P>

<P>SOURCE:  <I>Educational Update,</I> vol. 9 (Fall, 1986), p. 7.  It was not possible to determine the separate responses of black and Hispanic teachers, but Gallup poll data suggest that their responses would probably be even more favorable to private schools than the averages.  In any event, the notion that parents can't choose schools wisely is not very popular among the minority of parents who supposedly most need protection from their won choices.  In fact, a 1988 Gallup poll on the issue showed that the &quot;partisan poor&quot; supported vouchers by a 62 to 17 percent margin, the highest ratio of support among any of the major voting groups in either party.4 </P>
<P> Table 5.3 also weakens the argument that parents will sacrifice children's long-range interests for short-range benefits.  When public school teachers send their own children to private schools, are the teachers sacrificing the long-range interests of their own children for short-range benefits?  In view of the moderate economic status of teachers, this is very unlikely.  On the contrary, they are undergoing immediate sacrifices for what they perceive to be long-range interests of their children.</P>
<P> The &quot;parents can't choose wisely&quot; argument is also based on the concept of &quot;transaction costs.&quot;  In this context, they are the costs of acquiring the necessary information about schools.  Schools may have to be visited.  Conferences with school officials, other parents, and students who have attended the schools being considered might be advisable.  Publications by and about the schools, such as fee schedules and conditions of acceptance and expulsion, may have to reviewed carefully.  Even if parental time were the only cost of acquiring the information, it could be a significant deterrent to informal choice.</P>
<P> Yet whether information costs would frequently preclude informed choice is doubtful for several reasons.  First of all, it seems unlikely that there would be a large number of choices, desirable as this might be from the standpoint of competition.  Needless to say, it is much easier to choose between two or three options than among a much larger number.</P>
<P> Furthermore, school choice is likely to be a better informed one than choice of other professional services.  We employ most professional workers for a very limited number of service occasions.  The student who goes to school 180 days a year sees a doctor or dentist only a few times annually.  Perhaps fewer; most children do not break a leg or have teeth extracted frequently.  Thus in these services there is relatively little opportunity for parents or students to know the provider before the services are rendered.  With school and teachers, however, the opportunities are more frequent.  As Burton A. Weisbrod, a leading authority on the nonprofit sector, points out:</P>
<P>The informational advantage of the seller often disappears rapidly after purchase.  This has an important implication for choosing an institutional structure:  the private, for-profit market can work quite satisfactorily -- rewarding producers effectively -- even when sellers have the advantage at first, provided that buyers eventually close the information gap.  Buyers can, under these conditions, reward the desired performance.5 </P>
<P> The notion that parents will not choose schools wisely is also based on the anticipated role of advertising under voucher plans.  Opponents assert that vouchers will lead to false and exaggerated advertising about what schools can do for students.  The harmful consequences would be much greater than result from false advertising for toothpaste or detergents or gasoline.</P>
<P> In assessing this criticism, it is essential to avoid a double standard of judgment.  We must avoid the assumption that parents are adequately informed about the educational performance of their children or the public schools they attend.  For instance, public school leaders often complain about comparisons that overlook the selective nature of private schools.  They are largely silent, however, about the fact that public schools often manipulate test data in order to present school performance in a favorable way.  For example, school districts have raised average test scores by deliberately failing to require low achievers to take the tests.  In some cases where state funds are based on average test scores, the practice has been used to secure additional funds.6   Indeed, it can plausibly be argued that public school officials have misled the public more on this issue than private schools have ever done.  The latter are more the beneficiaries than the makers of public attitudes on the issue.</P>
<P> Test data manipulation is hardly the only case of deceptive practice by public schools.  In one highly publicized case in the 1970s, parents sued a public school district that had promoted their illiterate child for years.7   Although the lawsuit was unique, the situation giving rise to it was not; large urban school districts are about as forthright about their student deficiencies as used car dealers are about &quot;lemons.&quot;</P>
<P> Furthermore, public school districts and organizations sponsor an endless stream of news releases and press conferences.  These efforts to influence public opinion, usually in the context of larger appropriations for public education, are as biased as advertisements.  Whether or not we label these efforts &quot;public relations,&quot; &quot;advertising,&quot; or &quot;lobbying: is not so important.  What is important is the recognition that statements made to generate political and financial support for public schools are not necessarily more accurate than commercial advertising.  Indeed, since commercial advertising is or can be regulated in ways that political statements cannot be, the commercial approach might result in greater public sophistication about educational issues.  I do not assert this would be the case, but I see no reason to rule it out either.</P>
<P> We much also consider the probability that educational advisory services would emerge if choice of school emerges as a widespread practical issue.  Thousands of companies sell advice on investments, plant location, travel, family relationships, legal problems, and so on.  A large number of publications are also devoted to giving advice, including advice on choosing a college.  Such firms and publications do not flourish in education below the college level because there is a limited market for them.  With vouchers, a much larger market would probably emerge.  As a matter of fact, college counseling for high school students is already a small but growing private industry.8   Some private sector counselors are former high school guidance counselors seeking to capitalize on parent dissatisfaction with public school counseling services.</P>
<P> Furthermore, although some parents would choose schools without any investment of time or effort, their actions might have little or no practical effect on school quality.  To appreciate this, consider that many car buyers are indifferent to safety features.  The automobile manufacturers, however, have responded to the demands of the activist minority of car buyers concerned about safety.  As a result, the car buyers indifferent to safety also enjoy the safety features; buyer indifference to safety does not result in manufacturers' neglect of it.  By the same token, the schools are likely to respond to the wishes of activist parents, not the indifferent ones.  For instance, suppose some parents prefer a dress code but others are indifferent.  Schools can cater simultaneously to both groups of parent only by instituting a dress code.  Consequently, even parents indifferent to dress codes may end up enrolling their children in schools that adopt them.  In other words, because the more demanding parents are the most likely to transfer if their demands are not met, schools are more likely to meet these demands.  As a result, the demanding parents will often achieve benefits in school markets for the indifferent ones.9 </P>
<P> At the present time, most advertising in education occurs at the level of higher education.  At various times throughout the year, both public and private institutions place advertisements in newspapers and in radio/television commercials.  One may question why colleges should use taxpayer funds to recruit students, but the practice seems to be well established.  Of course, proprietary schools typically advertise, as do other businesses of one kind or another. </P>
<P> At all levels of education, however, advertising tends to be rather genteel.  Especially below the college level, denominational schools are under some pressure to avoid criticizing public schools.  First, most denominations have members who teach in public schools.  Strong criticism of the latter would raise interdenominational problems.  Second, most nonprofit schools are the junior partners in an uneasy relationship.  Frequently they utilize services provided by public schools:  remedial, transportation, diagnostic, and so on.  Although vouchers would supposedly foster competition, the rhetoric of public/nonprofit school relationships is a rhetoric of partnership, not of competition.  Public school officials are also severely constrained, since any criticism of nonprofit schools, especially denominational ones, would risk severe political retaliation.  Consequently, both public and nonprofit schools are content to treat the private school option largely as a matter of religious preference.  To do otherwise poses high risks for each sector.</P>
<P> Suppose, however, for-profit schools enter the picture.  For the most part, their appeal has to be based on superior educational performance.  &quot;Your children will read better if they attend our school&quot; -- that is the type of claim for-profit schools will have to make, and make good on.  In other words, the competition will have to be on secular educational grounds.  Presumably this is precisely the outcome sought by the educational improvement rationale.  Needless to say, &quot;secular&quot; includes not only academic achievement but student attitudes and conduct as well.</P>
<P> Whatever the merits, the argument that parents can't choose wisely appears to be a loser politically.  Obviously, private schools would object vigorously to any such conclusion; regardless, telling parents that they cannot distinguish good schools from bad ones is not an attractive political position.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Parent Ability to Choose Schools:  A Perspective</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> For the most part, objections to vouchers relating to parental competence to choose are information issues.  In brief, the objections are that vouchers are based upon <I>caveat </I><I>emptor</I>.  The concept may be appropriate for products or services that can be evaluated and compared adequately by sight, but it is not deemed appropriate for services rendered long after they are purchased, that are difficult to identify and evaluate, and that affect third parties who are not directly involved in the transactions.</P>
<P> Realistically, however, we do not avoid <I>caveat emptor</I> issues by having government provide a service.  Instead, the issues simply arise in a different format under different circumstances.  True, educational services cannot be evaluated as easily as most products or services.  Nevertheless, on this issue, voucher critics are characterized by a double standard of judgment and by failure to recognize the informational improvements likely to emerge under parental choice of school.  The double standard is the unstated assumption that parents are well informed about public school performance, or can rely upon school districts to monitor it.  This double standard leads to the assumption that government delivery of services is the solution to the informational problems that parents would face under voucher plans. Knowing whether we have chosen the right job often depends on information not available when the choice is made.  Nevertheless, we do not allow public officials to choose our work because some people choose poorly.</P>
<P> Indisputably, some parents would not choose schools wisely.  Just as indisputably, some government decision makers do not choose wisely either, even when their decisions affect large numbers of people.  The basic issues are what information is needed for this purpose, and who should generate, disseminate, store, and pay for it.  Focus on these issues would be more productive than simplistic arguments over whether or not parents can choose schools wisely.0 </P>
<P> To say the least, antivoucher groups present inconsistent, not to say suspicious, conclusions on information issues.  Parents who can evaluate public schools as voters supposedly cannot evaluate private schools as customers.  Advertising in the economic order is characterized by misinformation and bias, whereas advertising in the political order by education lobbies is not.  And so on.  Realistically, our economic as well as our political system require reliable information to function effectively, but both are often deficient in this regard.  In education, the way to overcome these deficiencies may be to provide market incentives for implementing public policy.  Such incentives may generate the information that is sadly lacking under public provision of educational services.1</P>
<P> Parental inability to choose sometimes may be less of a problem than parental <I>unwillingness </I> to choose the better school.  Such unwillingness may occur among students or parents who do not regard educational achievement as their highest priority.  For example, students, especially at the secondary level, may be reluctant to leave their friends in a public school.  If a student is on the football team or is an elected class officer, or is deeply involved in social affairs, his or her opposition to transfer may outweigh parental hopes for educational improvement; as private schools typically provide fewer extracurricular activities than public schools, this may often happen, especially at the secondary level.</P>
<P> Although real enough, the problems of parents as educational consumers do not seem more formidable than they are in other services where parental choice is taken for granted.  Every parent will not be a fully informed consumer, determined to maximize educational achievement, but overall, parental choice will probably meet the conditions required for effective competition.  Significantly, no individual parent is likely to affect price  of private education; furthermore, turnover among parents and the costs to them (especially the time required) of attempting to act in concert on school costs will preclude parental collusion to restrict competition on the demand side.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Vouchers As The &quot;Exit&quot; Or &quot;Voice&quot; Issue In Education</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The voucher issue is only one dimension of a much broader political and intellectual controversy over whether certain services should be provided through our political or economic system.  The controversy is often characterized as a choice between systems providing &quot;exit&quot; or systems providing &quot;voice.&quot;  Albert O. Hirschman, an internationally renowned economist, who first suggested this terminology in 1970, subsequently stated the distinction as follows:</P>
<P>. . . social actors who experience developing disorder have available to them two activist reactions and perhaps remedies:  exit, or withdrawal from a relationship that one has built up as a buyer of merchandise or as a member of an organization such as a firm, a family, a political party, or a state; and voice, or the attempt at repairing and perhaps improving the relationship through an effort at communicating one's complaints, grievances, and proposals for improvement.  The voice reaction belongs in good part to the political domain, since it has to do with the articulation and channeling of opinion, criticism, and protest.  Much of the exit reaction involves the economic protest.  Much of the exit reaction involves the economic realm, as it is precisely the function of the markets for goods, services, and jobs to offer alternatives to consumers, buyers, and employees who are for various reasons dissatisfied with their current transaction partners.2 </P>
<P> The exit or voice distinction is applicable to a wide range of decisions and situations.  Emigration, divorce, changing political parties or religious affiliations, quitting one's job -- are all examples of exit.  A letter of support (or of opposition) to a government official would be an example of voice, as would be complaining to public authorities about their policies or practices.</P>
<P> Although his publications frequently refer to public education, Hirschman does not categorically oppose vouchers.  Nevertheless, he has expressed several reservations about Friedman's strong support for the exit option in education.  According to Hirschman:</P>
<P>In the first place, Friedman considers withdrawal or exit as the &quot;direct&quot; way of expressing one's unfavorable view of an organization.  A person less well trained in economics might naively suggest that the direct way of expressing views is to express them!  Secondly, the decision to voice one's vies and efforts to make them prevail are contemptuously referred to by Friedman as a resort to &quot;cumbrous political channels.&quot;  But what else is the political, and indeed the democratic, process than the digging, the use and hopefully the slow improvement of these very channels?3 </P>
<P> In education, the issue is whether we could expect schools to be more responsive if a voucher plan was enacted.  Hirschman's comment that the political system is inherently not very expeditious hardly conveys the problems of &quot;voice&quot; in school situations.  Suppose, for example, that your child is being taught by a tenured teacher who appears to be incompetent.  To who do you voice your objection?</P>
<P>1. The principle who may respond by saying she did not want the teacher assigned to her school but her hands were tied?</P>
<P>2. The assistant superintendent for personnel who has not insisted on rigorous teacher evaluation because (a) the principals are afraid of the union's reactions and (b) the chances are against being able to fire a  teacher unless the written evaluations are clear and specific about his or her deficiencies?</P>
<P>3. The superintendent, just hired by the board?</P>
<P>4. The college at which the teacher received her B.A. degree?  Her M.A.?</P>
<P>5. The members of the school board responsible for employing and keeping administrator who did not do their jobs properly?  If so, how do you find out which board members were responsible, and who do you do if they have left the board or are not up for reelection for three years?</P>
<P>6. The state board of education that established low standards of teacher certification?</P>
<P>7. The legislature that enacted the tenure law which renders it extremely difficult to fire incompetent teachers?  Or if the law was enacted twenty years ago, to who in the existing legislature, no member of which has introduced legislation to change the tenure law?</P>
<P>8. The governor, perhaps elected with the strong support of teacher unions?</P>
<P> Not surprisingly, just ascertaining who (if anyone) is responsible for a policy or an action can be a difficult, time-consuming task.</P>
<P> It is sometimes thought that parents should express their concerns at school board meetings.  For the moment, let us put aside such issues as how often board meetings are held, whether they are held at convenient times and places, and whether sandwiching one's concerns into a school board agenda is an effective way to articulate one's concerns.  Since the early 1960s, there has been a massive increase in collective bargaining by teachers.  Recent estimates indicate that about three of every four teachers in the United States are employed pursuant to a contract between a board of education and a teacher union.</P>
<P> In many districts teacher unions have tried to negotiate contract language bearing on parental complaints.  For example, the following contractual article was proposed by scores of teacher unions in New Jersey:</P>
<P>ARTICLE XVI</P>
<P>COMPLAINT PROCEDURE</P>
<P>A.   <I>Procedural Requirement</I></P>
<P>  Any complaints regarding a teacher made to any member of the administration by any parent, student, or other person which does or may influence evaluation of a teacher shall be processed according to the procedure outlined below.</P>
<P>B. <I>Meeting with Principal or Immediate Superior</I></P>
<P>  The principal or immediate superior shall meet with the teacher to apprise the teacher of the full nature of the complaint and they shall attempt to resolve the matter informally.</P>
<P>C. <I>Right to Representation</I></P>
<P>  The teacher shall have the right to be represented by the Association at any meetings or conferences regarding such complaint.</P>
<P>D. <I>Procedure</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I>Step 1.</I></P>
<P>  In the event a complaint is unresolved to the satisfaction of all parties, the teacher may request a conference with the complainant to attempt to resolve the complaint.  If the complaint is unresolved as a result of such conference or if no mutually acceptable conference can be agreed on, the complaint shall move to Step 2.</P>
<P> <I>Step 2.</I></P>
<P>  Any complaint unresolved under Step 1 at the request of the teacher or the complainant shall be reviewed by the building principal or counterpart supervisor in an attempt to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.</P>
<P> <I>Step 3.</I></P>
<P>  Any complaint unresolved at Step 2 may be submitted in writing by the complainant or the teacher to the building principal or counterpart supervisor who shall forthwith forward a copy to the superintendent or his designee and the complainant.</P>
<P> <I>Step 4.</I></P>
<P>  Upon receipt of the written complaint the superintendent or his designee shall confer with all parties.  the teacher shall have the right to be present at all meetings of the superintendent or his designee and the complainant.</P>
<P> <I>Step 5.</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I>If the superintendent or his designee is unable to resolve a complaint to the satisfaction of all parties concerned, at the request of the complainant or the teacher he shall forward the results of his investigation along with his recommendation, in writing, to the Board and a copy to all parties concerned.</P>
<P> <I>Step 6.</I></P>
<P>  After receipt of the findings and recommendations of the superintendent or his designee, and before action thereon, the Board shall afford the parties the opportunity to meet with the Board and show cause why the recommendations of the superintendent or his designee should not be followed.  Copies of the action taken by the Board shall be forwarded to all parties.</P>
<P> <I>Step 7.</I></P>
<P>  Any complaint unresolved under Step 6 may be submitted by the teacher to the grievance procedure as set forth in ARTICLE III of this Agreement and shall commence at Level 3.4 </P>
<P> Before discussing the proposal, let me explain its genesis.  After New Jersey enacted a teacher bargaining law in 1974, the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) disseminated a model contract to its local affiliates.  The clause just quoted was include in this contract.  In other words, the clause reflects model language prepared by a large state union for its local affiliates.  Having served as a school board negotiator in six states, I can assure readers that the proposed clause is by no means the worst from the parents' point of view.</P>
<P> Obviously, the NJEA proposal would have a devastating impact on parental complaints.  First, a requirement that complaints be put in writing would virtually insure that no complaints would be received from illiterate parents or from parents who are ill at ease in using bureaucratic channels or institutional means of redress.  In New Jersey, the numbers of such parents are substantial.</P>
<P> The requirement that the teacher be present at all meetings on the complaint, after it was put in writing, would probably discourage any further expression of parental concern.  One need only contrast the proposed procedure with the complaint procedures in virtually any large retail store.  I know of none that requires complainants to put their complaint in writing and present it in the presence of the employee.  On the contrary, retail stores typically try to make it easier, not more difficult, for patrons to express their concerns.  Furthermore, the fact that the consumer can exit -- take his or her business elsewhere -- usually plays a significant role in retail complaint procedures.  Company reputation is an important asset that often underlies company policy toward customer complaints.  Thus on returned merchandise, company policy may be to avoid challenging the customer; the company does not want to antagonize a $1,500-a-year customer over a $100 purchase.</P>
<P> Although the problems associated with voice may be formidable, so may be the problems associated with exit.  Supporters of family choice rely on the efficacy of choice (exit) in simple commercial transactions.  In practice, however, exit applies to a broad continuum in which the difficulties vary considerably.  Emigrating from one's country is a form of exit that is much more daunting than changing one's dry cleaner.  Even exit in certain commercial relationships, such as renting a different residence or place of business, can be a very complex and very costly way to solve a problem.  We must, therefore, avoid conclusions that ignore the problems associated with either option.</P>
<P> Insofar as exit involves changing schools, there may be significant costs involved.  Here I am referring to the costs of actually transferring from school <I>A</I> to school <I>B</I>.  There may be schedule or transportation problems.  A student may have friends or teachers who are difficult to leave.  Membership on an athletic team may be a strong inducement to stay.  Although I shall not outline in detail the cost of exit, clearly they can be formidable despite the fact that voucher proponents neglect them.</P>
<P> We must also be careful to avoid confusing the problems of individual parents with those of policymakers on the issue.  Because the costs and outcomes of both exit and voice can vary so much, parents have to compare their advantages and disadvantages in a specific context.  Nevertheless, for policymakers, the issue is whether a significant number of parents would find the exit option helpful, regardless of whether they exercise it.</P>
<P> Educators rarely compare the responsiveness of local school districts to the responsiveness of companies in a market system.  Typically, it is impossible to say whether the absence of complaints in schools is due to parent satisfaction or the absence of expeditious complaint procedures.  After all, most people do not like to complain.  They do not want to devote time and energy to the process.  The rhetoric of education assumes that parents want &quot;participation&quot; and will avail themselves of Parent-Teacher Association and school board meetings and elections to make their wishes known.  The reality is very different, to say the least.  Most people do not want participation.  They want their institutions to work so the participation is unnecessary.  Democratic ideology notwithstanding, political action appeals only to political types, who make up a small minority of the population.  When school board elections are held independently of other elections, typically an extremely low percentage of the electorate votes.  In larger school districts, the teachers tend to be well organized and dominate the process.  Parents outnumber teachers, but it is impractical for the former to act effectively as a group; it is not impractical for teachers to do so.</P>
<P> In school situation, exit frequently has two critical advantages over voice.  First, insofar as voice is directed to a policy, it often cannot be effective without the collaboration of others.  With exit, a dissatisfied parent need not rely on such collaboration and can resolve the problem more or less independently.  The parent who can exit enjoys a tremendous advantage over one who must  organize a community or state campaign to change a policy.  Such campaigns themselves may require a new organization that gives rise to various complaints by its members, and the exit/voice issue must be confronted all over again.</P>
<P> Legal actions constitute an interesting variation of the voice option.  Parents who sue a school district are not trying to exit but to change its policies.  Although some litigation is not over educational policy (for example, suits for breach of contract or tort actions), a great deal is essentially an effort to change district policies by legal instead of political action.  Such litigation has increased dramatically in recent years and must be regarded as a challenge to the efficacy of other forms of voice in public education.5 </P>
<P> Voice is much more effective when an exit option is available.  For most parents, voice is especially crucial because there is no exit option; paradoxically, however, although the absence of exit renders voice more important, it also lessens the attention school officials pay to voice.  The parent who needs expeditious channels of communication faces school officials who may ignore parental concerns for precisely the same reason.  This problem has been intensified in recent years as higher and higher proportions of school revenues have been provided by state instead of local governments.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>6 Competition Under Voucher Plans </B></FONT></A></H2>
<P><B>T</B>he educational improvement rationale assumes that voucher systems would create markets and that, as a result of competition, the better schools would achieve a growing share of these markets.  The inferior schools would have to improve or lose their clientelle.<P>
<P>There are two kinds of objections to this rationale.  One is that the effects of competition under voucher plans will be bad for children and for our society.  Another is that the competition will not happen, and thuds its beneficent effects will not happen either.  This chapter is devoted to both objections.  it should be emphasized, however, that all the arguments for and against vouchers will not be discussed.  Chapter 7 discusses various noneducational arguments for vouchers, along with the specific objections they raise.  Here our focus is on objections raised by the presence or absence of competition under voucher plans.</P>
<P> Because most objections to vouchers are based on the assumption that competition between school will in fact occur, we begin with these objections.  Studies have demonstrated that private schools enroll a disproportionate number of students from the more affluent groups in our society.  Although the numbers vary from place to place, time to time, and school to school, the generalization is valid.  Voucher critics base several objections on this fact.  One is that a voucher plan will mainly benefit parents who are economically favored.  Another is that low-income parents will not be able to afford private schools even with a voucher.  If vouchers are instituted, private schools will undoubtedly raise their tuition, thus reducing or eliminating the voucher's usefulness.  In addition, the lack of private schools, especially in inner city areas, the time and expense of transportation to and from them, and related school costs will also serve to undermine the utility of vouchers for less affluent parents.</P>
<P> Voucher opponents also assert that private schools would avoid low achievers to bolster school reputation.  Inasmuch as disadvantaged minorities include a disproportional number of low achievers, private schools would tend to avoid both groups.  Such an outcome would tend to stigmatize public schools, with negative consequences for the morale and incentives for their students, parents, and teachers.  A great deal of this concern is based on opposition to &quot;tracking&quot; -- the practice of grouping students according to aptitude or achievement.  Sometimes the term is also applied to grouping students by their educational objectives, such as &quot;the vocational track&quot; or &quot;the college preparatory track.&quot;  There is concern that vouchers would encourage tracking, with undesirable effects on the tracks that imply less aptitude, lower achievement, or less ambitious educational objectives.  Furthermore, diversity within a school supposedly has positive educational consequences.  that is, while there is nothing wrong in having your tooth extracted by an all-white or all-black dental team, a good education arguably requires some interaction with students from other ethnic and socioeconomic groups.</P>
<P> One other potential negative should be noted.  All students, even of the same age and grade level, are not equally expensive to educate.  For example, it usually costs more to educate disabled students than those who are not disabled.  Thus even if vouchers are related to parental income, private schools will seek those students who are the least expensive to educate; the others will be ignored or relegated to inferior schools.</P>
<P> In short, the objection to vouchers is that if education is bought and sold on free market principles, we can expect a highly segregated and stratified educational system.  Just as the wealthy purchase the more expensive (and presumably better) houses, and segregate themselves accordingly, they will enroll their children in the more expensive schools.  At the other end of the economic spectrum, the poor will be left to struggle with a voucher insufficient to pay for a good private school while being relegated to public schools gravely weakened by the financial, educational, and leadership losses that would result from a voucher system.</P>
<P> Voucher supporters have responded to these objections in various ways.  One is to frame voucher proposals in ways intended to alleviate the objections.  For example, the amount of the voucher could be related to parental income, thereby providing low-income parents with higher vouchers than middle- or high-income parents.  One problem with this type of solution is that it erodes the political support for vouchers from middle- and upper-class parents.  A few leading academic supporters of vouchers have proposed that parents be prohibited from adding to the vouchers.  Such prohibitions, however, are not likely to be enacted.  For one thing, the voucher amounts would have to be very substantial if parents could not add to them.  This would probably make the voucher legislation prohibitively expensive and also lead to increased state regulation of voucher schools.  Prohibitions against add-ons would also lead to a situation in which parents could spend their income for liquor, cigarettes, casino gambling, whatever -- but not to improve their children's education.  As prohibitions against add-ons are likely to destroy support from several otherwise supportive constituencies, they are not likely to be included in any voucher legislation that has a realistic chance of enactment.  Another legislative approach is to require voucher schools to enroll a certain proportion of children from low-income families and to avoid increased segregation.</P>
<P> In some instances, voucher supporters rely on a different factual or policy analysis to counter these objections.  For instance, schools seeking to establish reputations for high achievement will not ordinarily try to enroll low achievers.  It does not follow, however, that there will be no competition to enroll the latter and improve their educational achievement.  Gourmet restaurants do not compete with McDonalds, but there is plenty of competition at both ends of the restaurant business.  Similarly, private schools that specialize in educating low achievers will compete for them, just as other schools compete for high achievers.  As a matter of fact, as a result of federal legislation prohibiting discrimination against disabled children, large numbers are enrolled in proprietary schools; the latter compete to enroll them, often across state lines.  Thus, while voucher opponents charge that private schools are already educating large number of them.   Inasmuch as they are doing so with the knowledge, cooperation, and financial support of public school systems, the dumping ground argument appears inconsistent, even hypocritical; the antivoucher forces are not objecting to dumping grounds as long as they are in private schools.</P>
<P> Similarly, voucher proponents assert that vouchers would facilitate, not foster, racial integration.  At this time there is no feasible way for inner city black parents who want to spend more for a better education to do so.  They cannot afford private schools; enrolling their children in a better public school would require moving to a more affluent neighborhood, which most would find prohibitive.  Yet by supplementing the voucher from personal income, these parents could improve their children's education.  In other words, vouchers would break the connection between residence and school, making it possible for schools to enroll a more racially diverse student body than if their students are drawn only from the surrounding neighborhood.</P>
<P> The pro-voucher position receives some support from the concern sometimes expressed that vouchers will be used by high-achieving minority students.  The concern is that the students who are most needed as role models in inner city schools would be the ones most likely to transfer out of them.  Presumably, this would have negative effects on the remaining students.</P>
<P> First, we might ask why this &quot;creaming&quot; objection is not applied to public housing.  After all, it could be argued that with housing vouchers, the model tenants would be the first to leave for better housing in safe neighborhoods, thereby leaving other tenants without desirable models to emulate.  It would be surprising if any such argument could be used effectively to block housing vouchers; it calls for immediate concrete restrictions on freedom to improve one's situation in exchange for amorphous long-range benefits to others.  I see no reason why the restriction should be more persuasive in education.</P>
<P> In fact, comparisons of housing and education policy are instructive.  Public housing must rate near the top of anyone's list of dumping grounds.  Precisely for this reason some public agencies are turning to housing vouchers as a way to eliminate these dumping grounds, or to prevent the emergence of new ones.  That is, instead of providing housing in public facilities, the disadvantaged receive vouchers that enable them to rent private housing.  Although housing vouchers have not proved to be an unqualified success, they are perceived to be useful under certain circumstances.  Certainly they have not evoked the kind of opposition that is galvanized when educational vouchers are the issue.  Why are vouchers viewed as part of the solution to the dumping-ground problem in housing, but a potential cause of the problem in education?  In my opinion, political not substantive differences explain the different receptions accorded the policy.  A much smaller and thus less influential number of public employees are adversely affected by housing than by education vouchers.</P>
<P> Both supporters and opponents of vouchers appeal to &quot;diversity&quot; in education and pledge to strengthen it.  Not surprisingly, &quot;diversity&quot; means different things to these tow groups.  To private school leaders, &quot;diversity&quot; refers to the importance of schools organized on a religious, cultural, or philosophical basis.  Although leaders in both groups praise diversity, they are really applying the same term to different concepts -- in fact, contradictory cones.  The school diversity envisaged by private school leaders is unlikely to result in the kind of student diversity within classrooms sought in the public schools.</P>
<P> In all likelihood, voucher plans would be more supportive of the private school interpretation of diversity.  Objections to vouchers based on a melting-pot concept do not seem strongly persuasive.  Middle-class students in public schools usually are not enrolled in the same ones as the disadvantaged minorities.  Nor is it likely that they will be as long as public school enrollments are based on residence.  In any case, some homogeneity is required to facilitate education.  While this is not a popular idea in public education, it is unassailable if not pushed to extremes.  If students, parents, and teachers do not share some skills, values, and attitudes, it becomes virtually impossible to operate a school effectively.   In fact, the Coleman studies (to be discussed in chapter 7) strongly suggest that the community of values and attitudes in Catholic schools is a major reason for their effectiveness.  This community minimizes the resources that must be devoted to conflict resolution and makes it possible to establish educational programs that are not compromised by opposing interest groups.</P>
<P> One additional consideration weakens the objection that vouchers would encourage Racal segregation.  As Nathan Glazer has pointed out, the availability of private schools has been a critical factor in maintaining residential integration in Manhattan.   Families that would have moved out of the city if there was no alternative to its public schools have remained because of the private schools.  These schools are racially integrated but less subject to the academic, drug, and discipline problems that characterize many inner city public schools.  A great deal of &quot;white flight&quot; might have been obviated if acceptable private schools had been available.  In short, vouchers may contribute to residential integration, even while they lead to segregative effects in the schools.  Failure to consider, let alone rebut, this argument seriously weakens racial segregation objection to vouchers.</P>
<P> Several additional objections to vouchers, based on consequences of competition, remain to be considered.  Because these objections are intimately related to the role of schools for profit, they will be discussed together.  At this point, however, let me conclude by pointing out that voucher supporters see only the good effects of competition; opponents see only their negative effects.  The actual outcome will undoubtedly lie between these extremes -- but precisely where will depend on the specifics of the voucher plans adopted.  The objection should be viewed as matters to be considered and perhaps monitored; they should not be regarded as insuperable, regardless of the specifics of a plan and the circumstances of its application.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Nonprofit Status And Competition Under Voucher Plans</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> We turn next to concerns about voucher plans based on the possible absence of competition instead of on its possible consequences.  The educational improvement rationale is obviously based on an analogy to for-profit enterprise in competitive markets.  What the analogy consistently overlooks, however, is that private schools are predominantly denominational and overwhelmingly nonprofit; nonprofit schools probably enroll more than 98 percent of total enrollments in private schools.  </P>
<P> The nonprofit status of most private schools raises a number of basic  questions:</P>
<P>1. To what extent, if any, will the benefits of competition in the for-profit sector emerge from a voucher system in which nonprofit schools are overwhelmingly dominant?  Indeed, in some voucher legislation, only nonprofit schools are eligible to accept voucher students.</P>
<P>2. What policy justification for nonprofit status is applicable to private schools that compete effectively in education markets?  To phrase the question somewhat differently, if nonprofit schools can compete successfully, why should they need or have nonprofit status?</P>
<P>3. If competition in education markets is desirable, as is assumed by the educational improvement rationale for vouchers, is there any reason to exclude for-profit schools from the competition, for example, by rendering them ineligible to accept voucher students?</P>
<P>4. How can competition between nonprofit and for-profit schools avoid the unfair competition that results from tax exemptions and subsidies going to the former?</P>
<P>5. What public policies, if any, are needed to ensure fair competition between nonprofit and for-profit schools?</P>
<P> Obviously, these questions are interrelated.</P>
<P> Paradoxically, the first one has not been raised by either supporters or opponents of vouchers.  I say &quot;paradoxically&quot; because it seems counterintuitive to rely on nonprofit organizations to act like for-profit ones, at least without any questions or reservations.  Furthermore, nonprofit schools are governed by their nonprofit status as well as their status as educational institutions.  To focus exclusively on their educational role would overlook several critical factors that will affect their future, including their role under voucher plans.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Role of Nonprofit Organizations</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> A nonprofit organization is defined as one that is legally prohibited from distributing any net earnings to individuals who exercise control over the organization.  That is, nonprofits are differentiated from for-profit organizations by the &quot;nondistribution constraint.&quot;   If revenues of nonprofit organizations exceed their expenses, they can expand their services or lower their prices, but they cannot legally distribute such earnings to officers, directors, or other individuals who control the organization.  Later we shall have occasion to consider various efforts to avoid the nondistribution constraint.</P>
<P> In recent years the increased size of the nonprofit sector has led policymakers, business groups, and scholars to devote more attention to it.   It turns out that the number of organizations deemed tax exempt by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) increased from 309,00 in 1967 to almost 900,000 by 1984.  The number of tax-deductible &quot;charitable&quot; nonprofits increased from 138,000 in 1969 to 366,000 in 1985. (These are nonprofit organizations that receive a variety of subsidies and privileges, including the deductibility of contributions to them.)</P>
<P> The total revenues of nonprofit organizations increased from $115 billion in 1975 to $314 billion in 1983.  The IRS annually approved about 5,000 requests for tax-exempt status through 1963; by 1984 over 44,000 such requests were approved annually.  The assets of nonprofit organizations (land, reproducible consumer goods, semidurables, and financial assets) are almost 50 percent of the assets of the federal government and almost 15 percent of all governmental assets in the United States.</P>
<P> Although estimates vary widely, it appears that the nonprofit sector included about 9 million full-time employees in 1976.  In addition, nonprofit organizations utilize an enormous amount of volunteer labor, adding perhaps as much as 6 percent of the employed labor force.</P>
<P> The size of the nonprofit sector is likely to have important repercussions for educational policy.  Currently, law and policy lack a unified, coherent view of the role to be played by the nonprofit sector.  Because of its growth and size, however, this omission is not likely to continue.  Questions about what nonprofits do, what they should do, their sources of support, how they should be regulated, and what reporting requirements should be imposed on them are increasingly coming to the fore in legislative and academic forums.  Nonprofit organizations are largely in service industries, and education is the second largest component in the nonprofit economy.  As our nation resolves the issues relating to the nonprofit sector, it is virtually certain that private schools will be greatly affected.  While educators are apt to think of regulation in terms of educational issues, such as curriculum, class size, or teacher qualifications, regulation resulting from nonprofit status may also impact private schools in several important way.</P>
<P> It is not feasible here to examine in detail the structure of the nonprofit economy.  Instead, I shall summarize briefly the major categories of nonprofit organizations.  Inasmuch as each category includes some private schools, the categories will be discussed in the school context.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Nonprofit Schools as a Response to Unsatisfied Demand for Educational Services</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In the colonial period, schools were usually established first by private citizens.  this meant that the family had to bear the cost of providing educational services.  When citizens who supported formal education were able to persuade a legislative majority to finance public education, it was logical for them to shift the cost of education from their private resources to public funds.  Needless to say, any such change had to be characterized in more idealistic terms, and so it was.  Education was deemed to benefit everyone, so it deserved public support.  Such support solves the &quot;free rider&quot; problem; that is, the fact that some of the beneficiaries of education are not paying for it.</P>
<P> Public support also makes possible a higher level of support, since the costs are shared by a much larger group -- including, of course, the otherwise unwilling taxpayer.   Nevertheless, the level of public support is not geared to the most avid supporter but rather to the preferences of a hypothetical &quot;median voter.&quot;  If support were lower, political leaders would lose out to advocates of higher spending for education.  If it were higher, they would lose out to advocates of less spending.  For this reason, the actual level of support is the level that satisfies the wishes of the median voter. </P>
<P> Obviously, this level does not meet the demands of parents who want a higher level of public provision.  Insofar as they can, these dissatisfied parents will meet their needs through private schools, which provide the public good but also maximize the private benefits (such as religious indoctrination).  Inasmuch as the dissatisfied citizen/consumers are paying for the school themselves, they can exercise more control over the service and can pay less attention to the benefits going to those who do not pay.</P>
<P> Some additional points should be noted.  Resort to the private sector will be affected primarily by the demand heterogeneity of the population in a given governmental unit and the income levels of consumers/taxpayers.  Although heterogeneity in the population with respect to income, religion, location, lifestyle, occupation, and so on cannot be equated with heterogeneity of demand for public goods, there is certainly a strong correlation between the two.  Thus there is less dissatisfaction with public schools over religious issues and less resort to private schools in Japan, where the population is relatively homogenous from a religious point of view, than in the United States, where religious heterogeneity is common.</P>
<P> Level of income is a critical variable.  As income levels increase, dissatisfied consumer/taxpayers are better able to support nongovernmental provision of the service.  Indeed, voucher proponents emphasize the alleged superiority of vouchers over tuition tax credits as a means of providing less affluent parents a way to exercise effective choice.</P>
<P> These observations may help to explain resort to the private sector; they do not, however, explain why the alternative to public provision should be nonprofit schools.  One reason is the nature of consumer/taxpayer dissatisfaction.  If based, for example, on religious reasons, it would be difficult to use for-profit organizations to provide the service.  Until the 1970s, most private schools were catholic schools that relied heavily on the contributed services of teachers in religious orders.  Such teachers would not have been available to for-profit schools, so the latter would not have been able to survive except for parents at a very high income level.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Nonprofit Schools as Trustworthy Producers: The Contract Failure Argument</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Another view of nonprofit organizations is that they are a response to &quot;contract failure&quot; -- that is, the inability of donors or purchasers to monitor the goods or services they have paid for.  Ordinarily, purchasers are also the recipients of whatever they purchase:  groceries, dry cleaning, automobiles, haircuts, and so on.  Suppose, however, you want to help survivors of the earthquakes in Armenia.  If you donate money or goods, you have no practical way to make sure your gift actually helped anyone; going there would be too expensive.  Theoretically, a profit-making organization could sell assistance for a certain price, but the risk that funds would be siphoned off to increase profits would discourage prospective purchasers of such assistance.  In contrast, nonprofit organizations have no incentive -- or less incentive -- to cheat, since the distribution constraint supposedly precludes profiteering.  For this reason nonprofit organizations sometimes emerge as the solution to contract failure.</P>
<P> Distance is not the only factor that may weaken the ability of donors or purchasers to monitor performance.  Whenever the person who pays is not the direct recipient of the services, there is a possibility of contract failure.  Obviously, this is the normal situation in education, so it is not surprising that parents' ability to monitor the educational services received by their children is a basic issue in the controversy over vouchers.</P>
<P> Interestingly enough, some applications of the contract failure argument have been criticized for their allegedly weak empirical foundation.  For example, it is often doubtful whether purchasers know which organizations are for profit and which are not (I have met college students who did not know whether their secondary school was for profit or nonprofit.)  Perhaps the most important issue is whether consumers really care.  Monopolies aside, consumers are likely to be more interested in price and quality, not how much profit management is making.</P>
<P> Most important, nonprofit status does not solve the most basic problems of contract failure.  Nonprofit management may be scrupulously honest but also incompetent.  I believe that incompetence is a much more pervasive problem than dishonesty.  Whether it is or not, nonprofit status cannot be viewed as tantamount to quality control.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Nonprofit Organizations as the Result of &quot;Backward Integration&quot;</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Citizens dissatisfied with a public service may decide to purchase the service in the private sector.  Under some circumstances, however, they may unite to provide the service themselves.  Inasmuch as their interest lies in the service, not in making a profit, the nondistribution constraint presents no problem.  If income exceeds revenues, the fees charged can be lowered or the quality increased.</P>
<P> Private clubs often fit this pattern.  For example, a group of tennis players may be dissatisfies with the public courts.  By starting their own club, the players can control location, membership, amenities, and availability; were they to purchase time on courts operated for profit, they would have less control over these matters.</P>
<P> This process has been referred to as backward integration because it reflects integration from the consumer back to the process of production.  Although some private schools were established this way, ordinarily they do not continue in this mode for long.  Changing conditions and parent turnover lead to a loss of control by parents, especially since the parental time required for school governance is often prohibitive.  The parents who follow the founders often do not have the interest and the drive that led their predecessors to establish the school.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Nonprofit Status in Theory and Practice</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In considering the implications of private schools' nonprofit status, we must recognize that the differences between for-profit and nonprofit organizations are often not as sharp in practice as my discussion might suggest.  In many fields, the distinction has been diminishing in importance.  Because the reasons are also applicable to private schools, let us review them briefly.</P>
<P> 1.  The revenues of certain kinds of nonprofit organizations, such as schools and hospitals, have come increasingly from fees for services.  Consequently, these nonprofit organizations raise most of their capital through retained earnings and by borrowing.  This is an important change from an earlier time when they raised most of their capital from donations and government grants.</P>
<P> 2.  Nonprofit organizations, including schools, are subject to economic pressures even if they are not required to show profits.</P>
<P> 3.  Although nonprofit organizations do not accumulate profits in a legal sense, they do so in an accounting sense.  To survive even without expansion, nonprofit organizations must have revenues to cover the costs of renovation and capital equipment.  For this reason, nonprofit organizations try to accumulate surpluses that are used for some of the same purposes as for-profit organizations, such as expansion or renovation of capital facilities.</P>
<P> 4.  Organizational structure is not a guide to individual motivation and conduct.  &quot;For-profit&quot; and &quot;nonprofit&quot; are legal terms not necessarily indicative of anyone's attitude toward charitable service or making money.  A teacher in a Catholic school is not necessarily motivated by Christian charity; the job may be the best one available.  Although efforts have been made to identify group differences in values, personality, and behavior among graduate students who enter for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, the evidence of actual differences is rather weak.  Aside from the fact that the group differences were not always more flattering to those entering the nonprofit sector, it is doubtful whether they would emerge or be as pronounced in education.  Even if there were some group differences, conclusions about individuals based solely on their sector of affiliation would not be justified.</P>
<P> 5.  Along with a tendency to overemphasize the service motivations of employees in not-for-profit firms, there is a tendency to overstate the profit motivations among employees of for-profit firms.  For-profit companies give money, products, and services to universities, to charities, to civic, religious, and cultural institutions, and otherwise conduct their affairs without trying to squeeze the last penny from every transaction.  Such activities often characterize the personal as well as the corporate activities of individual employed by such firms.  Actually, the extent to which for-profit companies should allocate resources to activities that are not clearly intended to enhance the long-range profitability of the company is a matter of dispute.  Ironically, while some observers assume that corporate managers care only about maximizing profits, these same managers are often criticized for not doing just that.</P>
<P> 6.  Both for-profit and nonprofit firms contract and interact with each other in ways that blur the distinction.  For-profit organizations often set up nonprofit foundations that receive a substantial income from corporate revenues.  In other cases, corporations contract with nonprofit organizations for services.  Similarly, nonprofit organizations, such as universities, hospitals, and schools, frequently contract with for-profit firms for goods or services.</P>
<P> 7.  The legal limitations on nonprofit companies vary widely from state to state.  In some states a tax exemption is the only criterion that distinguishes them from for-profit organizations.</P>
<P> 8.  nonprofit organizations use a variety of techniques and legal mechanisms to evade the legal restrictions against the distribution of &quot;profits&quot; to management.  Pension plans can build a huge management equity.  Managerial residences, travel, club expenses, and other perquisites can be paid as organizational expenses.  In some ways it is easier to pay managers more in the nonprofit sector; they do not have to be concerned about shareholders perusing the annual report to find out why the return on their investment is so low.  The revelations in 1987 of the salaries and benefits paid in some television ministries provide a case in point.</P>
<P> 9.  In some instances for-profit firms build and operate municipal facilities under long-term agreements.  The facilities are bought by the municipality (thereby becoming tax free) and then leased back to the firm, which manages them for profit.  this approach to capital construction has not been used often in education, but as noted in chapter 3, it may be in the future.</P>
<P> On some issues, the lack of data constitutes a major obstacle to sectoral comparisons and analysis.  To illustrate, consider the important question of whether a voucher system will lead to an increase or to a decrease in private support for education.  Theoretically, either outcome is possible.  The reason it might foster an increase is that under the present system, it is usually not feasible for parents to devote an increase in disposable income to education.  If a parent receives a salary increase (e.g., $100 a month), the parent can spend it for better food, better clothing, a better automobile, a better vacation, or for many other amenities.  It would, however, be impractical to try to buy a better education with the salary increase.</P>
<P> Under a voucher plan, however, buying a better education would arguably be a practical outcome.  Parents who could afford $2,500 a year to send their children to private school could do so by adding to a voucher from personal funds.  There could be a range of schools, catering to the range of parents willing to supplement vouchers from personal funds.  Thus, despite the concerns of voucher opponents, vouchers might lead to increases in total spending for education -- an outcome voucher opponents presumably support.</P>
<P> It is also possible that vouchers could result in less personal and total spending for education.  In some fields, such as the arts, government spending sometimes has the effect of &quot;crowding out&quot; private spending for the same purposes.  Obviously, if a voucher merely replaced parental funds, the dollar spent by government would not add to educational spending but would simply rearrange the sources of it.  Nonprofit schools might simply replace parental funds with educational vouchers.  As this happens, schools might become more oriented to government regulators than to parents.  There is some evidence that this is what happened after the enactment of a voucher plan in British Columbia. </P>
<P> Another factor complicating sectoral analysis is that the functions of nonprofit organizations often change over time.  This is especially obvious in the case of higher education.  Many private institutions were founded to train leaders of a particular religion.  Over time some of these institutions, such as Harvard, became nonsectarian, emphasizing different objectives than those motivating their founders.  Similarly, the objectives of nonprofit schools below the college level can and do change from time to time.</P>
<P> Even apart from the foregoing complexities of analysis, it is open to question whether a voucher system utilizing only nonprofit schools, or an overwhelming preponderance of them, can achieve the benefits of competition in the for-profit sector.  Granted, the ideal conditions for competition seldom exist, even in the for-profit sector; the issue is one of degree, not whether competition would exist at all under a voucher plan dominated by nonprofit schools.  Nevertheless, the persistent neglect of the issue is cause for concern.  To cite just one reason, some voucher proposals exclude schools for profit from eligibility to participate in voucher programs.  Inasmuch as schools for profit are a minuscule lobby, especially compared to denominational nonprofit schools, the exclusion of for-profit schools from voucher programs does not encounter significant political opposition.  Nonetheless, the exclusion is certain to weaken the possibility that vouchers would result in competition leading to educational improvement.  If one supports vouchers for other reasons, neglect of this sectoral issue may not seem important, but it is critical if educational improvement is the objective.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Service Differentiation</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In education, one often encounters the view that it is important &quot;to meet the needs and interests of people.&quot;  However this is interpreted, implementing the concept requires differentiated services.  Both evidence and theory support the conclusion that for-profit schools would provide such differentiation more effectively than nonprofit schools.  For-profit companies are constantly searching for markets that can be used as profit centers.  Studies of three-sector industries show rather conclusively that the services provided by public and nonprofit organizations tend to be very similar, whereas those provided by the for-profit sector tend to be much more varied.  Book publishing, hospitals, and employment agencies illustrate this point.0 </P>
<P> The greater service differentiation in the for-profit sector has important implications for vouchers.  Nonprofit schools do not exist to educate anyone who comes down the pike; they tend to enroll a certain constituency.  Although each for-profit school may also have a distinctive constituency, schools to serve specialized groups are more likely to be established in the for-profit sector.  The substantial increase in for-profit organizations serving the disabled is a case in point.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Implications of the Labor-intensive Nature of Education</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The  conventional efforts to improve education focus on such means as reducing class size, adding resources, training teachers differently, providing student incentives, or rearranging human resources in one way or another.  Unfortunately, the record of increased productivity in other fields strongly suggests that such approaches are very limited in what they can do to improve productivity.  Outside of education, productivity improvements rely heavily on improving technology:  agricultural machinery, medical instruments, new drugs, computers, word processors, jet airplanes, and so on.  As the amount of capital equipment per worker increases, workers become more productive.  Industries with a low ratio of capital equipment per worker tend to be less efficient.  Because they are less efficient, they tend to require more workers to maintain a given level of services; the more workers needed, the more difficult it is to provide them with a high level of compensation.</P>
<P> What conditions encourage the development and introduction of better technology, and how can these conditions be introduced into education?  The evidence is overwhelming that for-profit enterprise is quicker to develop and/or use technology than either the public or the nonprofit sector.  As critical as the issue is, however, educational policymakers pay virtually no attention to it.  When they do, the results are usually much worse than if the issue had been ignored.  Let me cite just one example.</P>
<P> As we have seen, California law provides that at least 55 percent of the operating budget of unified school districts must be devoted to teacher salaries.1   In other words, no matter how much the district could improve education by allocating more resources to technology or paraprofessionals or whatever, teachers must receive at least 55 percent of the expenditures.  Needless to say, it would be ridiculous for a business firm to restrict itself this way.  If a firm can reduce its labor costs by introducing technology, it does so.  That is how companies increase their productivity.  It would not make sense for a company or a hospital or law firm to impose a minimum budget allocation to any factor or production.  As a matter of fact, if there is to be legislation on the issue, it would be more sensible to impose a <I>limit</I> on labor costs -- that teacher salaries cannot <I>exceed</I> 55 percent of the district budget.  This might force districts to be more receptive to improved technology than to inefficiencies in its expenditures.</P>
<P> For several years, educational and political leaders embraced the idea that the teaching profession should be &quot;restructured.&quot;  In practice, such restructuring turns out to be giving teachers opportunities to observe other teachers, making paraprofessionals available to teachers, providing teachers with offices, or authorizing teachers to purchase instructional materials.  These efforts assume that restructuring can be achieved by legislation or certification procedures or collective bargaining.  Such approaches are consistently unproductive because they overlook the role of technological change as a condition precedent to changes in personnel structure.  In medicine, there are physicians, nurses, therapists, X-ray technicians, dietitians, pharmacist, and a host of other specializations.  Without the technology, however, we would still be using the Hippocratic personnel structure.</P>
<P> I do not assert that personnel restructuring apart from technological change is always futile.  Such restructuring at best, however, is not likely to achieve major gains in educational productivity.  The basic issue is not how to restructure education.  It is how can we foster the development of an educational technology which will lead to  a more efficient personnel structure?  On this issue at least, for-profit schools unquestionably offer much more promise than public or nonprofit ones.  The tendency of public school managers to overspend on immediate benefits for public employees, and to under invest in capital equipment as well as research and development, is beyond dispute; I see no reason to expect any change in the matter.  For several reasons, especially the nondistribution constraint and lack of access to equity capital, nonprofit organizations are also less likely than for-profit ones to invest in new technology.</P>
<P> If this analysis is correct, and I believe it is supported by a wealth of evidence, the overwhelming predominance of nonprofit schools raises serious doubts about the likelihood that a voucher system will lead to educational improvement.  Granted, this observation does not invalidate the other rationales for voucher systems, but it poses a critical issue for the educational improvement rationale.  The predominance of nonprofit schools would not be a major problem if voucher legislation allowed schools for profit to participate in voucher programs.  Actually, the exclusion of schools for profit is more prevalent than their inclusion in proposed voucher programs.  Such exclusion clearly weakens the possibility that educational vouchers would foster changes in educational technology and a restructuring of the teaching profession.</P>

<P> Recent developments in health care support the view that for-profit organizations should be allowed to participate in educational voucher plans.  While developments in other fields may not be directly applicable to education, they should be considered.  Health care is our largest industry in which public, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations have achieved a significant market share.  Ignoring this evidence would be as undesirable as uncritical application of it to education.</P>
<P> In 1982 for-profit hospital chains owned 10 percent of the hospitals in the United States and managed another 4 percent.  In addition, another 5 percent of American hospitals were independent proprietary hospitals (not owned by a company owning three or more hospitals).  From 1976 to 1982 the number of for-profit hospitals owned or managed by hospital chains increased from 533 to 1,040, despite the fact that the total number of hospitals in the United States declined in this period.  Thus by 1982 approximately 19 percent of American hospitals were for profit.  This increase is remarkable in view of the fact that some of the largest for-profit hospital chains did not even exist until the 1970s.2 </P>
<P> The hospital chains have expanded rapidly mainly by acquisitions from all sectors:  government, nonprofit, and for profit.  In addition to the problems of financing the acquisitions, the hospital chains have had to overcome several obstacles that are similar to those that would be present in school situations.  One is the attitude that there is something reprehensible about making money off the sick.  Another is the fear that hospital chains would serve only the affluent, leaving the poor worse off than before, or that the drive for profits would result in inferior levels of health care.  Over time these fears and attitudes have diminished, partly as a result of specific agreements that address the problems; in fact, in recent years the initiatives for acquisition have often come from government or nonprofit hospitals rather than the for-profit chains.  </P>
<P> Actually, for-profit enterprise plays a prominent if not a dominant role in virtually every service associated with health care.  In addition to the fee-for-service orientation of physicians, the percentage of hospitals (15) that are for profit is higher than the percentage of schools (10) that are nonprofit.  Ambulatory service centers, nursing homes, and dialysis centers are predominately for profit, as are primary care or urgent care centers.  In addition, for-profit companies play an important and increasing role in cardiac rehabilitation, physical rehabilitation, radiology, hospice care, birthing centers, and diagnostic imaging, to mention just a few areas.3 </P>
<P> This brief overview suggests several points of major interest to education.  One is that negative attitudes toward education for profit are not necessarily immutable.  If providers of health care can overcome opposition to &quot;making money off the sick,&quot; educational providers should be able to overcome opposition to &quot;making money off children.&quot;</P>
<P> Medical care experience also highlights an important difference in the potential benefits of service for profit.  For profit companies often operate at lower cost without any service implications.  For example, if a for-profit operator can hire equally qualified employees at lower salaries, it can achieve savings without any quality reduction.  On the other hand, some potential benefits have direct implications for the quality of service; for example, because they operate on a larger scale, for-profit hospitals can purchase and use expensive equipment not available in small public or nonprofit hospitals.</P>
<P> Of course, large public or nonprofit hospitals might also be able to buy and use the equipment efficiently.  The point is, however, that hospitals operated for profit are more likely to be organized and operated in a way that enables them to take advantage of efficiencies of scale.  Hospitals that are owned nationally are more likely to provide services that require expensive equipment and that must serve larger than local markets to be viable than are locally based public or nonprofit hospitals.  Also note that equipment that cannot be used efficiently is not likely to be invented.  In other words, the larger scale of for-profit hospitals fosters technological improvements that would be impractical in a cottage industry.</P>
<P> In health services, nonprofit providers have been the main challengers to the emergence of for-profit enterprise.  For-profit hospitals are not ordinarily viewed as a &quot;threat&quot; to government hospitals.  In specific situations, the establishment or expansion of a for-profit hospital may adversely affect the economic viability of either a public or nonprofit hospital, but public hospitals do not constitute a united lobby in opposition to for-profit ones.  One reason is that for-profit hospitals often offer physicians financial and professional incentives that are not available in government or nonprofit hospitals.  Another is that public officials as well as the trustees of nonprofit hospitals are concerned about the costs of medical care and are inclined to consider alternatives to the existing system.</P>
<P> The health care experience also highlights the importance of the motivations underlying objections to service delivery by for-profit organizations.  For instance, when access to health care was a genuine concern in a proposed acquisition by a hospital chain, contractual arrangements that allayed the concern usually could be worked out.  This would not have been possible if the concern had been merely an excuse for the opposition.  Whether access to education is a genuine concern or merely another excuse for opposition remains to be seen.  If the former, solutions can often be negotiated; if the latter, they cannot be.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Exploitation of children for Profit</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The discussion thus far has raised some concerns about the anticipated benefits of competition between nonprofit schools.  It has also suggested that if voucher plans are enacted to facilitate educational improvement, schools for profit should be allowed to participate in the plans.  Some might object that for-profit schools would take advantaged of students to maximize profits.  This objection has not been widely raised because of the tacit assumption that for-profit schools would not be eligible to participate in voucher plans; if medical experience is relevant, however, the assumption would not hold and the objection would be inevitable.  Indeed, its relevance is heightened but not necessarily dependent on a large-scale increase in schools for profit.</P>
<P> To some extent, the objection ignores business realities.  Successful businesses are alert to opportunities to cut costs, but they do not systematically take advantage of customers at every short-range opportunity.  Indeed, most successful companies are very much concerned about retaining customers.  To this end, they absorb a variety of costs that actually should be borne by customers; for example, policies on returned items are not based upon <I>caveat </I><I>emptor</I> but on the importance of a satisfied customer over a long period of time.</P>
<P> This is not to deny that in some instance, for profit schools will try to use unethical means to maximize profits.  In this issue, however, it is vitally important to heed my initial warning about a double standard of judgment.  As I pointed out elsewhere, public school teachers on strike have frequently:</P>
<P>&#149;Made  pupil records inaccessible so substitutes cannot teach effectively</P>
<P>&#149;Told pupils not to attend school if their teachers were on strike.  This, of course, is encouraging pupils to violate the compulsory attendance laws in order to increase the effectiveness of the strike.</P>
<P>&#149;Refused to give credit for student work performed during the strike in some districts, and threatened to do so in others.</P>
<P>&#149;Utilized children on picket lines with picket signs supporting teachers, in order to generate public support.</P>
<P>&#149;Used the children of teachers and others to enter schools during a strike to lead student walkouts and student efforts to disrupt and discredit school operations during the strikes.</P>
<P>&#149;Discussed actual or threatened strikes in classes, where it was not relevant to the curriculum, in ways calculated to gain student and parental support.</P>
<P>&#149;Created fears among students that their opposition to a teacher strike, or even their refusal to support it, could lead to reprisals against the students.4 </P>
<P> These actions are simply the most visible ways that public school teachers exploit pupils for their own welfare.  The most harmful ways are to be found in the legislation, such as the excessive duration of compulsory education, which is ostensibly designed to protect young people but in fact benefits the service providers at the children's expense.  In fact, all three sectors (public, private nonprofit, and private for profit) have exploitation problems; in my opinion, none has solved them more effectively than the others.  The basic issue is how the form of organization influences conduct.  Would the same hospital administrator be more likely to take advantage of a patient in a for-profit than a nonprofit hospital?  Would the teacher or principal who emphasizes student welfare in a public school or a nonprofit school subordinate such welfare in a for-profit schools?  These are rather brad questions which are answered in more detail in chapter 11.  At this point, however, let me comment briefly on relationships between sectoral status and ethical conduct.</P>
<P>  First of all, there is an existing for-profit sector in education.  It is much larger than is generally realized because our procedures for estimating educational expenditures substantially understate its size.5   Because this point is relevant to several issues in this book, let me explain it briefly.</P>
<P> Data on expenditures for education are generated by local school districts according to accounting procedures established by state governments.  The data are then sent on by the state departments of education to the Center for Statistics, an agency of the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
<P>  Consider a high school student taking Spanish.  The students are counted, as are the teachers.  Our expenditures for education include the salaries for these teachers.  Let us suppose, however, that instead of being enrolled in Spanish courses in public schools, the same students were paying private tutors for Spanish lessons.  In the latter case, students, teachers, and expenditures would not show up in federal statistics on the costs of education.</P>
<P>In other words, if we consider the subject instead of the source of payment, total spending by school districts, states, and federal agencies understates total educational spending for elementary and secondary school pupils.  This is true even if the estimate is restricted to subjects that would be counted if offered in an elementary or secondary school.  For example, computer education is counted if taken in high school, but it is not counted if taken at summer camp.  Music is counted if studied in school, but music lessons outside of school are not counted.  And so on.</P>
<P>Obviously, our nation is spending a great deal more for education than is suggested by U.S. Department of Education statistics on the issue.  The point to be emphasized here, however, is different.  It makes little sense to debate how educators for profit would act while ignoring how they do act.  After all, we are not talking about minuscule expenditures.  Minimally, the for-profit education sector runs into billions already.  Nevertheless, there is no public outcry over its ethical or professional standards; the issue seems to be dormant.  this is not to say that instances of unethical conduct in this sector are unknown; they do arise, and no doubt will in the future.  The issue, however, is whether this sector reveals such persistent patterns of undesirable conduct that it should be prohibited.  The answer seems to be clearly in the negative; trade schools aside, increased regulation of education for profit does not seem to be an active issue in any state.</P>
<P>As is widely recognized, the issue of whether doctor profits will take precedence over patient welfare has emerged in health care.  If anything, this question is more urgent there than it is in education; at least, most people would agree that consumer protection is more urgent in life or death than in educational decisions.  Nevertheless, there is not persuasive evidence that patient interests are being systematically sacrificed in for-profit hospitals.  As one recent study summarized the evidence:</P>
<P>A major issue in physician/hospital decision making is the extent to which control of costs or improved efficiency can be achieved only at the expense of the quality of care.  Most of the studies to date, however, suggest that efforts at containing costs are positively associated with quality.  For example, a study of Chicago-area hospitals found that the more efficient hospitals, as measured by lower costs and lower manhours per standardized unit of output, also provided higher-quality care, as evaluated by outside experts and as indicated by accreditation and severity-adjusted death rates.  A study of hospitals in Massachusetts revealed that higher cost per case was associated with higher medical/surgical death rates, even when differences in case mix were taken into account.  Other studies have generally found similar results . . . existing evidence offers little support for the argument or expectation that efficiency or cost containment goals are inherently incompatible with effectiveness or quality of care.6 </P>
<P> One of  the critical issues here is whether the nonprofit mode actually compensates for a lack of consumer sophistication about service providers.  On this issue at leas the data from health care show no superiority of nonprofit over for-profit providers.  For example, studies designed to assess the extent of fraud, unnecessary surgery, and unnecessary hospital care do not show that nonprofit hospitals are more protective of consumer interests than for-profit ones.  That is, if the nonprofit mode is supposed to serve as a consumer protection in health care, there is little if any direct evidence that it does so more effectively than hospitals for profit.</P>
<P> As Harvard law professor Robert C. Clark summarizes, &quot;the most reasonable conclusion on the evidence is simply that organizational form appears to play little role in solving or worsening information problems and other causes of market failure.&quot;  Furthermore, &quot;At the very least, one can conclude that the case for believing that nonprofit hospitals are organized as fiduciaries and are therefore socially superior has not been established.&quot;7 </P>
<P> As a matter of fact, the most significant development in the medical field is not the substantial growth of the for-profit sector.  It is the growing challenge to the policy rationale underlying the nonprofit sector.8   At least some elements of this challenge (for example, the tax-exempt status of nonprofit hospitals) are applicable to nonprofit schools.  In addition, the legislative and lobbying activities of nonprofit schools, like such activities in the nonprofit sector generally, will probably be more restricted legally in the future than they have been.9 </P>
<P> For educational policymakers, perhaps the main lesson to be learned from the health care industry is the importance of avoiding stereotypes about the for-profit sector.  Earning a profit may not be as antithetical to high-quality education as many educators assume.  Parents who have entrusted their health and even their lives to for-profit hospitals are not so likely to be concerned about for-profit schools.  If sector neutrality continues to gain acceptance in medical care, the educational community may have to face the issue in the near future, quite apart from any voucher plans.</P>
<P> The case of medical care suggests two additional outcomes that are widely ignored in the debate over educational vouchers.  Most hospitals were established by denominational groups and were intended to serve the needs of their constituents.  In this respect, these hospitals were similar to schools established by denominational groups.  Over time the denominational character of hospitals has declined, especially as they have become more dependent on government support and payments by health insurance companies.</P>
<P>Insurance companies are not a major source of revenues for private schools.  It is not likely that they will be, at least for many years to come.  The hospital experience suggests, however, that educational vouchers may not be as efficacious in maintaining denominational unity as is commonly assumed.  Given a way to implement their choices, some parents who now choose denominational over public schools may choose nondenominational over denominational private schools.</P>
<P> Finally, our experience with health care suggest that the major private school concerns about voucher plans may not materialize.  As we have seen, some private school leaders oppose vouchers because they fear increased regulation will result.  Interestingly, the American Medical Association (AMA) initially opposed Medicare on the grounds that it would lead to increased government regulation of medical care.  When it became clear that a federally financed plan would be enacted, the AMA redirected its efforts to protect doctor interests.  Unquestionably, the AMA was very successful in this effort.  This fact suggests that government regulation of voucher plans is not necessarily a threat to the service providers; the issues can be resolved in their interests.  I am not advocating such an outcome, but increased regulation of private schools under voucher plans is not a foregone conclusion.0 </P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Transfers Under Voucher Plans</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> If the educational improvement argument for vouchers is valid, poor schools, whether public or private, must either improve or go out of business.  Thus the ultimate test of the educational improvement rationale is not how many students transfer.  It is what happens to the levels of teaching and learning in schools generally.,  Although widely overlooked, this point is absolutely critical.</P>
<P> First of all, the mere fact that students transfer under a voucher plan would not be evidence per se that the educational improvement rationale is valid.  Students enroll in private schools for a variety of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with educational improvement.  Some may even transfer for educationally negative reasons.  As a matter of fact, even transfers based on such goals as learning to read and write better would not sustain the educational improvement rationale.  Unless educational achievement actually improves as a result of transfers or potential transfers, the educational improvement rationale will have failed.</P>
<P> Some implications of this conclusion are worth noting.  One is that the rationale poses some difficult assessment problems.  Even if educational improvement takes place, it may be impossible to say what was responsible for it in a given school.  And what if educational achievement declines, as it inevitably will in some schools for reasons beyond the influence of any educational program; for example, what if demographic changes result in lower achievement levels?  can the improvement rationale survive such situations?</P>
<P> Notice also that other arguments for vouchers will have other criteria for their success or failure.  If vouchers are proposed for religious reasons, the test of their success will be whether public schools are more hospitable to religious beliefs and/or whether there are more transfers for religious reasons.  Wither of these outcomes could happen without any educational improvement.  Similarly, other rationales for vouchers have other criteria for evaluating the success or failure of voucher plans.</P>
<P> The economic level of transferees is another matter of considerable uncertainty.  Voucher opponents assert that students transferring to private schools would be overwhelmingly from affluent families because poor families could not afford private schools, even with vouchers.  The fact that the voucher amounts (or tax credits) usually proposed are rather modes ($250 to $750) lends some support to this conclusion.  On the other hand, a strong argument has been made that the students who transfer as the result of a voucher plan are more likely to be from lower-income families.1   The reason is that the small amount of the vouchers is not likely to have deterred affluent parents.  In contrast, relatively modest amounts would have been much more important to low-income parents who prefer private schools.  Of course, if few students transfer as a result of vouchers, voucher funds would largely benefit the parents whose children would have attended private schools anyway.  At any rate, it is doubtful whether vouchers would result in a large-scale exodus of middle- and upper-class students from public schools.  This might happen where such students attend schools characterized by racial conflicts, but its occurrence elsewhere is doubtful.</P>
<P> The low-income parents who wish to transfer their children to private schools may encounter some noneconomic hurdles to doing so.  School effectiveness is related in significant ways to student characteristics.  Speaking generally, and recognizing that exceptions are numerous, students from upper-middle-class families will have a more positive effect than lower-class students on the educational achievement of fellow students.  For this reason, private schools emphasizing academic achievement may be more reluctant to accept low-income students, especially if some students must be turned away.2 </P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Competition In Education:  Some Observations</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In 1953 I was appointed assistant professor of education at the University of Oklahoma.  As a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed professor, I participated in several faculty meetings devoted to this question:  How many semester credits of academic work earned at other institutions should receive credit for an M.A. degree at the University of Oklahoma?</P>
<P> The records of these interminable discussions may not show it, but after all the educational arguments, pro and con, the question was resolved by one simple fact:  If we did not allow at least eight semester hours of transfer credit, we would lose graduate students to our archrival, Oklahoma State University.  Ergo, we allowed eight semester hours of transfer credit.</P>
<P> Since that time I have been employed in a variety of institutions all over the United States.  Competition issues have arisen frequently.  In all the cases that I can recall, however, the issues were resolved in ways that were good for the professors and students seeking the least educationally demanding solution, but bad for everyone else.</P>
<P> My experience here is relevant to voucher issues.  A high school student may be more interested in a piece of paper (a diploma) than in the quality of educational achievement or service supposedly reflected in a diploma.  When this happens, competition is not a matter of providing better service in the sense assumed by voucher supporters.  On the contrary, it is a matter of getting the requisite piece of paper in the least expensive way.  If a student needs a diploma to get a driver's license, or a job, the student's interest is in the diploma, not the educational achievement it presumably stands for.  In such cases, competition can have disastrous consequences.</P>
<P> Let me cite another example that plays an extremely important role in education below the college level.  The overwhelming majority of teachers below that level are paid on the basis of their academic credits and years of experience.  Teachers with a master's degree are paid more than teachers with only a bachelor's degree.  Teachers with thirty hours of credit beyond the M.A. are paid more than teachers with only a M.A.  And so on.</P>
<P> In most school districts, there is no quality control over the process of accumulating credit for salary purposes.  It matters not whether additional academic work is relevant to the teacher's assignment, whether the teacher received A's or D's in the courses, or whether the institutions offering the courses had high or low standards, or even any, for granting credit.</P>
<P> Under these circumstances, competition has turned out to be competition to offer credit in the least expensive and least educationally demanding ways.  The teachers who respond by taking the least demanding and least expensive courses are acting in a rational manner.  Competition is working; teachers are getting the desired credit in the least expensive way.  Similarly, in the absence of any external standard for evaluating student performance, we can expect a great deal of school competition to be antieducational in effect.  That is the reality; one need usually look no than the nearest institution of higher education to see a concrete manifestation of it.  Opposition to vouchers among public school officials and organizations is often ascribed to monopolistic and/or self-seeking motives.  Such motives do play a significant role in this opposition.  Realistically, however, similar motives underlie some support as well as some opposition to vouchers.  The rhetoric of competition serves some private school interests; at bottom, these interests are just as eager to avoid competition as their public school counterparts.</P>
<P> This is not a matter of conjecture.  In 1969 Marjorie Webster Junior College, a two-year proprietary institution in Washington, D.C., filed an antitrust action against the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (MSA).  MSA was one of six regional accrediting associations in the United States.  It accredited institutions of higher education and secondary schools in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, and Virgin Islands.  At the time of the lawsuit, MSA's membership included 346 nonprofit institutions of higher education, including 106 public ones.  proprietary institutions were not eligible for accreditation or membership in the association.</P>
<P> The legal basis for the suit was the fact that although the lack of accreditation was damaging to the college, it was not eligible for accreditation because of its proprietary status.  Testimony at the trial brought out the fact that all regional accrediting associations excluded proprietary institutions.  In any case, the plaintiff college alleged that MSA had acquired monopoly power over regional accrediting in its area and that it was exercising this power in such a way as to prevent competition from proprietary institutions.  The relief sought was a decree declaring the exclusion of proprietary institutions to be illegal and an order that the plaintiff's application for accreditation be accepted and that the institution be accredited if it were otherwise qualified.  The case was heard by a judge without a jury in the District of Columbia.  The trial court upheld the claim of Marjorie Webster College virtually <I>in toto</I>.  On appeal to the federal circuit court of appeals, the decision was reversed, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the appellate court decision in December 1970.3 </P>
<P> The trial record takes up fourteen volumes, and any summary of it necessarily oversimplifies the issues.  Nevertheless, the major issues were of the utmost importance to our analysis.  Marjorie Webster College introduced a wealth of testimony to prove that nonprofit colleges competed for  students, faculty, donations, and research contracts.  The MSA just as vigorously asserted that its members did not compete with each other.  Indeed, in its defense it went to great lengths to show that the notion of competition in the business sense was utterly foreign to the field of higher education.  And in taking this position, it clearly had the support of the other regional accrediting associations, which represented most of the institutions of higher education and secondary schools, public and private, in the United States.</P>
<P> One of the reasons the case was so important was that it was viewed as a test case of the exclusion of for-profit institutions.  Public and nonprofit institutions were categorically opposed to allowing for-profit institutions to be evaluated on the same standards.  If an institution was for profit, it was not to be accredited, no matter what.  Its students, faculty, financial standing, program -- all might be outstanding, yet the institution could not hope to be considered for accreditation.  And this was true even though accreditation conferred certain legal rights on institutions, such as eligibility for federal aid of various kinds.  Literally, the national leadership of both public and nonprofit institutions and secondary schools asserted that competition did not, should not, and would not prevail in education if they had anything to say about it.  According to the MSA brief on its appeal to the federal appellate court:</P>
<P> In industry, free competition for a commercial market, motivated by desire for profit, is deemed to be the soundest method for assuring maximum production.  The forces which tend to produce the highest quality in education are entirely different from the forces which tend to produce the best automobiles or television sets.  In education, the highest achievements have been obtained by the cooperative search for improvements and mutual assistance between institutions . . . (&quot;. . . the policy unequivocally laid down by the [Sherman] Act is competition&quot;) . . . Given this goal of competition between contending economic units sought to be attained by the antitrust laws, it is clear that the entire regulatory scheme is wholly foreign to higher education..  This is so because the relationships among colleges is cooperative, not competitive . . . Thus to apply the Sherman Act in the instant case is to impose alien concepts on higher education . . . The Sherman Act's purpose is to <I>preserve</I> the competitive relationship between business entities.  The Act is not intended to <I>impose</I> competition as the fundamental relationship among institutions which never have before economically competed with each other.4 </P>
<P> There is widespread agreement that competition between institutions of higher education is much more prevalent than between institutions below the college level.  If colleges do not and should not compete, as the MSA contended, how could educational leaders view competition as appropriate below the college level?  Most emphatically, I do not agree with the argument or the legal result in the Marjorie Webster case.  My point in discussing it is to show that nonprofit as well as public school leaders are eager to avoid competition.  Of course, this attitude is not unusual, even in the competitive business sector.  Most businesses look at competition as they do taxes; they prefer to avoid it if they can.  If they cannot, they try to shape it to their advantage as much as possible.</P>
<P> Businesspeople welcome competition among their suppliers.  When it comes to the sale of their own products, they would prefer to be a monopoly.  Propriety requires that this preference not be expressed openly, so we are subjected to an immense amount of rhetoric praising competition from business leaders who work diligently at avoiding it if they can.  Thus educators who praise competition while trying to avoid it are no more and no less hypocritical than their counterparts in the business world.</P>
<P> Public school opponents of vouchers are opposed to vouchers for several reasons, including their desire to avoid competition.  Rightly or wrongly, however, the voucher opponents have assumed that competition would ensue under a voucher plan.  They could hardly object to voucher proposals both on grounds that competition is bad and that it would not exist.  Objecting to vouchers on the grounds that they would not generate competition implies that support would be forthcoming if vouchers did generate competition.  Of course, public school voucher opponents have no such thought.  Thus neither proponents nor opponents of vouchers have has any compelling reason to raise competition issues.  Ironically, interscholastic athletic competition is sacrosanct in most school districts.  A school board that suggested eliminating it would be quickly out of office.  At the same time, academic competition is not widely encouraged (in some districts it is fair to say it is discourage).  Analysis of these different attitudes toward competition would take us too far afield, but I believe they suggest that teacher attitudes toward competition are shaped largely by their own interests.</P>
<P> Teachers tend to be hostile to economic competition for several reasons.  First, the politics and culture of education are dominated by the redistribution of wealth, not the creation of it.  Of course, teachers assert (and believe) that larger appropriations for education are a productive social investment; this conclusion, however, merely illustrates Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto's observation that men find it easy to convert their interests into principles.  In the meantime, teacher organizations focus on a larger piece of the pie in legislatures and at bargaining tables.  To be sure, an emphasis on the redistribution of wealth is a widespread tendency in our society; some observers believe it is a pervasive characteristic of advanced industrial nations generally.5   Still, outside of public employees, most groups that focus on improving their economic status by redistributive measures cannot avoid some exposure to economic competition as participants.</P>
<P> Second, a substantial number of teachers have never competed economically.  Of course, when someone applies for a teaching position, he or she can be said to be &quot;competing&quot; with others seeking the position.  Likewise, when teachers applied for college admission, they were &quot;competing&quot; with others.</P>
<P> Nevertheless, most teachers have not been competitive in market situations.  That is, they have not achieved a larger share of a market by producing a better product or better service, or by producing products or services more efficiently.  As I am commenting on a group of several million, there are many exceptions and qualifications, but I believe that my basic contention is valid.  The kind of competition familiar to most teachers is the kind that exists everywhere.  Even in socialist economies there is competition to be admitted to college or to get a job one wishes.</P>
<P> As previously noted, reluctance to confront competition issues characterizes private as well as public school leaders.  Unquestionably, however, some private nonprofit schools, including denominational ones, do compete for students.  Nonprofit schools are beginning to conduct market research, to advertise, and to conduct a variety or promotional efforts to recruit students.6   We can expect these efforts to intensify, especially if the market for private education declines in the 1990s.  Regardless of whether voucher plans are enacted, however, it will be essential to clarify the rationale for the nonprofit status of private schools.  It may turn out that nonprofit status will depend on the nature of the clientele served or willingness to provide a certain amount of unpaid service; for example, I see no reason why schools catering to affluent parents, who are the first to assert their ability to choose schools wisely, should continue to enjoy nonprofit status.  Be that as it may, the notion that public school teachers should enjoy monopoly status for what they sell but the benefits of competition for what they buy will become increasingly difficult to sustain.</P>

<P> Controversies over vouchers typically focus on their educational consequences.  In addition, their effects on religious freedom, neighborhoods, parents, tax rates political parities, and racial harmony are widely debated.  Insofar as attention is paid to the effects of vouchers on private schools, it is usually thought that vouchers would help them financially.  In addition, private school leaders are deeply concerned by the possibility that vouchers would lead to increased regulation of private schools.  The possibility that vouchers could affect the educational role of nonprofit schools is seldom considered, but deserves some attention.</P>
<P> Hospital experience illustrates the problem.  Some hospitals were founded to serve the indigent or a particular religious or ethnic group; such hospitals were often funded mainly by donations.  With the advent of Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance, many of these hospitals came to depend more upon these sources of funding, less upon donations and payments by patients.  As this happened, the operation of nonprofit hospitals, including denominational ones, became increasingly dominated by a fee for service orientation, indistinguishable from commercial operations.  Such transformations are not unusual when nonprofits compete in competitive markets; their original purpose may become secondary or even disappear altogether.7 </P>
<P> Many institutions of higher education have followed this pattern.  Initially, they were established to train religious leaders.  Over time, financial exigencies led them to recruit other students and rely upon nondenominational sources of revenue.  Many became nonsectarian or were eventually incorporated into public systems of higher education.   The changes were not necessarily undesirable, but they underscore the possibility that a competitive milieu would lead to changes in the educational mission of nonprofit schools.  Clearly, if denominational schools compete for students on secular criteria, the latter may eventually take precedence over the denominational ones.  The structure and management of an organization devoted to denominational objectives differ from those engaged in competitive economic enterprise.  It is wishful thinking to assume that the two kinds of objectives can be reconciled in the same organization.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>7  Noneducational Arguments for Vouchers</B></FONT></A></H2>
<P> <B>W</B>e turn next to arguments for vouchers based on noneducational objectives.  Even in these cases, however, the educational consequences are very important.  Although the primary objectives of a voucher plan may lie outside the field of education, its educational effects are unavoidably an important consideration.  If, for example, by reducing educational achievement, policymakers would face a dilemma.  Obviously the dilemma would not exist if educational achievement was as high or higher under voucher plans as under conventional arrangements.  The following discussion, therefore, is not limited to the noneducational objectives of voucher proposals.  It also seeks to assess their educational impact.  This impact may or may not be similar to the educational impact of voucher plans consciously formulated to raise levels of educational achievement.</P>
<H3><A ID="I2" NAME="I2">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Religious Rationale for Vouchers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Perhaps the most important noneducational argument for vouchers is that they are essential to protect religious freedom.  The argument is based on the fact that education is compulsory in every state.  Because they cannot afford private schooling, many parents are forced to send their children to schools that violate their religious convictions.  A voucher system could avoid this outcome by making it possible for parents to enroll their children in schools of their choice.</P>
<P> The factual premises of the religious rationale are indisputable.  Historically, denominational schools have always existed in the United States; typically, they preceded public schools.  Prior to 1850 state and local assistance to denominational schools was commonplace.   The influx of Catholic immigrants in the latter half of the nineteenth century created a policy dilemma for political leaders, who were overwhelmingly Protestant.  State aid to religious schools now required aid to Catholic as well as Protestant schools.  Rather than accept this alternative, the dilemma was resolved by compulsory education laws.  By simultaneously denying aid to Catholic schools, it was anticipated that most Catholic children would be enrolled in public schools.  The latter were not viewed as &quot;nonreligious&quot;; on the contrary, they were permeated with a strong Protestant bias characterized publicly if ineptly as a &quot;nonsectarian&quot; approach to religion.2<P>This bias was most clearly reflected in the Bible-reading statutes.  during the nineteenth century Massachusetts was the only state that required Bible reading.  In the twentieth century, however, thirty-six states enacted statutes requiring or allowing public school teachers to read passages from the bible at certain times.   These statutes typically prohibited teachers from discussing the passages that were read.  For example, Pennsylvania law required that &quot;At least ten verses from the Holy Bible shall be read, without comment, at the opening of each public school on each school day.  Any child shall be excused from such Bible reading, or attending such Bible reading upon the written request of his parent or guardian.&quot;</P>
<P> In many states Catholic parents objected to Bible reading, and not simply because a Protestant instead of a Catholic edition of the Bible was used.  The statutes were consistent with Protestant theology that regards people as capable of interpreting the Bible correctly without intermediaries.  They were not consistent  with Catholic theology, which holds that the Catholic church is necessary to reveal and interpret the Word of God.</P>
<P> Feeble defenses aside, there was no question about the Protestant bias in the Bible-reading statutes.  Nevertheless, out of a total of twenty-five cases on the issue from 1854 to 1924, the protesters, most often Catholic, lost about three out of four cases.   This type of bias was reflected in other ways too numerous to be recounted here.  What were the aggrieved parents to do?  They could -- and sometimes did -- establish private schools, but such schools had to operate without public financial help.  Needless to say, for opponents of Bible reading to appeal for financial help to the very same legislatures that enacted the Bible-reading statutes was not a very promising way out of their  predicament.</P>
<P> The Bible-reading statues were held to be unconstitutional in 1963.   Today some of the Protestant denominations that were instrumental in enacting the statues are expanding their denominational schools as a response to the religious restrictions on  public schools.  Bible reading is only one of several factors in this situation, but it illustrates two important points.  First, whatever public schools do about religious issues, some group is likely to cite the action as a reason to establish private schools.  Second, although couched in constitutional terms, the religious rationale is based primarily on the alleged unfairness of compulsory education without financial support for those who object to public education on religious grounds.  </P>
<P> Although the religious argument per se has not changed much over the years, several facts pertinent to it have changed.  Programs of sex education and restrictions on Bible reading, school prayer, and the teaching of &quot;creation science: have led some Protestant fundamentalists to conclude that public schools are hostile, not merely neutral, to their religious beliefs.  This attitude is frequently expressed in charges that public schools are promoting &quot;secular humanism&quot;; the latter is said to be a nontheistic religion that emphasizes human instead of divine sources of moral authority.  In addition, many parents who think this way believe that public schools are too permissive in matters of drugs, alcohol, dress, language, and manners.  The result is that the number of Protestant fundamentalist schools increased rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s; their rate of increase outstripped every other denominational category.  Paradoxically, Christian fundamentalist school officials tend to be more hostile to government regulation than Catholic school leaders, who are more likely to recognize the legitimacy of state regulation of private schools. </P>
<P> The upsurge in Christian fundamentalist schools has occurred at a time when Catholic schools faced a number of difficult problems.  A sharp decline in the number of Catholics entering religious orders has been a major problem.  As the number of nuns and priests available to teach in Catholic schools has declined, the schools have been forced to employ a higher number of lay teachers.  This has led to greater financial strains on Catholic school budgets and increased interest in government assistance.  For our purposes, the important considerations are these:  First, there has been and still is some religious bias in public schools.  I make no effort to quantify the bias but simply accept the fact that from time to time and place to place, public school policies and practices violate good-faith religious convictions.</P>
<P> At the same time, it is equally clear that some critics of public schools will not be satisfied with genuine neutrality, whether it takes the form of objective pedagogical treatment or of avoidance of denominational issues entirely.  In other words, I see no immediate end of either justified or unjustified criticism of public schools on religious grounds.  Whatever the merits, conflicts over religious objections to public education are likely to continue into the foreseeable future.  We can, therefore, expect a religious base of support for family choice no matter what public schools do.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Family Choice and the Separation of Church and State</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> As most private schools are denominational, there has been opposition to most government efforts to aid them.  Such assistance would allegedly violate the First Amendment and several state constitutions that incorporate it.  The relevant portion of the amendment states that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the fee exercise thereof . . .&quot;  On its face, the language applies only to Congress; in 1940, however, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the First Amendment applies to the states as well as the federal government.   Although this was a momentous limitation on state action, it is not the crux of current controversy on First Amendment issues.  Such controversy emerges from conflicts between the establishment clause and the free exercise one.  This conflict is especially acute under compulsory education.  If parents who regard the public schools as antireligious cannot afford private education, compulsory education is an interference with the free exercise of religion.  If government provides vouchers which make such attendance possible, the vouchers may be deemed contrary to the establishment clause.  This dilemma lies at the heart of religious conflict over education vouchers.</P>
<P> In 1983, in the <I>Mueller</I> v. <I>Allen</I> case, the United States Supreme Court upheld a Minnesota law that provided tax deductions for educational expenses.   Legally, the deductions were available to parents of both public and private school children; as a practical matter, they were used overwhelmingly by denominational school parents.  Although the Supreme Court decision to uphold the law was by a five to four vote, it seems likely that educational vouchers available to all parents would also be upheld.  As was the case with the tax deduction, the benefits would (or could) be made available to parents; the assistance to denominational schools would be secondary.</P>
<P> Undoubtedly, church/state issues will continue to play an important role in voucher controversies.  In my view, however, the issues are fundamentally political ones, to be resolved in the political arena.  Of course, voucher legislation will have to run the gamut of legal challenge; judges will have to decide whether voucher legislation is or is not constitutional.  Nevertheless, the judges themselves will be designated through our political processes; the ultimate legal fate of voucher legislation thus depends primarily on the outcome of our political processes.</P>
<P> Since the<I> Lemon</I> v. <I>Kurtzman</I> decision in 1971, the Supreme Court has adopted a threefold test for deciding the constitutionality of legislation that allegedly violates freedom of religion, establishes a religion, or does both.  The legislation must:  (1) have a valid secular purpose; (2) not have the primary effect of advancing religion or interfering with the free exercise thereof; and (3) avoid excessive entanglement of religion and government. </P>
<P> Any one of the rationales for vouchers previously mentioned would satisfy the first criterion.  In view of the <I>Mueller</I> v. <I>Allen</I> decision, it is unlikely that voucher legislation would be held unconstitutional on the second criterion.  Indeed, if vouchers were successful in introducing competition among schools, some parents would transfer their children from denominational to nondenominational schools.  Obviously, if this happens, it would be more difficult to argue that the legislation had the primary effect of promoting religion.</P>
<P> The entanglement issue presents difficult legal as well as political problems for voucher legislation.  There is very little regulation of private schools now because most are denominational; most legislators are eager to avoid the political problems inherent in increased regulation of religious organizations.  If, however, voucher opponents cannot block vouchers directly, they will try to do so indirectly by demanding increased private school regulation.  The argument will be that eve though the vouchers are made available to parents, they are actually a subsidy to the schools that redeem them  Allegedly it will be necessary to regulate the schools that redeem vouchers in order to avoid huge expenditures of public funds without accountability for the results.</P>
<P> In short, voucher legislation must avoid interfering in religious affairs but also provide sufficient accountability for expenditures of public funds.  The question is whether the voucher legislation that eventually emerges from the political process will be able to emerge unscathed from the judicial process -- and whether what is required to survive the judicial process can be negotiated through the political process.  Inasmuch as we do not have the legislation at hand or know the composition of the Supreme Court that will resolve the issue, the constitutional outcome is uncertain.</P>
<P> The second major legal issue likely to affect the future of educational vouchers is the constitutional definition of &quot;religion.&quot;  The First Amendment prohibits government from establishing a religion or interfering with its free exercise.  What, however, is a &quot;religion&quot; or a &quot;religious belief&quot; from a constitutional point of view?  The Supreme Court has already held that a &quot;religious&quot; belief need not be based on belief in a Supreme Being or on belief in a supernatural realm; Confucianism illustrates the kind of nontheistic belief system that can neither be established nor prohibited by the First Amendment.0   The difficulty lies in distinguishing which nontheistic views are religious and which ones are not.</P>
<P> If the Supreme Court adopts an expansive definition of &quot;religion,&quot; the public school curricula will be correspondingly restricted; more of what public schools do will violates someone's religious beliefs or constitute establishment of religion.  An expansive definition will, therefore, lead to a more restricted public school curriculum and to more defections over the restrictions.  Ironically, a restrictive definition of religion could have the same result, albeit in a different way.  If &quot;religion&quot; is defined narrowly, the public schools will have greater legal freedom to teach subject matter that is contrary to the beliefs of some parents.  The latter may then defect, as some already have, to private schools.  In other words, no matter how &quot;religion&quot; is defined constitutionally, the definition is likely to lead to some defections from the public schools.</P>
<P> Overall, however, it is clear that both legal and popular opinion are becoming more receptive to public support for denominational schools.  First of all, it is indisputable that the First Amendment was not intended to proscribe nonsectarian aid to Christian, especially Protestant, religious organizations.  On the contrary, and disconcerting as it may be to strict separationists, a major purpose of the amendment was to prevent the federal government from interfering with state legislation that provided nonpreferential aid for religious activities.  The evidence for this is too overwhelming to be in serious question.1 </P>
<P> Proponents of such aid will also rely on the argument that any aid to private schools that excludes denominational schools constitutes unconstitutional discrimination against such schools.  It is impossible to predict the weight that will be accorded this argument, but it does command some support from constitutional scholars.</P>
<P> More important, the restrictions on aid to denominational schools are the exception, not the rule, in church/state relations generally in the United States.  As pointed out by Thomas Vitullo-Martin and Bruce Cooper:</P>
<P> The Court has permitted direct government contracts and grants to churches in the areas of higher education; medical institutions; care of the elderly, the poor, young children, orphans, the hungry, the homeless, the sick, addicts, the mentally impaired; food stations; prison release programs; job training programs; youth shelters; and even burial.  It has permitted the state to build churches (on government reservations); to donate to churches the land for their buildings (the land for St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City); and to pay the salaries of priests, pastors, rabbis, and other religious officials who serve as chaplains.  In short, the Court has approved state support of churches in virtually every aspect of their self-defined mission, except in their operation of elementary and secondary schools.  Even in the area of schooling, churches can receive public funds to operate preschool programs, after-school youth programs, post-secondary schools, and adult training programs.  In addition, the Court has approved the government's giving churches tax exemptions, which in effect means providing churches with free municipal and state services (by eliminating property taxes), and reducing the cost of supplies (by removing sales taxes).  Most Americans agree with these policies, which apply evenhandedly to all churches.  The Court-appointed policies in these areas could not pass the tests the Court has developed for school aid, and the Court itself has struggled to limit to schools alone the constitutional principles it has developed in the elementary school cases.2 </P>
<P> These inconsistencies might well be resolved by a more tolerant legal posture toward aid to denominational schools, especially if such aid results from direct assistance to parents or children.  Later in this chapter I shall try to show that there are strong public policy reasons for providing such assistance.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Educational Achievement in Public and Private Schools</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Attitudes toward vouchers are often dominated by perceptions about private schools.  Typically, voucher supporters believe that private schools are educationally more effective than public schools.  Thus vouchers are seen as a way to enable more students to take advantage of the superior education provided by private schools.</P>
<P> Needless to say, voucher opponents challenge the view that private schools are educationally superior.  Logically, the issue may be irrelevant since a voucher plan might affect either the advantages or the deficiencies of private schools -- or both.  Logic notwithstanding, perceptions of private school effectiveness play an extremely important political role in voucher controversies.  Apart from this, comparisons of public and private school effectiveness may contribute to our understanding of several voucher issues.  For these reasons, a brief consideration of school effectiveness is essential.</P>
<P> First we must recognize the problems inherent in such comparisons.  One is whether the services offered in public and private schools are close substitutes for each other, or whether they are essentially different services.</P>
<P> To illustrate the problem, consider a public school mathematics class of twenty-five students and a private school class of ten in the same subject.  Is the public school teacher providing the same service as his private school counterpart?  The private school may enroll students precisely because its classes are smaller and provide much greater teacher-pupil interaction.  In other words, parents may view the situation as one in which t<P>are buying different services from what they would get in public schools.  Similarly, if denominational instruction is important to parents, the latter are likely to view denominational schools as providing a different service instead of a close substitute.  There is no simple way to resolve the issue, and inconsistent treatments of it are commonplace.  The fact that the problem is not confined to education does not render it less important or easy to resolve.3 </P>
<P> Another pervasive problem results from the fact that it is prohibitively expensive to evaluate certain outcomes of schooling.  For example, consideration for the rights of others may be an important objective of both public and private schools, yet the cost of assessing performance on this criterion may be prohibitive.  Consequently, schools tend to be evaluated on the basis of criteria that ignore important but difficult-to-evaluate instructional objectives.  Student outcomes are a mix of what is or can be measured and what is not or cannot be.  Focus on only the measurable outcomes may lead to erroneous conclusions about school performance.  More important, it may also lead to undesirable allocations of school resources.  If, for example, schools are evaluated solely on the basis of academic achievement, school resources are less likely to be used for other important objectives.  Again, the problem is not confined to education; it arises in many fields.4 </P>
<P> Even when there is agreement on the dimensions to be evaluated, it can be extremely difficult to compare school performance with respect to them.  Perhaps the most difficult problem is how to distinguish the school effects from the nonschool factors that affect educational outcomes.  Obviously, if private schools enroll brighter students, or students who are more motivated to learn, or students who receive more parental support for learning, the students could show a higher level of achievement even though the private schools per se were not more effective than the public schools.  Unfortunately, several factors affect school achievement, and reasonable people can and do disagree on the weight to be accorded them.  In addition, there are difficult technical problems in assessing the factors.</P>
<P> We must also be aware of the dangers inherent in comparing vastly dissimilar private schools with vastly dissimilar public schools.  If we lump together a Catholic parish school, a nondenominational independent school, a a boarding school, our &quot;averages,&quot; whether of educational achievement, student characteristics, teacher salaries, or anything else, may be very unrealistic.  Furthermore, the school categories often include subcategories that raise the same issue.  For example, a boarding school may be simply a custodial institution for the children of parents who don't want to be bothered by child-raising problems.  In another case, the parents may be required to travel frequently, but they and the school may have the highest ideals and standards.  Thus even conclusions about private residential schools or parents or students in them may aggregate data that is very misleading when reduced to &quot;averages.&quot;  Needless to say, public school averages often raise the same problem.</P>
<P> To begin with, some studies do not support the conclusion that private schools are more effective educationally than public schools.  For example, one major comparison of public/private school effects was conducted under the auspices of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  The NAEP study involved 104,000 children ages nine, thirteen, and seventeen, in 1,377 schools.  The study concluded that &quot;when the data are adjusted to compensate for socio-economic differences in the composition of private and public school student populations, national differences cease to be statistically significant.&quot;5 </P>
<P> Conclusions more favorable to Catholic schools have been reached by James S. Coleman, a sociologist who is widely acknowledged to be the leading scholar on the effects of schooling.  In recent years Coleman has been the principal investigator in several studies that compare public to private school achievement.  These studies were characterized by extensive efforts to isolate the school effects from other factors that affect student achievement.  Coleman's major study relied on a sample of sophomores and senior among 58,278 U.S. high school students enrolled in 893 public schools, 84 Catholic schools, and 11 non-Catholic private schools.  Because of the small number of the latter and the wide variation among them, the study focused on the comparisons between public and Catholic schools.  The study itself was based on the results of standardized tests in reading comprehension, vocabulary, mathematics, science, civics, and writing.</P>
<P> High school sophomores were tested in all six areas; seniors were tested in the first three using some items identical to those in the sophomore tests.  Coleman first published his analysis in 1982; after considerable controversy over the research methods and reassessment of the data, in 1987 he asserted:</P>
<P>  At this point, it is sufficient to say that most critics have come to agree . . . that there is a positive Catholic sector effect on achievement in the areas of reading comprehension, vocabulary, mathematics, and writing, but not in science or civics.  The remaining disagreement about the Catholic sector effect appears largely to focus on the size of the effect.  With respect to the effect of other private schools, we agree with the critics' point . . . that no strong inferences could be made about achievement effects of this sector.6 </P>
<P> Although comparisons of public to Catholic schools necessarily omit several important issues, they are useful for at least three reasons.  In the first place, Catholic schools enroll almost 60 percent of all students enrolled in private schools.  Second, they enroll pupils from all socioeconomic classes; in this respect, their student population is more comparable to the public school population than to that of any other category of private schools.  Finally, insofar as the denominational aspect of Catholic schools is a relevant variable, most conclusions about them are likely to apply to other denominational schools as well.</P>
<P> In view of the political, economic, and educational stakes involved, it is not surprising that several major controversies have arisen over public/private school comparisons.  For example, Coleman concluded that students attending Catholic high schools averaged about one grade higher in reading and mathematics achievement than comparable students in public schools.  Critics have disputed this conclusion.  A recent critique emphasizes that most research on the effects of schooling deal with short-term effects that shrink or disappear completely in a longer time frame.  In reanalyzing the Coleman data, the critique asserts that no Catholic school superiority is shown in reading achievement and there is a small but distinct Catholic school inferiority in mathematics achievement.7  After reviewing Coleman's studies, another analyst concluded that &quot;the advantage of Catholic secondary schools in promoting cognitive development, if it exists at all, is so small as to be practically unimportant.  Certainly there is no convincing evidence that Catholic schools have an important advantage over public ones in this regard.&quot;8 </P>
<P> Richard J. Murnane, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, has formulated a similar conclusion, although he is not so categorical in rejecting &quot;the Catholic advantage.&quot;</P>
<P> While there is considerable disagreement about whether Catholic schools and other private schools are more effective on average than public schools, there is agreement that even the largest estimates of a private school advantage are small relative to the variation in quality among different public schools, among different Catholic schools, and among different non-Catholic private schools.  Consequently, in predicting the quality of a student's education, it is less important to know whether the student attended a public school or a private school than it is to know which school within a particular sector the student attended.9 </P>
<P> In other words, the critical issue is not necessarily whether there is &quot;a Catholic advantage.&quot;  It is whether any such advantage is large enough to justify public policies strengthening Catholic (and other denominational) schools on educational grounds.  The answer to this question depends partly on the reasons for &quot;the Catholic advantage&quot; and whether or how these reasons might be affected by policies that strengthen family choice.  Let us consider these issues briefly.</P>
<H3><A ID="I5" NAME="I5">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The &quot;Social Capital&quot; Hypothesis</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> To some extent, the resolution of policy issues may depend on the resolution of difficult technical issues.  For example, if the reasons for &quot;the Catholic advantage&quot; are such policies as insistence on homework on a regular basis, the policy implication might be to insist on homework in the public schools, not encourage transfers to private schools.  Actually, this underscores the inherent difficulty of isolating the school effects from the other factors affecting student achievement.  Requiring students to do homework may be due more to parent pressure on the school -- it may not be a school effect as much as a parent effect.  Also, the reason that public schools may not require homework may be the lack of parental support for it, or that more of their students have outside employment.  Thus regardless of whether there is a Catholic school advantage, or whether homework is a factor in it, it might be unrealistic to assume &quot;competition&quot; would improve matters in this regard.</P>
<P> Coleman's explanation of the Catholic advantage is worth noting.0   In his view, a number of basic social changes have eroded the influence of parents over their children.  In fact, intergenerational relationships, especially close personal ones, are declining generally in our society.  In previous generations, especially when the extended family was much more common, young people were more likely to interact with adults in the home, at the marketplace, and in the neighborhood and community activities.  Today, however, government is replacing the family as the provider of basic welfare services, such as education and safety net services.  As this happens, close personal relationships, especially intergenerational ones that fostered school achievement, have diminished.  School achievement depends on the interaction of school and non-school factors, such as family and community support for what schools are trying to achieve.  It appears that the family and community factors that are essential for high levels of school achievement have been weakened by the shift to government instead of family support for welfare services.</P>
<P> Coleman's point can be illustrated by the fact that about 80 percent of over 5 million single-parent households headed by females receive no financial support from the fathers; of those that do, a relatively small proportion receive a significant amount of support.  In fact, about one in eight children in single-parent households were conceived by women who were not living with the father at the time of conception.  In these cases, the fathers rarely contribute to child support.  Needless to say, such absentee fathers also do not help to reinforce positive attitudes toward school and work habits among their children.  Nevertheless, the declining role of families in raising children is by no means limited to any particular economic level or ethnic group.  In some ways the displacement of family functions by government programs is even more pervasive among middle- than among lower-income groups.  For example, government funding for higher education is increasing more rapidly than support from family sources.</P>
<P> In Coleman's view, therefore, our society is undergoing a major decline in &quot;social capital&quot; -- the family, neighborhood, and community relationships that formerly helped to develop positive attitudes, habits, and conceptions of self among youth.  Herein lies his explanation of the reasons for &quot;the Catholic advantage.&quot;  Religious institutions are the major nongovernmental institutions that foster constructive intergenerational relationships at the person-to-person level.  In Coleman's terms, they are a major source of the social capital that is essential to foster constructive attitudes and effective study and work habits.  Thus in his view students of comparable ability tend to learn more in Catholic schools because such schools (and their neighborhoods) are more likely to provide the social capital missing from the environment of many public school students.  This explanation seems especially persuasive in view of the fact that the Catholic advantage is most evident in inner city areas characterized by the most severe, deficiencies in social capital.</P>
<P> Dropout data also provide strong evidence that a decline in social capital is a major cause of educational deficiencies.  As the Coleman studies show, the dropout rates among Catholic students in Catholic schools are much lower than the dropout rates for Catholic students of comparable scholastic ability and socioeconomic status in public schools.  Furthermore, the dropout rate among students in other denominational schools is much closer to the rate in Catholic than in public schools; this is what would be expected if denominational schools provide more social capital than public schools.  Significantly, the dropout rates in private independent schools that do not draw their clientele from clearly defined communities or religious groups are much closer to the rates for comparable students in public than in denominational schools.1 </P>
<P> Obviously, it is difficult to isolate school from nonschool factors regarding the concept of social capital.  As Coleman would be the first to agree, it is extremely important to avoid selectivity bias in assessing school effects.  For example, we would not want to credit Catholic schools for a lower dropout rate resulting from the fact that its student were more likely to stay in school to begin with.  I shall not her review Coleman's procedures for avoiding such selectivity bias, but to me they appear adequate.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Similarities Between Public And Catholic Schools</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The similarities as well as the differences between Catholic and public schools have important implications for voucher plans.  As far back as the early 1960s, the U.S. Office of Education studies showed substantial similarities in the curricula of public and denominational schools.2   For several reasons, these similarities continue to exist.  Some states mandate that certain subjects be taught in both public and private schools.  State and regional accrediting associations to which both public and private schools belong also exert pressure toward similar curricula.</P>
<P> Another major factor is the tremendous mobility of the American people and its educational implications.  Approximately 17 percent of the American people move every year.  Inevitably, this leads to substantial interchange between public and private schools.  Inasmuch as the public schools enroll 90 percent of the students, they are not especially concerned about the articulation of public and private school curricula.  Private schools, however, must be.  Their concern is not primarily because children move in and out of their attendance areas but because the overwhelming majority of private schools do not teach grades 1 through 12.  Many are just high schools.  Consequently, there will often be transfers to and from public schools even among students who do not move.  The inevitability of such transfers exerts considerable pressure on private schools to adjust their curriculum to that of the public school.</P>
<P> The Coleman studies tried to estimate school differences in curricula.  For example, an effort was made to compare the semester hours of coursework taken by comparable students in public and private high schools.  Coleman concluded that even when nonschool factors were taken into account, students in Catholic schools completed more semesters of academic coursework in mathematics, English/literature, foreign languages, history/social studies, and science.  Nevertheless, as table 7.1 shows, the differences were not very large except in foreign languages.</P>

<P>SOURCE:  Reprinted, by permission of the publisher, from James S. Coleman and Thomas Hoffer, <I>Public and </I><I>Private High Schools:  the Impact of Communities</I> (New York:  Basic Books, 1985), p. 48.</P>
<P> The table applies only to students in academic programs; the differences in academic coursework taken among students in general and vocational programs were larger than those shown.  Regardless, a variety of factors suggests that public and Catholic school curricula are substantially similar.  Textbooks play an extremely important role in what students learn.  In many situations, the text books <I>are</I> the curriculum, despite pedagogical advice to avoid such a limitation.  In many fields, however, the public school textbooks are modified only slightly or not at all for use in private schools.  College admission requirements also encourage common curricula.  Students seeking admission are often required to have taken a certain number of units in specified courses, such as mathematics or English.  Practically speaking, such requirements force all schools to devote the same minimum amount of time to the subjects required for college admission.</P>
<P> Actually, the time devoted to religion was the major difference in public/private school curricula in the 1960-62 Office of Education study.  Because public high schools devote to such courses.  Voucher critics emphasize that the time devoted to courses in religion is time devoted to a private, not public, good.  Although even some voucher supporters accept this point, it is a weak objection to vouchers.  In most denominational schools, only a small proportion of school time is devoted to religious training per se; rather regular subjects are taught in a religious atmosphere.  For instance, the reading materials may be devoted to religious themes, or the room decor may evidence a religious orientation.  Such policies fulfill the school's religious mission while also approximating the public school allocation of instructional time.  Voucher opponents, however, have cited these practices to defeat government assistance to denominational schools.  Ironically, and despite their philosophical position, denominational schools use textbooks provided by the state, the textbooks do not include religious content.</P>
<P> Actually, courses devoted to religion often include subject matter acceptable to, or even taught in, public schools.  Nevertheless, even if this subject matter is not appropriate in a public school, it is hardly a persuasive reason to oppose denominational school participation in voucher plans.  Religion courses are as helpful as any others in fostering good work habits, respect for others, punctuality, patriotism, and a host of other objectives that public schools claim to foster.  The philosophical importance of a religious environment or religious content should not obscure the tremendous overlap between public and denominational schools on secular content and objectives.</P>
<P> Interestingly enough, the Coleman study indicates that among students enrolled in Catholic schools, the more religious students perform better on secular subjects than on those not as religiously oriented.3   This finding appears to support the social capital hypothesis; minimally, it suggests that school-based religious activities are not an obstacle to improvement on secular outcomes.  Paradoxically, it also suggests that the Catholic school advantage would decline as those schools enroll more non-Catholics or more Catholics not so committed to their religion.</P>
<P> Extracurricular activities often play an important role in fostering school climate and student attitudes toward school.  Significantly, the Coleman study indicated that the percentage of public and Catholic school students participating in extracurricular activities was substantially similar; in Coleman's words:  &quot;The comparability of the public and Catholic school participation rates suggest that these two types of school rely to a similar extent on the extracurriculum to integrate students.&quot;4 </P>
<P> Finally, it should be noted that school operations, especially where public and Catholic schools are in the same states and attendance areas, are also likely to foster similar curricula.  The closer they are geographically, the more public and private schools tend to operate with similar school calendars and teacher/student work days.  School bus schedules are similar, often even identical.  Family work and vacation schedules may also require similar school calendars to accommodate families with children in both public and private schools.</P>

<P> Although not subject to precise quantification, there are important similarities between teachers in public and nonprofit schools.  The training of teachers in both sectors differs more in quantity than in quality.  In some states teacher certification laws apply to teachers in both sectors.  Even where private school teachers are not legally required to be certified, private schools often insist on, or prefer, certified teachers because of accreditation or public relations reasons.  In 1981, 98 percent of public and 84 percent of private school teachers were certified to teach their major assignment by the state in which they were teaching.5   Furthermore, many teachers in both public and private schools are trained in the same institutions; even when the institutions tend to be different, the same textbooks are often used in all courses.</P>
<P> In addition, there is considerable overlap in the professional activities of teachers in both sectors.  They are active in the specialized organizations of teachers, such as the International Reading Association, National Science Teachers Association, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and so on.  Obviously, such common membership implies considerable overlap in professional publications read, conferences attended, and leadership in professional activities.</P>
<P> Finally, a substantial number of teachers in private schools eventually accept positions in public schools.  Although the number may not be very large in terms of the total public school complement, the transferees probably include a higher proportion of younger career-oriented teachers.  Private school teachers whose salaries are the second income probably do not place as much emphasis on the higher salaries in public schools.  There is also a smaller flow of teachers from public to private schools.  It would be helpful to know the teacher characteristics associated with these transfer patterns, but systematic data on the subject are not available.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Policy Implications of the Similarity and Social Capital Hypotheses</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> The suggestion that public and private schools may not be very different seems counterintuitive.  Why would parents pay if there are no significant differences?  Surely they are not all being misled by private schools.</P>
<P> They are not being misled, but this does not negate the point being made about the similarities between public and private schools.  First of all, to the extent that private schools are maintained for religious reasons, their performance on secular criteria becomes secondary if not irrelevant.  This does not mean that schools maintained under denominational auspices fail to achieve better educational results.  It means only that the latter outcome is fortuitous <I>in terms of the operative rationale.</I>  Paradoxically, &quot;denominational auspices&quot; may be regarded as a proxy for several secular factors that contribute to educational achievement.  Thus even if parents enroll their children in denominational schools for religious reasons, the school environment may be more conducive to secular educational achievement than the environment of public schools.</P>
<P> Even parents who send their children to private schools for secular educational reasons are not necessarily being misled if private schools offer no educational superiority.  Parents faced with a choice between an extremely poor public school or a much better private school may reasonably choose the latter option.  Such parents may be the first to agree that private schools in general are no better than most public schools.  In terms of our analysis, therefore, parents who send their children to private schools for secular reasons may be acting in a way that is completely consistent with the similarity hypothesis.</P>
<P> Whether or not nonprofit schools are more efficient than public schools, two important points must be emphasized.  One is that any private school superiority does not rest on any greater expertise or technical superiority over public schools.  The second is that nonprofit schools would lose some of their efficiency advantage under a voucher system.  Let me comment on these points, since they are critical in many ways.</P>
<P> As previously noted, even if per-pupil costs are much lower in private schools when all costs in both sectors are fully accounted for, the fact does not necessarily constitute a valid efficiency argument for vouchers.  If private school teachers were to receive higher salaries as a result of vouchers, as is virtually certain, the major efficiency advantage of their schools would be reduced correspondingly.  Of course, there would be efficiency gains as well as losses; for example, by paying higher salaries, private schools might be able to increase class size without impairing educational output.  In the short run, however, vouchers would probably result in decreased efficiency in private schools.6 </P>
<P> The similarities between public and private schools pose several difficult questions for the educational improvement rationale for vouchers.  According to this rationale, competition between public and private schools will lead to rapid and widespread adoption of better practices.  Will this interactive process actually happen?  The question inevitably raises another:  Has this process taken place in the past?  The answer seems to be a rather sweeping negative; at least I have not been able to identify any such improvements.</P>
<P> One can argue that the reason this has not happened is that public schools are, in effect, a monopoly and are under no pressure to adopt better practices.  Yet even if we ask only what innovations would be incorporated into public schools if they were not monopolies, the answer seems to be &quot;none.&quot;  One can hardly argue that insistence on regular homework or better discipline are private school &quot;innovations.&quot;  Furthermore, after generations in which private schools have educated tens of millions of pupils, it ought to be possible to identify some improvements that originated there and were incorporated into public education.  The absence of example along this line weakens the argument that competition from nonprofit schools under a voucher plan will lead to educational improvement.</P>
<P> The similarities between public and Catholic schools support two somewhat conflicting conclusions.  On the one hand, the similarities add credibility to the conclusion that the outcomes of public and Catholic schools are not very different, especially when the students being compared have adequate social capital.  Minimally, the similarities are consistent with the conclusion that the choice of public or Catholic school has little effect on the educational achievement of large groups of students.</P>
<P> In this connection, it is surprising how little attention is paid to the fact that private schools appear to achieve comparable results while paying their teachers substantially less than public school teachers.  This fact surely raises some questions about conventional approaches to school improvement.  For instance, why is there such an urgent need to raise all teacher salaries if private school teachers with lower salaries seem to be achieving comparable results?  Clearly, the Catholic advantage is not due to better teachers (at least insofar as higher salaries are a proxy for them).  And insofar as we can exclude other factors such as &quot;better teachers&quot; as the explanation for the Catholic advantage, we strengthen the case for greater social capital as the explanation.</P>
<P> Perhaps the most fundamental policy implication of the social capital concept is that the separation of church and state in the United States has been a disservice to education, especially of disadvantaged children.  Such separation has forced our society to avoid utilizing religious institutions to educate our youth.  Inasmuch as disadvantaged children are the ones who are most handicapped by the absence of social capital, government inability to provide education through denominational schools has been especially harmful to them7 </P>
<P> Whether anything can or should be done in this regard are matters to be discussed; obviously, separation issues involve several matters that have not been considered thus far.  At this point, however, let me say only that the issue is not whether to abandon the concept of separation of church and state.  It is whether the concept should be interpreted to allow more extensive use of denominational schools to carry out secular governmental objectives in education.  Inasmuch as government already utilizes religious organizations to deliver various noneducational services that are publicly funded, it is questionable whether any changes in the concept of separation are needed.</P>
<P> Unquestionably, there are strong political forces opposed to increased utilization of denominational schools to deliver publicly funded educational services.  Any changes along this line face an uphill struggle.  Although I regard such changes as both desirable and constitutional, their limitations should be recognized.  Increased utilization of denominational schools may help a significant number of student who lack social capital, but it cannot help most of them.  Furthermore, although improving the educational achievement of students from the underclass is very important, so is improving educational achievement among the vast majority of the student population.  In other fields, for-profit enterprise has been our major source of increased productivity.  For this reason, both denominational schools and schools for profit should be allowed to participate in voucher plans.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Political Rationale For Family Choice</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In <I>Capitalism and Freedom, </I>Milton Friedman argues that education vouchers are desirable as a means of reducing social conflict.  As he points out, education, like public policy generally in the United States, is often characterized by intense political, religious, economic, and cultural conflict.  Conflict over sex education, prayer in schools, and abortion rights illustrate such conflict.</P>
<P> When government provides a service like education, it tends to provide the same service for everyone.  Consequently, the only way <I>A</I> can get the kind of education <I>A</I> wants is to force <I>B</I> to have it also; unfortunately, <I>B</I> may be strongly opposed and prefer a kind of education to which <I>A</I> is strongly opposed.  Family choice is therefore viewed as a means of reducing social conflict.  If parents could afford the kind of education they want for their children, there would be much less incentive for them to impose their educational views on others.  Such imposition is unavoidable when government monopolizes educational services.  For this reason, it is better to have their disagreements resolved through the marketplace instead of the political process.</P>
<P> The political rationale is clearly an independent argument for vouchers.  One might reject all other arguments but still conclude that vouchers are needed to reduce political conflict over education.  Furthermore, the political rationale need not be based solely or even primarily on religious conflict.  Its existence might be an important element of the political rationale, but the latter is not necessarily dependent on any particular kind or source of educational conflict.  As a matter of fact, many citizens who are indifferent to religious issues have strong convictions about political, economic, or social issues that arise in schools.  Parents who have strong convictions about economic issues may not care one way or the other whether public schools have a moment of silent meditation or conduct Christmas pageants with Christian orientation or include &quot;creation science&quot; in the curriculum.</P>
<P> The political argument for vouchers is also based on a concept of equity.  All citizens are taxed to support education.  Arguably, it is unfair to subject parents to &quot;double taxation&quot; because they choose one type of school over another for reasons of conscience.  The alleged inequity gives rise to political conflict as those excluded from the benefits seek redress.  Presumably, a voucher system would eliminate this inequity and therefore this source of political conflict.  Of course, whether the remedy would lead to even more conflict is another matter.</P>
<P> The strongest arguments for the political rationale are:  (1) the existing system creates too much dissatisfaction and requires excessive allocation of resources to conflict management; and (2) it is frequently impossible to provide program integrity when educational programs are subject to the political process.  Let us see why these arguments do indeed have considerable merit.</P>
<P> The educational program of public schools represents a compromise among citizens with different points of view.  These compromises, although inevitable politically, may be indefensible educationally because they often apply to educational or technical issues that cannot be compromised without undermining all of the different positions on it.  Sex education can be cited as an example.  Some citizens don't want it in the schools.  Some want it under various restrictions and limitations.  Some want schools to advocate abstinence.  Some want schools to present virtually any sexual code as a student choice to make.  And so on.</P>
<P> Now, it may be that a program that vigorously and consistently emphasizes abstinence would be effective.  It may also be that a clinical program with explicit instruction in the use of contraceptives would be effective.  And it may also be that programs that are a compromise between the two are a waste of time and resources.  If, however, the issue is to be resolved politically, the third alternative is most likely to happen.</P>
<P> Problems of this kind emerge in every field.  A doctor may have to decide whether to operate immediately or delay the operation a few weeks in order to strengthen the patient.  A compromise, such as delaying the operation for only a few days, may lose the value of both alternatives.  In brief, interests are subject to compromise; technical solutions may or may not be.  The issue is whether a compromise destroys the technical integrity of a proposed policy or program.</P>
<P> This issue arose frequently in my experience as a labor negotiator for school boards.  One way or another, school boards and teacher unions agree eventually in the overwhelming majority of cases.  Any consistent approach will usually achieve an agreement.  What was most likely to fail, however, were compromises that eliminated the integrity of any approach.  Boards would adopt a &quot;hard line&quot; but take action that was inconsistent with it.  The result was that the board was not perceived as either &quot;tough&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; but as a body that could not be trusted from one day to the next.  </P>
<P> In any event, providing educational services through market instead of political processes would probably reduce social conflict over education.  A personal example may help to illustrate this important point.  In 1985 I visited a proprietary school in California.  Students were required to wear uniforms.  If parents refused, they had to enroll their children elsewhere.  </P>
<P> My point is not that uniforms are better than no uniforms.  It is that the structure of control enabled the school to adopt and implement a consistent policy.  Contrast this private school with a public school board trying to formulate a dress code.  Because the code is the result of a political process, it may lack any coherent rationale or consistent objective.</P>
<P> The OEO experiments discussed in chapter 4 also illustrate this point.  OEO might have conducted an experiment to see if contracting out could improve basic skills.  It might have conducted an experiment to see if the basic skills tested the value of teacher or student incentives to achieve certain goals.  Due to political factors, however, it was forced to compromise among these objectives.  As a result, what it did shed no light on any of them.  The technical integrity of the experiment was destroyed by the compromises reached.</P>
<P> For-profit schools are more likely than nonprofit schools to avoid such outcomes, because nonprofit schools are often subjected to political or quasi-political pressures similar to those in the public schools.  The principal of a denominational school is unlikely to enjoy the same degree of managerial discretion as the owners of for-profit schools.  Of course, compromises are made in the marketplace as well as in government; one difference is that parents would have more freedom to reject marketplace compromises.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Antidemocratic Schools</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Potentially at least, there is a political downside to vouchers that should not be ignored.  I refer here to the possibility (opponents would say &quot;probability&quot;) that vouchers would be used to fund extremist schools that foster antidemocratic views.  As the objection runs, it is bad enough that parents can establish such schools using their own money; to allow public funds  to be spent for them would be simply intolerable.</P>
<P> Clearly, there are extremist groups in our society:  the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups are examples.  Still, we are dealing with a system issue, and it is essential to avoid a double standard in comparing system outcomes.  It is, therefore, pertinent to ask whether the members of these groups received their education in public or private schools.  I have no data on the issue but seriously doubt whether a disproportionate number were educated in private schools.</P>
<P> Significantly, most extremist groups do not survive for long.  The notion that they could build schools, employ teachers, and transport their children to their schools implies a population base, a cohesiveness, and a durability that is doubtful, to say the least.  Even antidemocratic parents are presumably interested in their children's welfare; the belief that such parents will act solely out of ideology for long periods of time seems doubtful.</P>
<P> Efforts to establish extremist schools can be anticipated, and antivoucher groups will publicize these efforts.  In this connection efforts to use voucher systems to avoid racial integration are sometimes cited to show that vouchers will be used to achieve antidemocratic objectives.  Such efforts were made, but the outcome does not necessarily support an antivoucher position.  First and foremost, the efforts failed, which suggests that regulatory and judicial remedies can deal effectively with them.  Second, some public as well as private schools try to evade their constitutional obligations; the files of federal civil rights agencies and the U.S. Department of Education include thousands of cases of school district failure to respect their constitutional obligations.  (In fact, I served as an expert witness for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund in such cases in six states.)  As previously noted, private schools in the South were often racially integrated long before the public schools in their vicinity.</P>
<P> Most emphatically, I am not contending that antidemocratic school would never be a problem under a voucher system.  Instead, my point is that the problems will be manageable; the frequency and scale of their emergence is not likely to justify an antivoucher position.  On the other hand, schools conducted largely in a foreign language, especially Spanish, may become a serious problem.  Such schools may handicap students from full participation in our society.  Most ethnic/language groups are too small to avoid familiarity with English, but the Hispanic population is not.  States cannot prohibit private schools in which English is not the language of instruction, but they can decline to support them.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B> The Taxpayer Rationale</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Family choice is sometimes supported as a means of minimizing our tax burdens.  To illustrate, suppose that it requires $4,800 per child in tax revenues to educate students in public school.  Suppose also that a voucher worth $1,000 would induce large numbers of parents to transfer their children to private schools.  The taxpayer savings would be $3,800 per child, less the amounts paid to parents who enroll their children in private school even without vouchers.</P>
<P> The example ignores several critical issues, including some factors that might reduce the savings, but it is intended only to illustrate how vouchers might minimize taxes.  Obviously, the argument does not depend on any assumptions about religious freedom or social conflict or educational improvement.  Instead, it asserts only that government contributions to a private service provider may be ultimately less expensive (to government) than not contributing.  In the context of vouchers, efficiency issues are often confused with taxpayer ones.  The taxpayer interest is not:  Which schools are more efficient?  It is&quot;  Which schools will cost taxpayers the least?  Again, it must be emphasized that the questions are asked on the assumption that other things, such as the quality of service, are equal or do not favor the more expensive provider.  Significantly, the National Taxpayers Union (NTU), a national organization seeking to reduce the costs of government, has actively supported family choice in education.8   This support illustrates the point that the taxpayer rationale constitutes an independent argument for family choice.</P>
<P> Contrary to popular belief, the taxpayer rationale does not necessarily assume that private provision of education is more efficient than public education.  Conceptually at least, private schools might be less efficient than public school, but if the inefficiencies are subsidized from private instead of public funds, the taxpayer rationale would still be valid.  Nevertheless, efficiency and taxpayer issues are closely related.  The more efficient private schools are, the more likely it is that a voucher system would lead to taxpayer savings.  The less efficient the private schools are, the more they would need high tuition fees or donations to generate any taxpayer savings.  Thus we should not ignore efficiency comparisons even though they do not necessarily tell us whether a voucher system would result in taxpayer savings.</P>
<P> Not surprisingly, comparisons of public to private school efficiency are characterized by intense controversy over the facts and their policy implications.  The literature supporting vouchers sometimes asserts that per pupil costs in private schools are only about half the costs in public schools.9   This assertion is probably not true, even though the full costs of public education are systematically understated and not factored into the comparisons.</P>
<P> In education, efficiency is the relationship between resources used (inputs) and educational outcomes produced (outputs).  The common assumption is that private schools use fewer resources to produce the same or better outcomes than the public schools.  This is probably true, but cost statements for nonprofit schools frequently omit certain costs, such as for utilities that are paid from church funds.  Factoring in these cost might not affect the amounts saved by taxpayers under a voucher plan, but it would reduce the efficiency level of the nonprofit school.</P>
<P> This point is fundamental but widely overlooked.  Many school expenses paid separately from tuition by parents or by religious organizations in private schools are paid from public funds in public schools.  Consequently, the expenses do not show up on private school budgets.  When these budgets are compared to public school budgets, it can seem that private schools are more efficient than public ones.  Donated labor is another example of a resource that must be included to develop an adequate view of the efficiency of nonprofit schools.  It is virtually certain that such schools receive much more uncompensated labor than public schools.0   Such donations, which benefit taxpayers as well as the nonprofit schools, cannot be ignored in estimates of private school efficiency.  If individuals worked for wages that were donated to nonprofit schools, their contributions would be regarded as school revenues; likewise, so should contributions of time.</P>
<P> Furthermore, as mentioned, private schools enroll a much lower proportion of students who are difficult to educate and require higher than average per pupil costs.  These categories include disabled, retarded, and disruptive pupils as well as certain types of vocationally oriented pupils.  To this extent, lower per pupil costs in private schools cannot be attributed to their greater efficiency.  As shown by table 7.2, private schools receive some publicly funded educational services.</P>

<P>NOTE:  Because percentages are calculated on unfounded numbers, details may not add to totals.</P>
<P>SOURCE:  Reprinted, by permission, from <I>Publicly Funded Services to Private Elementary and Secondary Schools </I><I>and Students, 1983-84,</I> Center for Education Statistics, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education (November 1986), p. 3.  The data in this table were collected prior to the U.S. Supreme court decision in <I>Aguilar</I> v. <I>Felton</I> (1985), which severely limited the provision of publicly funded services in denominational schools.</P>
<P>The Department of Education estimates that in fiscal year 1981, $608 million in federal funds were spent for kindergarten through grade 12 private schools; in that year federal expenditures per pupil were $277 in public schools and $121 in private schools.1   Because these expenditures are not always reflected in the financial statements of private schools, their efficiency is correspondingly overestimated.  As a matter of fact, Dennis J. Encarnation of the Harvard Business School estimated that just over 26 percent of private school income is received from public funds.2   Whatever the correct percentage, it is ignored in the voucher controversy.  Supporters do not want to weaken the impression that private school parents pay the full cost of private education while sharing the costs of public education.  Voucher opponents do not want to reconcile their objections to vouchers with the acceptance of public funds for other costs of private schools.</P>
<P>Encarnation's estimate of private school income includes the value of &quot;taxpayer expenditures.&quot;  Such expenditures, which were approximately equal to the value of direct assistance, include property tax exemptions, tax deductibility for donations, exemptions from corporate and sales taxes, lower postal rates, exemption from minimum wage, bankruptcy and antitrust laws, and other forms of indirect assistance to nonprofit schools.</P>
<P>Whether &quot;taxpayer expenditures&quot; should be considered a government subsidy to nonprofit schools, and whether they should be viewed as reducing any taxpayer savings resulting from the existence of nonprofit schools, are highly controversial issues.  If taxpayer expenditures are factored into the costs of private schools, how does such inclusion affect the argument that nonprofit schools result in savings to taxpayers?  One study of this issue has led to some interesting conclusions.  A study by economist Marc Bendick, Jr., indicated that when taxpayer expenditures are taken into account, the differences between per pupil costs in the public and nonprofit sectors decrease dramatically.3   Although this study necessarily relied on data that was far from precise, clearly the taxpayer rationale for nonprofit schools is much more complicated than its proponents assume.</P>
<P>Thus far, I have discussed the ways that financial and record keeping procedures may lead to erroneous comparisons of public to private school efficiency.  Let me turn next to some factors affecting their actual efficiency, not the accuracy or completeness of our data on the issue.  first, if we focus on the resources actually used, the efficiency advantage of private schools may be substantially reduced.  Their main advantage clearly lies in the fact that their teacher salaries and benefits average about one-third less than in public schools.  It is unlikely that the resources used but not counted by private schools offset the savings from their lower levels of compensation.  Bendick's study of the issue concluded that &quot;the more comprehensive the accounting revenues, the more similar are the patterns of financial support among the sectors.&quot;4   As a matter of fact, although his analysis indicated that denominational schools had lower costs per-pupil than public schools, the per-pupil costs in nondenominational private schools (where class size is lower than in public schools) were much higher than in public schools.</P>
<P>A main reason why nonprofit schools are less efficient than public schools is their lack of either economic or political accountability.  that is, nonprofit schools, like most nonprofit organizations, are less subject than for-profit organizations to the discipline of the market.  At the same time, nonprofit organizations are not subject to whatever discipline is imposed through our political system.  To the extent that they operate without market or political accountability, nonprofit schools may be able to operate inefficiently without corrective action.</P>
<P>Merely to suggest that many private schools may be less efficient than public schools may seem absurd, especially to those associated with the former.  It does not, however, seem absurd to those who have studied efficiency in the nonprofit sector.  On the contrary, several researchers have concluded that nonprofit organizations are usually less efficient than either government or for-profit service providers.5 </P>
<P>Generally speaking, private schools do not rely upon donations for most of their income.  Although some denominational schools are heavily subsidized by their denominational sponsors, tuition fees are the largest source of income for denominational as well as independent private schools.  Insofar as nonprofit schools rely on tuition and fee instead of donations, they are more likely to be efficient, but there are also countervailing factors.  Most private schools are denominational schools and are not concerned about competition in the area of denominational instruction.  To the extent that parents rely on denominational criteria for choosing schools, the denominational rather than the public schools constitute the monopoly.  Thus the undesirable effects of monopoly can characterize nonprofit as well as public schools.  Furthermore since management of nonprofit schools is legally constrained from receiving profits, it may have less incentive to identify inefficiencies but more incentive to tolerate management perquisites.  These countervailing factors should not be dismissed, regardless of whether they characterize existing nonprofit schools.</P>
<P>The efficiency advantages of private schools are primarily their lower costs for faculty and support staff, their ability to use resources more effectively because their student bodies tend to be more homogeneous, and their freedom from regulatory costs.  The largest savings are the lower teacher costs in private schools; as a rough estimate, teacher salaries and fringe benefits in private schools probably average about 25 percent less than such costs in public schools.  This estimate is somewhat lower than most, but takes into account the fact that about one in four private school teachers receives some in-kind income.  Housing, meals, and tuition allowances for family members are the major components, which probably total over $3,000 a year for teachers receiving them.  A much smaller proportion of public school teachers, located mainly in isolated areas, receives a significant amount of in-kind income.</P>
<P>Aside from neglect of in-kind income, the salary differentials typically overlook certain facts which reduce the significance if not the differentials themselves.  In 1985-86, private school teachers averaged four years less teaching experience than public school teachers.  In addition, private school teachers had less training and were less likely to have received advanced degrees (master's or doctoral degree).6   In other words, even if the private school teachers were placed on public school salary schedules, they would be earning less on the average than the current complement of public school teachers.  To put it another way, the group comparisons overstate the differences between what a given teacher would earn in public as compared to private school employment.</P>
<P>Actually, school efficiency comparisons are characterized by several unanswered questions that raise serious doubts about the validity or usefulness of the results.  For example, religious instruction is not one of the services provided by public schools.  The latter, however, often provide services not often available in private schools:  counseling, vocational, and special education services.  Thus the extent to which differences in costs reflect differences in the services or in efficiency, or both, must be considered.</P>
<P>To cite just one additional example, locational issues are subject to different interpretations.  Because of its location, a private school may pay very little for security services.  A public school in an inner city ghetto may have to pay a great deal for such services.  Does the latter payment reflect a difference in efficiency?  After all, if the public and private schools reversed their locations, their expenditure patterns for security might also be reversed.</P>
<P>Dozens of issues like these render valid comparisons very difficult to make.  Nevertheless, such comparisons are often cited to justify policies relating to private schools.  Because so many subjective judgments are involved, Daniel J. Sullivan, a leading analyst on the subject, has concluded that the comparisons merely spread confusion about an issue that cannot be resolved objectively.7   Sullivan goes on to suggest that more attention be devoted to delineating the unique roles of each sector, rather than to the futile task of comparing their efficiency.  Whatever the merits of the suggestion, it raises a question about competition between the sectors.  If each sector performs a unique role, are they truly competitive?</P>
<P>Whatever the answer, the taxpayer rationale may overlook two factors that would reduce anticipated tax savings form vouchers.  First, if vouchers are enacted, parents will have to pay more than they do now to enroll their children in private school.  If private school costs to parents are raised by all or most of the amount of the voucher, there would be little or no savings to parents and few if any voucher-generated transfers to private schools.  Instead, there would only be a taxpayer loss resulting from the subsidies to children already enrolled in private schools - - or who will enroll in the future, regardless of voucher availability.</P>
<P>The second neglected point relates to the political dynamics of appropriations for education.  In the absence of vouchers, parents of children in private schools lack strong economic incentives to support spending for education.  These parents are not merely a cross-section of parents generally; they include a disproportionate number of politically active citizens.  A voucher system would provide these parents with economic incentives to support instead of oppose increased spending for education.  In short, if the private school lobby were to join forces with their public school counterparts, the taxpayer rationale might well sink in a sea of red ink.  Indeed, these groups might embrace each other as allies in the near future even in the absence of a voucher plan.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Civil Liberties Rationale for Vouchers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Vouchers are also justified as a protection of civil rights.  Although this rationale overlaps with the religious one, they differ in significant ways.  Clint Bolick, an attorney active in civil rights litigation, has recently stated the civil liberties rationale as follows:</P>
<P>. . . In modern society, the pursuit of education is critically important in exercising fundamental rights.  Thus, any arbitrary interference with the pursuit of education constitutes a deprivation of civil rights.  Moreover, as the Supreme Court observed in <I>Brown</I> v. <I>Board of Education,</I> the principle of equality under the law requires that education, &quot;where the state has undertaken to provide it, . . . must be available to all on equal terms.&quot;</P>
<P> The denial of educational liberty stands as one of the most flagrant and crippling violations of civil rights today.  The principal source of this deprivation is the monopoly public school system, which limits opportunities for alternative types of education on the one hand while allocating benefits unequally on the other.8 </P>
<P> In Bolick's view, &quot;civil rights&quot; means essentially three things:  fundamental rights, individualism, and equal opportunity under the law.  Fundamental rights include freedom to pursue economic opportunities not hindered by unjustifiable government obstacles.  In some cases, however, government actions have weakened instead of strengthened equality of opportunity, especially in the economic realm.  Licensing laws illustrate this point.  Although racially neutral on their face, they often have highly disparate effects on minorities and the disadvantaged.</P>
<P> An example cited by Bolick illustrates this point.  In 1982 licensing requirements to drive a taxi in the District of Columbia were minimal.  As a result, Washington had twelve cabs per one thousand people, and almost two thousand blacks owned taxis.  In Philadelphia, where the licensing requirements were much more expensive, there were only three cabs per thousand people, and only fourteen owners were black.</P>
<P> Bolick concedes that education is not a fundamental right, like freedom of speech.  Nevertheless, because of its importance to the economic welfare of individuals, arbitrary interference with the right to freely choose an education should be viewed as a violation of an individual's civil rights.  His contention is that a voucher system would not have this result, so vouchers should be considered a civil rights issue.</P>
<P> Because this rationale for vouchers has been articulated only recently, it has not as yet been subjected to widespread analysis and criticism.  It appears, however, that the rationale faces several empirical and constitutional problems.  For example, plaintiffs alleging that our system of public education violated their civil rights would have to show they are damaged by the public school monopoly.  It would be extremely difficult to show that the plaintiffs would be better off if they could attend a private school.  The argument would be that although government need not support education at all, its support must be made available in ways that do not unreasonably limit parental choice education.  This is a minority position in legal circles at this time.  In the short run at least, the civil rights rationale is unlikely to have nay legal impact on voucher controversies.  It does have some political appeal, but it is not clear whether the appeal will lead to policy changes.

<P> <B>V</B>oucher controversies constitute an unprecedented philosophical turnabout on equality issues.  By and large, vouchers are supported most strongly by &quot;conservatives.&quot;  The opposition to vouchers is centered largely among &quot;liberals&quot;:  the teacher unions, the American Civil Liberties Union, the liberal religious denominations such as reform Judaism and Unitarians, and various public interest groups typically supporting liberal positions, such as People for the American Way.</P>
<P> This widespread conservative-liberal split is a reversal of the roles these groups usually play on equality issues.  For decades liberals and conservatives have clashed over a wide variety of government programs.  In general, the liberal position has been that <I>A</I> and <I> B</I> are &quot;equal&quot; when both have the same power to do something.  Thus <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> are equal with respect to educational opportunity if both can afford to attend the same college.  They are equal with respect to health care if both have the funds to get the medical services they need.  And so on.  On the other hand, conservatives have been more apt to define equality in terms of legal rights.  In the typical conservative outlook, the government's role is to ensure legal but not economic equality.</P>
<P> The liberal emphasis on the &quot;power to do&quot; has led inevitably to support for government programs that provide that power.  In education, for example, the more government provides, the less individual students and parents must provide from their own resources.  If government expands facilities for higher education and absorbs most of the operating cost xrom general revenues, it can keep student charges to a minimum.  This is thought to be more conducive to equality of educational opportunity than charging students higher fees for their higher education.</P>
<P> In the voucher controversy, however, it is the conservatives who have adopted the idea that equality must be viewed as equal power, not merely as an equal legal right, to take an action.  Conservative support for vouchers has repeatedly emphasized the goal of providing the poor with the effective choice now available only to the more affluent.  Meanwhile, the liberals have ignored their traditional approach to equality as the equal power to do something.</P>
<P> This role reversal does not tell us anything about the merits of the controversy.  No matter what the service, there are practical limits to how far government can and should got to equalize access to it.  Each step toward equality as the power to do requires additional resources; additional resources require additional taxes, and at some point, the additional tax burdens are questionable substantively and/or politically disadvantageous.</P>
<P> The liberal/conservative role reversal on vouchers illustrates how interests dominate the discussion of voucher issues.  The contention that vouchers would result in the destruction of public education also illustrates this point.  It is contended that public schools have been an important means of fostering social and racial integration, and of economic and social mobility, especially for the disadvantaged.  Essentially, this idea is based on the assumption that under a voucher system, public schools would end up with the disadvantaged minorities, disabled, disruptive, and/or otherwise difficult or expensive-to-educate students.  Thus public education would lose its middle-class support, while private schools would be the beneficiaries of it; public schools would become the &quot;dumping ground&quot; of our educational system.  Public schools would continue to exist, but their role as a means of upward mobility and social and racial integration would disappear.</P>
<P> The destruction of public education argument is, to put it mildly, not very persuasive.  Essentially, it implies that the means are more important than the ends.  If by any chance the dire prediction came true, the destruction would probably be deserved or self-inflicted or both.  That would seem to be a reasonable conclusion in view of our tremendous exposure to public education as students, parents, and taxpayers, its enormous public revenues, and its interest group support.</P>
<P> The apocalyptic assessment of vouchers is based on the validity of several dubious assumptions.  For instance, it assumes that public education will be helpless to do anything about the reasons why parents enroll their children in private schools.  It assumes that parents in affluent suburbs with prestigious public schools will have as much incentive to transfer as beleaguered inner city parents.  It assumes that private schools will maintain their real or alleged advantages even if and when such schools enroll many more students that they do now.  It assumes that private schools will expeditiously solve the host of financial, legal, personnel, management, and regulatory problems that are likely to emerge from voucher legislation.  Minimally, all of these assumptions are doubtful.  Reliance on them illustrates the fact that both voucher supporters and opponents find it advantageous to exaggerate the effects of voucher plans.  The difference is that proponents exaggerate to generate support while opponents do so to generate opposition to vouchers.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Changing Patterns of Consumption</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Education is a service industry; as such, it is not immune to changes affecting consumption patterns in our economy as a whole.  Some of these changes are virtually certain to strengthen the voucher movement.  Let us see why this is so.</P>
<P> Generally speaking, our economy is moving toward increased differentiation of products and services.  The automobile industry illustrates this point for products.  It is very unlikely that a single automobile will dominate the market, as the Model T did generations ago.  The same trend is evident in services; for example, travel services were formerly a simple matter of how to assist <I>X</I> to travel from <I>A</I> to <I>B</I>.  Today travel services include hotel reservations, car rentals, medical data, dining guides, special events, sightseeing information, traveler's checks, mail forwarding, and specialized insurance protections.  The changes include both new services and the coordination of existing services.</P>
<P> Increasing differentiation and proliferation of services is directly tied to changes in income levels.  As income levels rise, consumer decisions are more oriented to specialized and what might be called lifestyle activities.  That is, consumption shifts from basic needs for food and shelter to goods and services that fulfill more personal needs.</P>
<P> If average incomes are low and meeting basic needs dominates the economy, there is relatively little demand for services geared to individual needs and tastes.  The U.S. economy has passed through this stage of development; now its economy is oriented largely to products and services designed to fulfill personal needs and lifestyles.  The emergence of two income households, with or without school-age children, has accelerated this development.</P>
<P> This change in the pattern of consumer demand does not occur at the same pace in every industry.  It is safe to say that it lags somewhat in education, even taking into account the huge for-profit educational sector that caters to school-age children.  We can reasonably assume, however, that the increase in demands for specialized educational services outside of regular school will eventually be reflected in consumer attitudes toward schools per se.  If this occurs, it will herald a strong shift to voucher plans; it is very unlikely that public schools can respond as effectively as private schools to this shift in patterns of consumption.  In view of the expansion of choice in religion, politics, marriage, higher education, occupation, spouse, residence, and lifestyle, in addition to the enormous increase in choice of products and services, the absence of educational choice below the college level may be simply an anachronism.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Choice Within Public Schools</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Feminists regard themselves as &quot;pro-choice.&quot;  Opponents of abortion characterize their position as &quot;anti-abortion&quot; -- significantly, not &quot;anti-choice.&quot;  Similarly, parental choice in education is politically difficult to oppose.  In fact, the public education lobby does not oppose it; instead it supports choice, on the condition that it be exercised within the public school system.  Choice within public schools is also receiving widespread political support; for example, President Bush, the National Governors Association, and the President's Commission on Privatization have characterized it as a promising reform initiative.  As of June 1988, choice legislation has been enacted or introduced in thirteen states, and the number has undoubtedly increased since then. </P>
<P> Minnesota has enacted the most extensive legislation on choice within the public schools.  Under a statute enacted in 1988, students in public schools will have the right to transfer to another district in the 1990-91 school year.   The district of residence cannot prohibit the transfers; the district of choice can refuse to accept students only if they exceed class, grade level, or building capacity.  Districts are prohibited from rejecting students on grounds of previous academic record, handicapping conditions, lack of English proficiency, previous disciplinary record, or for athletic or extra-curricular reasons.</P>
<P> The state school board and school administrator organizations as well as the state teacher unions opposed the legislation.  Reasons given include the fact that students could transfer every year; if a substantial number do so, districts would be unable to operate effectively.  Also, no educational reason is required; if students want to transfer for social reasons, they can do so.  It will be interesting to see what happens when the plan is implemented.</P>
<P> The supporters of choice within the public school system emphasized that &quot;choice&quot; need not be viewed as choice of district or of school.  On the contrary, there can be choice of program, course, activity, schedule, and/or teacher.  It is, therefore, quite common for public school leaders to assert that choice already exists or can be provided in public schools.</P>
<P> Unquestionably, this position has often be adopted in order to forestall family choice legislation.  Regardless of motivation, however, the substantive issue remains:  Can choices within the public schools achieve the benefits and avoid the drawbacks of a system that allows parents to choose private schools?  In some respects at least, they clearly cannot.  One reason is that the restriction to public schools necessarily excludes some choices that would be uppermost in parents' minds.  For example, no matter what choices are available in public schools, they cannot include religious instruction, yet that might be why parents want a choice of school.</P>
<P> &quot;Choice with public schools&quot; encompasses a variety of widely disparate policies.  Conceptually and practically, some students may choose to attend school offering little or no choice of program.  Others may not be able to choose their school, but may have a wide range of choices within the schools they are required to attend.  To treat these and other versions of choice within public schools as example of the same policy can (and does) lead to widespread confusion.  For example, choice of school district has significant financial implications that do not arise in choice of program within the same school; the latter does not affect state aid to the school district.  Students' willingness to exercise choice is another illustration.  Choosing a different school or school district may involve differences in travel time and costs that are not present in choices within schools.  As is the case with voucher proposals, there is a danger of identifying the concept with specific arrangements that can be drastically modified.</P>
<P> Unquestionably, there is a great deal of choice within public schools, especially in comprehensive secondary schools.  Students typically can choose from a wide range of programs, subjects, and activities; often they can choose their teachers, at least within the limits of class size and room capacity.  It appears doubtful, however, that such choices play a significant role in improving educational achievement.  On the contrary, there is significant evidence that many students choose the least demanding and ultimately the least helpful subjects simply to get through school with as little hassle as possible.  For these students, &quot;choice&quot; is a way to avoid the personal requirements of effective schooling. </P>
<P> In short, &quot;choice&quot; per se is hardly more than a slogan.  To understand its actual consequences, we must consider what the choices are, who can choose, the conditions and limitations of choice, and the effects of choice on other parties, including the nonchoosers.  Viewed from such a brad perspective, choice within public schools offers at best only marginal opportunities for increasing educational achievement.  This is not to argue for no choice within public schools or to question the wisdom of expanding choices in specific schools.  Instead it is simply to say that expanding choice within public schools does not appear to be a promising route to educational reform.</P>
<P> To understand the reasons for this negative assessment, it is essential to recognize that choice within public schools means choices set by the producers, not the consumers.  It is as if you could buy any automobile you wished -- as long as it was sold by the state-operated automobile manufacturer.  To say the least, bureaucratic decisions are a less accurate guide than market decisions to consumer preferences.  Moreover, choice of public schools inherently involves constraints that limit its usefulness to parents.  If parents prefer public school <I>A</I> over public school <I>B</I>, there is no necessary implication that <I>B</I>'s teachers are incompetent; the choice may be based on programmatic or other reasons unrelated to teacher competence.</P>
<P> Thus a question arises:  What to do with the teachers in school <I>B</I>?  These teachers cannot be fired for incompetence merely because all the parents prefer the teachers in school <I>A</I>.  For this reason, the choices within public schools will necessarily be severely limited to what is possible using existing staff.  (New hires made possible by attrition are not likely to ease this limitation significantly.)</P>
<P> School capacity raises the same issue.  Suppose schools <I>A </I>and <I>B</I> are excellent building operating at capacity, but all students in both schools prefer <I>A</I> to <I>B</I>.  The school district is not likely to build an addition to <I>A</I>, or run double sessions at <I>A</I>, while school <I>B</I> is empty.  Instead, choices will be limited by the capacity of existing buildings; in a voucher system, the expansion of preferred schools would not be limited by the need to utilize the less preferred schools.</P>
<P> As imposing as they are, the foregoing limitations on parental choice within public schools are probably not the most restrictive factors.  About 80 percent of the nation's teachers are employed pursuant to collective bargaining contracts.  Typically, these contracts limit school district flexibility in teacher transfers, hours of employment, assignments, and/or class size; the larger the district, the more likely this will be the case.  If the contract says that teachers may not be assigned more than thirty pupils, it indirectly but effectively limits parental choice of teachers.  As a matter of fact, many contracts require school districts to equalize class size or at least make a good faith effort to do so.  Class size provisions are only one way that teacher union contracts would limit choice within a public school system; in most cases several contractual provisions would limit choice of school or teacher.  Furthermore, it would be highly unrealistic to anticipate contract changes that would allow greater parental choice of school or teachers.  such changes would require years of intensive negotiations in which the teacher unions would have several strategic advantages.  The unions would represent an entrenched permanent constituency that knows what it doesn't want.  In contrast, the supporters of choice are likely to be a highly diffuse group without any strong incentives to achieve their objectives.  These parents who feel strongly about choice are more likely to enroll their children in private schools than to invest their time and energies in what is likely to be an unsuccessful effort to achieve it in public schools.  Also, many parents probably will be concerned about retaliation if they publicly oppose teachers on this issue.  In my own experience, I have met many parents who were strongly opposed to teacher strikes or teacher positions in bargaining, but who refused to express themselves publicly because (rightly or wrongly) they feared teacher retaliation if they did so.</P>
<P> The weakness of choice with public schools is especially evident when problems of scale are considered.  Currently, some of the largest school districts operate specialized high schools.  For example, the New York City school system operates the Bronx High School of Science, the High School of Music and Art, and several other specialized academic and vocational high schools.  It is practically impossible for the overwhelming majority of school districts to do so; although many of their student might wish to attend specialized schools, the number of such students in most districts is insufficient to establish them.  On the other hand, a voucher system could overcome this problem because specialized private schools could enroll students from several districts.  &quot;Choice within public schools&quot; really has no solution to this problem, even though school districts occasionally operate specialized schools that enroll students from other districts.  The vast majority of such schools serve disabled students; the schools are not a response to parental choice but to school district efforts to avoid excessive costs for facilities serving a small number of students.  In these situation, however, parents from the sending districts cannot withdraw their children or vote in a school board election in the receiving district.</P>
<P> Let me cite one additional reason why choice solely within public schools is not likely to be effective.  The rationale for choice assumes that the service providers will have strong incentives to respond to parental wishes.  For the reasons just outlined, these incentives become highly attenuated - - if they do not disappear altogether - - when choice is limited to public schools.  Public schools that can keep their market share regardless of parent preferences are not likely to change very much.</P>
<P> These drawbacks to choice within public schools are not merely speculation.  The Office of Economic Opportunity tried to conduct an experiment with educational vouchers in the early 1970s.  The experiment, conducted in the Alum Rock, California, school district, provided choice only in public schools and then only insofar as school facilities would permit.  In addition, teachers were protected against any loss of employment or compensation as a result of parental choices.  Even under these and other crippling limitations, the results were not clearly negative as far as vouchers were concerned.  On the other hand, they were not dramatically favorable either, so they did not lead to increased support for vouchers.   Ironically, public school leaders currently urging support for choice solely within public schools conveniently overlook this experiment, which supposedly demonstrated that such choice would not lead to educational improvement.</P>
<P> Paradoxically, the prospects for choice within the public schools may depend partly on private school reactions to the idea.  For the most part, state organizations of teachers, school administrators, and school board members oppose choice legislation, even when choice is restricted to public schools.  These organizations do not necessarily fight such legislation to the bitter end, but they are not enthusiastic supporters of it.</P>
<P> At the same time, such legislation presents a dilemma for private school leaders.  Their rhetoric supports choice, but choice only within public schools is disadvantageous to private schools.  Such choice provides parents with options that cannot help and may even be disadvantageous to private schools.  In the absence of the legislation, parents seeking certain course or programs might find them available only in private schools.  By making it possible for students to enroll in such courses in other public school districts, the legislation weakens private school attractiveness.  Indeed, some of the leading proponents of choice within public schools have explicitly cited this as a reason for their position. </P>
<P> Generally speaking, the private schools have some influence in the state legislatures.  consequently, choice legislation limited to public schools presents a dilemma for at least some proponents and opponents of choice.  The private school proponents may be faced with a plan that strengthens choice, but in part to their disadvantage.  At the same time, the public school opponents of choice legislation must now decide whether to join the private school opposition to it or support the legislation as a way of avoiding policies that would facilitate choice of private schools.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Choice Within Public Schools:  Tactic or Policy?</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Measures to provide choice within public schools receive widespread publicity and may be widely enacted.  The ostensible purpose of these measures is to foster greater flexibility and responsiveness to consumer preferences.  Other things being equal, however, this objective would be far better served by resort to the private sector; the record of private sector superiority on this criterion is persuasive, to say the least.  At bottom, choice within public schools is an effort to incorporate the features of a market system in government provision of service.  Unfortunately, such efforts usually fail, no matter what service or country is involved.</P>
<P> The naivet&#233; of these efforts should also give us pause; for example, a recent study supportive of choice within public schools asserts that it is &quot;based largely on a free market concept&quot; and &quot;stems from the fee market ideology of Adam Smith developed over 200 years ago.&quot;   I suspect that Adam Smith would be startled to read that choices offered by a public sector monopoly illustrates his &quot;free market ideology.&quot;</P>
<P> As we have seen, voucher critics contend that vouchers providing schools of choice would lead to ethnic, religious, economic, and social class isolation and stratification.  Wouldn't choice within public schools have the same effects?  It would unless choices are different, which is clearly the case.  This undermines the idea that choice in public schools can replace choice of public or private school.  Regardless, educational literature is replete with references to the public school problems of tracking, that is, to problems resulting from students choosing or being assigned to different educational or career objectives.  Tracking is not due solely to student choice, but the expansion of choice within public schools unquestionably will lead to more of it.  On the other hand, the way to reduce tracking is to reduce the choices that lead to it.</P>
<P> The tracking problem reveals a fundamental dilemma of choice within public schools.  Essentially, it fosters the same outcomes of self-selection which are deemed reprehensible if they result from choice of a private school.  To make matters worse, by catering to a wide range of choice, public schools end up trying to be all things to all parents.  Inevitably, they cannot provide choices as attractive as those available in schools which focus on particular choices.  Anyone who doubts this should consider what choices of automobile would be available if limited to those made by a single monopolistic automobile manufacturer.</P>
<P> Some supporters of family choice view choice within public schools as progress toward voucher plans that would provide choice of school.   A little reflection suggests something is remiss here.  The public school establishment is adamantly opposed to private school participation in voucher plans.  If choice within public schools were a step in that direction, would the AFT and NEA support it?  Are these organizations unwittingly moving us closer to private school participation in voucher plans?  Any such conclusion underestimates the political sophistication of the teacher unions.  Their support for choice within public schools should be viewed as a blocking maneuver, not as an incremental step toward family choice plans.  For better or for worse, however, legislative action in the next few years is likely to focus on choice within public schools.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Political Paradox of Vouchers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> An ironic aspect of the voucher controversy is the fact that it would be most feasible to introduce vouchers in those states in which there is the least political support for them.  This is due to the fact that since some students are already enrolled in private schools, the states would have to pay out substantial amounts before transferees from public schools would result in savings in total state expenditures for public education.  If the voucher amount is low, it will be less of a drain on public expenditures, but fewer parents will use it; the fewer who use it, the less likely it is that transferring students will compensate for the voucher expenditures to students already enrolled in private schools.  On the other hand, the higher the voucher, the more students will transfer, but the amount that must be recouped by transfers from public to private schools is also much larger.</P>
<P> A hypothetical example will illustrate the difficulties.  Let us assume that states <I>A </I> and <I> B</I>, each enrolling 1 million students, desire to enact a voucher plan.  State <I>A</I> has 30 percent of its total enrollment in private schools; state <I>B</I> has only 5 percent in private schools.  The amount of the voucher is $2,400, or half the cost of educating a student in the public schools.  We assume further that per-pupil costs in public schools average $4,800, and that 10 percent of the students would transfer from public to private schools.</P>
<P> On these assumptions, we could expect the following results:</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Vermont Experience:  Reality Confounds Rhetoric</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> By and large, the debate over vouchers has ignored the existence of a voucher-type system in Vermont since 1869.  The Vermont system shows that the reality of a voucher system may be quite different from the plans or rhetoric of both supporters and opponents. </P>
<P> Technically, Vermont has a tuition, not a voucher, system.  School districts are allowed to pay tuition for their students in schools in or out of the state.  Parental choice is thus subject to school board approval; however, even school districts that include high schools are allowed to pay tuition for schooling outside the district, which often happens.</P>
<P> Initially, the Vermont system resulted form the existence of several school districts without high schools.  Beginning in 1869, these districts were allowed to pay public or private schools, in or out of the state, an amount based on the per-pupil costs in neighboring districts.  Over the years the legislation was amended and clarified so that in 1984-85, Vermont paid almost $8.6 million to send 2,857 secondary school pupils to private schools.  Parents absorb the additional costs, which in some cases are considerable.</P>
<P> Vermont does not allow local districts to pay for tuition elsewhere at the elementary level.  Legislation to authorize the practice failed to be enacted in 1985 after the State Board of Education, State Commissioner of Education, and Vermont Education Association opposed it in the Vermont House of Representatives.  Even school districts with elementary schools are not allowed to pay the tuition for their elementary pupils in private nondenominational schools.  As a result, in some cases parents pay the full cost of tuition in private school below the seventh grade, but their school district pays for it in the same school from the seventh grade up.</P>
<P> The status of tuition payments to denominational schools in Vermont is especially interesting.  In a 1961 case, the Vermont Supreme Court held that tuition payments to parochial school violated the First Amendment.  Nevertheless, several religiously oriented private schools have continued to receive tuition payments.  For instance, three prestigious Episcopal schools, with Episcopal clergy on their boards and which hold chapel one or twice a week, have continuously received tuition payments; thus the extent of religious sponsorship, control, or orientation that is permissible remains unclear.  This issue will be important if voucher plans are enacted.  Some denominational schools are legally controlled by lay boards, not religious organizations or religious leaders.  The issue is whether such schools are treated legally in the same way as schools formally under religious control.</P>
<P> The amount of the tuition payment to private secondary schools is based on the actual cost, up to a ceiling amount the latter is the average tuition cost in Vermont's union high schools for the year of attendance; any amount over this must be paid by the parents, as well as the costs of transportation or other expenses resulting from a decision to enroll in a private school.</P>
<P> Another interesting feature of the Vermont system is the flexibility provided local districts.  The latter can decline to pay for tuition elsewhere if they so choose.  They can designate the school or schools eligible for payment (from a state-approved list).  Or, as often happens, a district may allow parents to choose any school, in or out of the state, from the state-approved list.  Thus Londonderry, a community with a population of 1,510 in 1984-85, paid for tuition for eighty-eight students in that school year.  Of these, forty-six were enrolled in public high schools, at a cost of $3,288 per pupil.  Another forty-two were enrolled in forty two private schools in Vermont, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, with the district paying $2,862 per pupil.</P>
<P> As noted, vouchers are not used in Vermont; eligible schools in or out of the state simply bill the sending district for the state-approved amount for students choosing their school.  This arrangement has functioned efficiently, avoiding the problems that would arise by using vouchers with an identical face value.  In the latter case, reimbursements would be necessary if tuition in some schools were less than the voucher amount.</P>
<P> The flexibility of the plan is especially interesting.  Most voucher discussions assume that the state will pay for the voucher.  The Vermont plan renders payment a local option, a feature that has received relatively little attention from voucher analysts.  The Vermont experience also suggests that providing educational choice need not create difficult administrative problems.  Paradoxically, parents in districts without high schools may have virtually unlimited choice, while parents in districts with several public and private schools may have none.  Although local option inevitably results in such anomalies, there is much to be said for it, especially from a political standpoint.  By leaving the issue in the hands of local school boards, legislators may find it possible to avoid voting on a statewide voucher or choice plan that would be costly politically, no matter what the vote.  To be sure, public school organizations, especially NEA and AFT, would oppose this type of plan, but legislators could argue that they were voting for local autonomy, not for vouchers per se.</P>
<P> Overall, the Vermont experience is generally favorable to voucher plans.  It shows that they need not involve closer regulation.  Indeed, since the plan extends to out-of-state schools, close regulation of participating schools is not possible.  Even the initial standards for eligibility are relatively innocuous.  The plan has no effects on integration, especially when the students served are from school districts without a high school of their own.  Parents do add funds to the voucher, strengthening the conclusion that vouchers would lead to greater total spending for education.  Whether the benefits go to the affluent is not an issue; the students eligible for vouchers are defined in such a way  that any result on this issue would be fortuitous.  If local school boards should have the option of &quot;making&quot; or &quot;buying&quot; education, the Vermont system provides a unique combination of contracting out with parental choice.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Politics Of Vouchers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Writing more than ten years after Milton Friedman's first voucher proposals, Standford professor Henry J. Levin concluded that they would have &quot;deleterious consequences.&quot;  He then inquired into how the market approach might be adapted to the needs of ghetto children, and answered his own inquiry by recommending that:</P>
<P>. . . the state provide tuition payments -- and thus schooling alternatives -- only for children of the poor.  These family allowances &quot;. . . would allow that one section of our population that suffers most seriously from segregated schooling -- the poor -- to move, at their own initiative, and if they want to, into schools of their choice outside their neighborhoods.&quot;  This specific application of the Friedman proposal appears to be politically feasible and it is likely to spawn both the private and social benefits that we discussed above. </P>
<P> Almost twenty years later the Reagan administration twice attempted to provide poor children, and only poor children, a voucher.  On both occasions the effort was decisively defeated in Congress.0<I>  </I>Whatever their educational merits, the proposals were clearly not &quot;feasible politically.&quot;  On the contrary, the entire public education establishment condemned them in the harshest terms, and they did not dome close to enactment on either occasion.  Significantly, although the Reagan administration supported the proposals as a way to help economically disadvantaged students and parents, organizations representing these beneficiaries were not actively supportive.</P>
<P> There is a wide gap between support for vouchers in public opinion polls and such support in legislative arenas.1   Private school leaders are deeply divided over the issue; many fear increased government regulation, which they regard as inevitable under a voucher plan.2 Although most private schools are denominational, none of the largest Protestant organization officially supports government aid to religious schools.  Except for some small Orthodox groups, Jewish organizations are opposed to it, and Catholic ones are ambivalent or divided.  Inasmuch as the nondenominational private schools serve a relatively small group of students, drawn disproportionately from affluent parents, government aid to such schools is not a popular political position at this time.  The upshot for many private school leaders is a tacit acceptance of the status quo:  minimal public financial support but also minimal state regulation of private schools.</P>
<P> Despite the unfavorable history of voucher initiatives, Americans for Educational Choice, a national coalition seeking to enact voucher plans, was established in the fall of 1988.3   Although composed predominantly of denominational schools and politically conservative organizations, the coalition hopes to launch a major effort to develop a broader base of political support for vouchers.  In my opinion, however, its most difficult task is not changing the views of voucher opponents; it is achieving legislative and political unity among voucher supporters.  Let me elaborate on this critical point.</P>
<P> In controversies over vouchers, there is a tendency to view the arguments as additive or cumulative.  This is understandable but erroneous.  Those who support vouchers on religious grounds might do so even if vouchers resulted in higher taxes or a less efficient education system.  These negative consequences might be seen as the price that has to be paid to protect religious rights.</P>
<P> As previously noted, voucher proposals may differ on a host of issues:  who is eligible, the amount of the voucher, the kinds of expenses covered, the standards to be met by schools that redeem the vouchers, and state regulation of voucher schools, to cite just a few of the issues.</P>
<P> Needless to say, changes in voucher plans that would overcome one objection are likely to create new ones.  If a voucher is too small to provide genuine choice, increasing it solves the problem, but only by intensifying its fiscal problems.  If a proposal is deemed too expensive for taxpayers to accept, reducing the tax burdens also reduces effective choice, especially among low-income parents.  If a voucher is tied to increased regulation of private schools, some voucher proponents will oppose it; if there is little or no regulation, the proposal will be criticized for giving away public funds without adequate safeguards.  And so on.</P>
<P> These considerations explain why public opinion polls exaggerate the level of support for family choice.  Family choice, like any other policy, cannot be implemented as an abstraction.  On the contrary, it must be implemented by legislation that deals with specifics which may weaken its support.</P>
<P> In my opinion, the extent of dissatisfaction with public education will be a key to whether voucher plans will be enacted widely.  Inasmuch as I regard the educational reform movement as hopelessly futilitarian, I expect voucher support to increase among the public at large.  As we have seen, the &quot;partisan poor&quot; (which includes a substantial proportion of black voters) support vouchers more heavily than ant other major constituency in either the Democratic or Republican parties.4   Such support raises an interesting political question.  Black voters are predominately Democratic.  So are the teacher unions that are overwhelmingly opposed to vouchers.  As I shall explain in chapter 11, the political influence of teacher unions is likely to decline; conceivably, voucher issues could play a role in this development.  By emphasizing vouchers, conservative candidates could presumably appeal to black voters.  Indeed, it is not at all clear why they have failed to do so; perhaps the perception of vouchers as a Catholic issue has been a factor.  Concern over alienating teachers who might otherwise support conservative candidates may also be a consideration.  Nevertheless, if a significant proportion of black voters support voucher efforts, voucher prospects will be greatly enhanced.</P>
<P> In certain contexts, our political system responds more generously to failure than to success.  For this reason, attitudes toward vouchers may be dominated by perceptions about their beneficiaries.  If their beneficiaries are perceived to be low-achieving or low-income students and their parents, their prospects will be enhanced.  If the beneficiaries are perceived to be private schools, the dominant reaction may be not to appropriate funds to schools that are functioning effectively.  Political strategy and tactics may play a more important role than substance in shaping these perceptions.5 </P>
<P> U.S. Supreme Court decisions will play a critical, perhaps even decisive role in the future of voucher plans.  Currently, voucher plans are blocked by Supreme Court decisions prohibiting assistance to denominational schools except under narrowly defined circumstances.  These decisions are based on the First Amendment clause prohibiting the establishment of religion.  Faced with an appropriate case, the Supreme Court would probably uphold voucher plans as government aid to <I>parents</I> on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The constitutional precedent for such a decision is <I>Mueller</I> v. <I>Allen,</I> which upheld tax deductions for educational expenses for all parents, even though the overwhelming majority taking the deductions were parents of students in denominational schools.6 </P>
<P> Another possibility is that the Supreme Court will hold that compulsory education, in conjunction with parental inability to pay for private education, violates the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment.  Constitutionally, government must show &quot;a compelling state interest&quot; to justify interference with religious freedom.  Understandably, voucher opponents have no difficulty identifying such interests, but the legal argument for their existence is clearly vulnerable.</P>
<P> The constitutional issues related to denominational schools may be clarified in the near future.  As this is written, day care legislation is the subject of intensive controversy in the U.S. Congress.  The controversy involves several constitutional issues raised by education vouchers.  This is evident from the debate over the Act for Better Child Care Services of 1988, widely known as the ABC Bill or the Dodd-Kildee Bill.7   As initially drafted, the ABC Bill included stringent restrictions on participation by religious organizations and a strong emphasis on day care in public schools.  Inasmuch as the NEA, AFT, and AFSCME hope to organize day care employees in public schools, these unions were among the 90 organizations that supported the bill by November, 1987.  Although some religious organizations supported it, most were strongly opposed, as were several other organizations for a variety of reasons.</P>
<P> Subsequently, Representation Dale Kildee of Michigan introduced a substitute bill which included the following provisions relating to participation by religious organizations:</P>
<P>Sec. 19.  LIMITATIONS ON USE OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES.</P>
<P> (a) Sectarian Purposes and Activities. -- No financial assistance provided under this Act shall be expended for any sectarian purpose or activity, including sectarian worship and instruction.</P>
<P> (b) Facilities. --</P>
<P> (1) New Facilities. -- No financial assistance provided under this Act shall be expended for the construction of a new facility.</P>
<P> (2) Existing Facilities. -- No financial assistance provided under this Act shall be expended to renovate or repair any facility unless -- . . . </P>
<P> (B) if such provider is a sectarian agency or organization, the renovation or repair is necessary to bring such facility into compliance with health and safety requirements imposed by this Act . . .</P>
<P> (b) Religious Discrimination. -- A child care provider may not discriminate against any child on the basis of religion in providing child care services in return for a fee paid, or certificate redeemed, in whole or in part with financial assistance provided under the Act.8 </P>
<P> Although some critics of the original bill characterized these changes as cosmetic, various public school organizations withdrew their support for it.  Inasmuch as President Bush is expected to veto legislation that excludes religious providers, such legislation is not likely to be enacted.  If it is, the constitutional issues would not be precisely the same as those arising under compulsory education statues; still, if day care legislation is enacted, the Supreme Court will probably have to decide the constitutionality of nonpreferential government assistance to religious organizations to fulfill secular purposes.  Perhaps as education voucher opponents fear, a Supreme Court decision upholding such assistance could lead to widespread state voucher legislation.  One way or another, however, developments in day care are likely to play a major role in the future of voucher plans.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Minivouchers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> In the immediate future, perhaps the most effective way to advance the voucher concept is to de-emphasize the idea that vouchers should pay for enrollment in a school.  Instead, serious consideration should be given to &quot;minivouchers,&quot; or, vouchers that could be used for subjects or activities that do not require a change of school.  For instance, minivouchers might be available for Russian or sculpture or other courses not available in the school of enrollment.  Such vouchers would have several advantages over vouchers that can be used only in connection with a choice of school.</P>
<P>1. Minivouchers would be less threatening to the public school establishment.  Also, if teachers were allowed to be service providers in their off-duty hours (as in the case in Japan), a significant number might support minivouchers.  This would weaken union opposition to vouchers.  In any event, teacher jobs would not be threatened by minivouchers as they would be if vouchers could be used for students to transfer from public to private schools.</P>
<P>2. Minivouchers would not justify any additional regulation of private schools.  The latter would not benefit directly from minivouchers, but they could hardly be opposed to choice proposals that did not involve greater regulation of private schools.  Even if there were some regulation of the vendors providing services under minivouchers, it would be difficult to use such regulation as a backdoor way of opposing minivouchers.</P>
<P>3. Minivouchers can more easily avoid the separation of church and state issues that thwart conventional voucher proposals.</P>
<P>4. Some services purchased by minivouchers could be made available in schools outside the regular school day.  This could have several desirable side effects -- for example, it would reduce the building capacity needed during the regular school day.</P>
<P>5. It would be more difficult political to oppose minivouchers than choice-of-school vouchers.  First, minivouchers would avoid the major objections to conventional vouchers, such as the criticism that they would turn the public schools into a dumping ground.  Second, political leaders might view minivouchers as a way of meeting the demands for choice without disrupting public education.  Parents who cannot or do not interact effectively with the public schools might welcome opportunities to become involved in specific educational matters affecting their children; at least, parents would have no reason to oppose minivouchers.</P>
<P>6. Minivouchers offer opportunities to frame choice issues in ways more favorable to promoting choice.  Currently, &quot;choice&quot; is viewed as choice of school.  In the real world, however, choice of program, course, activity, or teacher may be more important.  To put it another way, choice of school may be irrelevant to the specific choices that parents seek; neither the public nor the private schools may offer the course or activity parents would like to choose.  The more we can separate choices and offer them independently of each other, the less reason parents will have to be dissatisfied with the system.</P>
<P> Whether vouchers providing a choice of school will fulfill the expectations of their supporters is an open question.  It seems to me, however, that incremental strategy is essential to achieve such vouchers.  Vouchers proponents often accept this point, but they tend to think of it solely in financial terms.  Their strategy has been to enact a voucher plan that treats choice of school as the critical decision parents must make.  In order to enact the legislation, the financial benefits are deliberately held to a minimum; the thought is that in future years, it will be easier to increase the amount of the voucher.  Essentially, the strategy is to enact acceptance of the voucher principle and to rely on an incremental approach to increase the voucher amount.</P>
<P> In my view, this strategy is flawed for two reasons.  First, voucher opponents are acutely sensitive to it.  For this reason, they are determined to defeat voucher proposals no matter how small the initial amount of the voucher.  Strategically, they are right to do so, so we can expect their continued opposition to choice-of-school vouchers.</P>
<P> The second flaw in current incremental strategy is its self-defeating nature.  If the dollar amount of the voucher is low, the vouchers will benefit only the parents who already are sending their children to private schools in the absence of vouchers.  I am not contending that such help is undeserved but am simply calling attention to its political consequences.  If assistance to parents who already send their children to private schools is the main outcome of the initial voucher plans, other states are less likely to adopt such plans.  As previously noted, OEO &quot;experiments&quot; in educational performance contracting and educational vouchers were so flawed that they could not provide an adequate test of either idea.  By proceeding with these flawed &quot;experiments,&quot; however, the OEO unwisely and unfairly discredited the very ideas giving rise to them.</P>
<P> Conventional voucher proposals are especially vulnerable in this regard.  As in Alum Rock, efforts will be made to modify voucher proposals so that their failure is assured.  Minimizing the dollar amount of the voucher is one way to achieve this objective.</P>
<P> Minivouchers have a much better chance to avoid this outcome.  A voucher amount that is too small to affect the choice of school may nevertheless be large enough to affect a choice of course or activity outside the regular school day.  Concretely, a voucher worth $250 may affect only a minuscule number of school choices, but it could affect a much larger number of choices relating to specific courses or activities.</P>
<P> As a matter of fact, in 1985 Minnesota enacted a Postsecondary Enrollment Options Act (PSEO).9   Under PSEO, public school students in grades eleven and twelve can enroll in nonsectarian course offered by public or private postsecondary institutions of higher education on a course by course basis.  State aid on a pro rata basis goes to the institutions offering the courses.  Public school organizations did not oppose this form of choice as strongly as they did voucher plans funding full enrollment in private secondary schools.  As previously noted, the Reagan administration proposed minivouchers for remedial services, and Congress crushed such proposals.  We should be careful, however, not to draw the wrong lesson from this experience.  When vouchers were perceived as a Catholic issue, they were losers politically.  When they were oriented solely to the disadvantaged, they were also losers.  These failures are instructive.  To be enacted, voucher plans must appeal to several constituencies.  These constituencies have not as yet reached consensus on a voucher plan that is both politically viable and acceptable.  To do so, they will have to agree on the specifics so that the voucher coalition does not break up when a concrete proposal is introduced.  Agreement on pie-in-the-sky specifics is easy to achieve but politically futile.  The crucial issue is what compromises voucher constituencies are willing to make to achieve a voucher plan that can be enacted.</P>

<P><B>T</B>he scale of education for profit is important from several standpoints.  Large companies support research and development in ways that small ones cannot.  More efficient facilities and equipment may require large-scale use to be profitable, so small companies may not be able to take advantage of such opportunities.  National or regional companies may adopt policies or practices that would not be appropriate if only a local market is considered.  I do not mean that privatization in education must develop <I>in toto</I> as either a cottage industry or as large scale enterprise.  Some dimensions might follow one pattern while others followed a different pattern. </P>
<P> My objective in this chapter is to explore various patterns of development in education for profit.  In doing so I question the fact that large-scale enterprise has unique disadvantages or advantages.  My objective here is simply to identify and analyze some of the factors that will affect the scale of education for profit.</P>
<P> Initially, it may seem that instruction will be a small scale enterprise.  Education is a service; unlike products which can be shipped around the world, services must ordinarily be delivered to customers.  Barbers in New York can't cut your hair if you are in California.  Doctors can't operate on patients not at hand.  Granted, some kinds of teaching, especially at higher grade levels, can be carried on through television and radio, but the interaction and feedback required for effective teaching usually requires a closer relationship between teacher and students.</P>
<P> Yet although most educational services require such proximity, we must avoid confusing the size of the delivery unit with the size of the firm.  McDonald's is a multibillion-dollar company, even though none of its service outlets remotely approaches this dollar volume.  Financial service conglomerates provide an extremely brad range of financial services across state and national borders.  In fact, although the costs of health care have already reached over 11 percent of gross national product, some analysts have speculated that by the end of the century most health care will be controlled by twenty to thirty corporations.  In short, the fact that education is a service does not necessarily mean that education for profit will be a small-scale industry.</P>
<P> Although I have already discussed developments in health care, a few additional comments on that subject may be helpful.  The five largest companies dominate the hospital chains:  Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), Humana, American Medical International (AMI), National Medical Enterprises (NME), Lifemark.  These five chains owed about half the hospital beds owned by all for-profit hospitals in 1981.   (These proportions have changed considerably since then as a result of mergers and acquisitions in the hospital industry.)</P>
<P> Several differences between the leading hospital chains might be applicable to education.  Unlike Humana, HCA does not limit itself to operating only its own hospitals; HCA also manages a large number of hospitals under contract.  AMI and NME stress diversification.  NME owns nursing homes and provides construction, purchasing, and other services for other hospitals.  AMI sells a variety of special services to other hospitals:  laboratory, dietary, and pharmaceutical services; respiratory therapy; mobile CAT scanners; and alcohol recovery centers.  There is no obvious reason why similar developments cannot or should not emerge in education.  For that matter, the leading  companies providing food, maintenance, and other noninstructional services typically provide managemtn services, not the entire complement of employees required to provide the service.  This fact raises an interesting and perhaps highly important issue.  Why do school districts buy management services for noninstructional but not for instructional services?  For that matter, why isn't school district management ever contracted out?  After all, governments often contract out hospital management, not merely this or that aspect of it.</P>
<P> The possibilities of contracting out a particular service is rarely raised in education.  One recent development, however, suggests that it may become an urgent practical issue in the near future.  A number of states, most notably New Jersey, have enacted legislation authorizing state takeover and operation of local school districts for various reasons.  If and when such takeovers occur, it will become imperative to find managemtn capable of managing the school districts.  Educational management companies could conceivably meet this need, just as hospital management companies do in the field of health care.  Whether or not takeover legislation triggers such a development, the possibilities of contracting out school management or the management of instructional services should be explored thoroughly.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Educational Testing and Market Size</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Private Companies provide a wide variety of testing services.  Although most of these companies are for profit, the largest is Educational Testing Service (ETS), a nonprofit company based in Princeton, New Jersey.  Established in 1947 as a nonprofit corporation, in 1986 ETS revenues were almost $200 million.</P>
<P> Like most other national companies that are active in education markets, ETS provides services to a wide variety of noneductional clients as well.  For example, its Center for Occupational and Professional Assessment (COPA) provides job-related tests for more than fifty occupations.  Clients include government licensing agencies, trade associations, employers, and institutions of higher education.  The services offered can include job analysis; test development, administration, and scoring; and score reporting.  Similarly, ETS also test proficiency in English for government agencies, business firms, and educational institutions.</P>
<P> In education, ETS is best know for the development and administration of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), a test taken by about 1.5 million high school juniors and seniors every year.  The SAT is a prime example of economies of scale; although SAT development cost several million dollars, students paid only $11.75 each in 1988 to take the test and have the scores sent to three institutions of higher education.  The large number of students who pay for the test every year funds a level of technical support that no single institution could finance solely from its own funds.</P>
<P> In one respect, however, the growth of ETS seems to contradict my argument that nonprofit schools would not expand rapidly under an educational voucher plan.  The rapid growth of ETS is not to be ignored but hardly demonstrates that nonprofit status is irrelevant to expansion.  Many of the services ETS provides are in noncompetitive markets.  Its tests are used primarily to guide educational transitions -- high school to college or college to graduate or professionals schools.  Other test companies sell mainly achievement and various sorts of noncompeting programs.  Interestingly enough, although ETS officials have not tried to change its nonprofit status, the do not express any strong opposition to such a change. </P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>For-Profit Learning Centers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Learning centers operated for profit raise several significant issues related to education reform.  These centers provide supplementary educational services for students in public and private schools.  In 1988 the three leading companies in this field were Sylvan Learning Corporation (based in Montgomery, Alabama), Huntington Learning Centers (based in Oradell, New Jersey), and American Learning Corporation (based in Chicago, Illinois).   The latter operates centers under the name The Reading Game in the West and under the name Britannica Learning Centers elsewhere.</P>
<P> The following discussion will focus largely on Sylvan Learning Corporation, which is a Delaware corporation in the business of diagnosing learning needs and offering individualized instructional services to meet those needs.  Essentially, the company provides supplementary educational services for children in school.  Reading, mathematics, and writing were the initial supplementary services, but others such as study skills, have been added.</P>
<P> Sylvan's growth has been impressive, to say the least.  The company was established in 1979 under the name Achievement Centers Inc.  The founder was a high school teacher who still serves as chairman of the company's board of directors.  Starting with one center in Portland, Oregon, the company began to franchise centers in September 1980.  The company was reorganized as Sylvan Learning Centers in 1981 and was purchased by Kinder-Care, the nation's largest provider of day care services, in 1984.  Subsequently corporate headquarters moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where Sylvan shares a new office building with Kinder-Care.  By 1987 the parent corporation had over four hundred centers under license or direct operation.  Despite increasing competition, Sylvan expects to increase both the number of centers and the services offered for many years to come.</P>
<P> Sylvan sells three types of franchises; the differences are mainly in the number of school-age children and the demographics of the franchise territory.  The most common is an &quot;A&quot; type franchise, which normally includes 20,000 to 25,000 school-age children.  Total start-up costs are estimated to be from $97,000 to $110,000, including a franchise fee of $35,000.  Franchisees are required to be open for business within 120 days from the date they have paid for business within 120 days from the date they have paid for the franchise, and they must maintain a minimum level of operation to avoid revocation of their franchise rights.  In addition, franchisees must pay a 1 1/2 percent national advertising fee and 8 percent of gross revenues to the franchiser.</P>
<P> A learning center staff normally consists of a director (owner/franchisee), an education director, a receptionist, and teachers.  Most teachers are certified, although not necessarily by the state of current residence.  Many are retired or individuals seeking only part-time employment.  Others are deemed qualified despite the absence of certification.  Each teacher teaches a maximum of three pupils at a time; the floor plans are designed to enable four teachers to work with three students each at any given time.  Depending on the area, the subject involved, and other factors, the teachers are paid $6 to $10 an hour; the centers charge $20 to $30 an hour, with the difference going for salaries and benefits for full-time staff, rent utilities, advertising and other expenses.</P>
<P> Parents usually pay $800 to $1,000 for a program of thirty-six instructional hours provided over three to five months.  The fanchisees are not allowed to add programs or services or sell products not approved by Sylvan.  Instruction is limited to three students per teacher; typically a student receives instruction for an hour a day, two days a week, after regular school.  Parents transport the children to and from the centers, which are usually open about five hours  day during school days.  Some centers are open on Saturdays; all operate during the summer.</P>
<P> The franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with company standards applicable to staffing curriculum, accounting, and management methods.  Some items, such as classroom furniture, ma be purchased from the franchisor; franchisees can also purchase other items on the open market if they wish to do so.  Franchise sites and floor plans must also be approved by Sylvan, but the criteria for approval are made available prior to purchase of a franchise.  Sylvan also reserves the right to cancel the franchise arrangement for specified reasons, including conduct that would harm the company's reputation.  Sylvan continually develops and field-tests new products and services that would be new profit centers.  In addition, franchise consultants (often former franchise owners) are available for assistance at any time, especially in the early stages of franchise development.  For example, the franchise consultant works with the franchisee on site selection, advertising, school relations, and other business and educational problems.  In addition, franchisees are required to participate in training programs, both in the preoperational stage and afterward as new services are introduced.  Sylvan also provides several manuals on franchise operations to assist franchise owners with anticipated problems.</P>
<P> Although some of the requirements franchisees must meet may seem restrictive, three considerations suggest they are not unduly so.  First, Sylvan has a significant stake in the financial success of its franchises.  If franchises are not successful, Sylvan receives less revenue from them.  Furthermore, Sylvan's income from franchise fees would be less if franchisee income is not so attractive to prospective franchisees.  Long-range growth both in franchise fees and royalties requires successful franchises.</P>
<P> Second, the franchisees have their won organization that represents their interests to the franchisor.  This, of course, is not unusual in franchise operations; for example, automobile dealers have organizations to deal with automobile manufacturers.  Third, the fact that an increasing number of franchises are purchased by existing franchisees suggests the restrictions are not unreasonably onerous.</P>
<P> Virtually every aspect of these operations provides significant economies of scale compared to freestanding local companies:</P>
<P>1. New programs and services can be developed and field-tested before being introduced on a large scale.  A local operator considering the introduction of a new service would find it too expensive to develop and field test, hence the program is less likely to be educationally or financially effective.</P>
<P>2.  Sylvan has developed newspaper and radio advertisements that are made available to franchisees.  Because the same advertising copy is used in hundreds of centers, the cost per center of effective advertising based on extensive market research is relatively low.  A freestanding local company cannot afford the expertise of national advertising agencies.</P>
<P>3. Just as leading fast food and automobile service station develop expertise on site selection, so do educational franchisers.  They are more knowledgeable about the factors associated with site selection than any solo operator could hope to be.</P>
<P>4. Sylvan has developed loan plans for both parents and franchisees.  These loan plans are made available through Educational Finance Plans, Inc. (EFP), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylvan.  The plans enable parents who cannot pay the full tuition in a lump sum to stagger the payments.  for example, if parents are willing to buy a $1,000 program subject to financing, EFP offers several financing options.  Whichever is adopted, the franchisee gets $900 immediately and the franchiser and its bank absorb the risks of default for $100 and the interest on the loan.  Most local operators could not develop and market such a plan; the costs would be prohibitive.</P>
<P> The Foregoing economies of scale are illustrative, not exhaustive.  Most are also evident in the operations of Huntington Learning Centers.  The latter was founded in 1977 by Ray and Eileen Huntington, a couple seeking primarily to establish their own business.  At the time, Ray Huntington was an analyst for American Telephone and Telegraph and Eileen Huntington was a high school teacher.  Although the first center was successful, expansion in the next seven years was rather slow and limited to the Middle Atlantic states.  In 1985, however, the company was reorganized to expand nationally, and it grew rapidly thereafter; in June 1987 it had exceeded fifty franchise agreements covering 111 territories in twenty-one states.  By May 1989 it had approximately 100 centers, including sixteen that were company owned and operated.  As was the case at Sylvan Learning Corporation, several franchisees had purchased exclusive rights to establish two or more centers in areas where none was operative.</P>
<P> In general, Huntington and Sylvan operate in similar ways.  In both, franchise operations are affected by such factors as size and population density of the franchise, its geographic desirability, demographic characteristics of the population, residential and commercial characteristics of the franchised territory, and competitive factors.  Both companies sponsor weekly meetings with potential franchisees and conduct intensive training programs for franchisees.  Franchisees in both companies rely on both advertising and informal networks (guidance counselors, doctors, parents, etc.) for referrals.  Both companies emphasize the importance of responding to telephone inquiries effectively and of converting such inquiries into parental visits to the center.  Both require and charge fees for tests prior to recommending a plan of instruction.  Finally, both companies use company-owned centers to field-test new services and plan to introduce additional services in the future.  For the most part, the differences between the companies are significant primarily to potential franchisees or to parents.  Some of these differences are as follows:</P>
<P>1. The Sylvan franchises are somewhat more expensive but also include more on-site consultation.</P>
<P>2. Sylvan franchisees are required to budget and sponsor a &quot;grand opening&quot;; Huntington franchisees are not required to do this.</P>
<P>3. Sylvan provides regional consultants; Huntington does not, preferring to emphasize immediate telephone assistance.</P>
<P>4. Huntington uses the number of school age children to set franchise fees; although the number of such children is obviously important, Sylvan relies upon multiple criteria in setting franchise fees.</P>
<P>5. Sylvan employs a national advisory board, whereas Huntington employs educational consultants as needed.</P>
<P>6. Sylvan uses plastic tokens to reward pupils for achievement; the tokens are redeemable in the &quot;Sylvan Store.&quot;  Huntington eschews this approach, relying instead on other ways of motivating pupils.</P>
<P>7. Sylvan only requires parents to purchase month-to-month blocks of hours of instructional time; Huntington offers a discount for large blocks of time paid in advance, but parents are allowed to withdraw their children at any time with a refund for the time not utilized.</P>
<P>8. Sylvan's advertising emphasizes a &quot;guarantee&quot; that students will improve to a certain extent.  If they do not, the center provides additional instruction.  Huntington advertising doe not include such &quot;guarantees&quot;; company officials regard them as inappropriate.</P>
<P>In pointing out these differences, my intention is not to favor one company over the other, or to endorse any educational service provided by either company.  Nor is it intended to be a criticism of the large number of independent educational service companies.  My comments are meant only to illustrate how educational franchising works and the economies of scale that are available to large scale educational providers.  How effectively companies take advantage of these economies of scale is a separate question.</P>
<P> I have tried to show that for-profit enterprise could play a more important role in instruction, whether by contracting out or through vouchers.  These two modes differ in several important ways; for example, a voucher plan would involve parents in a very different way than contracting out instruction.  In principle, there should be no objection to using for-profit enterprise in either mode of privatization; on the contrary, utilization of for-profit enterprise is essential to either mode of it is to bring about educational improvement.</P>
<P> I have further contended that contracting out instruction has several strategic advantages, at least in the short run.  Unlike vouchers, it does not require new and highly controversial legislation.  Also, contracting out does not require drastic changes in the governance structure, and there is ample precedent for it both in and out of the fields of education.  I do not contend that contracting out is a substitute for vouchers  or that it would serve all of the same purposes.  Instead, my contention is that for-profit enterprise should play an important role in either mode or both. </P>
<P> Finally, I have suggested that economies of scale apply to instruction as much as they do to support services and that because of this fact, greater reliance on for-profit enterprise is likely to result in the emergence of large companies that develop, sell, and/or manage educational services. None of these propositions commands widespread popular or professional support at this time.  For this reason, let me comment briefly on a common reaction.  Essentially, it is that the analysis fails to give sufficient weight to the actual school situation.  More specifically, if there is no difference in principle between contracting out instruction and transportation, or food service, or whatever, why isn't instruction contracted out more often?  The implication is that because instruction is rarely contracted out, it must be for a good reason.</P>
<P> With this criticism in mind, let us compare efforts to contract out language instruction with efforts to contract out custodial services.  Efforts to implement these two decisions would differ in the following ways:</P>
<P>1. The legal obstacles to contracting out language instruction would be much greater.  For instance, state law might require that language instruction be provided only by certified teachers; it is less likely to require that custodial services be provided only by licensed custodians or by school district employees.</P>
<P>2. If the affected employees object, the teacher union will be a more formidable opponent at the bargaining table.  It is more likely to provide a full-time negotiator and more backup in terms of data and public relations.</P>
<P>3. If the decision to contract out would result in loss of jobs, the tenure protections for teachers would be more difficult to overcome than those for custodians.</P>
<P>4. There is less interaction between the custodians and students than between teachers and students.  For this reason, parents are less likely to be concerned about contracting out custodial services.</P>
<P>5. Contracting out instruction may require or be facilitated by continuity in the teacher-student relationship.  It is more likely that providers of custodial services can be changed with little or no harm to the service.</P>
<P> I am not suggesting that these differences are exhaustive or that they always apply or are always important.  State laws and local collective bargaining agreements vary widely, as do the circumstances giving rise to the desirability or viability of contracting out.  In general, however, the obstacles to contracting out instruction are primarily legal and political, not economic or education.  There is no public policy reason why school districts that can contract with ServiceMaster for custodial and maintenance services, or ARA for food services, or Burns International for security services, or ETS for testing services, or for dozens of other noninstructional services should not have the same right to contract for instructional services.  Whether a district wants to exercise that right, or when, how, and why are separate issues.</P>
<P> The obstacles just mentioned do not explain why instructional services are rarely contracted out.  Managerial incentives, or the lack thereof, are probably the most important reason why for-profit  companies are used more frequently to provide noninstructional than instructional services.</P>
<P> To see why, consider the situation in hundreds of school districts in which for-profit learning centers have been established.  The public school buildings close in the afternoon, let us say at 3:30 P.M.  Down the street, the learning center, which charges $25 an hour for instruction, opens its doors at the same time.  The public schools could hire the same teachers; because the facilities are already in place and there is no need to earn a profit, the public schools could provide the same service for $10 instead of $25 an hour.  My assumption is that if a teacher is willing to teach for a private corporation for $8 an hour, he or she would be willing to teach in the public schools under the same conditions for the same hourly rate.  Actually, it appears that the public schools pay higher wages to the supplementary teachers, include an override to pay for any increased costs to the school system, and still offer the service for less than half of what private companies are charging.</P>
<P> Note that if teacher union opposition is a problem, the public schools need not employ the after-school teachers.  Instead, they could disseminate to parents lists of teachers, rates, and qualifications; parents could pay the teachers directly for supplementary services, with the teacher paying the school district to cover its costs.</P>
<P> Ostensibly, the learning centers for profit reflect a failure to utilize public facilities efficiently, a failure that appears to be very costly to parents.  Note also that if the cost of supplementary services were drastically reduced, the services would be available to a much larger number of students. Why then do school districts accept a situation that forces parents to pay $25 an hour for instructional services that the districts could make available for $10?</P>
<P> School administrators answer this question in a variety of ways.  In general, however, the answers do not point to anything that would deter a district determined to provide such a program.  Partly for this reason, I believe the most adequate explanation is one that is never given:  There are no personal incentives for school administrators to initiate such a program.  On the contrary, most have disincentives to do so, especially insofar as the programs are devoted to remedial instruction.  First of all, administrators would be initiating programs that imply public school failure.  Obviously, no such implication results from contracting out noninstructional services.  Also, if public schools make remedial programs available, parents will feel that the school districts should pay for them.  Such demands could create financial or equity or union problems that school management would just as soon avoid.</P>
<P> The bottom line is that school officials have no financial or political incentives that outweigh the disincentives for initiating the change.  Of course, if officials objected on educational grounds to supplementing services for profit, such objections could justify their inaction, but this is seldom the case.  The learning companies obviously want school cooperation (and referrals), but they appear to be prepared to function without it if necessary.  One indication of this is their employment of leading educators as advisers; former Secretary of Education Terrel H. Bell is chairman of Sylvan Learning Corporation's advisory board.</P>
<P> In practice, the learning companies assert that they are only doing what school districts would like to do but cannot -- provide instruction on a one-to-one or tutorial basis.  Most school districts also express this view.  Still, their rhetorical acceptance of it does not really explain their inactivity on the issue.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Future of Learning Centers</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> Franchised learning centers may develop in several ways; it is still too early to predict their long-range development, educationally or financially.  It appears, however, that in the next five to ten years, they will emphasize enrichment instead of remediation.  As large as is the market for remedial services, it is much more limited than the market for helping average or superior students in a wide variety of subjects.  conceivably, centers devoted to performing arts, foreign language, mathematics and science, or sports might have widespread appeal to parents seeking ways to improve their children's education.</P>
<P> As we have seen, a number of social and demographic trends are resulting in diminished opportunities for desirable child-adult interactions -- that is, to a decline in social capital.  Viewed in this contest, the learning centers may play a role that is much broader than remediation.  Indeed, the basic idea underlying such centers may eventually be applied to large numbers of students during the regular school day.  On the one hand, millions of students lack any means of interacting with adults outside the context of discipline or remediation.  On the other hand, there exists an enormous pool of potential part-time instructors:  retired persons, college students, and persons seeking or willing to accept only part-time employment.  The physical facilities for bringing these two groups together are largely in place.  Large numbers of students could be taught for at least a few hours a day with three or four to one student/teacher ratios.  Such arrangements might have beneficial effects that go far beyond remediation in school subjects.  Granted, the approach would not be applicable everywhere, but it may be in a large number of districts.</P>
<P> The development of franchised learning centers suggests that &quot;cottage industry&quot; and &quot;large-scale industry&quot; are not necessarily mutually exclusive, even with respect to the same service.  Franchised learning centers are small businesses, requiring an investment of about $10,000 overall.  The franchisors are much larger corporations that can provide funds for research and development and aggressive growth policies.  In a franchise agreement, small-scale and large-scale business are highly interdependent; the profitability of each type is directly dependent on profitability of each type is directly dependent on profitability in the other.  This pattern will not be predominant in every type of education for profit, but it is very likely to be in many fields.  From a broader perspective, this should not be surprising.  Franchising is a major source of economic growth in our economy; the reasons are just as applicable to education as to other franchised services.</P>

<P><B>T</B>hus far, privatization has been discussed in terms of separating government support for education from government operation of schools.  Some proponents of privatization do not regard such a change as desirable.  They point out that private contractors can and do lobby for increased government appropriations to pay for their services.  They also emphasize that private monopolies can be as harmful as government-operated monopolies.  Thus a change from public to private operation does not necessarily result in the beneficial consequences associated with privatization.</P>
<P>To some, therefore, &quot;privatization&quot; consists of load shedding -- government shedding of support as well as operation of public services.  At first glance, the idea of withdrawing government support from education may seem to be hopeless, even quixotic, regardless of any abstract merits it might have.  My position, however, is that any such dismissal of load shedding is unrealistic, especially if taxes for education were reduced proportionally.  Many adults without children, a rapidly growing segment of the population, would be receptive to it.  So would many parents who send their children to private schools.  Another group likely to support load shedding consists of parents who educate their children at home.  Thus there are important interest groups that are, or have reason to be, sympathetic to some degree of load shedding.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Emergence of Education at Public Expense</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>To understand the possibilities for load shedding in education, it will be helpful to review briefly the emergence of education at public expense.  This is related to but not the same as compulsory education.  Strictly speaking, compulsory education does not necessarily require education at public expense; governments often require that certain things (such as waste removal) be done while costs must be borne privately.  As a practical matter, however, compulsory education has been closely tied to public support. </P>
<P>Although taken for granted now, compulsory education was not widespread in the United States prior to the Civil War; in 1852 Massachusetts was the first state to enact a general compulsory education statute.  By 1900, thirty states and the District of Columbia had done so, but the statutes often mandated only part-time attendance while providing very little enforcement machinery.  Illiteracy rates revealed by our nation's entrance into World War I led to greater emphasis upon compulsory education.</P>
<P>In practice, compulsory education was tied very closely to child labor; in fact, the two types of legislation were frequently interdependent.  Prohibitions of child labor were widely enacted after the Civil War.  Nevertheless, by contemporary standards, these prohibitions were very limited.  Most applied primarily to manufacturing; agricultural and domestic work was exempted.  To be eligible for work in manufacturing industries, children had to be at least twelve years old and could not be required to work more than ten hours a day.  Parental statements concerning age were accepted perfunctorily and rigorous enforcement was exceptional.</P>
<P>To avoid economic competition on the issue between states, efforts to limit child labor emerged in Congress.  Eventually these efforts succeeded by restricting the sale of goods made with child labor.  In any event, compulsory education was more the result than the cause of child labor prohibitions.  The interrelationships between these policies is evident from the fact that the maximum school age and minimum work age were often the same.  School officials were usually delegated responsibility for enforcing child labor laws, and work requirements often included minimum education requirements, such as completion of the sixth grade.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most important implication of this brief summary is that repeal or substantial easing of compulsory education laws per se might not result in any major changes in school attendance.  For this to happen, it may be essential to repeal or amend the legislation that prohibits or restricts youth employment.  As will be discussed shortly, pressures to do that can be expected to intensify in the near future.</P>

<P>Some parents have done more than urge government withdrawal from funding and delivery of educational services.  These parents have taken it upon themselves to educate their children at home.  These parents, and the situation regarding home schooling, provide an interesting point of departure for our analysis of lad shedding. </P>
<P>&quot;Home schooling&quot; is not easily defined, legally or practically.  In the following analysis, the phrase refers to any effort to meet compulsory education statutes by instruction in a family residence.  In other words, &quot;home schooling&quot; refers to both a process and a site.  The nature of the process is subject to debate and litigation, but it presumably differs from the informal instruction that takes place in any home with children.</P>
<P>The 1925 Supreme Court decision in <I>Pierce</I> v. <I>Society of Sisters</I> held that a state cannot require children to attend public school.   States can require children to attend school but, subject to reasonable regulation, parents have the right to enroll their children in private schools.  A major point of constitutional uncertainty is the determination of reasonableness in state regulation; at some point, regulation could be so onerous that it would negate the rights of private school or parents wishing to enroll their children in such schools.</P>
<P>Within this constitutional context, all states have compulsory school attendance or education laws.  The distinction is significant.  If a state requires compulsory school attendance, home schooling may be justified on the basis that the home qualifies as a school.  As of 1983, thirty-eight states had enacted compulsory school attendance laws.   The absence of a statutory definition or statutory criteria for defining a school may render some of these laws vulnerable to legal challenge; in five states -- Wisconsin (1983), Georgia (1984), Iowa (1985), Minnesota (1985), and Missouri (1985) -- compulsory school attendance laws were held to be unconstitutionally vague for this reason.  In all of these states except Iowa, the aftermath of the court decision was legislation that was rather favorable to home schooling. </P>
<P>Compulsory <I>education</I> legislation avoids the need to define &quot;school,&quot; but it faces a different problem:  What activities constitute &quot;education&quot; in a compulsory education law?  Needless to say, the legal definitions of &quot;education vary about as much as the legal definitions of &quot;school.&quot;  In addition, courts are not always consistent in applying the same definition to a given factual situation.  Parenthetically, we might note that the legal definitions have implications besides those directly related to education.  For example, schools may be tax exempt or be allowed to operate in residential areas despite local opposition.  Of course, the way &quot;school&quot; is defined reflects legislative or judicial policy toward home schooling; an expansive definition reflects more support for home schooling than a restrictive one.  In recent years the courts that have been willing to construe the term judicially have been more favorable to home schools.</P>
<P>In one way or another, by 1987 every state permitted some type of home instruction.   A summary of the legal status of home schooling in 1986 revealed the following:</P>
<P>1. Twenty-three states had enacted some type of home schooling legislation in the years indicated:  West Virginia, Vermont, and Minnesota (1987); Missouri (1986); Arkansas, Florida, Oregon, New Mexico, Wyoming, Washington, Tennessee (1985); Georgia, Virginia, Louisiana*, Rhode Island* (1984); Wisconsin and Montana (1983); Arizona and Mississippi (1982); Ohio* (1976); Colorado* (1963); Utah* (1957); Nevada* (1956).</P>
<P>2. Only Iowa, Michigan, and North Dakota required that a certified teacher provide the instruction in all home schools.</P>
<P>3. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia required home schools to be approved by the local school district or school board.</P>
<P>4. Seven states (Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Nevada, and South Carolina) required the instruction in home schools to be &quot;equivalent' to public school instruction.  The &quot;equivalent&quot; requirement has been successfully challenged on grounds of vagueness in Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri.</P>
<P>5. Three states (Maryland, Delaware, and Rhode Island) required home school instruction to be &quot;regular and thorough.&quot; </P>
<P>6. Idaho and Michigan required home school instruction to be &quot;comparable&quot; to public school instruction.</P>
<P>7. Seven states (California, Hawaii, Kansas, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota) required home school teachers to be &quot;competent,&quot; &quot;qualified,&quot; or &quot;capable of teaching.&quot;</P>
<P>8. Home schools could operate as private or religious schools in Alabama, California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas.</P>
<P>9. Home schools may possibly be allowed to operate as private or religious schools in Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. </P>
<P>* These six states still give local superintendents or school boards the authority to &quot;approve&quot; home schools.</P>
<P>Although changes in the legal status of home schooling will undoubtedly occur, there is little likelihood of state uniformity on the subject; if anything, state legislation may vary even more in the future than it does now.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Number of &quot;Home Schoolers&quot;</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>How many children of school age are educated at home?  The estimates vary widely.  Raymond S. Moore, a leading advocate of home schooling, has made what appear to be the highest estimates.   His estimates, however, include a substantial number of migrant and disabled children who do not attend formal school.  Including these children, Moore estimates that the total of home schoolers is well over 1 million and may run much higher.  Although his estimates may be accurate for the most part, his figures really refer to the estimated number of school-age children who are not in school; they are not an estimate of the number of children being educated at home pursuant to a compulsory education statute.  Most children of migrant workers who are not in school are not receiving an education at home; they are not receiving an education from any source.  Although the education of such children is an important problem, they are not &quot;home schoolers,&quot; or students undergoing a planned program of instruction at home pursuant to a parental decision that such instruction is preferable to education in a public or private school.</P>
<P> Michael Farris, director of the Home School Legal Defense Association, has estimated that about 200,000 families and 500,000 pupils were involved in home schooling in 1987. This estimate suggests that slightly more than 1 percent of the school-age population is being schooled at home.  Because of the restrictions on home schooling, underreporting may have been widespread in the past, but the trend toward legalization and accomodation is probably resulting in more accurate data.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that the number of home schoolers increased in the 1980s.  It is difficult to say where the increase might level off; some observers believe that home schooling will be a major trend in American education, reflecting the broader social trends of self-help as opposed to reliance on institutions to deliver services.  Realistically, however, several factors are likely to curtail any major increase in home schooling.  Much of its growth has resulted from devout Protestant parents unhappy with public schools.  Many of these parents are likely to abandon home schooling as Protestant schools continue to expand.</P>
<P>While the legal climate for home schooling has improved in recent years, this could change as the number of children educated at home increases.  The recent increases, small as they are in absolute terms, led the National Association of Elementary School Principals to adopt a resolution critical of home schooling.  The resolution is quoted here in its entirety because it summarizes the objections to home schooling:</P>
<P><I>Compulsory School Attendance</I></P>
<P>     NAESP believes that education is a cornerstone of American democracy and that, in order to guarantee an enlightened electorate capable of governing itself, the American people must ensure quality education for each citizen.</P>
<P>     NAESP asserts that this is most effectively done through cohesive organization in formal settings in which resources can most beneficially be brought to bear and a compulsory attendance policy employed.</P>
<P>     NAESP views with alarm the increasing number of individuals and groups who are avoiding education in the traditional setting in favor of at-home schooling.  Such schooling:</P>
<P>1.  deprives the child of important social experiences,</P>
<P>2.  isolates students from other social/racial/ethnic groups,</P>
<P>3.  denies students the full range of curriculum experiences and materials,</P>
<P>4.  may be provided by non-certified and unqualified persons,</P>
<P>5.  creates an additional burden on administrators whose duties include the         endorsement of compulsory school attendance laws,</P>
<P>6.  may not permit effective assessment of academic standards of quality,</P>
<P>7.  may violate health and safety standards, and</P>
<P>8.  may not provide the accurate diagnosis of and planning for meeting the needs of children with special talents, learning difficulties, and other     conditions requiring atypical educational programs.</P>
<P>Therefore, NAESP reaffirms the value of compulsory school attendance.  The Association urges local and state associations to support legislation which enforces compulsory school attendance and prohibits at-home schooling as a substitute for compulsory school attendance.</P>
<P>NAESP further urges local and state associations to address these issues as important educational concerns.</P>
<P>Other public school organizations may adopt a similar posture toward home schooling.  We can expect these organizations to publicize home schooling deficiencies or instances of child abuse during home schooling.  Supporters of home schooling may contend that the instances are isolated, or that children are abused whether or not they attend regular school.  On the merits of accommodating home schooling, I side with the home schoolers, but the merits are not the point.   It is simply that any increase in home schooling will inevitably evoke opposition and negative publicity, justified or not.0 </P>
<P>In home schooling, the burden of education children falls mainly upon their mothers.  the fact is however, that over half the mothers of young children work outside the home, a proportion that is likely to increase in the future.  For a variety of reasons, more women are seeking economic security in careers outside the home than in homemaking.  Also, many parents who educate their children at home do not continue past the first year.  In short, despite some contradictory factors, the number of pupils educated at home is not likely to change drastically in the next five to ten years.  Patricia Lines, an attorney who has made a careful study of home schooling issues, projects the continued growth of home schooling, but at a slower rate than in the early 1980s.1 </P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Who Are the Home Schoolers?</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>The parents who educate their children at home are not a homogeneous group, either demographically or in the reasons why they prefer home schooling.  On the contrary, virtually the only characteristic children educated at home and/or their families have in common is that the children are not enrolled in a regular school.</P>
<P>Let us first summarize the demographic data on home schoolers.  Several efforts have been made to develop profiles of this population.  Brian D. Ray, a home schooling activist who summarized these studies in 1986, found that despite considerable ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic diversity among home schoolers, the studies agreed, or at least did not contradict the conclusions that:</P>
<P>1. The female parent was mother/housewife/homemaker.</P>
<P>2. The male parent was a professional or skilled worker. . . </P>
<P>5. Various religious backgrounds were represented, including some very untraditional ones; with 64 % regularly attending religious services.</P>
<P>6 Parents were average socializers.</P>
<P>7. It was a family enterprise, usually operated by both parents. . . </P>
<P>10. Informal, child-centered, and relatively flexible programs for learning were used.</P>
<P>11. The programs were effective and interesting to children (as perceived by parents). . . .</P>
<P>13 The school formally convened for 3 - 4 hours per day.</P>
<P>14. Children studied on their own an average of 2.7 hours per day.</P>
<P>15. The home school was approved by local authorities.</P>
<P>16. Most often instructional materials prepared by the parents were used. . . </P>
<P>18. The curriculum covered a wide range of conventional course offerings (with math, reading, and science as the three most often stressed).</P>
<P>19. The home school was operated for more than two years.</P>
<P>20. Families decided to home school for various reasons, which follow in order of their importance:  (a) concern for moral health of children, (b) concern over character development of their children, (c) . . . excess rivalry and ridicule in conventional schools . . . (d) overall poor quality education in public schools, and (e) desire to enjoy children at home in early years of their lives.2 </P>
<P>Although Ray's summary did not include all the demographic profiles of home schoolers, it is consistent with those not included.  For example, Earl W. Gladin's doctoral dissertation involved a study of home schoolers based on a 6 percent random sample of 6,850 families in eleven states, using the Bob Jones University Press home school mailing list.  the questionnaire included thirty-seven questions and was returned by 253 of the 416 recipients.  The major conclusions were as follows:</P>
<P>1.   The father's occupation was primarily professional or self-employed; over 50 percent of the fathers were ministers (14.0); in construction (11.2; in management (10.7); salesman (7.8); or in computers (7.8).</P>
<P>2.  Both parents had graduated from high school; a surprising 45.4 percent had at least four years of college.  Again, these percentages refer to the educational level of both parents.</P>
<P>3 The mean annual income was $30,972.</P>
<P>4. Over half (51.3 percent) of the families lived in the suburbs and an additional 12.0 percent lived in urban areas.</P>
<P>5. Over 72 percent of the respondents characterized themselves as evangelical or fundamentalist in religious orientation; the average home school family attended religious services two or three times a week.</P>
<P>6. According to their questionnaire responses, home school families tended to watch television only 1.7 hours a day, compared to the national average of 3.7 hours a day.  The responses also indicated that oral reading and library visits by home schoolers greatly exceeded national averages.3 </P>
<P>In terms of why they support home schooling, home schoolers appear to fall into two major categories.  One views home schooling as predominantly a religious or philosophical issue; researcher Jane Ann Van Galen has characterized the parents in this group as the &quot;ideologues.&quot;  The second major category consists of parents who believe home schooling is superior from an educational point of view; in Van Galen's study, such parents were categorized as the &quot;pedagogues.&quot;4 </P>
<P>Although useful as an effort to describe a highly diverse group, the ideologue/pedagogue breakdown has at least two major limitations.  fist, most home schoolers cite both ideological and pedagogical reasons.  Second, the variations within the major categories are sometimes more significant than the differences between them.</P>
<P>Understandably, the studies of home schoolers agree that the latter are highly supportive of their children's education.  Although the number of home schoolers may not be very large anywhere, it would be a mistake to view their absence from the public schools primarily in quantitative terms.  Home schoolers include a disproportionate number of the kind of parents who are normally expected to provide leadership in improving education.  For whatever reason, they have used the exit instead of the voice option with respect to public schools.  In conjunction with the much larger number of parents who enroll their children in private schools, they reflect an erosion of the leadership needed to improve public schools.</P>
<H3><A ID="I6" NAME="I6">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Rationale(s) for Home Schooling</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>In some cases home schooling is justified by the unique circumstances or characteristics of individual children.  For instance, the parents may believe their child is too bright to profit from conventional schooling.  At the other extreme, a child may be so disabled that conventional instruction, even in special classes, may be futile or impractical.  Children may be experiencing difficulty in adjusting to classmates or teachers.  In other situations, parents may feel a need to protect their children from harassment or ridicule because of appearance, disability, dress, or some other idiosyncratic factor.</P>
<P>Aside from such situations, let us consider the arguments for home schooling that are not so dependent on the special characteristics, actual or assumed, of pupils being educated at home.  One way is to compare the arguments for home schooling with the arguments for vouchers.</P>
<P>The basic arguments for educational vouchers are that they would: (1) protect the religious freedom of parents and students; (2) result in taxpayer savings; (3) minimize social conflict; (4) be a civil rights protection; and (5) result in improving educational services.</P>
<P>Clearly, the first four arguments are also applicable to home schooling.  Its proponents also contend that it results in better education, albeit their reasons are different from those adduced to support vouchers, and they assert other educational arguments which do not apply to vouchers.</P>
<P>As was the case with vouchers, the foregoing arguments for home schooling are often viewed as cumulative although they may be inconsistent with each other.  For the most part, however, anyone who found one or more of these reasons persuasive in the voucher context would be likely to find them persuasive in the home schooling context as well.  In some situations these arguments are more persuasive regarding home schooling; for example, the taxpayer savings resulting from home schooling are likely to be larger than the savings from enrollments in private schools, with or without vouchers.  Since parents who have religious objections to regular schools may not have access to an appropriate school, home schooling constitutes the only feasible way to accommodate some religious objections to public school.  Home schooling would also accommodate parents who reject formal schooling, public or private.</P>
<P>I do not mean to suggest that the rationale(s) for vouchers are equally applicable to home schooling, or that acceptance of an argument for vouchers necessarily implies its acceptance for home schooling.  One can plausibly believe that the problems of regulating private schools are so different from those of regulating home schools that policies appropriate in one area are not in the other.  Nor do I intend to denigrate the importance of those arguments for home schooling that are not considered here.  Again, my focus is on educational improvement.  For this reason, the following discussion focuses on the educational improvement issues raised by home schooling.  I shall consider whether or under what conditions, if any, home schooling would help to bring out better education -- &quot;better&quot; from a secular, not a denominational standpoint.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the educational rationale for home schooling is based on dissatisfaction with private as well as public schools.  In fact, a number of studies suggest that proportionally more home schoolers have been withdrawn from private than from public schools.5 </P>
<P>Educational arguments for home schooling include the following:6 </P>
<P>1. The family is (or should be, or both) the most important educative influence on children.  compulsory school attendance undermines this influence.</P>
<P>2. Children educated at school tend to succumb to peer pressures early on, because teachers cannot interact effectively and frequently with each child individually in a conventional classroom.  The result is that children's character is formed by pressures from peers who necessarily lack (for reasons of immaturity) the values and attitudes essential for constructive personality development.  For example, youthful peers are more likely than parents to sacrifice long-range objectives for short-range gratification.  In contrast, when children are educated at home, they interact with and are guided by adults much more often than occurs in the school situation.</P>
<P>3.  Proponents of home schooling also emphasize the importance of family relationships in social and emotional development.  It is asserted that compulsory school attendance results in maternal deprivation leading to negative emotional, social, physical, and cognitive effects on children.</P>
<P>4. Advocates of home schooling also assert that it fosters constructive social development.  The contention is that a child who is educated at home will develop socially in a more positive way.  Moore's argument is typical:</P>
<P>Parents and educators usually talk about sociability, but neglect to differentiate the kind of sociability they prefer.  The child who feels needed, wanted and depended upon at home, sharing responsibilities and chores, is much more likely to develop a sense of self-worth and a stable value system -- which is the basic ingredient for a <I>positive</I> sociability.  In contrast is the <I>negative</I> sociability that develops when a child surrenders to his peers.7 </P>
<P>All of these reason support, and are supported by, the social capital hypothesis discussed in chapter 7.  Even if the reasons do not add up to a unified theory, there is considerable evidence to support them  To be sure, there is some contrary evidence.  For instance, while proponents of home schooling cite evidence that children are required to attend school too soon, its critics cite evidence that allegedly supports lowering the age of compulsory school attendance, or at least providing for earlier schooling for parents who want it.</P>
<P>The stakes involved in these issues are very large indeed.  For example, if the age at which children must begin school were raised one year, the supply of teachers would be greatly increased.  It would be more difficult for teacher unions to increase teacher salaries; union income and influence would be diminished by the reduction in the demand for teachers.  By the same token, lowering the age of compulsory school attendance would have the opposite effects.</P>
<P>Interests aside, the evidence on home schooling generally supports it for those who choose this option.  In at least one respect, this is a surprising conclusion.  Despite the relatively small number of home schoolers, they are an extremely diverse group.  As we have seen, some are motivated by religious considerations, some are not.  Even among the latter, a wide variety of secular considerations are involved.  Some home school parents object to the competition they see fostered by regular school; others believe that schools do not adequately emphasize the free enterprise system.  Some home school parents believe that schools are too distracting and too directive; others believe they can provide better guidance and direction at home.  These and other differences in motivation and rationale are reflected in the diverse curricula and pedagogical procedures found in home schools.  Some curricula emphasize acceptance of authority (mainly supernatural and parental), whereas others emphasize the importance of questioning all authority.  Once you get beyond the idea that home schooling and heavy parental involvement is preferable to formal schooling, there is little if any unanimity among home school families.  Thus from this standpoint, it seems surprising that children educated at home compare favorably to those educated in regular schools.  The research is not systematic or comprehensive, but enough is available to place the clear burden of proof on the opponents of home schooling.8 </P>
<P>From another standpoint, the evidence on home schooling is not surprising.  Previously I referred to research on the &quot;effects of education.&quot;  The leading studies, such as those conducted by Coleman, point unambiguously to the family environment as the most important variable affecting educational achievement.  Consequently, we might expect children educated at home to do well -- not necessarily because they are educated at home but because their families are most supportive of educational achievement.  For example, according to one study, 90 percent of the Connecticut children who begin a program of home instruction are already at or above their grade level.9 </P>
<P>One might argue, therefore, that even though children educated at home achieve at a higher level than those educated in regular school, the home schoolers still do not make as much progress as they would in a public or private school.  Theoretically, this is possible; politically, it would be difficult to restrict home schooling for this reason.</P>
<P>Actually, we can expect much better data on the effects of home schooling in the future.  One reason is that fourteen states either require testing or allow local school districts to test as part of the procedures for approving home schooling.  As Lines points out, cooperative relationships between public school officials and home schoolers could advance our understanding of the effects of one-to-one instruction; the effects of peer pressure; the value of teacher certification and more frequent contact with adults; and of other matters of interest.0   Needless to say, the conclusions might embarrass both public and private school teachers.</P>
<P>The evidence on the social development of children educated at home is very limited; what there is, however, supports the conclusion that home schooling results in superior development.  This is somewhat surprising, but there is a plausible basis for it, besides the obvious importance of substantial parental involvement.  Home school families are not necessarily or predominantly hermits or isolated.  They may participate in a wide range of community activities while educating their children at home.  As a matter of fact, some home schoolers participate in school-based field trips or special activities.</P>
<P>Very few children are educated at home for their entire elementary and secondary careers.  The research available does not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the effects of home schooling over various periods of time, such as one, three, five, or seven years.  Evaluations of the effects of Catholic schools are mired in controversy over the duration of the effects; some researchers assert the Catholic school advantage disappears over the long term.  Home schooling may present the opposite situation -- no visible effects over the short term but clear-cut effects over a longer period of time.  Unfortunately, research is inadequate to resolve these issues now.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the compulsory school attendance laws were enacted long before there was research on child development, maternal bonding, peer pressures, or any of the other issues now thought to be relevant to the age of compulsory attendance.  It would be serendipitous indeed if the research supported the mandated age requirements; unfortunately, the compulsory education statutes have greatly strengthened the groups with a stake in their perpetuation.  For example, kindergarten and first-grade teachers have a bigger stake in the perpetuation of early compulsory school attendance than others have in postponing it.  As so often happens, the &quot;evidence&quot; on the issue has not played a major role in shaping the policies on it and may not do so in the future.</P>
<P>Some arguments for home schooling are arguments against public education per se.  Others, however, are essentially arguments for raising the age of compulsory school attendance.  For the most part, the home schooling movement owes its existence to the fact that the compulsory education statutes require school attendance at a highly debatable early age.  The overwhelming majority of children educated at home attend school at one time or another, especially as they become older.  Home schooling is primarily an elementary-level phenomena, as even its most articulate supporters concede.  For this reason, the home schooling movement per se would be greatly diminished if the age of compulsory school attendance were raised; in that case, there would be no legal obligation on parents to operate a home school for children age six to eight, just as there is no such obligation now to educate children under the age of compulsory attendance.  To be sure, some of the arguments for home schooling would still come into play, but the number of their supporters would be greatly diminished.</P>
<P>Although recent statutory trends have been more supportive of home schooling, wide variations exist and several issues are not resolved.  The major regulatory issues involve fire, health, and safety; curriculum and instructional materials; teacher licensing; time devoted to instruction; testing and reporting student progress; and whether home schools need be licensed.  Some of these issues have arisen because statutes that apply to private schools did not anticipate the existence of home schools.  For instance, statues requiring fire drills and fire fighting equipment in private schools might be inappropriate if applied to a home school.  With the growing acceptance of home schooling, its supporters are likely to intensify their efforts to have home schools treated differently from conventional schools.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Future Of Educational Load Shedding</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Perhaps the strongest argument for load shedding is one parents seldom make.  If parents pay for the education of their children from their own income, they are much more likely to insist on performance from their children and from educational producers.  In this respect, load shedding is a more desirable public policy than vouchers; with vouchers, the parents would presumably exercise choice, but it would be choice in using a credit provided by government for a specific purpose.  Parents would not be forced to choose between more or better education and more or better food, shelter, medical care, transportation, and other goods and services.  Load shedding would require such choices; undoubtedly parents and children would show a different attitude toward education if it were paid for from personal instead of government funds.  The student who wastes time in school or cuts classes would be wasting family funds, not &quot;the government's.&quot;</P>
<P>The evidence that higher levels of effort and achievement would result from education paid from personal instead of public funds is overwhelming, in and out of education.  For example, the dropout rate is much lower in private institutions of higher education, where students have to bear a higher proportion of the costs, than it is in public institutions, where government subsidies greatly reduce the amounts paid by students.  Where employees are required to absorb or share the costs of medical services, they are much more prudent in using them; it makes a difference whether the insurance company or the patient has to pay the hospital bills.  If your car is damaged in an accident, the first question asked in estimating the repair bill is likely to be who will be paying it.  Unfortunately, public education has served the connection between the payer and the consumer, to the point where the latter lacks adequate incentives to monitor the services provided.</P>
<P>While parents do have incentives to evaluate educational services because their children are involved, these incentives are rather weak.  Parental resources are not at stake, and the difficulty of taking remedial action gravely weakens the incentives for parental involvement.  The underlying question is who should be the decision-making consumer of educational services:  the family or an appropriate government agency?  Inasmuch as education is both a collective and an individual benefit, the answer depends on which way of resolving the issue will maximize desirable outcomes.  Approached in this way, the case for load shedding may be much stronger than its low level or political support would suggest.</P>
<P>One objection to home schooling may be the substantial transaction costs it would impose on parents.  Most parents may not want to grapple with a myriad of decisions about the education of their children.  Load shedding may be attractive to a small group of activists who know what they want educationally; to others it may mean being forced to make decisions they prefer to avoid.  Whether or not his is the case, load shedding would require greater transaction costs than any other educational policy.</P>
<P>As previously noted we could maintain compulsory education while withdrawing government support for it.  The financial impact of such a policy on parents is debatable.  Compared to the amounts parents currently pay in school taxes, some would pay more, some less, and some would just about break even.  The main reason some parents would pay more is that the costs of tax-supported schools mare shared by people who are not parents of school-age children.  On the other hand, parents would also avoid the costs of educating other children, and the costs of educating their own would be limited to their years in school.  Interestingly enough, an analysis of this issue in Great Britain strongly suggested that even a working-class family with two children in school would not be demonstrably worse off by paying for education from personal funds if their taxes were reduced proportionately as the result of educational load shedding.1   Although the study is outdated and was based on survey data from another country, it suggests that state-supported education is not as favorable economically to low-income groups as is commonly assumed.  Public education is no exception to the proposition that the affluent are usually better able to reap economic advantages from our political system.</P>
<P>Indisputably, our tax supported schools have always been characterized by severe inequalities of educational opportunity.  The rhetoric of equality of educational opportunity obscures the fact that tax support for education benefits the middle class and upper classes much more than the poor.  Middle- and upper-class children tend to stay in school longer.  Public funds support the education of large numbers of marginal middle-class students who would withdraw except for the government subsidy. Their culture calls for a high school diploma and a college education.  As a result, they tend to extend their education regardless of their ability to profit from it; tax-supported education meets their needs very nicely.  Financing the education of able students from lower economic strata is not difficult; the major problems arise because public funds are used to finance the education of hordes of students from all economic strata who should be working.</P>
<P>At the present time, the existence of inequality of educational opportunity is thought to be illustrated by the fact that a lower proportion of students from the lower economic levels stay in and graduate from high school and enter and graduate from college.  Efforts to achieve equality focus on raising the proportion of low-income youth who continue and/or complete their education at various levels.  Because of the political and media influence of the education lobbies, the possibility of achieving greater equality by decreasing the proportion of economically favored youth who stay in school is ignored; it will continue to be ignored as long as the value of secondary and higher education is shielded from scrutiny and publicity.</P>
<P>The concerns frequently expressed over the number of high school and college dropouts reflect the economic interests of the education lobby far more than any genuine concern for the disadvantaged.  High school diplomas and college degrees are symbols of time serving, not of significant educational achievement.  In many cases, staying in school retards rather than fosters the skills, attitudes, and habits required for civic, social, and economic competence.  The fact that the education lobby opposes objective standards for awarding diplomas or degrees illustrates that it is more concerned about enrolling students than educating them.</P>
<P>In effect, public policy on education operates on the principle that &quot;more is better.&quot;  The upshot is a vicious circle characterized by the most benign rhetoric.  To raise the proportion of the economically disadvantaged who stay in school, larger tax subsidies are provided.  The subsidies do not and cannot eliminate the alleged inequities that led to their enactment; instead, they increase the actual transfers of funds to middle- and upper-class families.  Meanwhile, given the fact that states rely heavily on regressive taxes to finance education, the burden of support falls more heavily on those least able to bear it.</P>
<P>The way higher education is financed illustrates how the rhetoric of equal opportunity is used to rationalize public subsidies that go largely to the nonpoor.  On the one hand, higher education is advocated as an &quot;investment&quot; in future earnings.  On the other hand, institutions of higher education vigorously promote increased government absorption of the costs of such education, especially of student loans.</P>
<P>Clearly, something is amiss here. If the &quot;investment&quot; in higher education is worth it to the students, they should be able to pay back the loans.  If there is a repayment problem, perhaps the reason is that the investment was not a good one.  At the secondary level, however, taxpayers make the poor investment.  As a result, there is less concern at the family level about its costs and benefits.  Meanwhile teachers and professors benefit, even if the students do not.</P>
<P>The importance of investment in education is often justified by relying upon the distinction between public and private goods.  Education supposedly contributes to both.  If investment in it is based solely upon the private benefits, under investment in education will result.  To be candid, however, this argument is not consistent with the rhetoric directed at students.  They are urged to stay in school for their welfare, not society's.  To put it mildly, candor on this issue is not widespread.</P>
<P>In brief, we have strong reason to be skeptical of equity reasons as an objection to lad shedding.  We can always provide for those unable to pay for education.  Education lobbies are opposed to the use of a means test, allegedly because they seek to avoid stigmatizing the poor.  This argument might have made sense fifty years ago, but its relevance in the age of food stamps is questionable.  Arguably at least, the avoidance of means tests in education protects affluent taxpayers more than the sensitivities of poor families.2 </P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Home Schooling Implications for Load Shedding</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Home schooling is an anomaly.  It does not reflect a government decision to withdraw support for or provision of education.  Instead, it reflects a consumer decision that the service is not wanted or needed.  Whereas vouchers maintain the principle of government support, home schooling does not -- at least, home schoolers have not sought state aid.  In some respects they appear to have at least as strong a case for it as conventional private schools.  If a home school qualifies as a school, the case for state aid to home schools would be even stronger.  Such aid might also be justified as an element of a family rather than an educational policy.  Of course, if home schooling is subsidized, it would no longer be load shedding.</P>
<P>The most significant point about home schooling is its message that load shedding in education need not be total.  As an all-or-nothing policy, load shedding is not of any practical importance, at least for a long time to come.  Nevertheless, as we saw with voucher proposals, the basic idea can be implemented incrementally, and the possibilities for doing so add significantly to the practical value of the idea.  The history of public education in the United States underscores this point.</P>
<P>Public education as it exists today was not created de novo by a single legislative enactment.  The idea of government-supported education was not widespread, even as an idea, when our nation was founded.3   On the contrary, education was regarded as a family and church responsibility.  The moral dimensions focused on religious themes, not civic virtues.  contemporary writer who quote a founding father as supporting public education overlook the fact that such a view was a distinct minority, both conceptually and in practice.  Legislatures first enacted compulsory primary education; subsequently compulsory education was extended to higher and higher grade levels.  Today public support for higher education is more common and more substantial than support for secondary or even elementary education was earlier in our history.</P>
<P>We should also note that public schools frequently add (but seldom drop) various educational programs.  None of our early  high schools offered consumer education or sex education.  Over the years high schools have added a wide variety of programs and courses; computer education and AIDS education are two recent examples.  Home schooling raises the question of whether the incremental expansion of government support for education can be transformed into incremental contraction of it.  Many home schoolers believe that children should not be required to attend conventional school until age eight to then, instead of five or six as is the case now.  In effect, this is an argument that government should shed financial support for educating children below the age of eight.</P>
<P>Let us pursue this line of thought briefly.  We have seen that fourteen states require or allow testing as part of the procedures for resolving requests to educate at home.  For the sake of discussion, suppose that the tests show that conventional schooling for children age five to seven has no lasting effects for normal children whose parents are willing to educate them at home.  The withdrawal (or at least diminution) of government support for primary education would be a feasible political objective.  Conceivably, government might provide financial incentives to encourage home schooling while continuing to support primary schools for parents who do not exercise the home schooling option.  It is not difficult to think of several other possibilities.  Higher education is too large a target to be attacked <I>in </I><I>toto</I>, but some elements of it offer good prospects for incremental load shedding.  It is ridiculous for government to be subsidizing the costs of training physicians who will earn several million dollars over their professional careers.  Whether government guarantees fewer student loans, requires higher interest rates and more stringent payback provisions, and/or imposes stiffer penalties for fraud, it should shed or reduce its financial support for these future millionaires.</P>
<P>In brief, incremental load shedding in education can be implemented by program as well as by grade level.  Driver education is a perennial candidate for load shedding, and many others could be cited.  All over the United States students are required to take &quot;physical education&quot; courses.  These courses consist largely of normal physical exercise or athletic activity similar to that which students undertake on their own after school.  In many cases students in physical education courses are simultaneously active members of school athletic teams and simply use the courses for team practice.  In this connection, note that the for-profit sector has played a much more significant role than schools in promoting exercise and fitness.  The explosion in health and fitness services and equipment has occurred independently of school programs in physical and health education.</P>
<P>In short, if load shedding is viewed as an incremental process, not as a revolutionary educational and political change, its usefulness and political prospects would be greatly enhanced.  No matter how strong the case for load shedding, it will never happen as long as its supporters overlook the need for an incremental approach.  Because the all-or-nothing approach forces the public to shed activities which it is not prepared to give up, it forgoes opportunities to shed the clearly indefensible.  Citizens who would be receptive to raising the age of compulsory school attendance, or requiring future millionaires to pay the cost of their medical education, nevertheless balk at total load shedding of public support for education.  I am not arguing here the total load shedding of education is desirable.  Whether it is or not, it can only be achieved by shedding public support for education on an incremental basis.  Obviously, any such strategy should focus on the grades, subjects, and programs most vulnerable to public scrutiny.</P>
<P>Finally, the all-or-nothing approach unites the public education lobby in opposition whereas it might be deeply divided by an incremental approach.  In our analysis of contracting out, we noted the crucial importance of achieving the support or neutralizing the opposition of public employees and their unions.  Load shedding obviously presents the same problem, and the same flexibility is required to deal with it.  Suppose, for example, that secondary teachers were offered a 20 percent wage increase, contingent upon the elimination of the first grade or shedding physical education with adequate benefits for incumbent PE teachers.  Such approaches might have some prospects for success.  Incremental load shedding can be implemented flexibly as circumstances require; the all-or-nothing approach cannot.</P>
<P>Efforts to end government support for specific educational activities can be justified without reference to load shedding.  If a case can be made for withdrawing government support, there is no need to relate it to broader objectives, if any.  This ambiguity is one of the strengths of an incremental approach to load shedding.  It focuses attention on specifics that are favorable to it.  In contrast, efforts to shed public education per se inevitably focus on ideology, a battleground in which load shedding is at a severe disadvantage.  Most citizens simply are not prepared for any such drastic change, and advocacy of it is likely to be counterproductive for a long time to come.  Nevertheless, incremental load shedding in education could become a significant development within the next few decades.</P>
<P>In considering the future of load shedding, we need to consider the milieu in which the issues will emerge.  It is especially essential to avoid the assumption that the relevant conditions will be the same in the future as they are now.  The reactions to the spread of AIDS illustrates this different situation concerning sexual ethics, medical examinations, advertising, and sex education, to cite just a few areas of rapid change.  Policies, such as those on condom advertising, have been suddenly raised and resolved in ways that would have been out of the question only a short time ago.</P>
<P>Changing attitudes toward marriage illustrate how attitudes toward public education may also change in the near future. Support for public education declines among senior citizens.  Yet changing attitudes toward marriage are leading to declining support among young adults as well.  The average age of persons first married in 1983 reached 26.8 for men and 24.5 for women, reflecting a long-term trend toward postponing marriage.  About one in every eight Americans remains unmarried for life.  In recent years the divorce rate has exceeded the marriage rate; marriage is clearly declining as a lifetime commitment.</P>
<P>The consequences of the decline of marriage are highly adverse to public education in several ways.  Adults who are not married or who marry later tend to have fewer children.  Partly for this reason, the political objectives of unmarried or childless adults differ markedly from those of married adults with children.  The latter seek low taxes, affordable homes, and good schools.  The unmarried, or the adults who marry frequently, tend not to be so interested in home building or schools.  Furthermore, single-parent and nonfamily households require heavier expenditures for nonschool social services, such as police protection and health care.  In short, the decline in marriage results in fewer children, less parental interest in public education, weakened political support for good schools, and more spending for nonschool public services.4 </P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Load Shedding and Equality Issues</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Chapter 6 noted that rising standards of living generate support for consumer choices.  In the educational context, such support encourages load shedding, at least to some degree.  This is evident from the patterns of choice when public and private sectors provide the same or similar services.</P>
<P>Both the public and private sectors provide food, housing, and medical services.  In these cases, and many others that can be cited, the private sector provides a much greater variety of choices.  To put it bluntly, the superiority of the private sector in the regard is indisputable.  It is unrealistic to ignore this fact, or the sectoral factors which underlie it.  </P>
<P>Essentially, rising economic levels generate a dilemma for public education.  Its supporters emphasize the danger that public schools will serve only the poor if educational services are provided by market processes.  Even if the factual premise is valid, the objection is not clearly persuasive.  With food and shelter and medical care, government provides services primarily for those who cannot afford to purchase them.  Dumping ground rhetoric notwithstanding, why not follow a similar policy in education?  Equalization requires funding, and we cannot fund complete equality for all services.  We cannot fund it even for one service, unless we are prepared to limit private expenditures for it.  Outside of education, however, the issue is not perceived or treated as one of equality.  Instead, it is what level of service should be made available to those who cannot purchase it in the market.  In setting this level, educators give education a high priority.  In fact, they give it a higher priority than the disadvantaged themselves often deem appropriate.  The latter often prefer a higher level of protection from crime or a higher level of shelter over a higher level of educational funding.  It is not at all clear, at least to me, why such preferences are irrational or shortsighted.</P>
<P>The suggestion that avoidance of market processes is a cause of our educational difficulties is obviously anathema to public school educators; any such suggestion appears to threaten their economic security.  Among academics, especially in the educational reform industry, the suggestion is just as odious, since it challenges the value and intellectual level of much of their work over many years.  Difficult as it may be, a significant shift to privatization, if otherwise desirable, must avoid being held hostage to these obstacles.</P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Graying of the Population</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Our population is becoming older.  From year to year the increases are incremental; yet over a few decades the increases constitute changes of enormous magnitude.  In 1900, 4.1 percent of the population was sixty-five or over; by 1980 this group was 11.3 percent  of the total population, and it is projected to reach 13.1 percent by the year 2000.  By 2010 one of every seven Americans will be sixty-five or over; the number of persons eighty-five and over may double to 6.8 million, a remarkable 2.4 percent of the total population.5 </P>
<P>These changes are likely to affect education in several important ways.  
<BR>The needs and interests of senior citizens differ from those of children and/or younger parents.  Thus as the elderly become a larger interest group, they generate heavy pressures on public budgets for services.  It has been estimated that from 1960 to 1979, the average government expenditure (local, state, and federal combined) for each person over sixty-five was about triple the expenditure for each child.  Because the expenditures for the elderly started at a higher absolute level, maintaining the three-to-one ratio meant that expenditures per elderly person increased more in absolute terms than expenditures per child.  Since 1979, moreover, the disparity has increased substantially.  Major federal programs for children, such as federal aid to education and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), have been reduced whereas those for the elderly are still growing.  In 1987 the federal government spent at least ten times as much per senior citizen as it did per school-age child; the 1987 rush in Congress to provide assistance for catastrophic medical situations suggest that the disparity is not likely to be reduced in the near future.6   Likewise, congressional and presidential reluctance to cap Social Security entitlements in order to reduce the budget deficit (even though most of the elderly are not poor) reinforces this conclusion.</P>
<P>The enormous changes in the age composition of the population do not fully convey the declining political future of public education.  Public opinion polls show that the elderly are more likely to vote but are not as supportive of education as younger citizens.  A 1983 Gallup poll asked whether respondents would support higher taxes for schools if asked to do so by their local school board.  Among those under fifty, the answers were evenly divided among those over fifty, the responses were 62 to 28 percent opposed.7 </P>
<P>In 1988 referendum in Arizona dramatically illustrates the declining support for public education among senior citizens.  Prior to the referendum Arizona retirement communities that were not part of any school district did not pay taxes for school district operations.  As a result of the referendum, retirement communities are required to pay them.  Several communities are taking legal and political action to avoid or reduce the school taxes they will otherwise have to pay.</P>
<P>Significantly, some retirement communities opposed to paying school taxes are quite large.  For example, two such communities in Sun City do not accept residents under fifty or children under eighteen, yet have over 60,000 residents.  Only a handful of children under eighteen, deemed hardship exceptions, are permitted to live in hose communities.  Obviously, the situation also illustrates the points made in chapter 7 about age segregation in American society.8 </P>
<P>By and large, the elderly include lower proportions of disadvantaged minorities than the population as a whole.  On the other hand, the black and Hispanic proportions of the school-age population is increasing dramatically.  thus in addition to the conflicts resulting from age related needs and interests, the elderly will include a much lower proportion of citizens with family ties to school-age children.  This is likely to exacerbate the problems of financing public education.  Challenges to public spending for education will come under increasing scrutiny.  It claims to foster basic skills, good citizenship, racial and social integration -- all such claims will encounter a more skeptical if not a more hostile audience.</P>
<P>The graying of the population is especially likely to affect labor markets and the Social Security system in ways that will be conducive to shortening the period of compulsory tax-supported education.  first, employers are experiencing greater difficulty in recruiting employees for entry-level jobs.  Historically, young people have been the major source for such employees, but the supply of teenagers relative to the demand is decreasing substantially.  Despite greater utilization of senior citizens and immigrants as sources of unskilled labor, our nation is being forced to reconsider its basic policies concerning youth employment.  It may well be concluded that a great deal of the protective legislation concerning youth employment actually works against the interests of the larger society.</P>
<P>Another consideration is less immediate but potentially significant in the long run.  Our Social Security system is essentially based on intergenerational stability.  Recipients are not paid from their prior contributions but from contributions of current and future employees.  Consequently, as the proportion of recipients increases vis-&#224;-vis the proportion of contributors, the aggregate amount of claims will exceed the aggregate amount of contributions; any excess of contributions over payments from past years will not maintain the system's stability.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, several policy changes will be required to maintain the solvency of the Social Security system.  On such policy change will most inevitably be lowering the age restrictions on gainful employment.  Having large numbers of young people contribute to Social Security for three or four years more than they do now will be an important step.  Of course, it will be argued that earlier participation in the labor force is a poor long-range investment for young people and for society.  With some young people the issue can be easily resolved one way or the other.  For large numbers, however, the value of maintaining their formal education at present levels is far from clear.  In view of the pressures to increase the work span, we can anticipate heavy pressures to reduce the extent of compulsory education.  In other words, just as compulsory education resulted under pressure to increase youth participation in the labor force.  While educational organizations, especially teacher unions will adamantly oppose earlier entry into the labor force, the demographic pressures to increase years of work are likely to be decisive.9 </P>

<P>Children are more and more being viewed as the outcome of deliberate &quot;consumer&quot; decisions whose economic costs should be borne by those who make the decisions.  In my opinion, we are at the beginning, not the peak, of this change.  Nevertheless, I believe the change is an irreversible one that is certain to weaken support for public education.</P>
<P>First of all, the feminist emphasis on a woman's unqualified right to abort reinforces a &quot;consumerist&quot; attitude toward children.  Education is the major public expenditure for children.  If the decision to have children is a personal and individual one, it is more difficult to contend that government is obligated to absorb the costs of raising children.  Why should everyone else pay if the decision to have children is a personal one?  As we have seen, the 1987-88 estimated per-pupil cost in public schools was about $4,800.  On the this basis, the average public cost of educating a child through high school will exceed $100,000 in a few years.  If the decision to trigger those costs is a personal one, it will occur to many that perhaps the costs should be also.  Sooner or later, one suspects that the feminist orientation of teacher unions, with their emphasis on choice in matters related to pregnancy, will be seen as inconsistent with their anti-choice approach to education.</P>
<P>Here again, we must consider the politics as well as the substantive dimensions of the issue.  When bearing children and raising a family were the normal career patterns of women, including the more affluent and better educated ones, the political decision to support public education was easy to make.  Intentions notwithstanding, the feminist movement weakens the consensus underlying public education.  For one thing, it weakens the economic incentives for marriage as a career.  As divorce has become easier to implement and more common, more and more women seek economic security in career instead of families.  Inasmuch as children may be an obstacle to careers outside the family, it is not surprising that birth rates have declined precipitously; in 1984 the fertility rate among women twenty to twenty-four years of age declined to an all-time low, despite a sizable increase in the percentage of babies born out of wedlock among all age groups.0   A critical factor has been the decline in fertility among women oriented to careers outside of homemaking.  The thrust of the feminist movement has gone far beyond the elimination of discrimination against women; while downgrading the economic benefits of marriage, it has increased the economic opportunities for women outside the home.  Indeed, to the extent that we move to greater economic equality between men and women, we will experience increased declines in fertility rates, at least among women who make a conscious choice between homemaking and other careers.  More and more women who formerly would have been active in the PTA are pursuing careers that exclude such activity.</P>
<P>At or near the other end of the economic order, the birth rates among teenage mothers have increased or remained relatively stable.  Just as our policies have weakened the economic incentives for marriage and for raising children among the affluent, they have strengthened the incentives to bear children among poor teenage females; the United States now has by far the highest teenage birth rate of any western industrialized nation.  These higher rates are not primarily a racial phenomena; while the birth rate for white teenagers in the United States is not as high as for blacks, it is still higher than for any other industrialized nation1   In 1985 about 8.8 million single mothers were legally entitled to child support.  Only about half were receiving the amounts awarded.  About a quarter were receiving less and a quarter were receiving none.  In 1987 four million children needed to establish paternity to receive child support but only 260,000 paternity's were established nationwide.  About one in eight children are conceived by parents who are not living together; in these cases, the fathers seldom provide support of any kind.2 </P>
<P>Thus as contraception and abortion make it easy to avoid child bearing, decisions to have children at all economic levels are increasingly made independently or paternal obligation or responsibility.  I see no reason to assume that fathers who pay no child support will pay for their children's education.  Federal legislation enacted in September 1988 is intended to require them to do so, but the effectiveness of the legislation has yet to be demonstrated.  The probability is that the long-tern decline in paternal support will not be made up, or made up fully, by government or by legal actions against absentee fathers; instead, there will be a decline in the standard of living of single parents (mostly females) and their children.  This decline, or the threat of it, will exert negative pressure on birth rates, especially among more affluent and better educated women  In short, the demographics indicate an erosion of support for public education among the groups that formerly provided much of its political support and leadership.</P>
<P>To repeat, making these observations does not imply approval of them.  Indeed, I regard them as cause for deep concern.  Nonetheless, the underlying realities have a momentum of their own that cannot be ignored.  Public education emerged from a confluence of several factors:  small, homogeneous communities, widespread acceptance of traditional family styles and structures, relatively little pressure on early labor force participation, and high expectations about the effects of education.  These factors may have changed or may change too much to enable public education as we know it to survive.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>The Decline in Teacher Unions</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>As we have seen, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers constitutes the major political obstacle to privatization in any form.  AFSCME must also be viewed as an obstacle, even though its efforts may focus on support services.  In general, we can expect these unions to actively oppose privatization of either instructional or noninstructional services.</P>
<P>The political importance of this opposition will vary widely from state to state and district to district.  In some northern states, especially in large urban districts, their opposition will prevail, at leas during the early 1990s.  Yet elsewhere their opposition will be negligible, mainly in some southern and western states.  Probably in most states their opposition will be significant but not necessarily decisive.  In the long run, however, these unions are likely to be less influential than they were in the 1980s.  In fact, such a decline is already under way.  Although its end point is unpredictable, it is virtually certain to bottom out at a much lower level of union influence in political matters.  A complete analysis of the reasons unions are losing influence would take us too far afield, but a brief discussion may suffice to show why we can anticipate this outcome.</P>
<P>First of all, the union movement per se is experiencing a substantial decline.  Union membership has declined from an all-time high of 36 percent of the labor force in 1945 to 18 percent in 1986.  Only 12 percent of college graduates employed full time on a year-around basis belong to a union.  The AFL-CIO itself has sponsored several studies of the causes and possible remedies for its declining membership and influence.  Although some changes in union programs and policies may help to stabilize union membership, the basic reasons for the decline do not seem amenable to union control.  For example, the tremendous increase in part-time employment and employment at home renders union organizations much more difficult.  Competition from foreign companies means that unions have much less latitude to negotiate restrictive work rules.  As their ability to negotiate such rules declines, so does an important reason for their appeal to employees.</P>
<P>Some but not all of the reasons for union decline in the private sector apply to teacher unions.  One is that teachers are becoming more dissatisfied with their unions.  A study by C. Emily Feistritzer, director of the National Center for Education Statistics, showed that although 75 percent of teachers with twenty-five to twenty-nine years of experience are NEA members, only 55 percent of those hired in the last five years are members.  Thirty-eight percent of teachers with less than five years of experience were not members of either NEA or AFT, whereas only 14 percent of teachers with twenty-four to twenty-nine years of experience were not union members.  In the poll one-third of the teachers were dissatisfied with their national union, 27 percent with their state union, and 21 percent with their local union.3 </P>
<P>Although some factors underlying union decline in the private sector do not apply to teacher unions, one potentially critical factor raises the possibility that teacher unions will decline faster than private sector ones.  In the private sector, there is usually no organizational alternatives to unions.  The decline in unionization results from demographic or economic factors, not from competition with nonunion organizations.  In education, however, teacher unions may be seriously weakened by the growth of nonunion teacher organizations.  The potential for such growth and its implications for privatization and choice issues require some elaboration.</P>
<P>In 1988 there were about twenty state nonunion organizations of teachers.  Although most enrolled less than one thousand teachers, several enjoyed a much higher membership.  The independent Missouri State Teachers Association enrolled more members than the state affiliate of either NEA or AFT; in Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, and South Carolina the nonunion organizations enrolled a substantial number of teachers, despite the fact that many teachers in these states do not join any teacher organization.4 </P>
<P>A critical issue is whether nonunion teacher associations can increase their membership substantially in states with teacher bargaining laws.  I believe this is possible, but the outcome depends on several factors that are unpredictable at this time.  In membership, resources, and political support, the nonunion associations are in a much stronger position than was the AFT at the advent of teacher bargaining.  Although they are not likely to support privatization, their positions on it are likely to depend primarily on whether proposals along these lines actually threaten teachers in service.  As we have seen, this will depend largely on the specifics of the proposals and the way they are introduced.  Expansion of nonunion associations would facilitate efforts to involve the private sector in more effective ways.  Minimally, the nonunion association are not likely to act as if the skies are falling every time vouchers are mentioned.</P>
<P>As the proportion of parents with school-age children declines, so will the proportion of teachers in the labor force and the political influence of teacher unions.  The latter are trying to maintain their numbers and influence by organizing day care centers, but it is doubtful whether their efforts along this line will be successful.  To solve their own problems of declining enrollments, institutions of higher education will encourage earlier entry into higher education, thus weakening the ability of teacher unions to maintain the market for teachers below the college level.  Everything considered, teacher unions will be hard pressed to maintain their share of a shrinking market for classroom teachers.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Load Shedding and the Day Care Movement</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P> On its face the day care movement seems to contradict may analysis of lad shedding.  Clearly, day care supporters in both major parties are seeking to expand government functions.  As we have seen, the major obstacle to federal support for day care is whether parents or public agencies should control how the funds would be spent.  Over the past fifty years, government has been replacing the family as the major source of support for the aged, the ill, the disabled, the unemployed, and other special populations.  In this sense, the day care movement reflects a longtime trend toward government displacement of families as a source of financial support.  I do not believe, however, that the day care movement invalidates my previous analysis.  Education is an enormous institution which is constantly characterized by some countercyclical trends.</P>
<P>Government financial support for day care is contrary to load shedding but might nevertheless encourage privatization.  If federal support for day care is made available through vouchers or tax credits, its overall effect would be to strengthen these policies for school-age children.  Such an outcome would reconcile the apparent willingness of the American people to increase spending for social services.</P>
<P>Finally, the possibility remains that private delivery of educational services funded by government may be far less effective than is anticipated.  In brief, the major criticisms of both public education and voucher systems may have merit.  What then?  By a process of elimination, we may be forced to reconsider whether education should be treated differently form food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities which parents buy for their children.  Eventually, we may conclude that parent purchase of educational services from parent funds is preferable to either the existing system or the alternatives currently receiving the most attention.

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>11 Ethical and Policy Issues in Education for Profit</B></FONT></A></H2>
<P><B>T</B>eaching is widely regarded or referred to as a &quot;profession.&quot;  Ideally, professionals act in the best interests of their clients.  In business, however, the welfare of the customer is secondary.  A doctor who recommends surgery because he would profit thereby would be considered unethical, regardless of the effect of such surgery on his practice.  In contrast, an automobile salesman who persuaded customers to purchase expensive but unnecessary optional equipment is ordinarily considered a successful salesman, not an unethical one.  The business firm may guide customers away form unwise purchases, but it does so to retain the customers or avoid damage to its reputation.  For this reason the operative principle in business is the welfare of the seller, not the customer.</P>
<P>The extent, if any, to which professional ethics differ in practice from business ethics is a matter of dispute.   Clearly, however, public opinion assumes that professions adhere or should adhere to a higher standard of conduct than business firms.  Education is one of the professions that is expected to adhere to such higher standards, imprecisely defined as they may be.  Consequently, we need to consider the ethical or professional implications of any trend toward education for profit.</P>
<P>Most ethical problems in the professions involve conflicts of interest, situations in which action on behalf of one party is actually or potentially contrary to the interests of another party.  Financial gain or loss is not always an issue.  Teachers who devote classroom time to one student may be acting contrary to the interests of others with greater need for individual attention.</P>
<P>For our purposes, the most important conflicts of interest are those involving teacher or owner interests on the one hand and student/parent interests on the other.  Such conflicts already exist under public operation of schools.  Student welfare may call for individual attention after school; teacher welfare calls for teachers to be released from service immediately after the last regular class.</P>
<P>In the commercial world, the existence of conflicts of interest is taken for granted, as is the presumption that each party will, or has the right to, maximize its own interests.  Even in the commercial world, however, in some situations conflicts of interest are not tolerated or must be resolved in certain ways.  The rules prohibiting &quot;insider trading&quot; illustrate this point; corporate officials are prohibited from purchasing or selling stock in their corporation on the basis of information not available to shareholders.</P>
<P>All of the established professions have adopted rules or codes of ethics that are intended to avoid or mitigate conflicts of interest.  Attorneys are not normally allowed to represent both parties in legal transactions; to do so would raise the possibility that one party or the other would not receive the full benefits of representation.  Currently, the NEA code of professional ethics and the codes of several of its state affiliates state that &quot;Educators . . . shall not use professional relationships with students for private advantage.&quot;  Such rules are enforced, however, by school managemtn, if they are enforced at all.</P>
<P>Public opinion often treats the differences between professional and business ethics as a matter of individual character.  That is, the differences in conduct are ascribed to differences in the kind of individuals who enter various occupations.  In this view, professional workers are more idealistic or more dedicated to service than their business counterparts; the latter are supposedly driven by greed or profits.  This attitude is common among teachers, who often assert that they prefer helping children grow over earning a higher income.</P>
<P>Such rhetoric notwithstanding, there is little justification for the idea that &quot;professionals&quot; are a different breed.  As far as teachers are concerned, it is very doubtful whether their conduct is any less self-serving than the conduct of businesspeople; as pointed out in chapter 6, teachers have frequently exploited their students not only in strike situations but in other contexts as well.  More important, and aside from the fact that business ethics sometimes provide better consumer protection than professional ethics, any differences in conduct between the professions and business are due to occupational structure and culture, not personality factors.  This point does not contradict my previous comment that sectoral status is not a reliable guide to individual conduct.</P>
<P>If adherence to professional standards was mainly due to personality factors, the change from a professional to a business context would not matter very much.  Presumably, the individual who places client welfare above personal gain would continue to do so regardless of context.  If, however, context is the controlling factor, changes in it can be expected to have significant implications for relationships with service recipients, whether they are labeled &quot;customers&quot; or &quot;clients.&quot;</P>
<P>On several occasions I have cited developments from health care that appear to shed some light on educational issues.  Perhaps no aspect of medical practice is more useful in this regard than the effects of a business orientation on medical ethics and practice.  Medical ethics are widely regarded as a model of professional conduct.  At the same time, for-profit enterprise has become the dominant mode in many aspects of health care.  For these reasons, and with the usual caveats about analogies, it will be helpful to review the changes in medical ethics for their educational implications.</P>
<P>Let me first illustrate the kinds of problems that would raise concerns about greater reliance on for-profit organizations.  A brief historical note may provide a helpful point of departure.   The first teachers in western culture (the Sophists) were fee takers; Protagoras, the most renowned among them, waived his fees for students who swore that his instruction had not been helpful.  Needless to say, few if any contemporary teachers would accept such a standard.  In any case, this bit of history suggests that education for profit has some roots in the educational practice and traditions of western civilizations.  Second, it also suggests that for-profit enterprise is not necessarily characterized by standards of conduct that are morally inferior to &quot;professional&quot; standards.</P>
<P>Neither business nor professional ethics condones outright falsehoods.  There appear, however, to be significant differences in the duty of disclosure.  Businesspeople are not ethically obligated to disclose the negative features of their product or service.  In contrast, physicians are expected to inform patients about the disadvantages of treatment that might lead a patient to reject it.  What policy would govern teachers in schools for profit?</P>
<P>A physician who sees another physician using a wrong procedure is obligated to alert the erring practitioner.  Similarly, teachers also would do so in the normal course of events.  Suppose, however, several for-profit educational companies are competing for students.  company <I>A</I> realizes that its competitors are relying on outdated information or teaching methods.  If the welfare of students is paramount, company <I>A</I> should inform its competitors.  From a business standpoint, however, the company would say nothing; it would be to its advantage to have its competition rely on outdated information or ineffective procedures.  To cite another likely scenario, a profit-making school would enroll students in a certain program even though a competitor has a better one, thus working contrary to the students' best interests.</P>
<P>Historically, medical practice has not always been clearly distinguished from commercial practice.  Anglo-American medical ethics has always held that physicians should act in best interests of patients; this principle can be traced all the way back to the Hippocratic tradition.  At the same time, nothing in our medical traditions requires physicians to provide their services on a philanthropic basis.  While physicians could ethically decline to provide service, once they elect to provide it, the patient's welfare was to be the guiding criterion.  Interestingly enough, physicians in ancient Greece avoided hopeless cases that would damage their reputations and jeopardize the market for their services.</P>
<P>In American medical history, the potential conflicts between the service and commercial dimensions of medical practice were largely ignored until the twentieth century.  When such attention emerged, it prohibited or warned against treating medical practice as a business.  In fact, even the appearance of commercialization was condemned.  Thus the AMA's first code of ethics, adopted in 1847, prohibited advertising, the holding of patents, and the dispensing of &quot;secret nostrums.&quot;  At the same time, however, the purpose of the code was not to control physician behavior.  Instead, it was to distinguish physicians from quacks and charlatans who engaged in the practices proscribed by the AMA.</P>
<P>Whatever its origins, hostility to business practices is no longer evident in the AMA code of professional ethics.  In many cases the code now accommodates business practices that were previously prohibited.  Some examples follow.</P>
<P><B>Advertising</B>  The prohibition against advertising has been changed to a provision that physicians &quot;should not solicit patients.&quot;  this change occurred in part as a reaction to a lawsuit against the AMA by the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that its prohibition of advertising was a restraint on competition.  Regardless of any legal issues, a shift to for-profit companies in education might change the content of advertising but not its utilization.  Public and nonprofit schools and organizations already advertise extensively; in fact, the longest running advertisement in the field of education is probably the weekly column in the Sunday <I>New York Times</I> sponsored by the American Federation of Teachers.</P>
<P><B>Patents</B>  The AMA's initial position, adopted in 1847, asserted that &quot;It is derogatory to professional character . . . for a physician to hold a patent for any surgical instrument or medicine.&quot;  In 1981 the AMA adopted a completely opposite provision:  &quot;It is not unethical for a physician to patent a surgical or diagnostic instrument.&quot;   Analogously, such a provision would allow educators to patent teaching devices, diagnostic instruments, or any other otherwise patentable product used in schools.  Inasmuch as no restriction now exists, no change in practice would be involved.</P>
<P><B>Dispensing Pharmaceuticals</B>  Obviously, if physicians are allowed to sell the drugs they prescribe, they might prescribe and sell drugs on the basis of their own profit, not patient welfare.  Since 1957, however, the prevailing principle has been:  &quot;Drugs, remedies or appliances may be dispensed or supplied by the physician provided it is in the best interest of the patient.&quot;   Needless to say, this is not much of a restriction as long as the dispensing physician is the one who decides what is &quot;the best interest of the patient.&quot;  In education, this posture would allow teachers or education companies to sell various products to students; for example, music teachers could sell instruments.  Where restrictions on such sales currently exist in education, they are due to school board policies, not to the policies or standards of teacher organizations.</P>
<P><B>Fee Splitting</B>  Fee splitting is a pervasive issue in medical practice because general practitioners often guide patients to specialists.  Is it ethical for a specialist to compensate a general practitioner from fees paid the specialist?  Despite some earlier emphasis on the evils of secrecy rather than fee splitting per se, the practice itself is still deemed unacceptable in the AMA code.  In this respect, the prohibition against fee splitting, which seems to be weakening, is an exception to the tendency to ease the restrictions on business practices.</P>
<P> A prohibition against fee splitting would prohibit teachers from receiving compensation for referring students to educational specialists.  This would be a significant limitation.</P>
<P><B>Ownership of Health Facilities</B>  Physician ownership of hospitals has always been accepted.  In recent years physician ownership of pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, and laboratories has increased considerably.   At the same time the AMA deems it unethical for physicians to allow their practice to be influenced by such ownership.  The outcome has been rather ambiguous.  Currently physicians can share in the profits of facilities they own (in whole or in part), but their compensation as physicians ethically cannot be geared directly to their referrals as physicians.  Many observers view this as a distinction without a difference, or much difference.</P>
<P>For several years the AMA emphasized the importance of professional control over hospitals; it Judicial Council held at one time that &quot;A physician should not dispose of his professional attainments or services to any hospital, corporation, or lay body by whatever name called or however organized under terms or conditions which permit the sale of service of that physician by such an agency for a fee.&quot;  This language was deleted from the AMA code of ethics in 1981; no reason was offered for the omission.  Obviously, any restrictions on teacher-owned schools, camps, learning centers, testing preparation facilities, and other profit-making centers could be a major limitation on education for profit.  Experience in health care, however, suggests that such limitations are not likely to survive a large shift to privatization.</P>
<P>As Georgetown University ethicist Robert M. Veatch points out, the ethical obligations of physicians increasingly are being defined in terms of patient rights instead of patient welfare of interests.  There is a heavy emphasis on physician control of medical decisions, including fees, but business involvement is acceptable if physicians maintain such control.  In Veatch's words, &quot;Nowhere in all of the professional literature of Anglo-American medical ethics is there any condemnation of the profit motive in the practice of medicine.  In fact. . . the AMA has viewed the question of whether an institution is making a profit on the physician's services as irrelevant to whether the arrangement is ethical.&quot; </P>
<P>The changes in medical ethics just discussed raise a question that soon may become important in education:  Did the changes in medical ethics precede and pave the way for changes in practice, or did the changes merely ratify irreversible changes that had already occurred?  Undoubtedly both patterns have been operative, but it appears that the ratification pattern was predominant.  For example, as the result of changes in medical technology and the sources of medical revenues (especially the tremendous growth of payments by government and insurance companies), more doctors enjoy more opportunities than ever before to earn substantial income from practices previously prohibited or discouraged.  It has become increasingly difficult for the AMA to maintain ethical standards that conflict with the interests of a larger and larger proportion of its members.  In effect, the standards could not survive the opportunities of doctor-owned profit centers, such as laboratories, testing centers, and nursing homes.  Granted, some of the changes in medical ethics are not desirable from a client point of view.  Again, however, it must be emphasized that we are dealing with system issues.  If education for profit plays a larger role in the future, competition and disclosure may protect students and parents just as adequately, if not more so, than reliance on professional ethics.  Let us see why this may be the case.</P>
<H3><A ID="I2" NAME="I2">
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>Competition Versus Regulation as a Student Safeguard</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Within the public school establishment, regulation by state and local authorities is viewed as the primary means of safeguarding student interests.  Whatever goes or might go awry is supposed to be brought to the attention of state and local public officials.  These officials will then remedy the problem by administrative or regulatory measures, including legislation if need be. Regulation is also viewed as  the means of safeguarding the interests of children in private schools.  The nonprofit, especially denominational, status of private schools is also deemed to protect student.  </P>
<P>At the same time, competition as a means of protection is virtually ignored, especially when denominational considerations are paramount.  As previously noted, consumer ability to compare price and quality is an essential element of competition.  We have also seen that is more difficult to compare the quality of human services than of products, such as television sets or vacuum cleaners.  On the other hand, whether choice in education is feasible depends on its cult to compare than products (if indeed they are).  Most people believe they can recognize the difference between good and poor teachers.  Granted, this is not equivalent to recognizing the difference between good and poor schools, but it is surely an important component of such recognition.</P>
<P>In any event, our difficulties in comparing schools may be partly due to the lack of incentives to make such comparisons.  The vast majority of parents have no practical incentive to compare schools.  If you cannot afford either a Mercedes or a Rolls-Royce, you are less likely to have nay interest in, and therefore any capability of, comparing and choosing between them.  If our comparison was intended to lead to purchase, you would undoubtedly become better informed about the options.  By the same token, the ability of parents to compare and choose among schools might be greatly enhanced if the choice was intended to lead to action.</P>
<P>The analogy may not be persuasive.  Persons who can purchase $35,000 automobiles are usually quite able to look after their interests in such matters.  What about individuals who have to buy an inexpensive subcompact or a used car?  There appears to be heavy competition for such purchases, yet some states have recently enacted &quot;lemon laws&quot; to protect car buyers form unscrupulous car salesmen.  Indeed, it might be argued that fierce competition has made it so difficult to earn a profit that salesmen have had to adopt unethical tactics.</P>
<P>Although the preceding point has merit, it does not necessarily mean that competition among schools would lead to undesirable outcomes.  Some care salesmen can survive by squeezing every penny from one-shot deals in which the customer is virtually defrauded.  It would be much more difficult for a school to survive this way.  Even if they did not withdraw their children immediately, most parents would not reenroll their children in a school that exploited to the hilt every short-term possibility for maximizing profits.  Furthermore, it would be very difficult for such a school to attract a new complement of students every year at every grade level.</P>
<P>For that matter, we can question the assumption that competition must be at the school level.  Theoretically at least, we could leave the structure of public education largely intact while fostering competition among teachers.  To see how, suppose that instead of employing teachers, school boards rented space in school buildings to them.  Suppose also that teachers were free to set their own fees; teachers who were in great demand could charge more than teachers who were not.  Such a system might be tied to a plan for divisible vouchers, so that part of the voucher credit could be used to pay mathematics teachers, part to pay science teachers, and so on.</P>
<P>Such a system could stimulate competition among teachers -- most of whom would be adamantly opposed to it for that reason.  Needless to say, teacher unions would be also.  Nonetheless, such a system might be more efficient and more desirable than competition at the school level.  among its potential advantages are the following:</P>
<P>1. It would attract more resources into education under conditions conducive to their more efficient use.  Parents who may be willing to pay more for particular teachers may be unable to do so if their choice is limited to schools.</P>
<P>2. Class size and room size could be coordinated more efficiently.</P>
<P>3 Parents would probably devote more effort to deciding what they want from education and how much they are willing to pay for what they want.</P>
<P>4. Teacher accessibility to and cooperation with parents would be greatly enhanced.  Teachers would have no interest in collective bargaining contract that limit their accessibility to parents to  a few evening and/or afternoon meetings a year.</P>
<P>5. Teachers would have greater control over their work and work schedules.</P>
<P>6. Insofar as the market would be an accurate guide, better teachers would be paid more; others would be paid correspondingly less.</P>
<P>A major objection to such a system would be that enrollments might reflect the entrepreneurial instead of the educational abilities of teachers.  I regard this as more of a short- than a long-range problem, but the danger exists.  Probably the other major  objection would be that such a system would lead to greater social class segregation than exists.  Although such an outcome is possible, it is by no means certain.  More important, the increased efficiency and productivity of the system as a whole might justify any negative change along this line. </P>
<P>From a public policy perspective, we can say that both competition and regulation have a role to play in consumer protection.  I do not mean to imply that the affluent rely on competition and the less affluent on regulation, although consumer protection in some situations follows this pattern.  In education, however, we rely almost exclusively on regulation to protect students and taxpayers. The possibility that competition might be a more effective way to provide such protection is virtually ignored.  Even discussions of vouchers and tuition tax credits do not address seriously the role of competition.  Because most family choice proponents are from the nonprofit sector and envisage assistance to private schools, not competition among them, they have also failed to present the case for competition in a serious way.  On both sides, &quot;competition&quot; is a slogan, not an idea worthy of serious analysis.</P>
<P>This is unfortunate, especially because most citizens do not realize how ineffectual educational regulation has turned out to be.  If more courses in science and mathematics are required for a high school diploma, school districts relable courses so the latter can be counted to meet the requirement.  If a certain grade-point average is required for athletic eligibility, grading standards are lowered to avoid the requirement.  If schools must be open a certain number of days, &quot;days&quot; are interpreted very liberally.  If a district can employ noncertified teachers only in an &quot;emergency,&quot; &quot;emergency&quot; is interpreted very loosely.  If textbooks are required to be up to date, publishers make cosmetic changes and change the copyright date.</P>
<P>In short, the regulatory approach is frequently characterized by loopholes and inadequate enforcement -- and it is doubtful whether rigorous enforcement without any loopholes would improve matters.  I am not asserting the desirability of completely avoiding regulation.  Instead, my point is that the effectiveness of regulation is widely exaggerated, and that competition in some situations may be a more effective way to achieve the objectives of educational regulation. </P>
<P>A critical point, often overlooked, is that the absence of regulation does not affect denominational and independent schools in the same way.  Denominational schools are accountable to their parent denominations.  Independent private schools, however, enjoy freedom from both state and denominational regulation.  The upshot is that such schools operate under minimal safeguards of any kind.</P>
<P>In many quarters, independent private schools are regarded as &quot;elite&quot; institutions of elementary and secondary education.  No doubt some of these schools are outstanding, but reason and personal experience suggest that our worst schools, public or private, are private independent schools.   The deficiencies in these schools tend to escape public scrutiny; they would be less likely to do so if voucher plans were enacted.  On the contrary, we could expect some exposes followed by demands for increased regulation of private schools.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, I do not accept as foreordained the idea that vouchers would automatically lead to greater state regulation of private schools.  There was no significant increase in regulation of grocery stores or medical practice as a result of food stamps or Medicare.  Many public institutions of higher education are not closely regulates; even private ones receiving substantial support from government are not subject to close state or federal regulation.  Significantly, there is the least regulation of private schools in some states which provide the most government assistance for them.  Increased regulation under a voucher system may not result form demands for greater accountability.  Such demands will be made and they will be a factor.  The main problem, however, would be the political objections to funding both public and private schools while closely regulating only the former.  In other words, the inconsistency in regulation might have to be resolved by increased regulation of private schools, regardless of any need for it.</P>
<P>Another possibility is to tie the degree of regulation to the level of government support.  As noted in chapter 2, the President's commission on Privatization recently recommended this approach and some nations have adopted it.  Apart from the specifics, it is not feasible to assess such policies, but they may receive more attention than in the past.  In any event, the nonprofit status of private schools may lead to increased regulation of them, independently of government financial support for them.  Because of its growth, the nonprofit sector is coming under greater scrutiny and regulation.  As a result, public policy may evolve in the direction of a comprehensive rather than an industry-by-industry approach to nonprofit organizations.  Any such trend would probably affect nonprofit schools adversely.  When regulation is industry by industry, the regulated industries are better able to control, or strongly influence, the regulatory agency.  For example, if occupational licensing is regulated by separate agencies, the occupations regulated have more influence over the agencies that concern them than if a single state agency regulated all licensing.  The 1987 scandals concerning certain television ministries may well result in greater scrutiny and skepticism concerning nonprofit organizations generally.  Historically, once public attention begins to focus on a neglected area, the fallout is much broader than the initial focus of attention.</P>
<P>Although the possibility is seldom discussed, family choice plans might lead to less regulation of public schools.  The reason is that the absence of regulation may be an important factor underlying any private school educational superiority.0   The policy implication is to reduce the regulation of public schools, whether or not family choice plans re enacted.  Of course, no matter how desirable in theory, deregulation would be difficult to achieve.  It would be necessary to identify those aspects of regulation which impair public school effectiveness.  At that point, influential interest groups with a stake in the status quo would oppose deregulation.  That is probably the main reason why it receives so little attention from legislators.  The latter are searching for what may not exist, a way of improving education that does not arouse influential interest group opposition.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47>  <B>The Outlook for Regulation by &quot;the Profession&quot;</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Some observers believe that the deficiencies of government regulation point to the need for a different kind of regulation --<I>self-regulation </I>by teachers as a profession.  This point of view is expressed in a variety of ways, such as the need to &quot;empower teachers&quot; or &quot;to replace bureaucratic control by professional control,&quot; or by some other phraseology that suggest teachers should control education.1 </P>
<P>Although arguments for teacher control usually strike a responsive chord among teachers, careful analysis suggest several major objections to any such development.  In the first place, delegating responsibility for policy and administrative decisions to teachers as a group creates an insoluble dilemma.  All individuals in the group cannot be held accountable for group action since some individuals may have opposed it.  For accountability to be meaningful, individuals must be responsible for their own actions, not for the actions of others.  Thus to avoid being unfair to individuals in the group, collective responsibility often deteriorates into collective irresponsibility.</P>
<P>Second, arguments for &quot;empowering teachers&quot; or self-regulation by teachers rely on the fee-taking professions as models.  Such reliance ignores the fact that the need for a viability of self-regulation in fee-taking professions differs significantly from its need and viability for salaried professionals subject to single employer supervision.  A fee taker may have dozens, even hundreds of clients (employers); it is simply impractical for any one employer to supervise professional workers.  This is not the case when one employer (the school district) employs a large number of professional employees (teachers).  The notion that supervision of teachers is unwarranted because professionals should not be supervised merely avoids teacher accountability under the rhetoric of professionalism.</P>
<P>An impressive body of evidence indicates that self-regulation by the professions has been used as much or more to advance the professionals' welfare as to advance the public interest.2   Whatever one's assessment of this evidence, self-regulation is likely to be even less effective in education.  In the first place, teachers do not have an affective code of ethics or a tradition of observing one.  Generally speaking, it is school management's responsibility to ensure that teachers do not engage in conduct prejudicial to student interests.  For example, school boards and school administrators, not teacher unions, are responsible for ensuring that teachers avoid commercial relationships with their students.  Turning over this responsibility to teachers (in effect, to teacher unions) would leave the public without any feasible way of preventing or remedying abuses.</P>
<P>Despite contentions that teachers are stifled by state legislation, most such legislation affecting teachers promotes their welfare.  Legislation on teacher tenure, retirement, leaves, and collective bargaining illustrate this point.  State legislation restricting teaching methods or materials is virtually nonexistent.  The limitations on teachers that do exist are usually the result of limitations on school officials.  For example, if a state requires that textbooks be selected from a state-approved list, teachers will necessarily be limited in their choice of textbooks.  Realistically, however, very little state legislation infringes on the freedom of teachers in the classroom.</P>
<P>The alleged desirability of developing an autonomous, self-regulated teaching profession fails to take account of the implications of teacher unionization.  Teachers are heavily unionized, perhaps more so than any other major occupational group in our nation.  Legally and practically, teacher unions exist to represent teachers on wages and terms and conditions of employment.  The union role is very similar to the role attorneys play in our legal system.  Attorneys represent clients and client interests, not the public interest; likewise, unions represent employees and employee interests.  This does not mean that unions always act in the short-range interests of the employees they represent, any more than lawyers always act to maximize the short-range interests of their clients.  Regardless, we should not allow special interest groups or organizations to exercise legal authority over policies affecting the public interest.</P>
<P>Here again, a bit of history is instructive.  Prior to the advent of collective bargaining in the early 1960s, the NEA and many of its affiliated state associations had adopted codes of professional ethics.3   Although code enforcement was minimal at best, there was at least a symbolic recognition that &quot;professionals&quot; were supposed to adhere to a higher standard of conduct than ordinary employees.</P>
<P>Collective bargaining put an end to this line of thought.  Legally and practically, teacher unions are the defender and promoter of teacher interests.  As such, they should not also be accorded the legal authority to represent the public interest.  Although the rhetoric of teacher unions portrays them as protector of the public interest, adherence to the rhetoric would lead to intractable problems.  Teachers do not pay hundreds of dollars annually in union dues so that unions can discipline or dismiss unethical or incompetent teachers.  When an accused person employs an attorney, the latter is not expected to help public authorities send the person to jail.</P>
<P>By the same token, teachers pay the union to protect their interests; protection of the public interest is management's job.  The principles involved are not affected by the fact that teacher unions sometimes support policies which are in the public interest.  Attorneys sometimes assert correctly that their clients are &quot;not guilty,&quot; but occasional congruence between client interest and public interest does not justify giving defense attorneys the authority to decide cases involving their clients.</P>
<P>In practice, teachers support student interests when it is in the teachers' interests to do so, but not otherwise.  Thus teachers support smaller class size ostensibly as a student benefit; at the same time, they oppose any weakening of tenure protections, no matter how indefensible they may be.  The problem is not merely that the union role of defender of teacher interests fundamentally conflicts with the role of the public interest.  It is that as matters stand, teachers, acting through their unions, have far too much power to veto or eviscerate changes to which they are opposed.  The reasons for this conclusion have been spelled out in considerable detail elsewhere, and I shall not repeat them here.4   It should be noted, however, that the advocates of &quot;teacher empowerment&quot; or &quot;self-regulation by the profession&quot; rarely specify what actions teachers cannot take that justify self-regulation.  Insistence on straightforward answers to this question would go a long way toward resolving controversies over it.</P>
<P>Finally, and most important, teacher self-regulation violates the concept of democratic representative government.  Whether we are referring to the state or local level, educational policy is public policy.  Public policy should be made by duly elected representatives of the public, not by representatives of an interest group with the most to gain from its control of public policy.  Although this objection to teacher self-regulations implicit in some of the proceeding comments, it needs to be stated explicitly.  Even if teachers were not unionized, self-regulation by teachers, whether of personnel matters or educational policies, is inconsistent with the underlying principles of representative government.5 </P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Information Issues in Education for Profit</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>As this is written, the U.S. Department of Transportation has required airlines to publicize the percentage of flights from specified airports that arrive and depart on time.  Airline companies with a favorable  ranking in these data are already doing so in their advertisements.  This example shows that government can play an important role in fostering effective competition.  In education, this role calls for three basic policies.  First, government has to create a market for competing educational suppliers.  Second, it must provide for sectoral neutrality; specifically, it must avoid placing conditions or restrictions on education for profit that create competitive advantages for nonprofit schools.  Finally, government policy should require, or at least encourage, disclosure of relevant data from all schools, public and private.</P>
<P>In dealing with these issues, we must recognize that the parents' information needs differ to some extent from those of educational policymakers.  The latter may want to know how much public revenue is lost because of tax exemptions for nonprofit schools; parents choosing a school are not likely to be interested in this issue.  Parents may be interested in whether a school requires tuition to be paid in advance in full or if it can be paid in monthly installments; policy makers are not likely to get involved in such issues.</P>
<P>In medicine, prior disclosure of the risks associated with a course of treatment is extremely important.  The doctor who does not inform patients of the risks of treatment may be inviting a malpractice suit.  Life-threatening or crippling situations are relatively infrequent in education; even in incompetent teachers do not kill or irrevocably cripple students for life.</P>
<P>Parent information needs would fall into three major categories.  First, information is needed to help parents decide which school offers the best value for the money.  Second, parents need information to identify and protect their interests in conflict-of-interest situations.  finally, parents need information that will help them evaluate school performance as it affects their children.</P>
<P>In both business and the professions, mandatory disclosure of conflicts of interest is often used to protect consumers and clients.  Although not a comprehensive solution, mandatory disclosure would certainly be an important safeguard in some situations.  For example, whenever a school or teacher recommends an outside product or service vendor and also receives a commission or rebate from those vendors, prior disclosure of this fact should be required.</P>
<P>Mandatory disclosure would have two desirable outcomes.  First, it would help parents decide for themselves whether seeking a better deal elsewhere would be worth the effort.  For example, if a school recommends a transportation service, parents would be more likely to investigate alternatives if they knew that the school received commissions from the service.  Second, parents would be in a better position to negotiate improvements in service or costs if they were aware of any kickback arrangement.  Mandatory disclosure of such arrangements need not necessarily replace other measures to protect parents, but it could be a major step in this direction.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Disclosure and School Performance</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>To some extent, parents and policy makers do have the same or similar information needs.  Just as car buyers and government agencies have an interest in automobile mileage ratings, parents and government agencies (local, state, and/or federal) have an interest in the performance of schools.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to judge school performance.  What data about schools would serve the same purpose as the mileage data about new cars required by the EPA?  The EPA data is not all car buyers consider, and its importance varies from one buyer to another.  Still, the data provide a relatively clear-cut and important standard available to anyone interested in buying a new car.</P>
<P>Student achievement would not be a very useful indictor of school performance for several reasons.  First, it is affected more by nonschool factors than by school ones.  Second, the technical problems in distinguishing school from nonschool effects are extremely difficult, especially in the short run or on a school-by-school basis.  Furthermore, even if these problems are resolved satisfactorily, the answers may not be helpful as a guide to parental choice.  For example, it may be that school <I>X</I> has performed very well in recent years.  Suppose, however, that several teachers who taught at school <I>X</I> have recently retired or accepted employment elsewhere.  In that case, even accurate judgments about school performance in the past might not be reliable guides to future performance.</P>
<P>The technical issues in comparing school performance are formidable enough, but the political ones may be even more troublesome.  To see why, consider the political differences between EPA and school officials as they relate to performance indicators.  The EPA does not manufacture automobiles.  Its performance as a public agency is based on the accuracy of its ratings, not whether cars are gas guzzlers or are highly fuel efficient.  In contrast, the school authorities who control the data collection process have a very large stake in the test scores they report.  In effect, they are being asked to provide data that can be used to challenge their own performance.  As a matter of fact, when the National Assessment of Educational Progress was established in 1980, state superintendents of education successfully insisted that test data not be used to compare educational achievement on a state by state basis.  This opposition to disaggregating national data on a state basis persisted until 1985, when the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) voted to support such comparisons.6 </P>
<P>Even the state comparisons are likely to be suspect if they reveal average test scores for school districts or individual schools.  Certain categories of students who are likely to receive low scores -- for example, non-English speaking children -- may have been excluded from the test sample.  When this happens, it may be impossible to know whether an increase in average test scores is due to better teaching or to the greater selectivity of the test sample. The importance of this point is underscored by the fact that approximately one-half to two-thirds of the decline in test scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test from 1964 to 1975 was due to the fact that a larger number of low-ability students took the tests after 1964.7   Taking this into account, a former U.S. Commissioner of Education has even argued that the overall decline in SAT scores conceals educational <I>improvement</I> rather than reveals educational deterioration, as contended by virtually all of the reform reports.8 </P>
<P>What information should schools be required to disclose?  Despite the possibility, even the likelihood, of some abuse, I believe data on student achievement should be disclosed.  In addition, I would require aggregate data on, among other things, student grades, the number and duration  of suspensions and expulsions, the number of years teachers have taught at the school, the number of days teachers and students have been absent, employment and college admission data, and class size.  I cite these merely as suggestions, in the expectation that experience will lead to improvements in the data used to evaluate schools.  Of course, the information should be available on a schoolwide, not an individual basis.</P>
<P>While disclosure issues are important, it is not feasible to analyze them here in detail.  Before leaving this topic, however, let me suggest some basic considerations that should guide our policies toward the subject.  First, it should be recognized that public school organizations have themselves created some of the problems that arise out of disclosure.  In the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the educational community has repeatedly claimed that what schools do is the major factor affecting educational achievement.  Yet according to the evidence, nonschool factors, especially family and home conditions, play a much more important role than school factors in educational achievement.9   When school data reflects low achievement, teachers and school officials fear that they will be held accountable for results they cannot control.  This would not be a problem, or so much of one, if public school rhetoric had been more realistic in the past.  In seeking public funds, the educational community asserts that good schools will produce literate graduates, skilled workers, and well-informed citizens.  When the evidence is clear that substantial numbers of students cannot read after twelve years of schooling, lack skills and habits essential for employment or higher education, and are unprepared to participate in civic affairs, the educational community naturally wants to blame nonschool factors.  If educators had been realistic about their limitations in the first place, they would have much less to fear from disclosure of negative information about school achievement.  The educational community believes schools are being treated as scapegoats because they cannot overcome the harmful educational effects of adverse social conditions.  In fact, the educators' tendency to exaggerate the influence of schooling, especially in their quest for larger appropriations, is a major cause of unrealistic public expectations about schooling.</P>
<P>Concern over disclosure often fails to distinguish between long-term and short-term effects.  If disclosure reveals low achievement that is not due to poor schooling, subsequent events will bear this out.  In the not so long run, effective schools will be recognized as such, regardless of the student body they enroll..  some disclosure opponents fear that teachers in ghetto schools will be criticized because their students do not achieve as well as those in affluent suburban schools.  Of course, it might be unfair to draw any conclusions about teacher competence and dedication from such comparisons.  The problem is however, that we cannot find out whether one ghetto school is better than another, or whether one suburban school  is more effective than its counterparts, without looking at comparative data.  Even in the absence of competition for students, disclosure requirements might make a major contribution to education.  They could do so not by showing which schools were better or worse, but by fostering a realistic attitude toward the relative importance of school and nonschool factors in educational achievement.</P>
<P>In considering disclosure issues, it should be noted that &quot;disclosure&quot; per se is not tantamount to consumer awareness.  Advertising may be essential for the latter regardless of disclosure requirements.  On this issue, developments in health care may be  predictive of things to come in education.  When hospitals fist began to advertise, they emphasized &quot;We care&quot; advertisements intended to create a favorable image in the community.  This appears to be changing.  Now hospitals advertising is rapidly becoming similar to advertising for commercial services generally; the emphasis is on why your receive better service at a lower cost in the advertising hospital instead of a competing one.0 </P>

<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="#000000">
<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Cross-Subsidization Issues</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>As we have seen, proposals to privatize education are often criticized on egalitarian grounds.  The criticisms allege that privatization will exacerbate problems of equality of educational opportunity,  Essentially, the criticism is that leaving the quantity or quality of education to market forces means that the affluent will get a better educational opportunity.  A related argument is that since race correlates highly with economic status, reliance on market forces will intensify racial segregation in education.</P>
<P>As I have previously discussed these criticisms, I has discuss only one additional issue here -- &quot;cross-subsidization,&quot; or the practice of using the excess revenues from the more lucrative services or clients to subsidize services or clients that do not pay their way.  I use the phrase &quot;excess revenues&quot; instead of &quot;profits&quot; because nonprofit as well as for-profit organizations engage in cross-subsidization.  For example, either type of hospital may use the excess revenues from insured patients to pay for services to the indigent.  Or either may use excess revenues from one service to subsidize another that is not profitable.  Actually, cross subsidization is an issue that the individual as well as the organizational level in health care.   Doctors as well as hospitals are commonly supposed to provide some service to patients unable to pay for it.  It is widely thought that may physicians charge high fees to cover the costs of their time with indigent patients.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as education is publicly supported, public school teachers need not be concerned personally about charging some students more to finance the education of those who cannot afford to pay.  Nor do private school teachers face the issue as individuals.  Decisions to admit students to private schools are made at the school, not the individual teacher, level.  For this reason, cross-subsidization will be considered here only at the school level.  It should be noted, however, that fee-taking professionals do not seem to provide an impressive amount of services for those unable to pay.</P>
<P>With respect to cross-subsidization, there is at least one basic difference between education and other services.  Outside of education, the indigent do not receive the service in the absence of cross-subsidization.  When a doctor or a hospital provides service to a patient who cannot pay for it, the assumption is that the patient would otherwise not receive the service at all.  Obviously, this is not the case in education.  If a private school does not admit a student, the latter still has the option of attending public school.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, private schools are confronted by cross-subsidization issues.  First, it is often contended that for educational reasons, private schools should enroll some less affluent students.  The rationale is that students should not be segregated in their schools by race or socioeconomic status.  In order to enroll a diversified student body, private schools should cover the costs of students who cannot pay by whatever mean are available.</P>
<P>Cross-subsidization has also been advocated as a way to achieve increased financial support for Catholic schools.  Thus in a recent address the Secretary of Education William J. Bennett urged Catholic schools to enroll a significant number of the most difficult to educate students, even if such students could not pay for private schooling.  Bennett urged that this be done to demonstrate the effectiveness of Catholic  schools and to strengthen their case for increased government financial aid.  Strictly speaking, therefore, he was recommending cross-subsidization as a temporary strategic policy, not as a permanent policy to be adopted on its merits.1 </P>
<P>Another argument for cross-subsidization in private schools is based on their impact on public schools.  If private schools do not enroll any poor students, a disproportionate number will be in public schools.  Inasmuch as such students do not perform as well educationally as middle- and upper-class students, public schools will be stigmatized as schools for less able pupils; consequently, the public schools will lose students from the middle class and eventually political and financial support as well.  To avoid these consequences, whether or not family choice measures are adopted, private schools are urged to enroll &quot;their share&quot; of students from poor families.</P>
<P>Because the underlying issues are much the same, it will be helpful to comment briefly on the cross-subsidization issue in health care.  Several efforts have been made to compare government, nonprofit, and for-profit hospitals on the extent to which they provide care for the indigent.  Although the data and procedures used in these comparisons are far from ideal, perhaps two important conclusions can be drawn from the studies.  One is that in both nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, uncompensated care amounted to less than 5 percent of total charges in 1982 and 1983 (The two years for which recent data was available).  Most of the studies report little or no difference between for-profit and nonprofit hospitals in this regard.  On the other hand, public hospitals show a higher proportion of uncompensated health care than either nonprofit or for-profit hospitals.</P>
<P>Perhaps this is as it should be.  Cross-subsidization is clearly an inefficient and inequitable way of distributing or sharing the burden of providing medical services for those unable to pay.  The doctors and hospitals near depressed areas would inevitably have to assume a heavier burden than their counterparts in difficult-to-reach affluent areas.  Even if it is assumed that doctors and/or hospitals have collective responsibilities in the matter, there is no commonly accepted way to allocate the burdens.  The ability of hospitals to absorb any costs of indigent care is affected by dozens of factors which vary over time and geographic areas.  Hospitals that tried to provide as much indigent care as possible would have to charge higher fees to others; it is not at all clear why a limited group of patients should be the ones to subsidize the free care.  Furthermore, acceptance of such a burden when other competing hospitals, profit and nonprofit, may not be doing so could jeopardize a hospital's competitive position and even ability to survive.</P>
<P>The objections are supported by our experience in providing other basic necessities to the poor.  The grocery stores that redeem food stamps are not expected to absorb the costs of feeding the hungry.  Landlords are not expected to provide housing for the poor at their own expense (except perhaps in New York City?).  Similarly, there is no special obligation on the part of private hospitals to provide health care for the indigent.  In all of these cases, the costs should be shared by everyone --paid for through taxes, not by a series of fortuitous payers who provide a convenient excuse for the majority to avoid paying their share of the costs.</P>
<P>The same considerations appear to be just as applicable to private schools.  While they may absorb the costs of some students who cannot afford to pay, their refusal or inability to do so should not be regarded as objectionable.  The major educational argument to the contrary would be this:  Unlike food or medical care, education cannot be consumed by freestanding individuals.  Good education requires diversity among students, so they can develop awareness and appreciation of diverse backgrounds.</P>
<P>One problem with this argument is that it implicitly condemns most public schools.  True, public school systems enroll students of every race, religion, and socioeconomic level.  Individual public schools, however, enroll students from a relatively narrow socioeconomic strata.  Thus if the objection is valid, it applies to so many public schools that any effort to require it of only private schools seems egregiously unfair.</P>
<P>Another objection challenges the argument on its merits.  Public school classrooms may already be characterized by too much diversity.2   Diversity can reach a point where it becomes impossible to provide quality service to most students within the classroom.  The students can be so diverse in aptitude, achievement, incentives, family background, and other characteristics that whatever a teacher does to accommodate some will be inappropriate or less than optimal for most of the others.  As a practical matter, whether there is too much or too little &quot;diversity&quot; in specific classrooms cannot be resolved by abstract appeals or rejections of it.  If a class has fifteen nonreligious students, ten Protestants, and five Catholics, does it help to include a Jewish student?  An atheist?  A Confucian?  Does the grade level and subject and educational level of the student matter?  What if the addition of a student promotes diversity on some criteria but sameness on others -- which is always the case? </P>
<P>In short, a policy that fosters diversity without regard to its specific criteria is impossible to defend.  So is a policy that fosters &quot;diversity&quot; on one criterion, such as economic status, without regard to grade level, subject, student ability or interests, or any other relevant factor.</P>
<P>&quot;Increasing diversity&quot; is often a euphemism for increasing the proportion of blacks and Hispanics.  At the present time, certain kinds of private schools are trying to do this.  Because the Catholic population is extremely diverse, Catholic schools as a whole are also, even though the diversity tends to characterize the system as a whole more than individual schools.  With some other denominations (fore example, Amish, Orthodox Jewish), the denominations are simply not ethnically heterogeneous, and there is no feasible way to maintain religious solidarity while introducing ethnic diversity.</P>
<P>The private independent schools present an interesting situation.  They tend to be the most expensive schools and the most diversified on religious criteria.  On the other hand, because of their high costs, they enroll proportionally fewer black and Hispanic students than the public schools.  Although not interested in expansion, private independent schools are attempting to enroll larger numbers of black and Hispanic students.  Their rationale is not especially clear; it probably includes a measure of noblesse oblige and some concern that the absence of such students leads to political vulnerability.  Whatever the reason, however, their efforts are not necessarily cross-subsidization.  The schools seek scholarship funds to finance the minority students.  This means that the students are not funded from excess revenues but from donations that may or may not have been available for other purposes.  If not, we do not have cross-subsidization; the school's financial situation would not be affected by who was enrolled in it.</P>
<P>Recent proposals in health care have some interesting implications for cross-subsidization in private schools.  Some observers have proposed that hospitals be required to provide a certain amount of indigent care as a condition of tax exemption.  The logic seems straightforward; if a tax exemption is granted because an organization will be performing services for those unable to pay, the organization should be required to demonstrate its performance of the services.  Logical or not, the rationale seems less applicable to private schools.  As we mentioned, while medical patients may have to go without service if it is not contributed, students are still entitled to attend public schools.  Although private schools should not be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds, forcing them to enroll students to achieve diversity seems to be a highly questionable policy.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Cross-Subsidization in Education:  A Caveat</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Cross-subsidization can be implemented in several ways.  As with other concepts I have discussed, there is the danger that criticism of one form of it may not apply to others.  Still, cross-subsidization in education entails risks and costs which do not characterize the practice in most other fields.</P>
<P>First, requiring private schools to engage in cross-subsidization is likely to weaken their educational effectiveness.  The reason is that student characteristics affect school effectiveness.  A pupil surrounded by highly motivated, well-behaved, and talented students is likely to learn more than if enrolled with indifferent, disruptive, and less talented students.  Public as well as private schools accept the underlying premise; for example, specialized public high schools, such as the Bronx High School of Science, do not accept students that weaken the school's reputation.  In short, control over admissions is critical to school effectiveness and reputation, and hence to school prospects in the marketplace.3 </P>
<P>In most fields, the cost of cross-subsidization can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.  For example, a doctor would estimate the value of the time devoted to indigent patients.  The services provided this way do not affect the quality of service to others, no do they have a negative effect on the doctor's reputation; if anything, reputation would be enhanced.</P>
<P>In education, the costs and effects of cross-subsidization are more problematic.  The characteristics of the students who are subsidized are more likely to affect school efficiency, reputation, and acceptability in the market.  In this respect, the costs of cross-subsidization in education are more complex than the costs in other fields.</P>
<P>The students who are not wanted fall into two general categories.  One category consists of students such as drug pushers, who adversely affect the education of others, regardless of school.  The other category includes students who have no negative characteristics per se, but who would have negative effects on the educational objectives of particular schools.  For example, a student who is not an Orthodox Jew would probably have negative effects on students in a school for Orthodox Jews.  Even if cross-subsidization avoids the latter type of negative effects, it cannot avoid the former; no school can.  As long as we have compulsory education, some students will adversely affect others, whether in public or private school.  Cross-subsidization cannot ameliorate this problem.  If practiced only under threat of penalty or waiver of benefits, it is more likely to weaken private schools without any corresponding benefits to students in either public or private schools.</P>
<P>To avoid any misunderstanding, let me emphasize that I am not urging carte blanche for nonprofit schools.  Public policy might justifiably require nonprofit schools to accept some of the burden of educating the disadvantaged or the disabled as a condition of tax exemption or some other privilege associated with the benefits of nonprofit status.  This might be done in a variety of ways.  My point is that these ways should not weaken the basic rationale for the nonprofit school.  I would not require a school catering to the affluent to accept students from nonaffluent families; neither would I provide such schools with tax exemptions or any other benefits of nonprofit status.  Most emphatically, I would not agree that saving the public treasury the cost of educating such students is an adequate quid pro quo for the nonprofit status of independent private schools.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>A Contractual Approach To Education</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>In conclusion, I would like to suggest that perhaps the strongest rationale for both vouchers and education for profit has not been articulated in the debate over educational reform.  This rationale is based on the advantages of a contractual approach to education.4   To illustrate it advantages, let us assume that everyone is agreed on the goals of education and on the curriculum designed to achieve it.  In other words, we shall assume that there is no support for vouchers for religious or ideological reasons.  Nevertheless, parents may still disagree on some important issues.  To simplify the analysis, I shall confine their disagreement to a single issue:  whether teachers should be paid for services or for results.</P>
<P>Some parents believe that tax dollars should be paid for services.  In their view, it would be unfair and unrealistic to pay teachers on the basis of results.  As long as teachers adhere to standard of reasonable care and competence, these parents are satisfied.</P>
<P>Other parents view the issue in a different light.  As they see it, schools were established so that students would learn certain things.  If the children don't learn, the teachers shouldn't be paid.  These parents are willing to pay whatever it takes to achieve results, but they want to pay only for results, not services.</P>
<P>Other parents have still a third view.  They believe that payment should be for services in some subjects but only for results in others.  We could spell out several variations of these positions, but let us instead consider the issue from the standpoint of service providers.</P>
<P>First of all, payment for results, or according to results, is common in both the commercial world and among the professions.  You can buy a television set with a warranty, but it costs more than if there were no warranty.  When you rent a care, the rental agencies offer several insurance options covering things that might go wrong.  You can rent a car (1) without additional insurance, (2) with insurance requiring the rental company to pay any amount over a specified deductible, or (3) with insurance that covers you against all claims.  The costs of the insurance vary with the risks involved and the willingness of the parties to pay for various allocations of risk.</P>
<P>Arrangements for legal services also illustrate this flexibility.  Ordinarily when you employ an attorney, you pay for legal services, not results.  Nevertheless, payment to attorneys is sometimes explicitly based on results, not services rendered.  Lawyers representing clients in personal injury cases may agree to accept a specific percentage of the award as their fee; if there is no award in their client's favor, there is no fee.</P>
<P>Note that contingent fee arrangements are extremely flexible.  The client may pay the lawyers' direct expenses and the contingent payment may apply only to an award, if any.  The contingent fees can vary, depending on the difficulty of preparing the case, the prospects for a large award, and so on.  The fee arrangements can deal with the time required to resolve the case, including what happens if an award is appealed by either the plaintiff or the defendant.  In contrast, medical and dental patients typically pay for services rendered, not results.  The critical point, however, is not whether payment is typically for one or the other; it is that the parties can resolve the issue through contractual arrangements.</P>
<P>A contractual approach to education would, therefor, be consistent with practice in other professions as well as in the commercial world generally.  In principle at least, such an approach would be feasible.  This is not to say that payment according to results should or would replace payment for services rendered; &quot;feasible&quot; means that we could structure education so that the producers and consumers of educational services would decide for themselves what the basis of payment would be.  Most payments to professional workers are for services, not results, and this practice would probably continue to be dominant in education.  Unfortunately, we have no way to be certain of what would happen if other options existed.</P>
<P>Although the contractual rationale for vouchers is independent of the others previously discussed, it does not necessarily conflict with any of them.  A contractual approach would tend to encourage parents to clarify what they expect from schooling, but the approach per se has no logically necessary relationship to any particular outcome.  Similarly, a contractual approach has no inherent implications for taxpayer issues.  Whether vouchers would result in taxpayer savings will depend on the factors previously discussed, such as the amounts of the voucher, eligibility for vouchers, the costs of public education, and the number of students who transfer to private schools.  Whether parents contract for services or for results, or contract at all with their schools of choice, is not likely to affect taxpayer issues directly, one way or the other.</P>
<P>In one sense, a contractual approach can be viewed as a special case of the educational improvement rationale.  Instead of competing on educational criteria, educational producers would compete on contractual criteria:  Who offers the best contract?  The competition would be similar to a situation in which two automobile dealers selling the same care compete on the basis of the warranties, not the automobile itself.</P>
<P>Conceptually, the contractual rationale can also be treated as special case of the argument that vouchers are necessary to minimize social conflict over education.  As previously pointed out, a major advantage of contractual approach is that it would or could reduce conflict over educational issues.  On the other hand, the conflicts that could be resolved in this way do not endanger social stability as much as the conflicts over religious issues in public education.  That is, a contractual approach would tend to resolve conflicts that are important to individuals but do not involve powerful interest groups.  This is why the argument for a contractual approach is not primarily its utility in reducing social conflict.  Instead, the argument is that a contractual approach would create significant options that cannot emerge in the absence of a voucher system.  Parents and citizens are not fighting over these options; they are not even aware of them in most cases.  Nevertheless, if raised to the level of conscious choice, these options could set in motion a process that has genuine promise for improving education.</P>
<P>To see why, let us first consider the dynamics of this approach in a noneducation context.  Let us assume that two automobile companies offer the same care for sale.  One company charges less because it offers no warranty of any kind; the other company provides a warranty, so its price is higher. (Actually, one company could offer both options, which would eliminate any controversy over whether the cars were truly identical.)</P>
<P>At a given time, buying the car with the warranty might be the wise thing to do.  Over time, however, the costs of making good on the warranty are identified and corrective measures are taken.  If, for example, a certain part frequently becomes defective while under  warranty, the manufacturer will devote resources to developing a more durable part or perhaps a way of avoiding any need for it.  Thus the economics of the warranty stimulate improvements in the product; as the improvements are made, it becomes more practical to buy the cars without the warranty, or perhaps the cost of the warranty may be reduced.  In any event, the contractual arrangements and the cost and quality of the product and the warranty interact.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly the same dynamics would emerge under a contractual approach to education.  For the sake of discussion, let us assume that two schools offered the same program, quality staff, and were otherwise indistinguishable on any educational criterion.  Let us further assume that the only difference was that school <I>A</I> charged on the basis of services rendered, whereas school <I>B</I> charged more because it guaranteed the results; to make up for its losses when the results were inadequate, school <I>B</I> would have to charge more than school <I>A</I>.</P>
<P>Predictably, the students who did not achieve up to the level of the guarantee would be scrutinized carefully.  These students, of course, would be analogous to the instances in which the automobile companies have to make good on their warranties.  Several outcomes might be anticipated.  Some students with certain characteristics might be identified as too high a risk for the money-back guarantee.  As a result, school <I>B</I> might charge more for the guarantee or even refuse to offer it for such students.  That school might also identify another group of students whose failure is remediable.  By careful analysis of its losses due to warranty payments, school <I>B</I> may be able to reduce the cost of the warranty.  This reduction in cost may enable school <I>B</I> to achieve a competitive advantage over school <I>A</I>, or over schools that charge more than <I>B</I> for the same educational guarantees.</P>
<P>Under a contractual approach, therefore, attention would necessarily focus on the educational needs and prospects of individual children.  Market forces would distinguish high-risk form low-risk students.  They would also encourage research into ways of reducing the incidence of high-risk students; schools would have financial incentives for their early identification and remediation.</P>
<P>Suppose, for example, that suburban parents wish to purchase a &quot;money-back guarantee&quot; of educational progress.  Suppose also that an inner city mother of three children on welfare also seeks to purchase the same guarantee.  A contractual approach would reveal the costs of equalizing the results.  If no educational vendor was willing to offer such a guarantee at any price to the inner city parent, the implication would not be that the contractual approach was fostering racial discrimination or unequal opportunity.  It would be that the demand for equal achievement was unreasonable.  It would be comparable to a demand that a physician guarantee the results of a heart transplant for a ninety-year-old patient.  Similarly, educators will accept the risks for some objectives with some types of students at some agreed-on price, whereas they will not be willing to do so in other situations.  An contractual approach would enable a market system to sort out these situations; the equality issues could be resolved by public assumption of the costs where equalization of outcomes is feasible.  What if certain parents determined to pay only for results could not find a school willing to educate on that basis?  The outcome would be the same as when people can't find a lawyer to handle their lawsuits on a contingent fee basis; the parents would have to change their position on fees or go without educational services.</P>
<P>It should be emphasized that such a situation would be drastically different from school board efforts to pay teachers on the basis of results.  There are enormous differences between payment to employees on the basis of employer-mandated standards and payment based on arrangements negotiated voluntarily by professionals and their clients.  Payment based on results may or may not have a significant role to play in American education, but unsuccessful efforts to structure the practice on a school or class basis (such as those by the OEO discussed in chapter 4) have little or not relevance to its possibilities on a voluntary professional-client basis. </P>
<P>In some respects, private education already illustrates the advantages of a contractual approach to school-parent relations.  In private schools, student discipline, suspension, and dismissal are matters of contract, not statutory regulation.  Litigation over these issues is relatively infrequent, whereas it is pervasive in the public school environment.  Of course, contract interpretation can lead to litigation; we cannot completely eliminate litigation and conflict by reliance upon a contractual instead of a statutory system of school-parent relations.  Nevertheless, a contractual system is more likely to reduce conflict between schools and parents.  Contracts can be revised and enforced more expeditiously than statutes as the need arises.  Teachers and teacher unions would probably oppose a shift to a contractual system; ironically, they advocated teacher collective bargaining contracts precisely because the statutory protections for teachers were deemed inferior to contractual ones.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Education as Joint Production of Services</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>Whatever its potential, the option of contracting for services or results is only one illustration of the advantages of a contractual approach to education.  To fully appreciate these advantages, it is essential to note some significant differences between products and services.  Products can be accumulated and stored somewhere until they are sold or needed.  Educational technology aside for the moment, services cannot be stored; they must be delivered to consumers.</P>
<P>Most products are made without reference to particular consumers.  For example, on the whole, automobiles are manufactured without the intervention of specific consumers.  Of course, manufacturers take into account consumer preferences, but they normally do so only on a large-scale basis.  There is often interaction at the point of sale -- the consumer wants a blue automobile instead of a red one.  At the assembly plant, however, the decision to assemble red or blue cars is made independent of individual consumer preferences.</P>
<P>In contrast, services are more often jointly produced.  That is, the producer is more often required to adjust the service to individual consumers and to enlist their cooperation in its production.  Physicians and patients have to adapt their schedules if the physician is to provide medical service.  No such cooperation is needed to consummate the sale of most products.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, consumer/producer cooperation (that is, &quot;complementarity&quot;) is more important in services than in products.  This is not necessarily the case when the services are performed on products, such as television sets or watch repair.  When, however, the services cannot be performed without the presence of consumers (including third-party service recipients), complementarity between producers and consumers becomes more important.  In many situations, such as in education, consumers often want to negotiate their own preferences into the service.</P>
<P>Of course, even in selling products, complementarity can be important, even essential.  The effective use of computers or machinery may require user training programs.  The important point here is the growing importance of complementarity in our economy and what it suggests for the delivery of educational services.  To be sure, public school officials acknowledge its importance in principle.  Much is made of the importance of school/parent cooperation and of parent involvement and support.  Many educational organizations have sponsored publications intended to facilitate parental involvement, and no one denies its importance in principle.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, all such efforts are characterized by one major and perhaps fatal flaw.  The urge complementarity, but for all practical purposes, it is on <I>their</I> terms, not the parents' or the result of negotiations between teachers and parents.  To cite a common case, teacher collective bargaining contracts severely limit parent access to teachers.  Most teachers are not normally available to meet with parents during evening hours, on weekends, or during the extended periods school is not in session.  Often teachers are available only on a few specified days or afternoons after students are dismissed.  Consequently, only those parents who can confer with teachers at the specified times have access to them.  I am not contending that there should be no limits on teacher availability; I do contend, however, that such complementarity as exists in public education is almost entirely on producer instead of consumer terms.  It would be astonishing indeed if a voucher system did not result in greater parent/teacher complementarity and therefore better education.</P>
<P>Whatever the advantages of a contractual approach to education, they cannot be achieved by governmental provision of it.  In order for parents to contract, they must have the funds to pay for whatever it is they are contracting for.  For this reason, large-scale contractual approaches will require a voucher system.  In such a system, parents and schools could contract for services (or results) they mutually agreed on.  There is not political interest in such an approach at the present time; political support for vouchers is based on religious or ideological, not contractual, considerations.  The latter may come into play only if and when voucher systems are established on other grounds.  Yet voucher legislation should be drafted carefully to maximize the potential benefits of a contractual approach to education.</P>

<IMG SRC="privbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 47><B>Education for Profit:  A Point of View</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>In concluding this analysis, let me suggest one final reason why education for profit may be our best hope for educational improvement.  The reason receives no attention in educational reform literature or in the media, but is would be difficult to underestimate its importance.</P>
<P>Simply stated, the reason is this:  The mass media (newspapers, television, and radio stations) do not understand and therefore cannot articulate the important developments and issues in education.  This is a fatal weakness in the conventional approach to education reform.</P>
<P>My assertion has two major components:  the inability of media personnel to recognize important developments and issues and the importance of this inability, if it exists.  Inasmuch as the latter component is less open to challenge, let me begin with it.</P>
<P>As emphasized throughout this analysis, educational reform requires sustained political leadership at all levels of government.  Given the fact that educational reform is highly dependent on political processes, media dissemination of educational issues and developments is essential to reform.  In many situations, such dissemination is critical, even decisive, as to whether any change takes place.</P>
<P>What, then, can be said about the educational sophistication of media personnel, whether they are education reporters or generalist who decide what education news is worth reporting?  The vast majority know very little about such matters as how education is financed, who benefits from it and how, the relative weight to be given factors that affect student achievement, the way tenure and teacher bargaining laws work, the state aid formulas, union dynamics and the provisions of negotiated agreements, the evidence on compensatory and bilingual education, or any other issue raised by conventional reform proposals.  Media attention to how much students or teachers or citizens generally know is commonplace; media attention to what its own personnel know about education is nil. (At least I have been unable to find any data or analysis on the issue, and I have no reason to expect more attention will be paid to it in the future.)</P>
<P>What is &quot;education news&quot;?  Going on the basis of what is now filtered through the media, &quot;education news&quot; is who is appointed or who gets fired from a superintendency or university presidency, the community squabble over sex education or the dismissal of a veteran football coach, commencement speeches, honorary degrees awarded, teacher strikes, high school athletics, government and foundation grants made or received -- in short, new is defined in terms of what reporters can handle intellectually.  If Smith replaces Jones as superintendent, you don't have to know anything about education to write the article.  If some parents want sex education and some do not, that is what is reported.  No understanding or even familiarity with the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of sex education is required to communicate a community controversy over it.  When an article seems to require some understanding of a complex substantive issue, the solution is as near as the telephone.  Unfortunately, the &quot;experts&quot; at the other end of the line have their own biases and agendas as well as their own shortcomings.</P>
<P>Media incompetence explains why political and educational leaders can establish reputations as educational statesmen on the basis of trivial and transparent educational initiatives.  It also explains why the educational reform movement was a basket case from the beginning.  Because the media lack an independent capacity to evaluate educational issues, a significant proportion of what the American people read, hear, and see about education is taken directly from news releases.  Inasmuch as news released do not typically announce failures and deficiencies, the process tends to result in benign treatment of the political leaders, organizations, and public agencies with the most effective public relations staff.  Meaningful reform has not emerged from this situation, and it will not in the future.</P>
<P>Theoretically, the mass media could employ persons knowledgeable about the underlying obstacles to educational improvement.  I would not bet on it, but it is a possibility.  Even if this problem were solved, however, the structure and modus operandi of the mass media pose insuperable obstacles to educational improvement.  Indeed, a major advantage of a market system over a political one for delivering educational services is that the former would be more likely to avoid reliance on haphazard media and political treatment of education.  To be sure, the change to a market system must  overcome the obstacles just mentioned.  For precisely this reason, the change may not occur.  Still, there is an enormous difference between changes that reduce dependency on the hopeless governance structure of education and changes that do not.  Both kinds have to run the same obstacle course, but the former holds more hope for introducing a process of continual improvement.</P>

<B> The National Education Association (NEA)</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>It appears that almost 70 percent of all U.S. public school classroom teachers were members of either the NEA or the AFT in 1994; in fact, the NEA had become the largest union in the world well before 1994. As Table 2.1 (from the <I>1993-94 Handbook</I>) indicates, NEA enrolled over 2,100,000 members, including almost 2,000,000 classroom teachers and college faculty; the remaining members were support personnel: clerical staff, bus drivers, school health officials, food service employees, maintenance staff, students and retirees.    </P>
<P>The NEA was founded in 1857, when the presidents of ten state educational associations issued a call to the teachers of the country to form a national organization. This call was answered by 43 persons who met in Philadelphia on August 16, 1857 and organized the &#147;National Teachers Association.&#148; The original constitution of the National Teachers Association excluded women from membership, an exclusion which was eliminated in 1866. The next major change took place in 1870, when the National Association of School Superintendents and the American Normal School Association merged with the National Teachers Association to form the National Education Association.

<P>men in administrative positions; however, after 1918 membership underwent an enormous expansion. Partly as a result of this expansion, the organizational structure of the NEA was changed in 1920 to provide for more representation from the state and local associations affiliated with the NEA. By 1955 NEA had enrolled approximately 52 percent of all professional educators eligible for membership.</P>
<P>As a professional association dominated by school administrators, the NEA was naturally opposed to collective bargaining by teacher unions; however, as AFT membership increased from 60,000 in 1961 to 300,000 in 1970, mainly as a result of AFT support for collective bargaining, 
<BR>the NEA reluctantly embraced it in order to survive as the nation&#146;s leading teacher organization. In 1961, the NEA established the Urban Project to oppose teacher unionization, but the outcome was to accelerate it dramatically. The NEA began by declaring that it supported &#147;professional negotiations&#148; instead of &#147;collective bargaining&#148;; the difference turned out to be that collective bargaining was termed &#147;professional negotiations&#148; if implemented by an NEA affiliate but &#147;collective bargaining&#148; if by an AFT affiliate. In any event, the budget for the Urban Project was $28,037 in 1961-62; in 1964-65, however, the Urban Project spent $884,665 to compete with AFT locals for bargaining rights. Concomitantly, NEA positions on teacher strikes and written collective agreements by whatever label were rapidly becoming union oriented; in effect, the challenge from the AFT in the 1960s and 1970s transformed the NEA into a union. Eventually, the differences that supposedly distinguished the NEA from &#147;unions&#148; disappeared, and a new department devoted to negotiations was established in 1968. Staff oriented to union activities replaced educational specialists as instructional and curriculum issues were deemphasized in favor of collective bargaining matters. As it shed its &#147;professional&#148; image, NEA leadership sanctioned the use of strikes, and in the late 1970s, the U.S. Department of Labor and Internal Revenue Service officially recognized the NEA as a union. Despite its new and unfamiliar role, the NEA doubled its membership during the 1970s, and by the early 1980s, it was second only to the Teamsters as the nation&#146;s largest union (Lieberman and Moskow, 1966).</P>
<P>During the NEA&#146;s evolution from &#147;professional association&#148; to labor union, Terry Herndon, the NEA&#146;s executive director from 1973 to 1983, was the most visible and articulate representative of &#147;the new NEA.&#148; Herndon, who served under five different NEA presidents, was committed to teacher bargaining, and to the unionization of the NEA. He was also an aggressive advocate of the liberal political agenda of his day. As its executive secretary, Herndon led the NEA against what he charged was a right-wing conspiracy of &#147;chronic tax resisters, congenital reactionaries, 
<BR>dangerous witch hunters, energized superpatriots, wayward dogma peddlers and vitriolic race haters&#148; bent on destroying public education. In 1981 the NEA published a teacher&#146;s guide to counter &#147;attacks on public education&#148; by &#147;the radical Right&#148; (Toch, 1991). This organizational 
<BR>posture has carried over to the 1990s; for example, in 1993, the NEA established the Center for the Preservation of Public Education. Funded for two years by the Representative Assembly, the Center provides staff support, materials and assistance to NEA affiliates actively opposed to 
<BR>the privatization of educational services. In addition to its opposition to voucher plans and parental choice initiatives, the Center received $50,000 to combat what NEA termed right wing stealth candidates who seek election to local school boards. In this effort, the NEA works closely with People for the American Way, a liberal policy organization that was formerly housed in the NEA building.</P>

<B> Representative Assembly (RA)</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA&#146;s organizational structure is shown in Table 2.2. Created in 1920, the Representative Assembly (RA) is the NEA&#146;s governing (legislative and policymaking) body. The RA approves the program budget, all resolutions, the legislative program, reports of committees and of officers, and amendments to the Association&#146;s constitution and bylaws before they are effective. 
<BR>The smaller administrative units of the Representative Assembly, such as the 164 member Board of Directors, nine member Review Board, and nine member Executive Committee, control the execution of major policies during the year. The Association&#146;s president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer are also elected by the Representative Assembly.</P>
<P>For each 1,000 active NEA members, each affiliated state association is entitled to one delegate to the Representative Assembly. Local associations are allowed one delegate for each 150 NEA members or major fraction thereof. In 1993 there were over 9,000 voting delegates to the Representative Assembly.</P>
<P>As a result of the size of the Representative Assembly, individual delegates often find it very difficult to participate effectively in the business before the Assembly. A large RA does serve some useful purposes, such as involving more members in NEA business, nominally at least, and more members can be accorded the prestige of being delegates. Nevertheless, it seems likely that a merger of the NEA and AFT would lead to and require constitutional changes that would increase the ratio of members to delegates; otherwise, the governing body of the merged organization would be too large to function effectively.</P>

<P>Implemented September 1, 1993, five standing committees devise the NEA Strategic Plan used for program development and budget allocations. As a result of internal restructuring, NEA &#147;Centers&#148; now provide the organizational structure for achieving the union&#146;s goals. NEA goals developed as the basis for its 1994-95 budget include:</P>
<P><I>Strategic Objective 1.</I> NEA shall expand and protect quality public education as a basic right (preK-G) and secure its adequate and equitable funding.</P>
<P><I>Strategic Objective 2.</I> NEA shall achieve the restructuring of public schools and enhance the preparation, practice, and professional standards of education employees to improve student learning.</P>
<P><I>Strategic Objective 3.</I> NEA shall achieve a pluralistic education work force and advance the economic interests, protect the job security, and improve the terms and conditions of employment for all education employees.</P>
<P><I>Strategic Objective 4.</I> NEA shall promote equity for all and the elimination of discrimination and other barriers to learning generated by social, economic, and political conditions.</P>
<P><I>Strategic Objective 5.</I> NEA shall strengthen its capacity to attract, represent, and serve members in all membership categories. </P>
<P>No standing committee exists to support the final strategic objective to maintain the organizational systems essential to fulfill the mission of NEA, although this goal receives a budget allocation of nearly $46 million.</P>

<B> State Education Associations</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The first state educational association was organized in Alabama in 1840. By 1921 every state and territory except Alaska had such an association; today NEA&#146;s two million members are organized in 52 state affiliates and approximately 13,000 local organizations.</P>
<P>State teacher unions play a critically important role in the NEA&#146;s organizational structure. The fact that the state unions affiliated with the NEA usually function under a title that refers to an &#147;association&#148; reflects the historical development of public education in the United States. Education is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, hence it is constitutionally a power reserved to the states or to the people. In the early 1800s, education was regarded as primarily a local matter if it were a governmental concern at all, or an individual family matter. In any case, it was taken for granted that public education was to be regulated by the states, within the very broad parameters of the U.S. Constitution.</P>
<P>As a result, the early educational organizations were state associations organized to achieve state funding in various ways. Teachers and administrators alike were members. As a matter of fact, it was common practice for administrators to insist that candidates for teaching positions agree to join their local and state associations as well as the NEA as a condition of employment. Needless to say the associations at all levels were not very aggressive advocates of teacher welfare. Nevertheless, until the advent of teacher collective bargaining in the 1960s, the predominant way to achieve teacher benefits was through state legislation. </P>
<P>Eventually, this emphasis was inadequate, or at least insufficient, for three reasons:</P>
<P>1. Inasmuch as the associations allowed unrestricted administrator membership, administrators ended to dominate the legislative objective of the state associations. This was not a problem when 
<BR>the welfare objectives of teachers coincided, or at least did not conflict with those of administrators. For example, both groups had a common stake in improving benefits under the state teacher retirement system. On the other hand, their objectives sometimes were conflicting; for example, administrators were often opposed to teacher tenure and applied their influence in the associations to lock or weaken teacher tenure legislation. Thus, unrestricted administrator membership and administrator domination of the state education associations often worked to the detriment of teachers.</P>
<P>2. Reliance on the legislative process often meant that no teachers could achieve a certain benefit unless and until all teachers received it. Teachers who could achieve various benefits if they and a strong local organization were disadvantaged by sole or even primary reliance on legislative processes.</P>
<P>3. To be effective at the state level, state organizations need local affiliates who can provide meaningful assistance to candidates for state office. The state education associations could not meet this requirement because their local affiliates were hardly more than social organizations.</P>
<P>For these reasons, the emphasis on state legislation as the vehicle for promoting teacher welfare ultimately was superseded by collective bargaining, that is, a procedure under which terms and conditions of teacher employment were negotiated by teacher unions and local school boards. Paradoxically, although teacher bargaining resulted from the ineffectiveness of the legislative approach to terms and conditions of employment, it strengthened enormously the political influence of the state teacher associations. It led to increases in their membership and to well-financed local affiliates which were much more effective politically in implementing the state legislative agendas.</P>
<P>The advent of teacher bargaining actually led to several basic changes in state association organizational structure and operations. Chapter 3 discusses the changes in union financial operations and Chapter 4 those in the political dimensions. Here, we shall limit the discussion to state association governance structures.</P>
<P>One of the most important changes was the adoption of unified membership throughout the NEA&#146;s organizational structure. Prior to teacher bargaining, teachers were usually allowed to join the local, state, or national organization without necessarily having to join at the other levels. A common pattern was for teachers to join the state association but not the NEA; at the same time, local dues were usually so low that membership at the local level was largely pro forma. In the 1970s, however, the state associations moved to require unified membership, and in 1975, the requirement was incorporated in the NEA&#146;s constitution. It is interesting to note that from 1972 to 1976, NEA membership increased from approximately 1,167,000 to 1,887,000, an increase of almost 62 percent. Some of the increase and a membership decline in 1977 were due to the addition and subsequent withdrawal of the New York State United Teachers, but the impact of unified membership was the predominant factor in the increase in NEA membership during these years.</P>
<P>Generally speaking, the state education associations have elected officers who are not eligible for reelection and staff headed by a full-time executive secretary. The prohibitions against reelection may be due to prohibitions in the state association constitution or to a tradition of changing the elected officials annually or biannually. Typically, local affiliates elect delegates to the state convention, and the delegates elect the policymaking officers, such as president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer. The members of an executive committee are also elected, usually for staggered terms of office.</P>
<P>The executive secretary model of governance differs from the conventional union model. In the latter, the full-time officers are free to run for reelection as often as they wish; for example, Albert Shanker has been president of the AFT since 1974. Similarly, Tom Hobart has been president of the New York State United Teachers since 1968. Obviously, these governance issues will have to be resolved if an NEA/AFT merger is to take place, but it seems apparent that the NEA is moving toward the union model of governance. At the state level, some of the tendencies in this direction are as follows:</P>
<P>1. Terms of office in the state associations are being increased, usually from one to two years.</P>
<P>2. Restrictions on being reelected are declining. Increasingly, elected state officers may run for reelection for a limited number of terms.</P>
<P>3. In an earlier era, the state associations merely reimbursed the elected state officers for the days lost from teaching while on state association business. Today, the practice is to pay the elected officers a full-time salary which exceeds the salary of the executive secretary.</P>
<P>Overall, the tendency is to treat the executive secretary as the top ranking staff officer but not as one of the leading policymaking officers of the associations. Of course, regardless of any organizational chart, executive secretaries (or &#147;executive directors&#148;) often do play important policymaking roles, by force of personality or tradition or simply because it is often impossible to separate formulating policy from implementing it. </P>
<P>Realistically, it is not to be expected that teachers who become officers of a state association will necessarily return to the classroom after their service as a state officer. The taste of high salaries, liberal expense accounts and fringe benefits, media attention, and the absence of supervision can hardly fail to affect the elected state officers. Of course, it is politically impermissible to acknowledge these advantages in so many words; in union politics, one must forego the joys of working with children for the thankless tasks of union office.</P>
<P>With the change from association to union functions, the state association structure changed dramatically. Prior to the change, the associations had devoted a great deal of their resources to instructional and curriculum matters. Like the NEA, the state associations supported departments along instructional lines, such as reading or mathematics or science. With the advent of teacher bargaining, however, the administrator organizations, such as the American Association of School Administrators, withdrew or were in effect expelled from the associations; at the same time, the curriculum and instruction organizations, such as the National Science Teachers Association, that had also been sub-units of the NEA and the state associations also became free standing organizations outside the NEA/state association umbrella.</P>
<H5><A ID="I12" NAME="I12">
<FONT SIZE=4>Local Education Associations</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Prior to the emergence of collective bargaining, local associations affiliated with the NEA were weak organizations. Quite frequently, they served mainly as social organizations, introducing new teachers and honoring retiring ones. Insofar as teacher terms and conditions of employment could be distinguished from educational policy, local associations played a marginal role in the former and a negligible role in the latter. Inasmuch as local associations usually included school administrators, it was seldom feasible for them to be aggressive advocates of teacher welfare. Such advocacy typically conflicted with administrative prerogatives. For example, the teachers might have preferred extra duty to be assigned by rotation or by seniority, but the administrators would often prefer to retain administrative discretion in such matters. Teachers were not likely to urge local associations to advocate limits on administrative discretion in the presence of the very administrators whose actions allegedly justified the limits. </P>
<P>Collective bargaining altered the NEA membership structure dramatically. Because teacher bargaining is regulated by state law, the following comments do not necessarily apply to every state; in fact about 16 states have yet to enact teacher bargaining legislation. Nevertheless, the overall thrust of the collective bargaining legislation that has been enacted is clear enough. Collective bargaining draws a sharp distinction between individuals who exercise supervisory/managerial responsibilities and the employees under their supervision and direction. The union represents the latter. Participation in union affairs by supervisory and managerial employees is discouraged where it is not prohibited by law. Such restrictions are deemed essential to prevent employer domination of the organizations that represent employees. Thus, collective bargaining eliminated unrestricted administrator membership, one of the major causes of weak local associations.</P>
<P>At the same time, collective bargaining greatly expanded the role of local associations. School districts were required to negotiate terms and conditions of employment with the exclusive representative of the teachers, that is, the union by whatever name it adopts. The exclusive representatives were usually the local associations affiliated with the NEA, which embraced their union role despite their anti-union heritage.</P>
<P>Negotiations require experienced full-time representatives at the local level. In addition to negotiating the collective agreement, the union is responsible for ensuring that the school district does not violate the agreements. If teachers allege that the school district is violating the agreement, the union initiates a grievance and carries it through the grievance procedure, possibly to arbitration. And because teacher terms and conditions of employment overlap with or affect educational policy, local associations are important players in district affairs. The senior teachers who want higher maximum salaries, perhaps instead of reducing the number of steps on the salary schedule, had to become active in the local association to achieve this objective, just as do the teachers who want the reduction of steps to be a higher priority than raising maximum salaries. Teachers who want family insurance coverage to replace teacher-only coverage must become active in the local association to ensure that the local association bargains for family coverage, just as those who prefer that funds be allocated to the salary schedule must be active to achieve their objective. Thus, whenever teachers feel strongly about an employment issue, the local association becomes the organizational vehicle through which they can achieve their objectives. More precisely, teachers try to persuade their local association bargaining team to emphasize their particular objectives in negotiations. </P>
<P>As local associations became de facto unions, teachers had to invest more resources in them. Local association dues increased dramatically with the advent of collective bargaining. Inevitably, the changes affected their influence in the NEA&#146;s organizational structure. First, local associations became an independent power base within the state and national organizations; instead of being overwhelmingly dominated by the state associations, local associations emerged as a major caucus in the state and national organizations. Nationwide the local associations established the National Council of Urban Education Associations (NCUEA), which received official recognition and support from the NEA itself. Obviously, the allocation of resources between the different levels of union organization are influenced by the existence of a strong network of local associations with needs and priorities that differ from time to time from the priorities of other caucuses within the NEA.</P>
<P>Although the factors contributing to the increasing importance of local associations are clear enough, the way that their importance is reflected in the NEA&#146;s organizational structure is not always evident from the formal structure of the NEA. One might assume that the dues for each level of organization (local, state, and national) would cover the organizational costs at each level, but that is not how the NEA functions.</P>
<P>The NEA also spends millions annually on approximately 1,500 field representatives who link the NEA to its 13,000 local affiliates. These &#147;UniServ directors&#148; provide bargaining and political services in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and in four overseas areas. Supported in part by a special fee ($19 in 1993-94) assessed of every NEA member, UniServ staff tie locals to the NEA&#146;s national political network. UniServ directors, UniServ representatives, UniServ field representatives, UniServ consultants, by whatever title, typically serve as the chief negotiator for one or more local affiliates of the NEA. Where local associations do not have enough members to support a full-time representative, the UniServ programs enable them jointly to receive full-time representation. </P>
<P>Providing assistance to local affiliates in collective bargaining is UniServ&#146;s most significant service. As will be explained in Chapter 3, UniServ staff accords the highest priority to contract language that maximizes the union&#146;s income stream, as well as to articles that restrict the rights of competing unions. For example, the UniServ directors try to persuade school boards to deny the use of district mail facilities and bulletin boards to competing organizations.</P>
<P>For 1993-94 the budget allocated for UniServ implementation of collective bargaining programs was $48,631,161. The budget also targeted 16 state affiliates which did not have collective bargaining statutes in 1993. Plans included a pre-Representative Assembly conference, designed to secure bargaining rights for all education employees in those states. Coordination, evaluation, and expansion of NEA programs on collective bargaining for all education employees was also included in the funding. </P>
<P>De facto bargaining is a separate line item ($486,683) within the State Relations budget for 1993-94. In collaboration with state affiliates and other NEA program units, this budget item provides support and assistance to the bargaining efforts of state affiliates in states that have not enacted bargaining statutes. In practice, UniServ directors also often exercise the leadership in campaigns for or against school board members, state legislators, and other candidates for public office. By any criterion, they are a crucial component of the NEA&#146;s vast political as well as bargaining operations.</P>
<P>The UniServ program illustrates the difficulty of trying to assess the NEA&#146;s  organizational priorities from a perusal of its organizational structure or gross budget figures. The UniServ funds are transferred from the NEA to the state associations; the latter are technically the employers of UniServ staff. Why not fund UniServ by having the state associations increase their dues by $19 and having NEA dues reduced by this amount? We do not know the answer to this question, but it is probably easier for the NEA to fund its field representatives through one appropriation at the national level than through 52 different state and association appropriations.</P>
<P>The preceding discussion is hardly more than an introduction to the NEA; indeed, it is an introduction mainly to the transformation of the NEA from a professional association with unrestricted administrator membership to a public sector union that excludes administrative personnel. It should be noted that the transformation affected all the state and local associations, not merely those in states which had enacted legislation that required school boards to bargain with teacher unions. As the union orientation began to dominate the NEA&#146;s national perspective, its constitution and policies became increasingly antagonistic to administrative personnel and to policies such personnel normally support. By 1994 the NEA was emphasizing the enactment of collective bargaining for teachers in the states that had not yet enacted it.</P>
<P>Our emphasis on the transformation is based on one overriding consideration; to wit, that the emergence of the NEA as a union is the key to understanding virtually every other dimension of its policies and programs. In some cases, the effects of its union orientation are not always apparent to persons not familiar with the dynamics of unionism, but the following chapters will help to confirm the importance of union status. First, however, let us review briefly the structure of the other national teacher organization, which adopted and proclaimed its union status since its inception in 1916.</P>

<B> American Federation of Teachers (AFT)</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Although teacher unions emerged before 1900, the first to affiliate with the AFL was one in San Antonio, Texas, in 1902. In the same year the Chicago Teachers Federation, which had been organized in 1897, affiliated with the Chicago Federation of Labor. Two patterns of affiliation thus appeared at the outset. One pattern was affiliation with a national labor organization, the other affiliation with a local labor body.</P>
<P>From 1902 to 1916, the teacher union movement had little success in enlisting the nation&#146;s teachers. In 1916, however, a number of teacher union leaders agreed upon the desirability of a national teacher union. At that time, there were three teacher unions in Chicago fighting with the Chicago Board of Education for their very existence. The Board had amended its rules in 1915 to prohibit &#147;membership by teachers in labor unions or in organizations of teachers affiliated with a trade union.&#148; The Chicago Teachers Federation secured an injunction which restrained the Board from enforcing this prohibition. However, at this time teachers in Chicago were hired on a year to year basis, and the Board refused to rehire many teachers who belonged to the unions. This action of the Board finally induced the Chicago teachers to take the lead in forming a national union of classroom teachers. An invitation to form such a union was sent to all teacher organizations affiliated with labor or those interested in such affiliation. Only four locals sent delegates to the first meeting in Chicago on April 15, 1916, but teacher organizations in Chicago, Gary, New York, Oklahoma City, Scranton, and Washington received charters from the new organization. An application for affiliation with the American Federation of Labor was granted on May 9, 1916. </P>
<P>In its first two years, the AFT had to struggle desperately to survive as a functioning organization. The Chicago Teachers Federation withdrew from the AFT in 1917 as the price for the reinstatement of the Chicago teachers who had been dismissed or not rehired as a result of union membership. Many other locals disbanded under heavy pressure from school boards. However, from 1918 to 1919, the number of AFT locals increased from 24, with a membership of less than 2,000, to over 160, with a membership of close to 11,000. For a short time, membership in the AFT exceeded the membership of the NEA, as teachers were increasingly dissatisfied with the Association&#146;s failure to raise teacher salaries in the inflationary period at the close of World War I.</P>
<P>After World War I, however, school boards and school administrators, encouraged by the anti-labor political climate in the early 1920s, launched a major effort to minimize teacher participation in teacher unions. As a result, by 1927, less than one-fifth of the AFT locals which had been issued charters were still operating. After 1927, membership increased steadily until 1939, suffered a short setback until 1941, and then slowly turned upward with only minor reverses until the 1960s.    </P>
<P>Prior to the 1960s, the AFT had not been able to organize a higher proportion of the nation&#146;s teachers; its increases in membership merely kept pace with increases in the total number of teachers in the United States. The Federation&#146;s inability to enroll a higher proportion of all teachers ended with dramatic gains in the 1960s. These gains resulted from the AFT&#146;s overwhelming victory over the NEA in the 1961 representation election in New York City. This victory convinced AFT leaders that if given an uncoerced opportunity to choose, most teachers would prefer union to association representation. Consequently, AFT locals began calling for representation elections to choose a bargaining agent, even in districts where the AFT enrolled far fewer members than the NEA. Because of administrator influence in the NEA at that time, the Association did not embrace collective bargaining until a series of election losses to AFT affiliates in large cities created an unavoidable dilemma for the NEA at every level. The dilemma was to embrace collective bargaining and unionization or face staggering losses to the AFT. Inasmuch as teachers far outnumbered administrators, the outcome was more or less inevitable as the NEA and AFT competed in representation elections in the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1960s, however, the NEA and its affiliates realized that teacher bargaining could be used to increase their membership, and they proceeded to take advantage of their opportunities to do so as the association replaced its professional image with a union one. Indeed, in struggling to overcome its earlier opposition to collective bargaining, the NEA adopted extreme positions that were intended to demonstrate that it was a bona fide militant union. For instance, the NEA asserted that all school board policies should be negotiable. As experts on collective bargaining would unanimously agree, this position was indefensible, but even AFT leaders embraced it publicly to avoid being upstaged by the NEA. Unfortunately, many teachers who are not sophisticated about collective bargaining were convinced that they should have the right to bargain on educational policies, or for that matter, on any school district policies of concern to teachers. The possibility that negotiating public policies with one interest group might be contrary to the principles of representative government was simply ignored.</P>
<P>Once the NEA embraced teacher bargaining, the NEA and AFT entered into a rough stalemate. Both showed increases in membership, but gains were made mainly by organizing the unorganized, not by persuading teachers to switch from one organization to the other. By and large, the AFT is dominant in large urban centers and the NEA in smaller cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Both unions have achieved some success in organizing higher education; their success in doing so has led to the virtual demise of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), which had formerly been the dominant organization of faculty in higher education. </P>
<P>In 1993 the AFT claimed a membership of 820,000 in 49 states (no affiliate in Nevada), the District of Columbia, Panama, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and ten overseas countries, and 2,281 local affiliates. It was also affiliated with the American Federation of Labor&#150;Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the national labor body formed by the merger of the AFL and the CIO in 1955. </P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Biennial Convention</FONT></A></H5>
<P>As shown in Table 2.3, the governing body of the AFT is the Biennial Convention, which is analogous to the Representative Assembly in the NEA. Locals are permitted delegates on the following basis: one delegate from each affiliated local having a membership of 25 or less; for each 100 members or major fraction thereof, one additional delegate may be elected, provided the full per-capita tax has been paid to AFT. Locals with fewer than 100 members each, but in the aggregate fewer than 300 members from a contiguous geographic area, may form area councils of locals for the exclusive purpose of electing a delegate to the convention. Voting for dele-gates and alternates is by secret ballot. Each state federation may elect one delegate to the convention, regardless of its at-large membership. In 1992 there were 2,862 delegates at the AFT convention, representing 461 locals, 25 state federations, and 2 councils.</P>
<P>The Executive Council consisting of the president, secretary-treasurer and 38 vice presidents is responsible for the direction of the AFT between conventions. In effect, its functions include those of the NEA&#146;s Board of Directors, Executive Committee, and Review Board. The Executive Council carries out the instructions of the Convention, takes action with respect to legislation, interprets and enforces the constitution, makes rules and bylaws which must be submitted to the next convention for approval or rejection, creates and appoints members in the committees, has the responsibility for settling intra-organizational disputes and/or violations, fills vacancies in its own membership, and in general handles the Federation&#146;s affairs in the interim between conventions. </P>
<P>AFT members are categorized into five divisions<B>:</B></P>
<P>1. Public and private school teachers.</P>
<P>2. Paraprofessionals and school-related personnel. </P>
<P>3. Higher education faculty and professionals.</P>
<P>4. Nurses, allied health professionals and other health care employees.</P>
<P>5. State and local public employees and other workers organized in conformity with the provisions of the AFT constitution.</P>
<P>New language adopted by the 1992 convention provided that &#147;all divisions must be represented among the 38 vice presidents&#148; (AFT Constitution, 1992). </P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Committees</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Standing Committees, Council Committees, and Program and Policy Councils report to the AFT convention delegates with findings and recommendations for convention action. Like the reports and scores of resolutions voted on at the NEA Representative Assembly, the reports and resolutions presented to the AFT Convention address such diverse issues as Haitian refugees, the balanced budget amendment, childhood lead poisoning, school finance issues, and endorsement of a presidential ticket.</P>

<B> Conclusion</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Both the similarities and dissimilarities between the AFT and the NEA are not always apparent from their organizational structures; similarities are often obscured by terminological differences, dissimilarities by similar terminology. Several important organizational differences will be explored in the following chapters, but one that does not show up in their organizational structures should be recognized at the outset. </P>
<P>Because of the NEA&#146;s much larger membership, the policymaking proc-ess in the NEA is hostage to several interest groups that have veto but no &#147;do power.&#148; The upshot is that NEA policy tends to be the result of compromises between various interest groups within the Association; as frequently happens in such situations, policymaking becomes a process of formulating the policies that offend the least influential constituencies.</P>
<P>Because of its recent history, the political dynamics in the AFT are very different. Prior to 1964, the AFT was divided politically into two caucuses of roughly equal strength; the Progressive Caucus and the Classroom Teacher Caucus. This situation is relatively rare in union affairs; usually, the incumbent officers are able to utilize the advantages of incumbency to eliminate or weaken significant opposition to their continuation in office. At any rate, the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) in New York City was in the Progressive Caucus in the early 1960s. As a result of its victory over NEA affiliates in a 1961 representation election, the UFT was able to organize a majority of New York City&#146;s teachers. Within a few years, the UFT enrolled from a third to a half of all AFT members. Consequently, election to national office within the AFT became practically contingent upon UFT support; since 1964, no candidate for national office opposed by the UFT has been elected to national office in the AFT. This situation has continued despite the fact that the UFT enrolls considerably less than one-third of total AFT membership.</P>
<P>It must be emphasized that these differences in the political dynamics do not necessarily justify any conclusions about the specific policies actually adopted by the two unions. Whether NEA or AFT policies are &#147;better&#148; in some sense can be assessed only by examining the policies themselves. The point here is that the AFT is more unified politically than the NEA. AFT leadership can commit the Federation in ways that would be politically dangerous or unpredictable in the NEA. If AFT membership were as large and as diverse as NEA&#146;s, the political dynamics within the AFT would undoubtedly be more similar to the NEA&#146;s.</P>
