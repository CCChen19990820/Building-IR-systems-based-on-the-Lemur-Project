<B>INVOICE PAYMENTS</B><p>
Corporate Purchasing is now successfully paying invoices in Voyager.
Since the cessation of invoice payment using GEAC on March 29, 1996, invoices
have been paid both in Voyager and direct into Unibis.<br>
<p>
The reasons for making some payments in Unibis rather than Voyager are 
outlined below:<p>
<OL>
<LI>The programme for the transfer of (funds) account codes from Voyager
to Unibis needed to be written. Many thanks to Anne and Hans for their 
efforts in getting this programme working.
<p>
<LI> As a result of the vendor transfers which were the outcome of the
tender process this year, a number of outstanding 1996 invoices from
Harrassowitz and Swets were paid in Unibis. The purchase orders for these 
titles are recorded in Voyager for the 1997 calendar year with the new 
vendor, Blackwell.
<p>
<LI> Where creditors or Divisions were demanding urgent payment and the
purchase order had not been input to Voyager, payment was made in Unibis.
</OL>
<p>
The 1997 major supplier's invoices will be paid in Unibis as outlined in
<a href="/cis/csiroonly/lnm/lnm9607.html">LNM 96/7</a>. The 
reconciliation of the line item invoice details in Voyager will take some 
months and Corporate Purchasing staff are hoping that they will be able 
to accomplish this by the first quarter of 1997. <p>
The 1997 DA renewal invoices for the Network have been received and Sally
Ellis has commenced checking and inputting these invoices in Voyager. The 
Ebsco and Blackwell 1997 renewal invoices are expected in November. The
Blackwell invoice is usually received in early October but due to the 
number of vendor transfers, I have requested a list of transfer orders 
from Blackwell in order to check that orders have been correctly recorded 
prior to Blackwell running the renewal invoices.<br>
<p>
Sue Hosking and Paul Quilty have written a procedure to assist Divisions
in accessing invoice payment details in the Voyager Acquisitions Module. 
For further details regarding invoice payments made direct in Unibis, 
please contact Sue Hosking or Martin Osborne.
<p>
<B>SERIALS OPEN ORDER DATA ENTRY PROJECT</B>
<p>
This project officially finishes today. Three of our contract data entry
staff, Di Peter, Elspeth Payne and Liz Podoroshko finish up today.
<p>
I wish to acknowledge their significant contribution to the success of
the data entry project. Thanks also go to Divisional library staff and 
the following staff for their input into the project: Barb Hilling, 
Sally Ellis, John Wood (on leave 30/10/96 - 4/12/96, Nigel Ashworth and 
various Corporate Purchasing staff. Barb Hilling and Sally Ellis will remain
until Christmas to assist us in the invoice processing.
<p>
Particular thanks go to Jacqui Porter, who coordinated the entire project
in a most efficient manner. She wrote the wonderful and copious
documentation for the data entry procedure and trained all the necessary 
staff in the procedure.
<p>
Thanks also go to Robert Ho who gave us very useful advice on the effect 
that our data entry of the purchase orders was producing in the
Cataloguing Module and the subsequent display in OPAC.
<p>
As of 31 October 1996, the number of purchase orders in the Acquisitions
Module is 9,211. Excluding an estimated 700 memberships, there remains an 
estimated 290 purchase orders still to be input. These are mainly 
subscriptions held direct with publishers and will not hold up payment of 
the major supplier invoices for 1997. The remaining Corporate Purchasing 
staff should be able to deal with these subscriptions. The intention is
to input these subscriptions as the invoices for them are received at CCIM
for payment.
<P>
Thank you for your understanding and support in this difficult transition
time.<p>

<TITLE>CAN 1: Chinese names</TITLE>

<H3>CAN 1: Chinese names</H3>

1. If the name in question has been or has probably been romanised into 
our alphabet from Chinese characters (including names in Chinese characters in the book being catalogued, names of people or organisations or government departments in China,
or Chinese personal names from books published in China or Southeast Asia):<p>
<DL>
<DT><DD>Check LC and ABN, copying anything you find
<p>
<DT><DD>Give everything to Robert and ask him to check
</DL><p>
This is because we use a method of romanising (Pinyin) that is different to that currently in use by Library of Congress (Wade Giles), and ABN has required the other way in the past but allows both now.
<p>
2. If the name of a person is in a book published elsewhere than in 
China or in Southeast Asian areas with significant Chinese population and there is no indication that the person is connected with China, then treat as normal.

<TITLE>CAN 2: Order of priorities in choosing sources of information
</TITLE>
<H3><B>CAN 2: Order of priorities in choosing sources of information</B></H3>

<b>Choice of source</b>
<p>
Our primary authority for form of name is <b>AACR2</b> (latest version of 
"the rules"); after that come LC, ABN, and other sources.  Under each number
below, the most important source is listed first. 
<DL>
<DT>1. Names from Australia or New Zealand
<DD>ABN<br>
    Library of Congress Name Authorities (LC)
<P>
<DT>2. Names from other places since 1970s
<DD>LC<br> 
    ABN
<p>
<DT>3. Names from other places before 1970s
<DD>ABN<br>
    LC<br>
    NUC, BNB
</DL>
<p>
<b>Choosing among various forms of name on ABN
</b><p>
In general, choose verified names (those preceded by <b>+</b> on index
listing and including NOV field in <b>$,c</b> display)<p>
If none are verified or more than one is verified or if you are suspicious,
then check the number of bibliographic records linked to various authority
records and the library/ies that created those bib records.  If you display
the bibliographic record in $,c display, the cataloguing library and 
inputting library appear at top right. <p>
<UL>
<LI><b>National libraries</b> - you can identify inputting library from 
prefix of rid
<pre>
        [blank]  	LC (good quality, unless bib record has
                        Enc lvl=5 or 7)
	sn		LC serials
	abn		National Library (good for Australian names)
	bnb/bnn 	British Library (often low quality)
	zbn		New Zealand (good for their own names)
	cn		Canadian (good for their own names, especially
 			government names, which always have English
                        and French equivalents)
</pre>
<LI><b>Tape loads</b> - often from old records and little or no authority 
work - identify them by three letters at beginning of rid,
eg. qsl (Queensland State Library).  Generally unreliable for authority work.
<p>
<LI><b>ABN participating libraries</b> - rid begins with abn
<DL><DT>
<DD>
	To identify use WHO command, eg. who VS:CL
</DL>
</UL>
<P>
If a vocabulary or authority record has no bib records linked, usually ignore it.  If one vocabulary record has more linked bib records than other vocabulary record(s) and these bib records are not from tape loads, then use the first.
<p>

<b>Conflicts between Library of Congress and ABN</b><p> 

Generally use ABN for Australian and New Zealand names.  Otherwise, use the form that follows current rules.
<p>

<b>Other sources  can include</b>
<DL>
<DT>General
<DD>Marcfiche
<DT>Personal names
<DD>Don't bother unless it's a special case
<br>CSIRO staff list (especially for cross refs)
<br>Faculty directories, government directories
<DT>Australian government body names
<DD>Government directories in D, retrospective in Z
<DT>Conference names
<DD>InterDok
<br>List of conferences received (British Library) - fiche and 			paper
<DT>Geographic
<DD>LC, LCSH
<br>ABN (for Australian or New Zealand names)
<br>other sources are being considered 
   <DL><DT>
       <DD>ABN recommendations
	<br>LC recommendations
	<br>Earlier Central Library list of sources

<TITLE>CAN - 3. ABN note “Conflict unresolved”</TITLE>
<H3>CAN - 3. ABN note “Conflict unresolved”</H3>
"Conflict unresolved (date)" indicates that ABN knows that the works 
of more than one person are linked to one authority record.  In our 
authority record, use 670 ‡aABN+  (Conflict unresolved) and add a 
665 field that says Source:  [title of book, at least enough of it to 
describe the subject], (date of publication), e.g.<p>
<dl><dt>
<dd> 665   ‡aSource: Descriptive terms for graphic materials (1986).
<dd> 670   ‡aABN+ (Conflict unresolved)
</dl>
We have to trust that a cataloguer downloading from ABN will 
recognise from the 665 when s/he has a record by another person 
with the same name and then create a new authority record.  At that 
point, check both names and make them different.  By that time, ABN 
may have separated them or LC may have separate records for them 
or we may have to find a way to distinguish between them.  See CN-
06.  If that does not help, you can create a descriptive term for a 
person with ‡c at the end, e.g.<p>
<dl><dt><dd> , ‡cAstronomer</dl>

Use this field for the source of verification for the heading.  Generally use
only one 670 field per record.  Prefer library or bibliographic sources to 
others.  For priorities in authority sources, see <a href="can2.html">

<b>ABN+</b>    ABN authority record; it has had extra information added to 
it, usually including a NOV field (see below), and in an index 
listing, there is a  +  in the far left column.<br>
If the authority record has "Conflict unresolved", see CAN 3.

<h3>CAN 7 : 008 field (information codes)</h3>

"This field is not repeatable.  It consists of 40 characters (excluding the
field terminator) which provide coded information about the authority record 
as a whole. Some character positions have not been defined and contain 
blanks."
(Australian MARC specification : Authorities)

<TITLE>CAN 11: Cross references for personal names (400 field)</TITLE>

<H3>CAN 11: Cross references for personal names (400 field)</H3>


Cross references are alternative forms of a name that we believe a searcher may use. Cross references refer the searcher to the preferred form in the catalogue; this is most useful when the various forms would occur widely spaced in the index.  
<P>
Cross references may be found in ABN authority records or in LC Name Authorities.  You can use these for guidance, but do not follow automatically.  Each system has its own needs; for example, ABN may need extra cross references to automatically update na


mes from various national libraries, and LCNA may have extra references for each of the languages into which a work may have been translated.
<P>
Create a 400 field cross reference:
<P>
1. For another form of name found in a statement of responsibility when that other form has been used but used less often than the preferred form in the 100 field.
<PRE>
	W. D. Watson (used three times)
	William D. Watson (used twice)
		Australian name

	Use ABN verified form and its cross reference
	100 1 ‡aWatson, W. D. ‡q(William Donald)
	400 1 ‡aWatson, William D. ‡q(William Donald)
</PRE>
<P>
2. For another form of name found elsewhere than the chief source of information if provided by division.
<PRE>
	Title page          Cheng Ho (author employed at Los Alamos)
	Foreword            C. Ho

	Use LC form and its cross reference
	100 1 ‡aHo, Cheng, ‡d1954-
	400 1 ‡aHo, C. ‡q(Cheng), ‡d1954-</PRE>
<P>
3. If the entry point is not clear from the title page, for example, if the family name has more than one part or if the name may be entered in direct order.
<PRE>
        100 1 ‡aEl-Gohary, F.
	400 1 ‡aGohary, F. El-

	100 1 ‡aChopra, R. N. ‡q(Ram Nath)
	400 0 ‡aRam Nath Chopra. 
</PRE>
Do not make a cross reference if the prefix is one of these:  Fitz, Mac, Mc M', O', or U' (ABN rule interpretation)
<P>
In general, make a cross reference from the part of the name in ‡q of the 100
<PRE>
	100 1 ‡aIves, K. J. ‡q(Kenneth James), ‡d1926-
	400 1 ‡aIves, Kenneth James, ‡d1926-</PRE>
<P>
Do not automatically make a cross reference from a Russian name, since such authors hardly ever used their full forms  Do the same for other names if you have reason to believe that they only used their shorter version.  If in doubt, check where the names


 would occur in the index.  For common names, such as Smith, be more willing to make cross references than for names occurring only once, such as Rantana, P. (Pentti).

<H3>CAN 12: Cross references for corporate names (Fields 410 10, 410 20)
</H3>

Cross references are alternative forms of a name that we believe a searcher may use. Cross references refer the searcher to the preferred form in the catalogue; this is most useful when the forms would occur widely spaced in the index.  Use this CAN for t

he names of corporations, government departments or agencies, international organisations, professional societies, etc.
<P>
Cross references may be found in ABN authority records or in LC Name Authorities.  You can use these for guidance, but do not follow automatically.  Each system has its own needs; for example, ABN may need extra cross references to automatically update na

mes from various national libraries, and LCNA may have extra references because it lacked keyword searching capabilities.
<P>
Make a cross reference
<P>
1. For an abbreviation 
<PRE>
	110 2 ‡aAsian Association of Agricultural Colleges and
                  Universities.
        410 2 ‡a AAACU.</PRE>
In general, do not make cross references with spaces between letters in an abbreviation (eg. A A A C U)
<P>
2. For an alternate name
<P><PRE>
	110 2 ‡aEuropean Economic Community.
	410 2 ‡aCommon Market.

	110 2 ‡aEuratom.
	410 2 ‡aEuropean Atomic Energy Community.

3. For the name in another language (do not create a name by translating the original into English unless you believe the English form has been used).
<P><PRE>
	110 2 ‡aMathaf al-Tarikh al-Tabi'i.
	410 2 ‡aBasrah Natural History Museum.
</PRE>
4. To show a department or agency's place in a hierarchy, if known.

<H3>CAN 13: Cross references for conferences (Fields 410 20$a,$c / 410 30)</H3>

Cross references are alternative forms of a name that we believe a searcher may use. Cross references refer the searcher to the preferred form in the catalogue; this is most useful when the forms would occur widely spaced in the index.  Use this CAN for n

ames of conferences, meetings, symposia, colloquia, congresses, workshops, etc.
<P>
Cross references may be found in ABN authority records or in LC Name Authorities.  You can use these for guidance, but do not follow automatically.  Each system has its own needs; for example, ABN may need extra cross references to automatically update na

mes from various national libraries, and LCNA may have extra references to compensate for lack of keyword searching capacity in its earlier days.
<P>
Make a cross reference
<P>
<OL>
<LI>From an alternative name found on the item being catalogued
<PRE>

	111 2 ‡aConference on Parallel Architectures and Languages Europe
	411 2 ‡aPARLE</PRE>

<P>
If there is a series of meetings with a common name, and the same cross reference would be used on each, then add that reference to a parent body record.  If the cross reference is used only for one or some, then add it to the authority record(s) for the 

separate conference(s).

In general, follow the ABN rule interpretation that says do not make cross references from inverted names of conferences, exhibitions, fairs, festivals, etc., although this is contrary to LC practice.  Do make a cross reference, however, if the name begin

<OL>
<LI>To provide "evidence" that one part of the subordinate body name is correct.
<P>
<LI>To provide a cross reference to one record instead of separate ones on each of several subordinate body records.  For directions on when cross references to add to parent body and when to add to individual subordinate bodies or individual meetings,
see <a href="can12.html">CAN 12</a> and <a href="can13.html">CAN 13</a>.

<B>General rule: </B>Make a parent body record, if one does not 
exist, for all steps in the hierarchy of a name that is tagged 110 or 111.
Make a parent body for steps in a cross reference (410) if such a record
would provide useful cross reference(s) or explanations (eg. earlier,
later names).

<FONT SIZE=5><B>CN40 : Electronic Journal Cataloguing</B></FONT>
<P>
The central aim of cataloguing journals that are issued electronically is 
to assist in identifying and accessing them.  The electronic journals can 
be accessed free or by subscription.  They can also be downloaded into 
the local system.  In most cases, they are available by remote access.

<P>This Cataloguing Note is prepared to assist in the creation of a 
record for an electronic journal in CLINES.  The tags referred to are in 
AUSMARC.
<P>The following are issues and some recommendations that have been 
considered for cataloguing e-journals by the ABN Standards Committee. 
OCLC has published a document
<i>"Cataloging Internet resources : a manual and practical guide."</i>  
(Editor: Nancy B. Olson.  @1995). It is used by OCLC participants and 
will also be used by ABN.  CONSER has also issued a work on this issue 
called <i>"Module 31. Remote access computer file serials"</i>
(Prepared by Melissa Beck).

<P><B>Format</B> - E-journals are by its format a serial publication 
available electronically. Therefore it should be catalogued as a serial 
with information applicable to the computer file format.  This is now 
possible by means of the format integration  provided in the AUSMARC 
specifications.

<P><B>Chief Source of Information</B> - For computer files available by 
remote access, the chief source of information is the title screen or 
similar display from a terminal or a printout.
Other sources may be from the file itself: 'readme file', 'about'
 screen etc.  If none is available, the home page or published 
description of the file may also be
considered.
<P><B>Uniform title (240)</B> - A computer file serial which is also 
available (issued) in another format (eg printed version or CD-ROM) is 
not treated as a reproduction, and therefore requires an uniform title 
entry to distinguish it from the others. The  term 'Online' may be 
sufficient to differentiate the versions.

<P><B>General Material Designator (245 $m)</B> - 'computer files' is the 
only acceptable GMD in AACR2 currently.  The term 'electronic journal' 
has been used and is being considered to be a new GMD.  Since the term 
'computer files' is used to cover a wide range of electronic media and does 
not clearly identify the online nature of the publication, it is
necessary to have a way to assist in the identification of the online 
journal.  This identification can be given as a 'File characteristic' 
note or in the Collation area.  The use of the collation area is preferred 
since it is displayed prominently in OPAC.

<P><B>Imprint (260)</B> - All electronic serials are to be treated as 
'published'.  Therefore information in this area is necessary.  Take 
information anywhere in the file, but prefer the title
screen.  Include the publication date when cataloguing from the first issue; 
otherwise do not record date of publication.

<P><B>Collation (300)</B> - Since the material is available by remote 
access according to AACR2, it is not necessary to have a collation 
field.  It is worth indicating in this field that the
material is an electronic journal so as to explain more precisely the GMD.

<P><B>Mode of access (527)</B> -  AACR2R 9.7B1c indicates that 
information relating to the mode of access should be included for 
remotely accessed files.  These are to be included in the
note area and should give sufficient information to enable the user
to access the publication, whether directly or indirectly.  The user can 
directly access the journal free or by subscription or indirectly via the 
local system where the journals may have been downloaded.  The address 
should be tested for accuracy by the cataloguer or the reference staff.

</PRE>
<P><B>System requirements (527)</B> - This note is to be used to specify
a specific program or type of program needed for use with the file and/or 
any special hardware requirements.   For example: 527 00 $aSystem 
requirements:  PC; Internet access

<P><B>Summary (545)</B> - Depending on the information given in the title 
area, it is necessary to provide a summary to convey the purpose and 
contents of the item.  This is following 9.7B17 and 9.7B18.

<P><B>Source of title (516)</B> - This note is necessary in accordance 
with rule 9.7.B3.
<p>
Others -  Issues relating to the 'holdings' information and the mechanism 
for ongoing maintenance of title changes, access address, etc. have not 
been considered.
<P><B>Holdings information (930)</B> - Tag 930 is specific to GEAC system 
for summary holdings information. Locally in CLINES, the recommendation 
is that the shelf location ($s) data could be
<UL>
<LI>from where the electronic journal could be accessed (eg $sLIBRARY
REFERENCE DESK TERMINAL)
<LI>the internet address of the journal (eg http://worldnews.net
<LI>simply indicating that the material is an electronic journal (eg
$selectronic journal)

<P>
There are at least six commonly used fields in USMARC bibliographic
format for representing title information.   The choice of field
depends on the source of the title to be coded.
<P>
This Cataloguing Note provides a general guideline for coding
information relating to titles.  It is chiefly meant to assist
in original cataloguing decision, but can be applied to checking
incoming records from ABN or other sources.
<P>
Please note that in the CSIRO Union Catalogue, many alternate
titles which should be coded as Tag 246 but have been left as
Tag 740.  This is because coding was done according to AUSMARC
format and there were difficulties in converting to USMARC format
correctly.   Some records being downloaded from ABN can also have
field coding errors.   Follow this guideline to change the coding
such fields to the appropriate one.
<P>
Examples used to demonstrate the usage of the fields are copied
exactly from the CSIRO Union Catalogue, disregarding the subfield
codes.

<a name=intro> </a>
<p><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
SIM has been implemented within CSIRO to provide a high quality information service to scientists, managers and staff, all of whom have
access to a variety of text databases from their own computers or workstations. SIM is searched by means of graphical user interfaces which
are fast, efficient and easy to learn: SIMPCI for users of IBM-compatible personal computers, and SIMWWW for users of Macintoshes,
IBM-compatible PCs and other workstations. 
<p>
Currently, CSIRO use SIM as a platform for a number of quite different databases.<p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>CSIRO Index</b></i> (CSIX), CSIRO's own database of publications; <p>
<li><i><b>Current Contents</b></i>, (CC), which gives scientists abstracts of the most 
up-to-date journal information; <p>
<li><i><b>Defined Hazardous Substances List</b></i> (DHS), for occupational health and safety use;<p>
<li><i><b>Materials Safety Data Sheets</b></i> (MSDS), information on materials and
 chemicals used in CSIRO laboratories; <p> 
<li><i><b>Records management and Archives Manual</b></i> (RMA), a full text electronic version of the manual; <p>
<li><i><b>SCANfile</b></i>, (SCAN) a reference database for science policy and research
management literature, from CSIRO Corporate Library and Information Service;<p>
<li><i><b>Sector Stocktake of Research</b></i> (STOCKTAKE), a full text collection of Sector Outlook and Stocktakes of Research for all Sectors within CSIRO.<p>
</ul>
Use of these SIM databases is limited to CSIRO staff and to specific subsets of CSIRO staff, according to the sensitivity of the information contained in the database. <p>

<h2>The SIM Software</h2>
<p>The Structured Information Manager (SIM) is information retrieval 
software designed for managing and retrieving information in diverse document databases: text, images and other 
kinds of data.   SIM uses advanced indexing technology based on compressed inverted files 
to provide rapid response from very large databases.
<p>
SIM complies with international standards:<p>
<ul>
<li>ISO 8879 - Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML) for document description and interchange.  SIM imports, stores and exports text in SGML format. SGML is an internationally agreed method for defining 
document structures.  It is widely used for document description and 
interchange; <p>
<li>SIM also supports data in another internationally-accepted format: MARC - MAchine Readable Cataloguing format;
<li>the SIM DBMS is based on ANSI Z39.50, the standard for vendor-independent interconnection between computers for the purpose of information retrieval;<p>
<li>the query language is a full implementation (with some enhancements) of ISO 8777 - Commands for Interactive Text Searching (also known as the Common Command Language - CCL), which is itself closely related to the ANSI Z39.58 query language standard.<p>
</ul><p>
SIM supports both client/server and distributed computing models, and the open systems environment.
<p>SIM's components are as illustrated below:
<p>
<img src="sim_components.gif">
<p>
They include:<p>
<ul>
<li>The SIM Database Server (SIM DBS), which holds all the data to be stored, searched 
and retrieved;<p>
<li>SIM Command Line Interface (SIMCLI), which enables users to connect to the 
SIM database server from a character-based terminal, and provides search and 
display.  SIMCLI communicates directly with the SIM Database Server;<p>
<li>SIM PC Interface (known as SIMPCI), which allows users on a PC running 
Microsoft Windows 3.1 to connect to the SIM DBS via a gateway process.  SIMPCI is a 
graphical user interface for searchers, which comes with an SGML browser product (known as the Waterloo Text Viewer) developed by the Waterloo Foundation for the Advancement of Computing);<p>
<li>SIM PC Gateway, which handles communication between SIMPCI and the SIM DBS;<p>
<li>SIM World Wide Web (SIMWWW) gateway, used in conjunction with a web browser such as Netscape.
</ul> 
<hr><p>
<a name=inforetr> </a>
<h2>Information Retrieval Features of SIM</h2>
<p>SIM has sophisticated information retrieval features:<p>
<ul>
<li>search multiple databases; <p>
<li>very rapid retrieval on large databases<p>
<li>view or print results as formatted text (that is, special characters such as Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts, and mathematical symbols are displayed);<p>
<li>hypertext links between related information;<p>
<li>save results in a variety of electronic formats for use in other applications software; <p>
<li>display, store and recall search strategies; <p>
<li>run regular current awareness searches (SDIs);<p>
<li>relevance ranking;<p>
<li>security and billing facilities;<p>
<li>choice of search interfaces.
</ul><p>
Search interfaces include graphical user interfaces (GUIs) - SIMPCI for users of IBM-compatible personal computers, and World Wide Web (WWW) browsers such as Netscape in conjunction with the SIMWWW gateway for users of Macintoshes, IBM-compatible PCs and other workstations - and a command line search option.  SIMPCI and SIMWWW searchers proceed via query forms (where search terms are entered), menus and buttons, and pull-down lists using a mouse and the 'point and click method', and/or the 'Enter' key.<p>
<p>In the SIM CLI interface, commands are entered by the searcher to 
perform the various search functions.  Some of the SIM commands 
(particularly FIND and SHOW) have their own syntax.
<p>SIM is interactive:  every action made by the searcher is answered by the 
retrieval system, in the form of a result, or by an error or information 
message, with an instruction for further action to be taken by the searcher.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
SIM release 1.3 provides a new SIM server, new SIMPC gateway and SIMPCI 
client, a new SIM WWW gateway, and fixes some problems experienced by 
users.<p>
<A NAME=MAJ>
<HR>
<h2>Major Changes </h2>
SIM release 1.3:<p>
<UL>
<LI> supports 'fragmented' databases - that is, it enables easy searching, viewing and moving around in large full-text manuals;<p>
<LI> supports hypertext links between databases;<p>
<LI> provides the new SIMWWW gateway, with full search functions, including SDIs; ability to 
        edit saved searches; variety of view/save options and formats, including ProCite output from CC and CSIX; <p>
<li>  fixes some bugs in the SIMPCI, and provides additional options 
for handling saved search strategies.<p>
</UL>
<A NAME=WWW>
<HR>
<h2>SIM WWW Gateway</h2><p>
Features include:<p>
<ul>
<li>  New look screens;<p>
<li>  User configurable-options which allow you to select a default 
database, specify your workstation environment (PC/Mac/Unix), adjust 
height and width of certain display windows, etc;<p>
<li>  Context-sensitive help;<p>
<li>  Full range of search options;<p>
<li>  Fully-functional SDIs;<p>
<li>  Saved search strategies may be displayed, edited, emailed;<p>
<li>  Records can be viewed in a variety of formats on screen, or saved 
on your local workstation, or emailed.<p>
<li>  Formats for viewing/saving are database-specific.  Text-only and 
Web-Browser formats are provided for each database.  CC and CSIX records 
can be saved in ProCite format;<p>
<li>  Pre-defined fieldsets for viewing records are available.  These 
are also database-specific, but usually include (at least) Full (the 
default format), Brief and Summary.  Details are in the 
<a href="simdoc2.htm">database guides.</a><p>
</ul><P>
<A NAME=DATB>
<HR>
<H2>Databases</H2>
CSIX records can now be saved to disk in ProCite format.<P>
<A NAME=PCIC>
<HR>
<H2>SIMPCI 1.3 - Changes</H2>
<h3>Searching</h3>
Long search statements are not truncated (in SIMPCI 1.1d there was a 
limit to the length of a search - about 256 Kb or around 25 sets combined 
with OR).  There are now no limits to search statement length in SIMPCI 
1.3.<p>
Scan Index Terms window:<p>
<ul>
<li> display fonts are more readable;<p>
<li>if you are connected to more than one dissimilar databases, you can now 
scan and search an index which is present in only one of the databases. <P>
</ul>
<H3>Saved Searches</H3>
For working with saved searches (Click Icon 4) there are now some extra 
features:<p>
<ul>
<li> there is now an All Files (*.*) option when loading searches with the File Open option (in the Open window;<p>
<li> File Delete includes a verification message<p>
<li> Saved searches which have been edited in the Open window do not automatically overwrite the original search when run.<P>
</ul>
<P>
<H3>Viewing Records</H3>
The 'Illegal function call' problem which caused SIMPCI to crash (usually 
associated with the use of icon 8 -Summary List) has been fixed.<P>
An 'Unmark Selected' items option has been added to the Summary List Form 
window. <P>
When viewing a full-text manual (such as the INFO database), a Contents 
window will open beside the Text Viewer. You can move around the document 
(eg, from section to section) by clicking on items listed in the Contents 
window.<P>
The Options menu on the SIMPCI Toolbar now has a 'Reload Cache' entry.  
Use this function if you see an error message that says that a DTD or 
STYLE file is missing; it will reload all the DTD and style files from 
the SIM server onto your PC so that you can view database records.<P>
View Source window now displays fonts in a readable size.<P>
<A NAME=PCIP>
<HR>
<H2>SIMPCI 1.3 - Known Problems</H2>
These problems which were features of SIMPCI 1.1d are still present in 
SIMPCI 1.3.<P>
<H3>Database Selection</H3>
The scrollbar in the database help section of the Database Selection Form 
does not work, but information on each database has been edited so that 
the text fits into the available five lines. <P>
<H3>Searching</H3>
CCL Query Form - searching secondary indexes - If your search text 
contains a comma or parentheses you should continue to use double 
quotation marks (") around your search text;<P>
Plural stemming -   the tilde (~) is intended to be used at the end of a 
word stem so that singular/plural forms of the term are retrieved.  It is 
not currently giving accurate results.  Work-around: use the OR operator 
between singular and plural forms,    eg, rat OR rats <P>
<h3>Scanning Indexes</h3>
In the Scan Index Terms window, if the range you wish to scan starts on 
one screen and continues to the next, you must select and search for the 
values in the current screen, then move to the next screen (click down 
arrow) to select and search the continuation of the range.  Combine the 
sets with OR in the Set History window.  <p>
There is still a bug associated with resetting the databases to be 
scanned by means of the small Set Scan Databases window (after you do so 
only the Basic index will be scanned, despite what the index box says).  <p>
No thesauri are currently implemented in SIM, so an error message is 
generated when you click the Thesaurus Lookup button. <P>
<p>
<H3>Printing/Saving to Disk</H3>
Process Records window: the Change Format button leads to another window, 
but users cannot actually change any formats, and do not need to do so.  
All  relevant fieldsets and formats to the current database are shown in 
the Process records window.  Please ignore the Change Format button. <P>
Printing a range of records or cancelling a print operation (other than 
record by record) is still not possible. (It will not be possible until 
SIMPCI incorporates a Text Viewer which has this feature);<P>
Marking items for saving as you move through the Text Viewer is not 
possible.  [Use icon 10 instead, to save the current record to a file];<P>
Sorting the output (prints or saves to disk) is not yet possible.<P>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p><i>Q:  Where do I get a userid/password? </i><br>
A: Contact your site librarian or <a 
href="http://www.csiro.au/computing/helpdesk/helpdesk.htm">ITS Help 
Desk</a>.
Each CSIRO site has its own generic password and userid. SIMWWW users 
who are concerned about the privacy of their saved searches will be able to 
request individual <a href=" http://www.csiro.au/computing/helpdesk/userrego.htm">userids</a> for SIM. (If you logon with your own SIM userid to enter and save searches, your searches can be seen, run and edited by only you and noone else.) 

<p><i>Q: I am experiencing difficulties getting into SIM. What do I 
do?</i><br>
A:</b> It depends on what the problem is:<p>
<ul>
<li>If you receive a message saying the server is down, please ring the <a
href="http://www.csiro.au/computing/helpdesk/helpdesk.htm">ITS Help 
Desk</a> or <a
href="http://www.cis.csiro.au/usersupp/index.htm">CCIM Helpdesk</a>
and inform staff.</il><p>
<li>If the message is saying your password is incorrect, make sure that you
have the caps lock key off, as the userid and password are case sensitive 
and must be entered in lower case.<p>
<li>If you are using SIMWWW, the recommended browser to use is 
Netscape. There have been problems connecting through Mosaic and 
MacWeb.</ul>

<p><i>Q: How do I find out which version of SIMPCI I have installed?</i><br>
A: Under the Help Menu above the SIM toolbar, choose 'About SIM'.  Your
version of SIM and the release date will be displayed. The latest release of 
SIMPCI is 1.3.3.

<p><i>Q: Why aren't the databases in alphabetical order?</i><br>
A: Databases are listed alphabetically by name in two sequences. Simple
database names are in the first sequence; names which are 'aliases' for a
group of databases appear in the second sequence. 'CC' is an alias for 
separate groups of CC issues, so it appears at the end of the list. So far,
'CC' is the only alias in use.
<hr>
<a name=search></a>
<h2>Searching</h2>
	
<p><i>Q: When logging on to the SIMWWW interface, I did not actually 
specify a database for searching, however, CC comes up apparently, as a 
default. Why did this happen?</i><br>
A: See <a href="simul18.htm">SIMulcasts no.18</a> for explanation.

<p><i>Q: Using SIMPCI 1.3, is there a limit to the number of characters in a
search string?</i><br>
A: There are no limits to search statement length in SIMPCI 1.3. (SIMPCI 
1.1d did have a limit of 256 characters.) For further explanation see <a 
href="simul19.htm">SIMulcasts no.19</a>.

<p><i>Q: Where can I find a description of Boolean logic to assist me in the
development of search strategies?</i><br>
A: See <a 
href="tutorial/inforet.htm">Information Retrieval Techniques</a>.

<p><i>Q: How do I search using author names and initials?</i> <br>
A: This is outlined in <a href="simul3.htm">SIMulcasts no.3</a> and <a
href="simul20.htm">SIMulcasts no.20</a>, and in the individual <a href="simdoc2.htm">Database Guides</a>.

<p><i>Q: How does SIM search journal titles which have ampersands?</i> 
<br>
A: This is outlined in <a href="simul3.htm#jamp">SIMulcasts no.3</a>.

<p><i>Q: How do I combine a search with a particular/latest issue of Current
Contents? </i><br>
A: The IssueNumber index contains the issue number for the weekly CC 
edition. You can use it to limit your search to the last issue or several issues. 
Perform your search as usual. Then search (or scan) the IssueNumber index 
for the number you want. <br>
<b>SIMPCI:</b> Use the Combine AND option in the Set History window to 
combine the IssueNumber set with your earlier set. See the SIMPCI tutorial 
<a href="tutorial/pcisets.htm">Working with Sets</a>.<br> 
<b>SIMWWW:</b> Use the AND radio button (on the Combine Sets line) on 
the Search Result Sets window to combine the IssueNumber with your earlier 
set.

<p><i>Q: How do I interrupt a search? </i><br>
A: For SIMPCI only, some operations, eg. searching and saving to disk (but 
not printing because of the limitations of the Waterloo Browser), can be
interrupted by clicking on the State button at the bottom right hand side of
the SIM toolbar. See <a href="simul18.htm">SIMulcasts no.18</a>.

<p><i>Q: I have run an SDI and the system crashed before I could view the 
results, how do I reproduce the result set?</i><br>
A: SIM should not have changed the timestamp on your SDI. You can  just
re-execute the SDI. However, if you do this, and receive zero results, you can
change the timestamp to an earlier time by editing your saved search in the Saved Search Form (SIMPCI) or the Edit Saved Search form (SIMWWW).

<p><i>Q: Can a more meaningful date stamp be displayed for the user so 
that an SDI shows when the search was last accessed/run?</i><br>
A: SDI searches are timestamped by the SIM software. The timestamp is the
system time when the search was last run. Thus next time a user runs the 
SDI search, he/she only retrieves the records added since that time, and the
search is timestamped again. Because this is an integral part of the SDI
search process within SIM, the timestamp cannot be changed to something 
more understandable (such as date).

<p><i>Q: Is it possible to search earlier copies of Current Contents in SIM 
than just the last 6 months?</i> <br>
A: CSIRO has an agreement with ISI, the publisher of Current Contents to 
use up to 12 months of CC issues. Weekly CC issues are added to the SIM 
CC database and the earliest data is taken off in monthly instalments to 
comply with the licence agreement. A 'rolling' 12 months of CC issues is 
maintained as a SIM database.

<p><i>Q: Why am I unable to use the Thesaurus in the SIM 
databases?</i><br>
A: No thesauri are currently implemented in SIM, so the Thesaurus Lookup button in the Scan Index Terms window does not work. 

<p><i>Q: Why do the 'with' and 'same' context operations give the same 
results in the reference databases?</i><br>
A: The 'with' operator searches for words within the same paragraph, while 
the 'same' operator limits words to the same sentence. The 'same' operation 
has not been implemented in the reference databases so the result is 
equivalent to 'with'.

<hr>
<a name=view></a>
<h2>Viewing records</h2>

<p><i>Q: How do I quickly view titles in my result set?</i><br>
A: <b>SIMPCI:</b> Click icon 8 (or chose Operations, Summarise in the Set 
History window.) This opens the Summary List of titles. See <a 
href="simul18.htm">SIMulcasts no.18</a>. <br>
<b>SIMWWW:</b> Click on the Show Summary for Selected Result Set 
radio button then, click the Perform Search Result Processing button. When 
in the Search Result Summary Form appears, use the page up or page down 
button at the bottom of the screen.

<p><i>Q: Am I able to view a record in the Text Viewer from a highlighted 
record in the Summary List?</i><br>
A: By double clicking a specific record in the Summary List, you are able to 
view it in the Text Viewer.

<p><i>Q: How can I view different records in the Text Viewer, ie. not in 
numerical order?</i> <br>
A: You can do this by using the icons on the top right hand side of the SIM 
toolbar. The forward or backward double arrows take you to the last or first 
record in that set respectively. The single forward or backward arrow allows 
you to move one record at a time, and if you want to retrieve a specific 
record, you can type the record number in the box underneath the control 
arrows. 

<p><i>Q: Can I highlight terms on more than one screen at a time in the Scan 
Index Terms window?</i><br>
A: A feature of SIM is that it has the capacity to highlight on only one 
screen at a time. If the range you wish to scan starts on one screen and 
continues to the next, you must select and search for the values in the 
current screen, then move to the next screen (click down arrow) select and 
search the continuation of the range. Combine the sets with OR in the Set 
History window. (<a href="changes_13.htm#PCIP">SIMPCI 1.3 - Known Problems</a>.)

<p><i>Q: Why is the highlighting of some terms inconsistent when viewing 
the records in the SIMPCI Text Viewer? </i><br>
A: This problem is acknowledged and we hope to address it in a future 
release of SIMPCI.

<hr>

<a name=savess></a>
<h2>Saving - Search strategies </h2>
	
<p><i>Q: How do I save all my sets into a saved search?</i><br>
A: Make sure you highlight all the sets you wish to save. (SIMPCI: Use 
Operations, Select All to highlight all sets). See <a
href="simul19.htm">SIMulcasts no.19</a>.

<p><i>Q: How do I create an SDI?</i><br>
A: <b>SIMPCI:</b>The steps for creating an SDI for SIMPCI are outlined in 
<a href="simul1.htm ">SIMulcasts no.1</a>.<br>
<b>SIMWWW:</b>



<p><i>Q: Is there a way of saving just the journal name so on re-execution I 
can select it again?</i> <br>
A: Save the journal name (with a ? at the end) as a saved search or an 
SDI. You can then combine it with other terms.

<p><i>Q: How do I save a search to use again?</i><br>
A: To save searches see <a href="simul19.htm">SIMulcasts no.19.</a><br>
To save an SDI search see <a href="simul1.htm">SIMulcasts no.1</a> 
(SIMPCI).
	
<p><i>Q: Where are saved searches stored for SIMWWW?</i><br>
A: Saved searches for SIMWWW are saved on the SIM server and are 
accessible to all staff logging on with the generic userid for that Division. 
SIMWWW users who are concerned about the privacy of their saved 
searches will be able to request individual <a href=" http://www.csiro.au/computing/helpdesk/userrego.htm">userids</a> for SIM. (If you logon with your own SIM userid to enter and save searches, your searches can be seen, 
run and edited by only you and noone else. 

<p><i>Q: When I run an SDI do I have to re-save it?</i><br>
A: No. SIM automatically alters the timestamp for SDIs. If you re-save the 
search with no changes, you will have problems as there will now be two sets 
numbered set zero. If you wish to make changes to an SDI and re-save this, 
change the name of the file.

<a name=savesr></a>
<h2>Saving - Search results</h2>

<p><i>Q: How do I save just the document I am viewing?</i><br>
A: <b>SIMPCI:</b> Click on Icon 10 and select an appropriate Field Set and 
Record Format. Click on the Process button and save document to a file.<br>
<b>SIMWWW:</b>
Click on the 'Search result sets' icon (which is the sixth icon from the left of 
the screen), select the 'Capture' radio button and click the Process button. 
The Capture Records screen will appear. Select the 'Save to Local Disk'  and 
'Records in Range' radio buttons - nominating the correct record in the set. 
Choose the appropriate style and field set and click the Process button. Save 
document to disk and select or enter a file name.

<p><i>Q: How do I save my search results to disk?</i><br>
A: <b>SIMPCI:</b>
Select the records you want to save in the Summary List form (Icon 8). Click 
the Save button. [Alternatively, highlight the set which has the results you 
want. Use Operations Save menu in the Set History window.] In the Process 
Results window choose an appropriate Field Set and Record Format and 
click the Process button. Save the results under a new file name on your hard 
drive or floppy disk.<br>
<b>SIMWWW:</b> Click on the 'Search result sets' icon (which is the sixth 
icon from the left of the screen), select the 'Capture' radio button (on the Records in Set line) and click the Process button. The Capture Records screen will appear. Select the 'Save to Local Disk'  and 'Records in Range' radio buttons - nominating the 

results you wish to save. Choose the appropriate style and field set and click the Process button. Save document to disk and select or enter a file name.

<p><i>Q: How do I interrupt a 'save to disk' operation?</i><br>
A: Some operations, eg. searching, saving to disk (but not printing because of 
the limitations of the Waterloo Browser), can be interrupted by clicking the 
STATE button at the bottom right hand side of the SIMPCI toolbar. See  <a
href="simul18.htm">SIMulcasts no.18</a>.

<p><i>Q: Can I append my saved records to a file in SIMPCI?</i><br>
A: To do this, select the records you wish to save in the Summary List form 
and click the Save button (or use the Operations Save option in the Set 
History window). In the Process Records window select the appropriate Field 
Set and Record form and click the 'Process' button. Choose the file in which 
you wish to save your records. A dialog box will appear with three choices. To
append records to a file, you need to select 'Yes'.

<p><i>Q: When I view my saved search in Word it looks extremely messy. 
How do I reformat the results to make them easier to read?</i><br>
A: You can do this by following these steps: Highlight the whole document, 
change the font to Courier and the point size to 10. Go into Page Setup and 
change all the margins to zero or a very small width (eg. 0.2cm). This should 
tidy up the document and make the records easy to read.

<p><i>Q: Is there any way of getting rid of the capitalisation of titles for 
Current Contents records? It makes saving records to Pro-Cite a 
problem.</i><br>
A: Unfortunately not. ISI provide CSIRO with the tapes of CC and the data is 
formatted this way. This will not be changed by ISI before 1996.
        
<p><i>Q: How do you download records from SIMPCI into Pro-Cite?</i><br>
A: Make sure you save records to disk with an appropriate Pro-Cite format 
(see 
<a href="ccdbg.htm">Current Contents Database Guide</a>). Consult the 
Pro-Cite manual for importing instructions.

<p><i>Q: Can the SIMWWW interface download records in Procite 
format?</i><br>
A: Yes, this is now possible for Current Contents and CSIX records with SIM 
1.3.

<p><i>Q: Are there any plans to include other output formats such as 
Papyrus or EndNote for SIM databases?</i><br>
A: Yes, such formats will be provided in the future.

<hr>
<a name=print></a>
<h2>Printing</h2>

<p><i>Q: How do I print just the document I am viewing?</i><br>
A: You can do this by clicking the print icon button in the middle of the SIM 
toolbar.

<p><i>Q: How can I print a whole set without saying OK to each separate
record?</i><br>
A: Unfortunately, printing still needs to be done record by record until SIM 
incorporates a new text viewer which allows a range to be printed in one 
operation.

<p><i>Q: Can I print a range of documents?</i><br>
A: If you have a large set, and want to print all the records, the most 
efficient way of doing this is to save the result to disk and use your 
wordprocessing package to print from. See <a 
href="changes_13.htm#PCIP">SIMPCI 1.3 - Known Problems</a>.

<hr>
<a name=error></a>
<h2>Error messages</h2>

<p><i>Q: I received the error message: 'unknown host' whilst working in SIM. 
When I tried to go back and perform another task, SIM locks up. What do I 
do?</i><br>
A: This is probably a local setup problem.  You could try logging out of SIM 
and logging back in. If this does not work, contact your SysMan.

<p><i>Q: When testing an SDI (SIMPCI) I clicked on Icon no.8 and an 'Illegal 
function call' message was displayed. What does this mean? </i><br>
A: This is a bug in SIMPCI 1.1d. The problem does not occur with SIMPCI 
1.3. 

<p><i>Q: I received an error message saying 'DTD file missing' or 'style files missing' after logging onto SIM.</i><br>
A: If you are a SIMPCI user and receive this error, use Options, Reload 
Cache from the toolbar menu to reload all DTD and style files from the SIM 
server on to your PC.

<hr>
<a name=misc></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><i>Q: Are there plans to blank the background for SIM? </i><br>
A: In the current release there are limitations imposed by the text viewer 
(the Waterloo Browser) which is a proprietary software package licensed for 
use by CITRI with SIM.  It will not run subordinate to (inside) another 
window, that is why SIM appears so fragmented on the screen.

<p>You could try using a bland wallpaper and minimising all other 
applications if you find the background distracting.

<p><i>Q: How do I make sure I am notified of information about SIM and its 
databases?</i><br>
A: A listserver for SIM has been set up. Details for subscribing can be found 
in <a href="simul10.htm">SIMulcasts no.10</a>.

<p><i>Q: Will databases such as Medline, Biological Abstracts or Science 
Citation Index be included on SIM?</i><br>
A: Various reference databases are currently undergoing evaluation for 
inclusion on SIM by the SIM Project Team and the <a
href="http://www.cis.csiro.au/cis/lib/iag/iag.htm">IAG</a>.  
Subscribe to the <a href="simlist.htm">SIM Listserv</a> to ensure you 
receive 
news about SIM and its databases.

<p><i>Q: How do I propose a database for inclusion in SIM?</i><br>
A: Mounting databases on SIM is an issue for the SIM Project Manager and 
the SIM Project Team. At present those databases that are planned for the 
corporate SIM server are databases that can be demonstrated to have value 
for the whole organisation. Suggestions for candidate databases or documents 
for delivery via SIM to CSIRO users are welcome and may be directed to:<p>
<ul>
<li>SIM Services Project Leader - <a href="mailto:leigh.parsons@cis.csiro.au">Leigh Parsons</a><p>
<li>User Support -  <a href="mailto:helpdesk@cis.csiro.au">helpdesk@cis.csiro.au</a>
</ul>

<p><i>Q: Are CSIRO's SIM databases available to people outside the 
organisation?</i><br>
A: No, CSIRO's SIM databases are available only to CSIRO staff.

<p><i>Q: When are the Current Contents tapes loaded?</i><br>
A: The CC tapes are loaded weekly in Canberra. Usually the new issue is
available on Thursday mornings. Users subscribed to the  <a 
href="simlist.htm">SIM Listserv</a> receive notification of each update.

<p><i>Q: How do I email search results to a client?</i><br>
A: See <a href="simul19.htm">SIMulcasts no.19</a>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL><DL><DD><h1>SIMPCI Redevelopment</h1>
<hr>
<p>Negotiations have taken place with the vendors of SIM to speed up the release of a new PCI. Although the current version of the PCI is stable, it is not as user friendly and intuitive as we would like it to be. Redevelopment of the PCI has been held off by the vendors of SIM, as it was planned to re-write the PCI completely to coincide with the release of Version 2.0 of SIM. Unfortunately, the release date of Version 2.0 has been pushed back until 1997. 

<p>To accomodate CSIRO's requirements, the vendors have agreed to develop an interim release of the PCI, incorporating the screen design envisiaged for Version 2.0. The redeveloped PCI will be limited to dealing with screen design issues, rather than implementing extra functionality. This is because the current PCI and the redeveloped version of the current PCI will not be compatible with Version 2.0 of SIM. The whole PCI for Version 2.0 will work differently behind the scenes, and as a result will require a complete rewrite. 

<p>Therefore, it has been decided that it would be benificial to both CSIRO and the vendors of SIM to implement the analysis and design phases of the development of the Version 2.0 PCI into an earlier version of SIM. Obviously, the benifits to CSIRO will be to provide access to SIM via a more user friendly and efficient interface, and the vendors of SIM will get a head start on the screen design aspects and user requirements of the interface to be implemented with Version 2.0 of SIM.

<p>The specifications for this release will address quite a number of bugs and shortcomings identified by CSIRO in Version 1.3 of the PCI. Ten major design enhancements have been identified and will be included in the new version of the PCI. A date for release of the PCI has been scheduled for the first half of December 1996. 

<p>
<hr>
<h2><b>The Top 10 SIMPCI Enhancements</b></h2>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>1. Windows/GUI standards Compliance</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>The redeveloped PCI will have minimise, maximise and close buttons on every window.<p>
<li>Windows and forms will be movable and resizable. <p>
<li>Windows and forms will no-longer move or resize on their own.<p>
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>2. All SIMPCI windows will be contained within one main window.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>The SIMPCI toolbar will be incorporated into a main window, in which all other windows and forms will be displayed. <p>
<li>This will give the ability to minimise sub-windows and forms and for them to be displayed as surface icons 
on the main window's background.<p>
<li>The main window itself will now be able to be minimised.<p>
<li>Similar applications include MSWORD 6 and Eudora<p>
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>3. The ability to cut and paste out of the viewer windows.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>The Waterloo SGML Viewer will be upgraded to the latest Version, called LivePage which facilitates the ability to cut and paste text out of the viewer.<p>
<li>All cutting and pasting will be handled via the clip-board using the standard keyboard commands.<p>
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>4. Toolbar Icons improved.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>Icons on the toolbar will have Balloon Help (small yellow balloons), containing text describing the purpose of the icons.<p>
<li>All menu items that appear on other forms willbe incorporated into the toolbar.<p> 
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>5. CCL Query Form, Rank Query Form, and On-Line Help Query forms to be merged.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>A generic query form will be create which will enable the user to choose the type of query required.<p>
<li>The Rank Query form should look and feel the same as the one on the WWW. I.e. it should have a large area into which to paste text, not a single line with a pull-down button which is more appropriate to a drop-down selection list than an enlargement of the text area. The text should handle CR LFs properly. A Sanitize button should be available.  
</ul>

<p><hr><p><b><i>6. Consistent toggling of forms.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>Windows or forms will all toggle consistently. For example, if a user clicked the set history icon, the window will appear; if the user presses it for a second time, the set history window will disappear.<p>
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>7. Interactive Database Help.</i></b><p>
<ul> 
<li>When a DB is selected from the list, the database information relevant to that DB will immediately be displayed in the information area on the DB Selection form without any clicking of the Database Help button. <p>
<li>The area be scrollable also enabling larger, more comprehensive database help.<p>
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>8. Set scan index button to be removed.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>The Set scan index button does not work properly, is confusing and ultimately is not needed. The indexes available in the Scan Index Terms form should be determined solely by the database selections. They are not at the moment, though they should be.<p>
</ul>

<hr><p><b><i>9. Configurable interface preferences.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>A Configuration form will be available at the Menu level or with an icon, (similar to the  WWW Configuration screen) to enable users to set their preferences and settings rather than editing the simpci.ini file.
</ul>

<p><hr><p><b><i>10. Default server.</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than having the Server form displaying each time a user logs in, a default SIM Server will be initialised.<p>
<li>To select a different server the user would click the servers icon, which would then display the servers form.
</ul>

<DL><DL><DD><h1>SIM Version 2.0</h1>
<hr>

<h3>Timeframe for Release</h3>

<p>Development work on Version 2.0 of SIM has been progressing steadily. Currently, Version 2.0 of SIM is scheduled for release by the second quarter of 1997. Although not completely finalised, below is an overview of what will most likely be incorporated into the Version 2.0 release. As more details come to hand, a more specific list of enhancements will be developed.

<h3>Broad Aims of Version 2.0</h3>

<p>The main aim of SIM 2.0 is Z39.50 Version 3 conformance. Part of the aim is to
allow third party Z39.50 client software to be able to access a SIM server.  Also, the ability to
allow SIM  PC and WWW clients to access other Z39.50 servers in the world (eg other
libraries). This opens up numerous opportunities for CSIRO. For example, this would enable CSIRO to access a number of different vendors of electronic journals around the world, via SIM's PC and World Wide Web Interfaces.

<h3>Technical Issues</h3>

<p>Other broad areas are a PC development environment. RMIT-MDS have also been investigating the possibility of porting SIM from the current Sun Solaris UNIXoperating system, to Microsoft Windows NT. RMIT-MDS also want to rework the SGML parser (a tool for checking the validity of SGML documents), so that it can to handle external entity references properly.

<p>The PC Interface will be rewritten, however the development work currently underway on the <a href="pciredev.htm">interim PC Interface</a> for CSIRO, will in most instances, dictate at least how the new interface will look (ie keep same interface, change code behind scenes).

<p>The creation of databases with a "built in" Virtual Table of Contents will be made easier with the advent of Automatic Fragmentation. As the name suggests, the process will require much less human intervention. The benifits will include less time required for development and maintenance of databases.

<h1>SIM LISTSERVER</h1>
<HR>
<h2>Instructions for subscribing to the SIM Listserver</h2>

The SIM listserver is used by the SIM Management Team to disseminate information 
about the SIM service to users within CSIRO.  Documentation, searching tips, news 
and comments about SIM and its data sets are distributed by electronic mail to all subscribers
 to the listserver.<P>

There are two ways for users to be added to the list.<P>

1.  Do it yourself by sending an email to <B>sim-users-request@its.csiro.au</B> with no subject and the word:</P>
<PRE><B>     subscribe</B></PRE><P>
in the body of the email.<P>
2. Someone else does it for you (librarian/helpdesk etc) by sending an 
email to<P> 
<B>sim-users-request@its.csiro.au</B> with no subject and the line in the body of the email:<P>
<PRE><B>     subscribe sim-users Firstname Surname &lt;email address&gt;</B></PRE><P>
eg subscribe sim-users Sharon Johnson &lt;sharon.johnson@its.csiro.au&gt;<P>

After the subscription message has been sent you will be added to the list and 
you should receive a <B>Welcome to the sim-users mailing list! </B> email.  
This message will tell you what the list is for, and how to remove your name 
from the mailing list (unsubscribe).  If someone else has subscribed on your 
behalf, that person will also get a notification message.<P>

You will automatically receive any messages sent to the SIM listserver after you subscribed.<P>

If you wish to send mail to the sim-users listserver, address the email to: <B>sim-users@its.csiro.au</B><P>

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list, send an email to
<B>sim-users-request@its.csiro.au:</B> with no subject and the word:</P>
<PRE><B>     unsubscribe</B></PRE><P>
in the body of the email.<P>
Alternatively you can send mail to <B>Majordomo@its.csiro.au</B> with the 
following comment in the body of your email message:<P>
<PRE><B>     unsubscribe sim-users Firstname Surname &lt;email address&gt;</B></PRE><P>
eg unsubscribe sim-users Sharon Johnson &lt;sharon.johnson@its.csiro.au&gt;<P>

Please remember that messages posted to the listserver go to everyone on the list.  If you want to contact an individual take note of his or her address and send your message to him or her alone.<P>

<P>
Dear All,
<P>
The Voyager Listserver is a list server for users (and users-to-be) of
Voyager and a tool for Endeavor. Lately, there has been a little
discussion on user group meeting, importing, etc
<P>
As some of you are aware, there are only a few CSIRO people subscribed to
this listserver. This is mainly because
<OL>
<LI>It is basically a read only environment, ie if CSIRO wants to utilize
the listserver for obtaining information it is most likely not the
correct way to obtain it. For example, if want information say on stop
words, we may get 30 responses on the listserver and trying to sort those
out for our purposes would be quite confusing and inefficient. There are
better ways.
<LI>If CSIRO wants to put a query/remark on the listserver it should come
from someone on the Voyager Management team, or at least be channeled
through them. (ie not from individuals all over the place)
<LI>Other formal channels are in place via Ferntree and Endeavor Support
to answer specific questions/problems/issues/etc. It is not the place to
report problems.
<LI>When info on the listserver is important for the network it will be
forwarded as has been done on at least one previous occassion.
<LI>People who are subscribed to VOY-L need to consider the info they
receive in this medium carefully.<br>
Yes bits are useful but<br>
- what version of software are they using?<br>
- is the info relevent to CSIRO?<br>
- is the info more confusing rather than helpful?<br>
etc<br>
</OL>
<P>
With the above understood, I don't mind who subscribes to VOY-L<br>
BUT<br>
I would prefer that CAREFUL consideration be given before making ISSUES
of something that CSIRO may have NO control over, eg Version 3.2 software
capabilities due for release in the Northern Hemisphere's SUMMER.
(When things are a bit more settled we will all have more time to deal
with those matters. At the moment we're trying to get this version's
implementation complete.)
<P>
Regards,<br>
Anne

<b>Summary of Trip</B><br>
Took part in Endeavor Training Programme, Monday to Thursday<br>
inclusive. Ten people attended from five different<br>
customers, 3 universities and 2 scientific research<br>
organisations.<br>
<p>
The best part of the training was the wide range of<br>
questions that were raised and how well they were responded<br>
to by Endeavor staff. The worst part of the training was due<br>
to the developmental state of the software. By this, I<br>
mean that one day a function did not work, the next day it<br>
did and this meant revisiting parts of the system in a bit<br>
of an ad hoc manner. The good point of this was the<br>
quickness of the Endeavor programmers to fix or enhance the<br>
system.<br>
<p>
On Thursday and Friday I had discussions with Endeavor staff<br>
covering a wide range of issues.<br>
Della Williams, CSIRO's Account Manager, made appointments<br>
with other Endeavor staff for me. Della was very helpful and<br>
was able to answer many questions.<br>
Dave Dempsey, discussed Ingres, configuration and other<br>
technical issues.<br>
Verne Coppe, discussed version release, upgrades,<br>
reports/notices, futures, etc.<br>
<p>
Arrived in Manhattan, Kansas State University, and spent 1.5<br>
days discussing issues concerning Voyager, in particular<br>
their relationship with Endeavor and to get a feel for the<br>
way they do things regarding automated library management.<br>
I spent individual time with five senior staff (Voyager<br>
Project implementation manager - also Senior Reference<br>
Librarian, Bibliographic Control Manager, Senior<br>
Acquisitions Librarian, Circulation Manager, and Senior<br>
Computer/Network Manager).<br>
This was very interesting and the campus reminded me of<br>
Adelaide as many buildings (especially the older ones)<br>
looked like they were made of sandstone (actually<br>
limestone).<br>
KSU has a student enrollment of about 22,000.<br>
<p>
KSU is one of 3 official Voyager beta sites. These beta<br>
sites have had the software for about 6-7 weeks. During this<br>
time, the sites have been testing and recommending changes<br>
to the software. Endeavor responds by answering questions,<br>
fixing bugs, including enhancements with delivery of the<br>
software by ftp on a weekly basis. This process appears to<br>
be working extremely well. This is partly due to the<br>
enormous effort (I expect about ten staff) KSU has put into<br>
the process. KSU could not say when they were going live,<br>
partly because of Uni beaurocracy and I also think their<br>
computer environment was not completely ready.<br>
<p>
On returning to Chicago on Wednesday afternoon, I rang Della<br>
and informed her that I would not be in until Thursday. I<br>
spent a few hours travelling downtown (ie to the city<br>
centre), walking through Grant Park, enjoying the lakeside,<br>
and gazing at the wonderful tall skyscrapers. It is a<br>
fantastic and vibrant city and I would love to return one<br>
day to explore it further.<br>
<p>
My last couple of days at Endeavor were spent covering<br>
system administration (again) with 3 Endeavor people and<br>
talking with Mark Wilson, who is in charge of customer<br>
implementations.<br>
<p>
<b>Overview of the Company</B><br>
I confirmed Julie's and Jinette's impression that Endeavor<br>
is certainly on the right track. They have a strong core<br>
executive team who know what they want. The executives are<br>
clear about their goals not only regarding the software but<br>
also regarding client services, now and in the future. They<br>
are now in a position where they listen to customers<br>
requirements and respond to them in a reasonably<br>
professional manner. By this I mean that they do not<br>
necessarily change something just because one customer<br>
requests it. They make changes that will benefit all<br>
customers.<br>
<p>
I don't know the number of current Endeavor employees but do<br>
know that Endeavor have hired at least 5 new staff in the<br>
last 3 months. I also got the impression that staff turnover<br>
is minimal at the moment. They do seem under resourced as<br>
they are all working extremely hard with long hours. Mark<br>
Wilson is currently in the process of employing at least one<br>
more person. Mark said that he is very fussy about who he<br>
employs and though it may take extra time to get the right<br>
person, so far it has paid off. (I agree.)<br>
<p>
<B>Overview of the Software</B><br>
As hinted to above, the Endeavor programmers are furiously<br>
fine tuning Voyager version 3.0 at this time. I was very<br>
impressed at the speed at which work could be accomplished.<br>
Overall I was quite impressed. I believe there is nothing<br>
that would stop us (CSIRO) from trying to go live by the end<br>
of December. This is not to say that Voyager will have<br>
everything we want, far from it. What I do believe is, that<br>
it will provide us with a working system with a very nice<br>
interface.<br>
<p>
Endeavor did not hide the fact that some functions are<br>
clunky and that some flexibility is not available in this<br>
version (3.0). Mostly, the reason for this is that they have<br>
put on hold further enhancements in particular areas until<br>
they are sure the method is correct and suitable in the<br>
longer term. This is good (best?) practice as it means they<br>
are designing and analysing for the long term benefits.<br>
<p>
There will certainly be a change to many of our work<br>
patterns, some positive, some negative. In the longer term,<br>
I'm sure we will be happy with Voyager and possibly even<br>
proud.<br>

<h1>SIM-WWW Tutorial </h1>
The SIMWWW gateway provides access to SIM databases in CSIRO for users of 
PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix workstations running a supported web browser 
such as Netscape.  <p>
This tutorial introduces the features of SIM WWW and provides a simple 
explanation of how to use it to search SIM databases.

<h2DATABASE DESCRIPTION</h2>
<h3>Database name</h3>
<b>AESIS - Australian Earth Sciences Information System</b>
<p>
<h3>Source and Coverage</h3>
The Australian Earth Sciences Information System (AESIS) is the national reference database for the earth science and resource disciplines in Australia. It covers Australian-generated published and unpublished material from 1975 for most material and earlier for materials such as open-file and geological survey reports. From 1979 it also covers material published on continental Australia by non-Australian sources. The database has been developed by the Australian
Mineral Foundation (AMF) in cooperation with AGSO and State Departments of Mines/Minerals and Energy, CSIRO, National Library of Australia, the Australian Geosciences Information Association and many companies and
organisations.
<p>1975 onwards
<br>Updated monthly; reloaded six-monthly
<br>over 140,000 records (as at October 1996)

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<a name=BI> </a>
<p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index contains all the words from titles, abstracts, notes,
basin and tectonic names, and subject descriptor fields. The Basic Index is the default index for
searching when no index is specified.<p>
When searching, you may also search these specific components of the Basic Index.<p>
It does not matter if you use upper or lower case in searching.  Examples are shown
below in lower case.<p>
<p>
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>
The "<B>w</B>"  prefix is a convention used to indicate that
each <i> word </i> in the field is searchable in the Basic index. Enter the search in the CCL Qery form, and select the relevant field from the pull-down list.
<TABLE BORDER=ON CELLPADDING=4>
<TR><TD><B>Search element</TD>
<TD><B>Field Content</TD><TD><B>Example</b> <BR>(This is the search syntax shown
in the Set History window. SIM supplies the parentheses.)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>wTitle</TD><TD>Title</TD><TD><b>find wtitle=(zeolite?)</b>
<BR>Find <i>zeolite </i> or <i>zeolites</i> in the document title</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>wAbstract</TD><TD>Abstract</TD><TD><b>find wabstract=(water %2 pollution)</b>
<BR>Find <i>water</i> within 2 words of <i>pollution</i> in the abstract</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>wNotes</TD><TD>Title</TD><TD>
<b>find wnotes=(conference on materials) </b>
<BR>Find the phrase <i>conference on materials</i> in
the notes fields</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above.
 Use the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW)
to select a search element. These elements may not be scanned individually
with the SCAN command (or toolbar button 6), though the Basic index as a
whole may be scanned.
<p>
<p>
<a name=SEC> </a>
<br>
<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3>
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI using the Scan Index form
(the SIMWWW A-Z icon, selecting the index you wish to browse, and then selecting from the list of terms). <B>It is strongly recommended that using the indexes, rather than the CCL Query form is a better way to search AESIS</B>.  If you use the CCL Query form you need to be aware of the exact punctuation, and the variations that occur. While most of these variations can be overcome by using the truncation character (<B>?</B>), this will also result in false hits. These can be avoided by browsing the index, and selecting the search term.
All secondary indexes in AESIS are indexed by SIM with the "whole phrase" method.
 That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index.  It does not matter if you use upper or lowercase in searching.  Examples are
shown below in lower case.
<p>

<h3>Searching Tips</h3>
<h4>ANOMALOUS VALUES and ELEMENTS </h4>
The AnomElement secondary index includes the chemical names of minerals and other elements assayed. E.g. SiO2, Pb, Au, Fe2O3, as well as some spelt-out names, e.g. lime.
<h4>AUTHOR SEARCHES </h4>
Authors may be searched in two indexes in AESIS: <b>Author </b> and <b>
AuthorCorp</b>.<BR>
<b>Author</b> - This index contains the names of personal authors, editors and compilers, in inverted form, i.e. surname first: 
eg, Falconer A K . Always include the truncation symbol (<B>?</B>) to be
certain of covering any extra initials, hyphens or suffixes. E.g. <b>browne r?</b> will match Browne R M Jnr.
<p>
<b>AuthorCorp</b> - This index contains corporate body names, in non-inverted form, e.g. Pancontinental Mining Ltd. Again the truncation symbol (<b>?</b>) is recommended to overcome differences in punctuation.
<h4>GEOLOGY </h4>
The geology of an area may be approached in a number of different ways in AESIS, by
<UL>
<LI>the <b>Basin</b> index, containing basin and sub-basin names e.g. Adelaide Plains Subbasin.
<LI>the <b>Stratigraphic</b> index containing the stratigraphic names, e.g.Oodlatana formation
<LI>the <b>Tectonic</b> index, containing the tectonic names, e.g. Clarke River Fault Zone.
</UL>
<h4>LOCATIONS </h4>
The locations may be approached in a number of different ways in AESIS, by
<UL>
<LI>the State index, which contains Australian State names, as well as Papua New Guinea, Australia as a whole, plus non-Australian places, denoted as "GENERAL". 
<LI>the Locality index, which contains local place names, e.g. Rum Jungle. To search for non-Australian localities, e.g. Canada, using the CCL Query, note that this term  can appear in the index as a single term or a suffix (<b>CANADA</B> and <b>NEW BRUNSWICK (CANADA)</B>) . To cover both use <b>find locality = ?canada?</b>.
<LI>the MapRef index, which contains grid references at the 1:250 000, and sometimes, at the 1:1 000 000 scale e.g. SD5307 6170 (note the space between the two). The 1:250 000 references are hyperlinked to a grid map highlighting the referenced area.
<LI>the Mine/Well/Deposit name index, which contains these names, e.g. Norindoo 3. Note that a mine/deposit/well number often follows the name.
</UL>
<h4>DOCUMENT TYPES AND SOURCE</H4>
AESIS documents are coded with a document type(s), one of
<pre>
    Annual reports
    Bibliographies
    Conference proceedings and papers
    Monographs and other catalogued materials
    Explanatory notes
    Microfiche
    Papers in a monograph
    Field guides
    Journals
    Logs
    Maps
    Patents
    Records
    Open file reports
    Standards
    Theses
    Unpublished departmental reports
    Abstracts
</pre>
<P>These may be searched using the <b>DocType</b> index.
<p>The <b>Source</b> index which contains the citation of the document, e.g <i>Petroleum Engineer International</i> 63(7) July (1991), is another search access point for specific documents.  
<h4> SUBJECT SEARCHING </h4>
Words from the titles, abstracts and subject descriptors form the <b>Basic</b> Index in
AESIS, so the easiest way to search for a topic is to enter the terms of interest in
the Query form.<p>
For searching on subject terms, two fields are available: Descriptor 
and Broad Subject Category. These indexes may be scanned.<p>
The <b>Broad Subject Index</b> contains the authorised AESIS broad subject code plus expansion, e.g. 1520 Remote Sensing.

The <b>Descriptor</b> index contains subject descriptors, e.g. Porphyry copper deposits. Where appropriate a State code distinguishes between subject areas, e.g. Regional geology NSW.

<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RESULTS</h2>
<h3>Fieldsets</h3>
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets
 may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save
 or print.
<pre><b>Fieldset         Contains</b>
   B (Brief)	Title, Exploration No, Author, AuthorCorp,
                Source, PublYear
   F (Full)	All fields
   S (Summary)	Title, Exploration No.
</pre>
<h3>Formats</h3>
<h4>Text-only (ASCII) format</h4>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the
above lists, and the "Text only" format. The records will be saved to disk
in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc.
After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>Courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<h4>Pro-Cite format</h4>
For saving records in Pro-Cite format, choose the FULL fieldset (this should be the default). Do not choose Brief or Summary because these fieldsets do not contain all of the fields necessary to create a Procite record.
<p>
The saved file is an ASCII quote-delimited, comma-separated file that may be loaded into a Pro-Cite database. It contains 47 fields (many of which will be null ("""")).
The first two fields are the Procite WorkForm Code (or name), and a null (empty) record number field. The Procite WorkForm code is created by SIM on the basis of document type. Where an AESIS record has more than one document type, the first one only has been used. 
<P>Choose the "Comma-delimited" input format when loading into Procite.

<h2>Database description</h2>
<a name=DBNAME>
<h3>Database name</h3>
CCPM   -   CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual
<a name=COV>
<h3>Source and Coverage</h3>

<p>The first edition of this manual was published in February 1994 in hard-copy
form and distributed to some 550 selected CSIRO staff. 

<p>The present electronic version, first launched in October 1996, represents
the first revision of this manual and has been made available to some 700
nominated staff members such as Chiefs, Program Managers, Business Managers and
Corporate Managers and Divisional Librarians.

<p><a href="divlibs.htm">Divisional Librarians</a> will be able to initiate searches on behalf
of staff members without personalised access but with a genuine need for
information from the manual.  They will also be able to assist authorised users
within their Division with SIM searches if required.  Each Divisional librarian 
has been supplied with the names of all authorised users within her/his
Division.

<p>While some sections of the manual have changed little since February 1994,
others have been substantially revised and a complete new section on
"Development & commercial exploitation of CSIRO software" has been added. 

<p>However, this version does not yet take into account the recent major
restructure of CSIRO.  The abolition of the Institutes and the introduction of
Alliances and Sectors has caused a number of significant changes in some
commercial practices, in particular in respect of delegations, that are still to
be reflected in the manual.   Thus a further major revision of the manual is
planned for the closing months of 1996.  Nevertheless, the present electronic
edition is a complete replacement of the 1994 edition, which ceases to be an
authoritative source of CSIRO's commercial practices and policies.

<p>The manual was put together with the assistance of staff across CSIRO as a
guide for everyone involved with customer relations and the technology transfer
process.  It lets people know what CSIRO's policies and procedures in respect of
these matters are, and helps them to go about their particular role in a
confident and practical way.

<h3>Basic Index</h3>

<p>The Basic Index of the CCPM database, indexes the entire contents of the
CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual. The basic Index is the default index for searching 
when no index is specified in the search. It is best used when searching for a term(s) across 
the entire CCPM database. 

<p>For example, a user would select the basic index when searching for anything 
to do with  "legislation" within the entire CCPM database.

<h4>Components of the Basic Index</h4>

Two fields make up the Basic Index. They are the Heading field and the Text field. These two fields, 
when combined into the Basic Index, enable the entire database to be searched. The individual fields
which combine to make up the Basic Index can be used to limit a search to specific parts of the database.

<h4>Heading Field</h4>

<p>This field limits the search to words contained in the Section and
Sub-section headings of the CCPM database.  This field may be used to narrow a
search to specific sections of the CCPM database which deal with a certain
topic covered in the CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual. 

<p>For example, a user would select the Heading field when searching for a topic that is covered 
in the CCPM database, like "Trademarks and Business Reputation". 

<h4>Text Field</h4>

<p>This field limits the search to words contained within a Sub Section of the CCPM database. 
This field is best used when searching for a term(s) across the entire CCPM database, that are not headings. 

<h4>RNum Field</h4>

<p>This field is used to define relationships between records within the CCPM database. 
It is not to be used for searching.

<a name=SI>
<h3>Secondary Index</h3>

<h4>Policy Index</h4>

<p>This index will only search for words contained in the Policy Statements
within the CCPM database.  This index may be used to narrow a search to
information contained within policies that are described in the CSIRO Commercial
Practice Manual. 

<p>For example, a user would select the Policy Index when searching for a particular policy that has been defined 
within the CCPM database. Typically, a user would search for a term(s) which relate specifically to a Policy, like "logo" which would return any Policy statement within the CCPM database, which deals with Logos.

<a name=ST>
<h3>Searching tips</h3>

<p>When the Manual was converted into a SIM database, it was subdivided into 20
Sections (excluding the cover and imprint page) containing some 134
sub-sections. Thus a search will retrieve relevant sub-sections which may then be browsed
to locate the pertinent information.

<p>There are three methods available for searching the CCPM database.  You may
search for specific keywords (or combinations of keywords) using the CCL Query Form (icon 3),
you can scan through the list of keywords that are contained in the particular index, or you may consult
the Table of Contents (TOC) window which is a special feature of the full-text
databases in SIM.

<h4>Keyword Search</h4>

<p>A keyword search enables a user to search for a specific term or terms across
the entire CCPM database, individual Section Headings, or Sub-Section Headings. 

<p>The following example concerns a search for procedures dealing with the
assigning of rights for the use of CSIRO's logo via the SIMPCI.

<ul><li>Step 1.  Click on the <img src="findpci.gif"> icon from the SIMPCI toolbar
<p><li>Step 2.  Type the term "logo" in the CCL Query Form window and click the FIND
Button. The Set History window will then be displayed indicating the number of
hits returned for the particular search.

<p><li>Step 3. By double clicking on the result line within the Set History window,
the first relevant record for that particular search will be displayed. <a
href=ccpmdbg1.gif>see SIMPCI Sample Record</a> 
</ul>

<p>If the retrieved record occupies more than one screen, a scroll bar will
appear on the right hand side of the window. Each occurrence of the search term,
in this case "logo", will be highlighted. In addition to the relevant record, SIM
displays a Table of Contents window in which the content heading of the
retrieved record is highlighted.

<h4>Scanning Indexes</h4>

An alternate method of searching for particular keywords within the CCPM database is to 
use the Scan Index Terms option (icon 6). This option lists all terms that correspond to 
each index within the database. 

<p>The following example concerns a search for procedures dealing with the
assigning of rights for the use of CSIRO's logo via the SIMPCI.

<ul><li>Step 1.  Click on the <img src="scanpci.gif"> icon from the SIMPCI toolbar
<p><li>Step 2.  Type the term "logo" in the Scan Index Terms window and click the Scan
Button. Within the main window of the Scan Index terms Window, a alphabetic listing of 
all terms will appear, displaying the term "logo" and the corresponding number of occurances
of the word. <a href=scindex.gif>see SIMPCI Sample Record</a>
<p><li>Step 3. By highlighting the required term(s), and clicking on the Search button, the Set History window will then be displayed indicating the number of hits returned for the particular search.

<p><li>Step 4. By double clicking on the result line within the Set History window,
the first relevant record for that particular search will be displayed. <a
href=ccpmdbg1.gif>see SIMPCI Sample Record</a> 

<h4>Searching via the Table of Contents (TOC)</h4>

<p>SIM generates an automatic table of contents when full text manuals such as
CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual are searched. This allows an alternate method
of navigating through the database. The Table of Contents is made up of
hypertext links, which enable the user to move from the current section of the
manual to another, just by clicking on the associated Section or Sub Section
Heading, rather than searching for a particular term within the database. The
TOC is displayed after an initial keyword search result is displayed. 

<p>In the above example, the first record containing the word "logo" occurred in
Section 5. Intellectual property management, sub-section Trademarks and business
reputation.

<p>Clicking on one of the other sub-section headings in the TOC will immediately
display the corresponding record.  Clicking on a Section heading will retrieve
the table-of-contents record for that section and display all the sub-section
headings for that Section in the TOC. 

<p>The SIM World Wide Web Gateway search interface simulates the SIMPCI interface. The main difference
   is that the TOC is displayed above the record on the WWW, compared to the separate left-side window on the PCI.

<p>See the <a href=ccpmdbg2.htm>SIMWWW Sample Record</a> for the display of
CCPM records in the SIM World Wide Web Gateway.

<p> 
<h3>Basic Index</h3> 
The Basic Index contains all the words from titles, abstracts and major  
and minor descriptor fields. The Basic Index is the default index for  
searching when no index is specified.<p> 
When searching, you may search specific components of the Basic Index.<p>  
It does not matter if you use upper or lower case in searching.  Examples are shown 
below in lower case.<p> 
<p> 
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3> 
The "w" at the start of the  prefix is a convention used to indicate that 
each <i> word </i> in the search element is searchable. 
<pre><b>Search element  Field content     Example</b> 
                                        (This is the search syntax shown 
                                           in the Set History window. SIM 
                                           supplies the parentheses.)<br> 
wAbstract       Abstract          <b>find wabstract=(water %2 pollution) </b> 
                                  Find <i>water</i> within 2 words of 
                                  <i>pollution</i> in the abstract

The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above. 
 Use the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW)  
to select a search element. These elements may not be scanned individually  
with the SCAN command (or toolbar button 6), though the Basic index as a  
whole may be scanned. 
<p> 
At present, abstracts (wAbstract search element) are included only for saleable 
publications.  
There are no abstracts for journal articles, book chapters, etc.  Searches 
 can be of "words in abstracts" by searching the wAbstract component of the Basic 
index.

<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3> 
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI in the CCL Query form; 
 or by using SIMPCI Toolbar Button 6 or Function Key F6; or SIMWWW A-Z  
icon, and selecting from the list of terms. 
All secondary indexes in CSIX are indexed by SIM with the "whole phrase" method. 
 That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. If you are  
using the CCL Query Form and do not enter the entire value of a field make  
sure you use the truncation symbol (?) at the appropriate end of your search  
text.  It does not matter if you use upper or lowercase in searching.  Examples are 
shown below in lower case.

<h3>Searching Tips</h3> 
<h4>AUTHOR SEARCHES </h4> 
Authors may be searched in two indexes in CSIX: <b>Author </b> and <b> 
AuthorCorp</b>.<p> 
<b>Author</b> - All types of authors are included in this index, ie. CSIRO/external 
and personal/corporate authors.  Assume all authors displayed are CSIRO staff (at time of publication) 
 unless they are specifically designated as 'EXT' (External) in the index, 
eg, <i> Heatwole H (EXT) </i> 
<p> 
<b>AuthorCorp</b> - This index includes entries for CSIRO Corporate Authors  - 
authors of publications in which authorship  is assigned to a CSIRO corporate name, 
rather than to a personal name, eg. 'CSIRO Information Services'.  Corporate or 
Division names are not inverted in this index. 
<p> 
<h4> AUTHOR LOCATIONS </h4> 
Author locations are indicated by an index of place names - the <b> Location </b> 
index, and an index of States - the <b> State </b> index.<p> 
<b>Location</b> - This index includes place names, eg. Parkville, VICTORIA. In this index  
names of States are abbreviated. 
<p> 
<b>State</b> - This index indicates the locations of authors, and includes the States 
of Australia (not abbreviated), and  
'overseas' to indicate non-Australian locations.  This field is relevant only to 
CSIRO authors (personal or corporate authors), not external authors.  Note: Although 
states are not abbreviated in this index, their names 
 are displayed in abbreviated form in the SIMPCI Text Viewer window. 
<p> 
<h4> SEARCHING FOR PUBLICATIONS BY CSIRO DIVISION </h4> 
Two indexes are provided for retrieving CSIRO publications by Division:  <b>  
Division </b> and <b> DivisionOrig </b><p> 
<b>Division</b> - This index contains names of CSIRO Divisions with the names 
inverted, eg, <i> Animal Health, Division of </i> 
<p> 
Only the current name of a Division appears in this index, but all former  
versions of that Division's name will be retrieved by a search on the latest  
name. For example, if you scan the <b> Division </b> index and select <i> Chemicals 
 and Polymers, Division of </i> documents published under all  
previous names of the Division (eg. Division of Applied Chemistry; Division 
 of Applied Organic Chemistry) will also be retrieved. The Division name  
under which the document was actually published will be displayed in the  
citation in the Text Viewer window. 
<p> 
When Division names are selected from this index, records containing 
 personal authors from that Division (and all former Divisions) are retrieved. 
<p> 
For documents by staff of a particular Division (under the name that  
Division had at a particular time), select from the <b> DivisionOrig </b> index.  
For documents corporately authored by a Division, select from the  
<b>  AuthorCorp </b> index. 
<p> 
It is recommended that you search this index using the Scan Index  
technique. If you use the CCL Query Form you should enclose your search  
text in quotes (") and truncate if you don't enter the full name. 
<p> 
<b>DivisionOrig</b> - This index contains the original names of all CSIRO Divisions, 
with the name inverted,  
eg "Building Research, Division of". Select from this index to retrieve the  
names of Divisions under which documents were actually published. 
<p> 
It is recommended that you search this index using the Scan Index technique.  
If you use the CCL Query Form you should enclose your search text in quotes (") 
 and truncate if you don't enter the full name. 
<p> 
<h4> SUBJECT SEARCHING </h4> 
Words from the titles, abstracts and subject descriptors form the Basic Index in 
CSIX, so the easiest way to search for a topic is to enter the terms of interest in 
the Query form.<p> 
For searching on subject index terms, two fields are available: <b> Descriptor </b> 
and <b> ClassCodes</b>.<p> 
<b>Descriptor</b> - Two levels of descriptors are assigned: Major terms and Minor 
Terms.  Records entered prior to 1989 contain Major Terms only. Records entered  
from 1989 onwards contain both Major Terms and Minor Terms. By searching 
 the <b> Descriptor </b> index both types of descriptors may be retrieved. It is 
 possible to limit a search to Major Terms by searching on the <b> wMajorTerm </b>  
component of the Basic index. Similarly, Minor Terms can be searched in  
the <b> wMinorTerm </b>component of the Basic index.<p> 
Some recent records (especially externally-published works) may not  
yet contain Descriptors.  Citations are added promptly to CSIX; indexing terms 
(descriptors) are added somewhat later. 
<p> 
<b>Classification Codes</b> - The  <a href="/cim/csix/csixdbg.app.htm"> 
classification codes</a> (<b> ClassCodes </b> index) are broad subject categories which appear in all 
records from 1978 onwards.   Documents may have more than one classification code. 
Search this index if you are interested in items on a broad general topic. 
<p> 
<h4>TITLE SEARCHING </h4> 
Title words may be searched in the Basic Index, or in its <b> wTitle </b> component. 
<p> 
A specific <b> Title </b> index provides a list of all titles in the database.  The 
<b> Title </b>index enables whole titles (of articles, monographs, etc.) to be 
scanned and searched. Leading articles (A, An, The) have been excluded. Titles 
starting 
 with symbols or numerals appear at the top of the list.<p> 
<h4>DOCUMENT TYPE</h4> 
The DocumentType field appears in all records from 1984 onwards (it does  
not appear in most earlier records). Only one Document Type is given per record: 
<pre> 
<b>Type                   Explanation</b><br> 
<b>Book/book chapter</b>      [includes monographs (single or multivolume) and  
                            extracts from monographs] 
<b>Conference proceedings</b> [includes workshops and seminars; poster abstracts] 
<b>Electronic media</b>       [includes CD-ROMS] 
<b>General scientific</b>     [includes "popular" magazines] 
<b>Information sheet</b>      [includes posters] 
<b>Journal article</b>        [includes an article appearing in a monographic series] 
<b>Miscellaneous</b> 
<b>Newsletter</b> 
<b>Patent</b>                 [used 1969-1977 only] 
<b>Technical report</b> 
<b>Unpublished</b> 
</pre> 
<h4> ISBNs and ISSNs </h4> 
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) are indexed in the <b> ISBN </b> index.  
The numbers have been entered in the form 0306445336 (with no hyphens and no spaces 
between the numbers). 
<p> 
International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs) are indexed in the <b> ISSN </b> index.  
ISSNs have been entered in the form 1030-1887 (hyphens separate the two groups of 
four numbers). 
<p> 
<h4> LIBRARY CALL NUMBER </h4> 
The <b> CallNo </b> (Call Number) index contains a number (usually a Dewey decimal 
number) indicating the shelf  
location of monographs within the CSIRO Index collection at Clayton 
 (VS:CL Index). A small proportion of documents in the database are not  
held in the CSIRO Index collection. In such cases, the CSIRO Library code 
 is displayed, of one location where the document is held (eg. WS:RL).  Only one 
 call number/library holdings code is displayed, though items may actually be 
 held in several locations. More locations may be available in the CSIRO Library System. 
<p> 
<h4>PRICE INFORMATION</h4> 
Price Information is indexed in the <b>  PriceInfo </b> index.  This field was added 
in 1994: it applies only to CSIRO-published works (and externally-published works 
which are sold through the CSIRO Bookshop).  Most records do not contain this data.  
This field so far includes the following variants (only one per record): 
<pre><b>Chapter in Divisional publication 
Chapter in saleable publication 
From Division/Institute only 
Out of print 
Saleable (from CSIRO Bookshop)</b></pre> 
<a name=VPS> </a><hr> 
<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RESULTS</h2> 
<h3>Fieldsets</h3> 
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or  
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets 
 may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save 
 or print. 
<pre><b>Fieldset         Contains</b> 
   B (Brief)	DocumentNo, Author, AuthorCorp, Title, Source, PublYear 
   c (Citation)	Title, Source, PublYear  
   F (Full)	All fields 
   S (Summary)	Title 
</pre> 
<p> 
<h3>Formats</h3> 
<h4>Text-only (ASCII) format</h4>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the 
above lists, and the "Text only" format. The records will be saved to disk 
in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc. 
After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>Courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<p>
<h4>Pro-Cite format</h4>
For saving records in Pro-Cite format, choose an appropriate fieldset, and the "Pro-Cite Bib" format.
The saved file is an ASCII file that may be loaded into a Pro-Cite database.

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<h3>Sample records</h3>
<br><a href=ccreci.htm>Item record</a>
<br><a href=ccrect.htm>Table-of-Contents record</a><p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index of the CC database comprises words from the titles, 
abstracts, author keywords and ISI keywords of individual item records.  
<p>
The Basic index is the default index for searching when no index is 
specified in the search. Case is not specific in searching - it does not matter whether you use upper or lower case in entering your search terms. Further details on searching the Basic index are given in the <a href=#TIPS> Searching Tips </a>section.<p>
<p>
<h4>Components of the Basic index</h4>
Components of the Basic Index may be searched in the CCL Query Form 
(toolbar button 3). 
The "w" prefix to the fieldname (search element) is a convention used to indicate that each word is searchable.
<pre><b>
Search element   Field content     Examples</b> (This is the search syntax shown
                                    in the Set History window)

wTitle	         Title of article    <b>find wtitle=(bird species)</b>
                                     wTitle contains the phrase <i>bird species</i>

wAbstract        Abstract of article <b>find wabstract=(feeding same birds)</b>
		                     the word <i>feeding</i> is in the same sentence
                                     as <i>birds</i> in the abstract

wDescriptor      Author keywords     <b>find wdescriptor=(bird diets)</b>
                                     "bird diets" is either an author-keyword 
                                      or an ISI-keyword
</pre>
The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown 
above. Use the drop-down list in the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search 
screen (SIMWWW) to select the Basic Index, or one of its components (which are prefixed by a 'w').  These components may not be scanned individually with the SCAN command (or 
the A-Z icon), though the Basic index as a whole may be scanned.<p>
<a name=SEC> </a>
<h3>Secondary indexes</h3>
The secondary indexes may be searched from the CCL Query Form (toolbar
 button 3) or from the Scan Index Terms window (toolbar button 6, or 
function key 6), then selecting from the drop-down list.
<p>
In the SIMWWW gateway, use the A-Z icon or the Simple Search screen.
<p>
All secondary indexes in CC are indexed with the "whole phrase" method. 
That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. Although 
information may be retrieved from the secondary indexes by 
using the CCL Query Form, the recommended search technique is to use 
the Scan Index Terms window and select from the list of entries in the index. <p>
If you do use the CCL Query Form to search the secondary 
indexes, <b> make sure </b> you use the truncation symbol (?) at the start or end of your search string unless you have entered all the text to be found in the field. For example, the journal index contains not only the journal title but also the issue de
tails (eg, 'journal of neuroscience methods 1994 v 53 n 2 aug')<br>
The secondary indexes with a "toc" prefix provide direct access to TOC 
records. All other secondary indexes are for elements of individual item 
records. Further details on searching the Secondary indexes for data elements such as author name, journal title, etc are given in the <a href=#TIPS> Searching Tips </a>section.<p>

<h3>Searching for Words (Searching the Basic Index)</h3>
Source journals for CC are published in Australia, North America and Europe.
 Variants in spellings (such as labour/labor, organisation/organization) do
 occur in the database. When searching, use OR to retrieve variants,
eg, labor OR labour. You can also use the masking characters "?" (which
matches zero or more characters) or "#" (exactly one character).
<pre>eg,	<b>labo?r</b>          retrieves <i>labor, labour</i>
	<b>organi#e</b>        retrieves <i>organise, organize</i>
</pre>
The "?" is also a truncation symbol - use it when searching for plurals or other words with the same stem:
<pre>eg,	<b> electron? </b>        retrieves <i> electron, electronic, electronics, electrons </i> 
</pre>
<p>
<a name=AUTN></a>
<h3>Searching for Author Names (Searching the Author Index)</h3>
In the CCL Query Form select the Author index.   
Type the author name and initials in the query box:   
<PRE>	day mf</PRE>     
then click the FIND button.  Results will appear in the Set History window.  <p> 
If you are unsure of the initials, truncate your search with the '?'
<PRE>	day m? </PRE>
and you will retrieve all authors with a first initial 'M' (Day M, Day MB, Day MF, and so on).   
<p>
In author names in Current Contents (CC), hyphens, apostrophes and spaces are 'stripped out' by ISI (the publisher of CC) before CSIRO receives the data, so these characters do not appear in author names in the CC database in SIM.  
Do not include hyphens, apostrophes or spaces in your author search, eg in CC search for:<br> 
<pre>	staveleysmith l     NOT    staveley-smith l
	tyndalebiscoe ch    NOT    tyndale-biscoe ch
	vandermeulen cj     NOT    van der meulen cj
	vangerwen ac        NOT    van gerwen ac
	obrien cj           NOT    o'brien cj 
</pre><p>
When searching for particular authors a good technique is to use the Scan Index function (A-Z icon), and 
select from the list of index entries.<p> 
<p>
<a name=JOTI></a>
<h3>Searching for Journal Titles</h3>
<h4>A particular journal title </h4>
To find any issue of a particular journal title, eg <i>Journal of Applied Polymer   
Science</i><br>   
In the CCL Query Form select the Journal index.    
Type in the query box:   
 <PRE> journal of applied polymer science?</PRE>  
then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the truncation symbol (?).  Because this index includes the entire value of the field (including issue details as well as journal title), you must truncate your search in order to retrieve something.
A search on the <b> journal </b> index will retrieve individual item records.  If you wish to retrieve Table of Contents (TOC) records, select the 
<b> tocjournal </b> index instead of the <b> journal </b> index.<p> 
<h4>A particular issue of a journal title </h4>
To find a particular issue of a journal title, eg <i>Journal of Applied Polymer   
Science</i>, volume 54, number 1, October 3rd, 1994<P>   
In the CCL Query Form select the Journal index.     
Type in the query box:   
<PRE>	journal of applied polymer science 1994 v 54 n 1 Oct 3</PRE>   
then click the FIND button. 
A search on the <b> journal </b> index will retrieve individual item records.  If you wish to retrieve Table of Contents (TOC) records, select the 
<b> tocjournal </b> index instead of the <b> journal </b> index.<p> 
[Note: if you wish to locate a particular journal issue, it is    
easier to use the A-Z Toolbar button (no 6 in SIMPCI ) to open the Scan Index terms window,   
select the Journal index, scan for the journal name or part of it, then   
highlight the issue you want and search for it (double click the   
highlighted item(s) or click the Search button).  Scanning an   
index allows you to see exactly what data elements are there, and the    
order in which they are presented.]<P>
<h4> Journal Titles containing 'and' </h4>
To find a journal title containing the word <b> and </b>, eg <i>Accident Analysis and   
Prevention</i><P>   
In the CCL Query Form select the Journal index.  Type in the   
query box:   
<pre>	"accident analysis and prevention"?</pre>   
then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the quotation symbols (").  You must use these to retrieve the word 
<b> and </b> in order to distinguish it from the Boolean operator <b> and. </b><p>   
Alternatively, use the Scan Index function (A-Z icon) to scan the index and select the item you want.<p>    
<h4> Journal Titles containing an ampersand (&amp) </h4>
Ampersands (&amp) are not currently stored in the Journal index to CC.  If the title you wish to retrieve   
contains an ampersand, please ignore that character and scan or search for the title as if the ampersand is not   
present.<p>   
For example, search for the title <i>Computers &amp Geosciences</i> by typing:   
<pre>	computers geosciences</pre>   
in the CCL Query form or by scanning for this in the Scan Index form.<p>   
We hope to correct the omission of ampersands in CC indexes in a future re-load of CC.     
If you are uncertain whether the AND in a journal title is represented by an ampersand or the word AND, use   
the Scan Index function to check both versions in the index.<p>   
<a name=SEAD></a>
<h3>Searchable Data</h3>
The Basic index and all the secondary indexes except those with the "toc" prefix 
provide direct access to the CC individual item records.
  This means that individual items may be retrieved by:
<ul>
<li>words from title, abstract and keywords;
<li>author name and initials;
<li>author's affiliation (address);
<li>document type;
<li>language of publication of the article;
<li>number of references cited in the article;
<li>journal title;
<li>ISSN;
<li>publication year;
<li>keywords (author-assigned and ISI-assigned [also known as KeyWords 
Plus&#174;]), when available in the record;
<li>page number of start of citation;
<li>CC edition (eg, AGRI, BEHA, CLIN, LIFE, PHYS, TECH);
<li>CC issue number
<li>CC broad subject category; 
<li>The Genuine Article&#174; (TGA) number;
<li>date loaded in to SIM.
</ul>
In general, when searching a secondary index using the CCL Query Form 
it is not necessary to use double quotes (") around the query terms, 
unless your search term contains commas, parentheses or special words such as 'and'. 
If in doubt, put quotes around your text. Use the truncation symbol (?) if 
you are not entering the entire value of the field in your query. 
Note that the truncation symbol should be placed outside any 
quotes, eg  "agri"?
<p>
The recommended technique for searching secondary indexes is to scan 
the index, then pick from the list.<p>
<a name=TOCR></a>
<h3>Table of Contents (TOC) Records</h3>
Table of contents (TOC) records may be directly searched using the four 
indexes whose names are prefixed by "toc" (see the list of Secondary indexes).
<p>
<a name=TOCS></a>
<h4>Browsing TOC Records by Subject</h4>
To browse TOC records by subject, use the tocCCedition index 
in which the edition type (<b>AGRI, BEHA, CLIN, LIFE, PHYS, 
TECH</b>) is given together with volume and issue details.  Use the Scan Index 
feature to select a specific edition and issue, or several issues.  Alternatively, search 
the tocCCedition index (remember to truncate your search, eg. <b>tech?</b>) 
in the CCL Query Form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW).
<br>
Alternatively, browse TOC records via the subject categories.  Use the 
tocCategory index, which indexes the broad CC subject categories associated 
with each CC edition.  A list of these categories, for each CC subset, is 
given in the Appendices. Note that in SIM, however, these categories will be 
displayed in alphabetical order when the tocCategory index is scanned.
<p>
<a name=TOCJ></a>
<h4>Browsing TOC Records by Journal Title</h4>
Use the tocJournal index to select issues of a particular journal whose 
contents pages you wish to scan.  
<br>
Alternatively, search for contents pages of a particular journal, by 
choosing the tocJournal index in the CCL Query Form, and enter the name of 
the journal in the query text box. Remember to use truncation if you don't
wish to search for particular volume and issue details, eg "journal of 
neuroscience methods"?
<p>
<a name=TOCT></a>
<h4>Retrieving TOC records by TGA number</h4>
TOC records may also be retrieved by searching for The Genuine Article&#174; 
number in the tocGenArtNo index.<p>

<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RECORDS</h2>
<h3>Fieldsets</h3>
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or 
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets 
may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save or 
print.
<pre>
<b>Fieldset                  Shows</b>
    A (Abstract)	DocNo, wTitle, Author, Journal, PageNumber, wAbstract, wDescriptor, tocPage
    B (Brief)		DocNo, wTitle, Author, Journal, PageNumber, wDescriptor, tocPage
    C (Citation)	DocNo, wTitle, Author, Journal, PageNumber, tocPage
    F (Full)		All fields
    S (Summary)		DocNo, wTitle, tocPage
</pre>
If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full).
<p>
<h3>Saving Records to Disk</h3>
<b>Text-only (ASCII) format</b><br>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the 
above lists, and the "Text only" format. The records will be saved to disk 
in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc. 
After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<p>
<b>Pro-Cite formats</b><br>
For saving records in Pro-Cite format the following options are available:
<pre>
<b>ProCite-Bib  CC</b>       Pro-Cite RecordType (ie, C), Author, Title, 
                      Journal title, Date, vol no, issue no, page numbers.
   
<b>ProCite-Medium  CC</b>    Pro-Cite RecordType (ie, C) containing: Author, 
                      Reprint author, Title, Journal title, Date, Vol no,
                      Issue no, Page numbers, ISSN, Language, Document 
                      type, Genuine Article Number, Descriptors (Keywords).
   
<b>ProCite-Full  CC   </b>   Pro-Cite RecordType (ie, C), Author, Reprint author,
                      Title, Journal title, Date, vol no, issue no, 
                      page numbers, ISSN, Language, Document type, 
                      Abstract, Genuine Article Number, Descriptors (Keywords).
</pre>
Please note that the ProCite formats are intended for use with CC individual item records, not TOC records.<p>
Each record output from the SIM CC database includes a copyright attribution statement. This attribution 
is required by ISI, the publisher of CC, to be given in all CC outputs.  If you have generated a Pro-Cite format file from CC and then load the file into a word processor, you will observe that the copyright attribution statement appears 
among other fields in the "medium" or "complete" Pro-Cite formats, not at 
the end as it does in the "bib" format. 
For Pro-Cite output from SIM the attribution has been placed in the highest available 
unused Pro-Cite field for CC records, hence its appearance before data (such as the 
abstract) which has a higher field number in Pro-Cite.<p>
<b>Reference Manager format</b><br>
Reference Manager format is a tagged format which conforms with 
Reference Manager "RIS format specifications" for journal references. 
To save records in Reference Manager format use the following format:  
Ref-Manager  CC
<p>
Please note that the Reference Manager format is intended for use with CC individual item records, not TOC records.<p>

<H3>Coverage</H3>

The DHS database is a standard list of designated hazardous substances. There are 1,959 entries with some substances duplicated under variant names. The access and use of the DHS database is restricted to CSIRO staff only. 

<P>The DHS database acts as a "front end" to the CSIRO Materials Safety Datasheets database (MSDS). Most of the DHS records have hypertext links to the corresponding MDSD records. Those substances without a hypertext link to MSDS are in the process of hav

ing the corresponding MSDS sheet prepared.

<P>Note that you do not have to select the MSDS as well as the DHS from the list to use the link between them. Clicking on the hypertext link in DHS will activate the MSDS database for you.

<H3>Basic Index</H3>

The Basic Index of the DHS database consists of two fields, risk phrases and safety phrases.
The Basic Index is the default index when no other index is specified in the search. Case does not need to be specified in searching - it does not matter whether you use upper or lower case in entering your search terms. This index can be used 
to search for specific risk or safety phrases.
<P>
<p>Alternately, each component of the Basic Index can be searched separately.

<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>

<p>The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above. Use
the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW) to select a
search element. These elements may not be scanned individually with the SCAN
command (A-Z icon), though the Basic index as a whole may be scanned. 

<A NAME="secindex"></A>
<H3>Secondary Indexes</H3>

The difference between using the secondary indexes and the basic index is that in the basic index the individual words of chemical names, or separate numerical fragments of the CAS number are separately indexed, whereas in the secondary index the whole value of the name or number is indexed.<BR>

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<a href=msdsrec.htm><b>Sample record</b></a>
<p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index contains all the free text words used in the descriptive
 fields, ie this is a "word" index.  The Basic Index is the default index 
for searching when no index is specified.  It is not suitable for 
searching on chemical names (for this purpose, use the secondary index "Names" 
outlined below).
<p>
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>
The following fields of the record are included in the Basic Index:
<dl>
<dt>Dangerous goods field
<dt>Uses field
<dt>Product characteristics fields:
<dd>- Appearance, Solubility, Other properties, Ingredients in mixture.
<dt>Health hazard data fields: - all information.
<dt>First aid information fields: - all information.
<dt>Precautions for use fields: - all information.
<dt>Safe handling information fields: - all information.
</dl>
All these fields are indexed by SIM using the "word" indexing method, and 
this is indicated by the leading "w" in the names (search prefixes) of 
these indexes.
<pre><b>
Search prefix	Field content</b>
<b>wAdviceToDr</b>     First Aid information:  Advice to doctor
<b>wAppearance</b>     Product characteristics:  Appearance
<b>wChronicEffect</b>  Health hazard data:  Chronic health effects
<b>wEffectEye</b>      Health hazard data:  Effect on eyes
<b>wEffectInhale</b>   Health hazard data:  Effect of inhaling
<b>wEffectSkin</b>     Health hazard data:  Effect on skin
<b>wEffectSwallow</b>  Health hazard data:  Effect of swallowing
<b>wEnginControl</b>   Precautions for use:  Engineering controls
<b>wExposureStd</b>    Precautions for use:  Exposure standards
<b>wFAidEye</b>        First Aid information:  For eye contact
<b>wFAidInhale</b>     First Aid information:  For inhalation
<b>wFAidSkin</b>       First Aid information:  For skin contact
<b>wFAidSwallow</b>    First Aid information:  If swallowed
<b>wFireExplosion</b>  Safe handling information:  Fire/explosion hazard
<b>wFlammability</b>   Precautions for use:  Flammability
<b>wIngredientMix</b>  Product characteristics:  Ingredients in mixture
<b>wOtherInfo</b>      Safe handling information:  Other information
<b>wOtherProperty</b>  Product characteristics:  Other properties
<b>wProtection</b>     Precautions for use:  Personal protection
<b>wSolubility</b>     Product characteristics:  Solubility in water
<b>wSpillDisposal</b>  Safe handling information:  Spills and disposals
<b>wStoreTransport</b> Safe handling information:  Storage and transport
<b>wUses</b>           Uses
</pre>
Search prefixes may be used to specify components of the Basic Index.
<p>
For searching using SIMPCI, choose one of the fields from the drop down list
 in the CCL Query 
Form (Button 3).
<p>
These are examples showing the search syntax which appears in the Set History 
window when one of the components of the basic Index is searched.
<pre>
<b>find wchroniceffect=(liver damage)
find wstoretransport=(impact)
find wfireexplosion=(toxic fumes)
</b></pre>
The components of the Basic Index may be searched separately as the 
examples above show. 
However, they may not be scanned individually with the Scan function. The 
Basic index as a whole may be scanned, and a selection made from the list.
<a name=SEC> </a>
<p>
<h3b>Secondary Indexes</h3>
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI by using the FIND icon 
(Button 3), and selecting the appropriate field from the dropdown list in 
the CCL Query Form, or by using the SCAN icon (Button 6) and selecting 
terms from the appropriate indexes.
<p>
In SIMWWW use the Find button and the dropdown list in the Simple Search screen;
 or use the A-Z icon to open the Scan Indexes form.
<p>
All secondary indexes in MSDS are indexed by SIM with the "whole phrase" method.
  That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. Although 
information may be retrieved from the secondary indexes by using the CCL 
Query Form, the recommended search technique in SIMPCI is to scan the index
 and select from the resulting list. If you do use the CCL Query Form to search 
these indexes, make sure you truncate your search text with the "?" symbol if
 you do not enter an entire value for the field.
<p>
<pre><b>
Index        Field content     Examples</b>
CASnumber    CAS numbers       <b>118-96-7</b>
Date         Date of creation  <b>930309</b>
HAZCHEMcode  HAZCHEM code      <b>2we</b>
Name         Chemical name     <b>2,4,6-trinitrotoluene</b>
             Trade names       <b>entsufon</b>
             Other names       <b>tnt</b>
UNnumber     UN number         <b>1356</b>
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Notes on Secondary Indexes</h3>
<b>CAS number</b><br>
CAS number should only be searched on the full number; truncation gives 
unpredictable results.
<p>
<b>Date</b><br>
Searching can only be done on the full date. Use the relational operations 
in the CCL Query Form to search partial dates. Truncation does not work. 
eg. select the Date Index; click the = button. Click on the numeric operator. 
The search will look like this: <b>f date>=930000</b>.
<p>
<b>Name</b><br>
It was decided to make the Name Index a secondary index so that names 
could be scanned ie. names are not included in the Basic Index. The 
latter is a word index which would have broken complex chemical names into 
unsearchable fragments. Unfortunately, this means that simple 
chemical names (eg. "ammonium fluoride"), do not appear in the basic index. 
The Name index includes chemical, product and trade names and can be 
scanned and searched. If the name includes punctuation such as commas or
 parentheses, you should enclose your search text with double quotes 
(") if you are searching in the CCL Query Form.
<p>
<b>UN number</b><br>
UN numbers cannot be reliably searched or scanned.  This is due to a parsing 
problem which we hope will be fixed in the future.  The difficulty is that 
some of the numbers have a qualifier in brackets after them, causing them 
to be filed in a different sequence in the scan index.  Searching on the 
full number is successful, but truncation only works if the number has a
 qualifier.
<a name=TIPS> </a>
<p>
<h3>Searching Tips</h3>
<b>Names</b><br>
Finding chemical, trade and product names can be done most easily using 
the Scan Index facility (PCI toolbar button 6); A-Z icon in SIMWWW.
<p>
<b>Fields not indexed</b><br>
These fields are not indexed because of inconsistency in the data:
<dl>
<dt><dd>Boiling point
<dt><dd>Melting point
<dt><dd>Vapour pressure
<dt><dd>Specific gravity
<dt><dd>Flammability limits
<dt><dd>Flash point
<dt><dd>Auto-ignition temperature
</dl>

use one of the system defaults. These defaults are the same as the Output 
formats listed above. Use the Toolbar Display Fields Icon in SIMPCI and 
the SHOW or SUMMARISE commands in SIMCLI.
<p>
<h3>Saving records to disk</h3>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the above list,
 and the "Text-only" format. The records will be saved to disk in ASCII format
and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc.

<B>Individual Item Records</B><BR>
<P>All the secondary indexes, and the Basic index provide direct access to the content of the RMA manual (i.e. section and sub section documents). This means that individual items may be retrieved by:

<UL><p>

<A NAME=STIPTOC><B>Navigating using Table of Contents</B></A><p>
<P>SIM generates an automatic Table of Contents when full-text manuals such as RMA are searched. This allows two avenues for navigating within the Text Viewer, where previously there was only one. 
<P><B><I>SIMPCI</B></I><BR>
You can navigate through the 'Sections' of the RMA manual from the automatically generated Table of Contents record which appears on the left  of the Text Viewer screen. Only a portion of the Table of Contents record appears in what is called a 'fish eye'

 view. Each section and sub section is a 
hypertext link. Double click on the link and the Text Viewer will show the relevant section. 
<P>Alternatively, you may navigate through a set of records by using the forward and backward arrows situated at the top right corner of the toolbar. 
<P><B><I>SIMWWW</B></I><BR>
You can navigate through the 'Sections' of the RMA manual from the automatically generated Table of Contents section which appears at the top of the View Record screen. Only a portion of the Table of Contents appears in what is called a 'fish eye' view. Y

ou can click on any of the hypertext-linked section or subsection to move to another record. The record will appear after the Table of Contents; you may need to scroll down the screen to view this.

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<h3>Sample record</h3>
<img src=scanrec.gif>
<a name=BI> </a>
<p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index of the SCAN database comprises words from the title and
abstract of each record.  The Basic Index is the default index for searching when no index is
specified in the search. eg.
<pre><b>find commercialisation</b>      (searches for the word <i>commercialisation</i>
			     in the Basic Index)
<b>find intellectual property</b>  (searches for the phrase <i>intellectual property</i>
                             in the Basic Index)</pre>
When searching you can specify components of the Basic Index.
<p>
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>
The `w' at the start of the prefix is a convention used to indicate that each <i>word</i> in
the search element is searchable.
<pre><b>Search Element   Field content         Examples</b> (This is the search syntax
					shown in the Set History window)

wTitle          Title of article       <b>find wtitle=intellectual property</b>
wAbstract       Abstract of article    <b>find wabstract=collaborative research</b></pre>
The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above.
Use the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW)
to select a search element. These elements may not be scanned individually
with the SCAN command (A-Z icon), though the Basic index as a
whole may be scanned.
<p>
<a name=SEC> </a>
<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI by using toolbar button 6, 
(or function key 6) to open the Scan Index Terms window, choosing an index, then selecting from the list of terms.
Alternatively they may be selected and searched in the CCL Query Form (SIMPCI).
<p>
In the SIMWWW gateway, use the A-Z icon or the Simple Search screen.
<p>
All secondary indexes in SCAN are indexed with the 'whole phrase' method. 
That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. Information
may be retrieved from the secondary indexes as shown in the examples below. 
It is necessary to use the truncation symbol (?) if the search term you 
enter does not include the entire value of the field. However, the 
recommended search technique is to scan the index and select from the 
resulting list.
<pre><b>Search Prefix   Field content               Examples</b>        
  
Author          Author names and initials   <b>mitchell gr</b>
CreationTime    System-assigned time of     <b>79644000</b> 
                  database record creation
DocNumber       Unique record number        <b>950201</b>
Issue           Issue number                <b>649</b>
Journal         Journal name                <b>new scientist</b>
PublYear        Year published              <b>1995</b>
</pre>
<a name=TIPS> </a>
<h3>Searching tips</h3>
There is an abstract included in every record. 
<p>
There are no subject indexing terms in SCAN so for subject searching
 use the Basic index. 
<p>
Source journals for SCAN are published in Australia, North America and Europe.
 Variants in spellings (such as labour/labor, organisation/organization) do
 occur in the Basic index. When searching, use OR to retrieve variants, 
eg. labor OR labour. You can also use the masking characters "?" (which 
matches zero or more characters) or "#" (exactly one character).
<pre>eg.	<b>labo?r</b>          retrieves <i>labor, labour</i>
	<b>organi#e</b>        retrieves <i>organise, organize</i>
</pre>
The "?" is also a truncation symbol - use it when searching for plurals or other words with the same stem:
<pre>eg,	<b> commerc? </b>        retrieves <i> commerce, commercial, commercialisation </i> 
</pre>
<p>
Note that authors' initials are blocked together with no space between them.
<pre>eg.  <b>abbott ge</b></pre>
All initial articles (A, An, The) are removed from the start of the 
journal names except for those in a few titles such as <i> The Bulletin </i>, <i> The Times</i>, 
etc. In order to search these few journal names properly the 'The'
 must be included in your search.
<pre>eg.  <b>the bulletin</b></pre>
Alternatively, use the Scan Index Terms operation and pick from the list. The
few titles retaining an initial 'The' will file under T.
<p><hr>
<a name=VPS> </a>
<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RESULTS</h2>
<h3>Fieldsets</h3>
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or 
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets 
may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save or 
print.
<pre><b>Fieldset         Contains</b>
   B (Brief)     wTitle
   F (Full)      All fields
   S (Summary)   DocNumber, wTitle, Author, Source, PublYear
</pre>
<h3>Saving records to disk</h3>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the 
above lists, and the 'Text-only' format. The records will be saved to disk
 in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or 
emailed, etc.  After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<p>
<h3>Document supply</h3>
SCAN users who have identified relevant citations in SIM should first contact their Divisional Librarian for supply of the original documents.  Please quote the SCAN Document number, eg. <b>930245</b> in your request.<p>
If the item is not held in your library your Divisional Librarian will arrange an inter-library loan for you from the Corporate Library &amp; Information Service. 
<p>
(<b>Note</b>: All requests must comply with the Copyright Act 1968 as amended.)

<A NAME="NAME"><H3>Database name</H3></A>

Stocktake - Sector Stocktake of Research 

<A NAME="COVER"><H3>Coverage</H3></A>

<P>The CSIRO Sector Stocktake of Research database is a collection of all Sector Stocktake 
documents produced by each sector within CSIRO. The purpose of the database is to make 
available information describing the activities of each CSIRO sector. Access to this database is 
restricted to Sector Co-ordinators and other identified users.

<P>Each Stocktake of Research is broken down into a number of  ‘sector chunks’. A ‘sector 
chunk’ specifically describes the corresponding activities according to fourteen topic headings 
identified in the Sector Stocktake Proforma.

<P>Incorporated into each Stocktake of Research, is a four part Sector Outlook Summary, which 
describes the background of the Sector, an outlook specifically for the sector, how CSIRO 
relates to the sector, and also the return to Australia for the effort exerted within the sector.

<A NAME="INFO"><H3>Information Provider</H3></A>

Information for each sector has been supplied by each corresponding Sector Co-ordinator.

<A NAME="SEARCH"><H2>Searching the Database</H2></A>

There are a two primary methods available for searching the Sector Stocktake Database. 
Users may perform a standard “keyword” style search, and also navigate the database via the 
Table of Contents (TOC) window which accompanies all full text databases.

<A NAME="KEYW"><H3>Keyword Search</H3></A>

<B><I>SIMPCI</I></B><BR>
A standard keyword search enables users to search for a specific term across the all 
Stocktakes Sectors of Research within the database. For example, a user may wish to search 
across all sectors to determine which sectors have dealings with BHP:

<P>Step 1. The user would click on the FIND icon <IMG SRC="findpci.gif"> from the SIMPCI toolbar.   This will 
display the CCL Query Form.

<P>Step 2. Insert the query term “bhp” into the CCL Query Form window and press the FIND 
Button. <BR>
<IMG SRC="ccl.gif">
 
<P>Step 3. The Set History window will then be displayed. By double clicking on the set history, 
the first corresponding record will be displayed.<BR>
<IMG SRC="setbhp.gif">

<P>Step 4.  The contents of the database are broken down into two logical parts when displayed:<p>
<UL>
<LI>A Table of Contents (TOC) which highlights the position of the retrieved record within the 
database. <p>
<LI>The actual record that has been retrieved. To view the text within the document, the user 
can scroll down through the document. Each occurrence of the search term - in this case 
“bhp” - will be highlighted.<p>
</UL>
 <IMG SRC="record.gif">

<P><B><I>SIMWWW</I></B><BR>
A standard keyword search enables users to search for a specific term across the all 
Stocktakes Sectors of Research within the database. For example, a user may wish to search 
across all sectors to determine which sectors have dealings with BHP:

<P>Step 1. The user would click on the FIND icon  <IMG SRC="findwww.gif"> from the SIMWWW toolbar.   This will 
display the Simple Search Form.

<P>Step 2. Insert the query term “bhp” into the Simple Search Form window and press the 
PERFORM SEARCH Button. <BR>
<IMG SRC="simsearc.gif">
 
<P>Step 3. The Search Results Set screen will then be displayed. By clicking on the ‘Show’ radio 
button, the first corresponding record will be displayed.<BR>
<IMG SRC="resuwww.gif">

<P>Step 4.  The contents of the database are broken down into two logical parts when displayed:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>A Table of Contents (TOC) which highlights the position of the retrieved record within the 
database. <p>
<LI>The actual record  that has been retrieved. To view the text within the document, the user 
can scroll down through the document. Each occurrence of the search term - in this case 
“bhp” - will be highlighted.<p>
</UL>

<A NAME="NAV"><H3>Navigating via the Table of Contents</H3></A>
Navigating through the Stocktakes of Research for each Sector can be performed using  the 
Table of Contents (TOC). Each entry in the Table of Contents is a hypertext link to the 
corresponding physical record in the database. After the user has completed an initial keyword 
search and a record has been displayed, the Table of Contents can be used to move from one 
record to another. 

<P>There are two types of  links within the Table of Contents:<p>
<ul>
<LI><B><I>Stocktake of Research Headings</I></B><p> 
These headings serve two purposes. Firstly, they link the Stocktake of Research Heading to 
the corresponding Sector Outlook Summary, and secondly, they expand the Table of 
Contents to display the corresponding Sector Chunks for the Stocktake of Research 
Heading.<p>
 <LI><B><I>Sector Chunks</I></B><p>
These link Sector Chunk Headings to the physical record in the database. Sector Chunk 
Headings are identified by an asterix (*).<p>
</ul>

<A NAME="BASIC"><H3>Basic Index</H3></A>

The basic index facilitates the ability to search across all Stocktakes of Research including all 
Sector Chunks and Sector Outlooks. This is the broadest of searches and is best used when 
searching for like terms across the whole database. For example, the basic index would be 
used to search for sectors have dealings with a certain person, or organisation.

<A NAME="SECOND"><H3>Secondary indexes</H3></A>

A number of secondary indexes are used to narrow down the search to specific parts of the 
database. The purpose of this is to reduce the number irrelevant records being retrieved. A 
number of secondary indexes have been created to enable certain parts of the database to be 
searched individually, including Sector Chunks, and Sector Outlooks.

<P><ul>
<li><B><I>Chunk</I></B><p>
The Chunk secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector Chunks 
only. This means that the search will exclude all Sector Outlook documents.

<P><li><B><I>ChunkTitle</I></B><p>
The ChunkTitle secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector 
Chunk Titles only.

<P><li><B><I>Outlook</I></B><p>
The Outlook secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector 
Outlooks only. This means that the search will exclude all Sector Chunks.

<P><li><B><I>OutlookTitle</I></B><p>
The OutlookTitle secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector 
Outlook Titles only.

<P><li><B><I>RNum</I></B><p>
The RNum Secondary index enables searching of the whole database by way of searching for 
specific record numbers. Each record within the database has a unique record number. For 
example, the very first record in the database has a RNum value of “1”.
</ul><p>

<A NAME="TIPS"><H2>Searching Tips</H2></A>

To ensure efficient use of the database, advice on how to use the secondary indexes and 
navigate successfully via the table of contents has been included.

<A NAME="ACCESS"><H3>Accessing the first record</H3></A>
To access the first record of the entire database, select the Rnum secondary index in the CCL 
Query form (or Simple Search query form for SIMWWW). Type in the number “1” in the 
search window and hit FIND (SIMPCI) or PERFORM SEARCH (SIMWWW). This will 
bring up the first record in the database.

<A NAME="COMBINE"><H3>Combining searches</H3></A>
To search within a chunk on a particular term, you will need to perform a search for the term 
in the Basic index. Then change to the Secondary index of your choice and type in the second 
term. Combine the two set results using the AND operator to produce a third set history. 

<A NAME="VPS"><H2>Viewing, Printing and Saving Results</H2></A>

<A NAME="FIELD"><H3>Fieldsets</H3></A>

Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or saved to disk. If no 
fieldset is chosen, the default is F(Full). Fieldsets may be chosen in various
windows depending on whether you wish to save or print. 

<P><TABLE border=4 cellpadding=3>

</TABLE>

<A NAME="SAVE"><H3>Saving Records to Disk</H3></A>

Currently, the ability to save records out of  Sector Stocktake of Research database has not 
yet been completed. Soon, the ability to save records as RTF(Rich Text Format), which is a 
format that is compatible with MSWORD and many other wordprocessing packages will be 
available. This will give the capability to extract information within specific Sector Chunk(s), 
and Sector Outlook(s) and be able to incorporate this information into other documents via a 
number of popular Word Processing Packages.

<A NAME="PRINT"><H3>Printing Records</H3></A>

<P><B><I>SIMPCI</I></B><BR>
Records may be saved (see above) to disk before printing or printed directly from the screen. 
To print the record you are currently viewing use the Print icon <IMG SRC="print.gif">  . To print the whole result 
set, choose the Operations, Print Result Set option in the Set History window. <BR>
<IMG SRC="sethist.gif">
 
<P><B><I>SIMWWW</I></B><BR>
In order to print records from SIMWWW, you will need to capture them to screen or disk.

II.	Interrupt function in SIMPCI<br>
III.	Configuring options in SIMWWW 
		
<p><b>I. Quick browsing in SIMPCI</b> 

<p>After retrieving a set result, you can view the titles by clicking icon 
number 8 to open the Summary List window. 

<p>Quick browsing - to move through the set 10 records at a time, click on 
the scroll bar near the up or down arrow.

<p>To move through the set one record at a time - click on either arrow in the 
scroll bar.

<p><b>II. Interrupt function in SIMPCI</b>

<p>To interrupt a long search - <b>such as an SDI or saved search</b> - or 
a <b>save to disk operation</b>, click on the STATE button in the right hand 
corner of the SIM toolbar. If you have interrupted a save to disk operation 
then the message 'dump cancelled' will be displayed. Click on OK to return to 
searching.

<p>Please note that, unfortunately, this will not interrupt printing.

 <p><b>III. Configuring options in SIMWWW</b>
 
 <p>Use the Configure icon, (the ninth icon <b>on the SIMWWW form</b>) to configure certain user options. 
 
 <p><b>Make sure that when you change an option, you scroll down to the 
bottom of the screen and click on the "Update user configuration" button.</b>
 
 <p>An example of this is could be to select a default database for log on. 
This means that whenever you log on you are connected to the database you 
selected as the default. That database name will be displayed immediately 
under the Databases icon.
 
 <p>Important note: With generic userids, if one person changes the 
configuration (eg. to choose a default database), all users of that generic id will be affected.

<h2>An occasional series of SIM searching tips from CIS</h2>

<h3>6 December 1995</h3>
<p>[First issued 9 October 1995]
<hr>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>I. Search limits in SIMPCI 1.1d<br>
II.	Saving search strategies (SIMPCI)<br>
III.	Editing saved search strategies (SIMPCI)<br>
IV.	Sending saved search strategies (SIMPCI)<br>
V.	Sending saved search results

<p><b>I. Search limits in SIMPCI 1.1d</b>
		
<p>SIMPCI 1.1d has a limit of 256 characters in one search string. For example, if you have many sets to OR together, you should highlight only about 25 to combine at a time:
<p><pre>eg.  s=1 OR s=2 OR s=3 .....OR s=25</pre>

<p>If you wanted to combine more than 25, do them in groups then OR 
together the sets representing the groups:
<p><pre>eg.
<p>s76          s=1 OR s=2 OR s=3 ...OR s=25
s77          s=26 OR s=27 OR s=28 ... OR s=50
s78          s=51 OR s=52 OR s=53 ... OR s=75
s79          s=76 OR s=77 OR s=78</pre>

<p>SIMPCI 1.3 has no limits on search statement length.

<p><b>II. Saving search strategies (SIMPCI)</b>

<p>Search strategies may be saved with options given in the Set History window Operations menu. You may save a strategy for use in a particular database, use in any database, or as an SDI.

<p>In order to save a search using the SIMPCI client, you must first highlight the set or sets you want to save.

<p>If you are not sure about which option you want to use for saving a search 
(ie. Create Saved Search with Base, Create Saved Search without Base, Create SDI), then save the search without a base first. You can then re-run it and re-save it as one of the other options, giving each a slightly different name.
<p><pre>eg.
cat.sav (for search without base)
catcsix.sav (for search in CSIX i.e. with base)
catcc.sdi (for the same search run as an SDI in Current Contents)</pre>

<p>Note: There is presently a bug in SIMWWW which does not allow you to do this.

<p><b>Full documentation for saving searches can be found in the SIMPCI 
Tutorial.</b>

<p><b>III. Editing saved search strategies</b>

<p>Saved search strategies can be edited and renamed. First, click Icon 4 to open the Saved Search form, then use File Open to load your search into the window.

<p>To edit comment lines into a saved search, follow this procedure:

<p>1.	The first line must be blank.<br>
2. You can insert a line after the initial blank one which is your message 
preceded by a hash (#).<br>
3. If the database name is present in the saved search, it will appear on the third line.<br>
4. If you want another comment lower down in the same search you cannot use #  again (it tells you already have a set # and you cannot have 
another one).  You may use other non-numeric characters such as *. <br>
5. When you run the search you will receive a parameter such as: 
 
<p><pre># FIND {Whatever message you have typed in}
eg.	# FIND This search was first run 10 Aug 95.</pre>
 
<p>with the resultant number of hits being zero. That will not affect your "real" search parameters which have real numbers.<br>

<p>Note: You must not have a blank line within the search.

<p>If you wish to save your search strategy with another name, use the File Save As option. Be aware that if you run the edited search it will automatically be saved and will overwrite the original. Therefore if you wish to retain the original version, save the new version under another name before running it.

<p><b>IV. Sending saved search strategies</b>

<p>Saved search strategies can also be copied and transferred to another machine or person.

<p><b>SIMPCI:</b><br>
 Copy the .sav file to a diskette using Windows File Manager <b>or</b> highlight and copy the search to the Windows clipboard and then paste it into an email message and send to the other person).

<p><b>SIMWWW:</b> <br>
1. In the Search Result Sets window choose the 'Capture' radio button (on the Search Strategy line), then click the 'Process' button. This will take you to the Print Search Strategy window. <br>
2. Click the <b>Email to:</b> radio button and type in an email address (making sure to include the whole address, even if you are emailing someone in your own domain). <br>
3. Click the 'Process' button. SIM will take you back to the Search Result Set window and will produce a message verifying that the search strategy has been sent.

<p><b>V. Sending saved search results</b>

<p><b> SIMPCI:</b><br>
Although you cannot cut and paste directly from within SIM to your word processor or email software,  you can easily do so with the plain text file which is saved from SIM:

<p>1.	Perform your search.<br>
2. Highlight the set you want, and choose 'Operations Save' in the Set 
History window. (This saves results of the set to disk).  The Process 
Records form will open.<br>
3. Choose the appropriate Fieldset in the upper 'Use Fieldsets' box (i.e. 
Full, Summary, Citation, etc.), and Text-only in the lower 'Use Record 
Format(s)' box, then click the 'Process'  button.<br> 
4. You will be prompted to enter a file name, and you can choose  the 
drive and directory too. The records will be saved to disk in a plain 
ASCII file.  

<p>You can load this file into your word processor, cut and paste from it, 
attach it to  your email software, etc. (If you view it in your word processor, 
view it with the courier font - this is a  fixed-space font, and the spacing will 
then look OK.)

<p><b>SIMWWW:</b> <br>
1. Click on the Search Result Sets icon (which is the sixth icon from the left of the screen - the 'S1,S2' button).<br>
2. Select the 'Capture' radio button (on the <b>Records in Set</b> line) and click the 'Process' button. The Capture Records screen will appear. <br>
3. Select the <b>Email to:</b> and <b>Records in Range</b> radio buttons - nominating the results you wish to send. <br>
4. Choose the appropriate Style (for emailing, usually Text-only) and Field Set and  type in an email address (making sure to include the whole address, even if you are emailing someone in your own domain). <br>
5. Click the 'Process' button. SIM will take you back to the Search Result Sets window and will produce a message verifying that the search has been sent.

<h2>Introduction </h2>
The <a href="../simoverv.htm"> SIM software implementation </a> within 
CSIRO provides a high quality information service to scientists, managers and
staff.  Several databases are available, and more are planned.
<hr>
<a name=SDB></a>
<h2>SIM Databases </h2>
Each SIM database is named with a brief mnemonic code, eg CSIX for CSIRO Index. 
Labels or aliases for groups of databases may also be assigned, eg, CC is 
the label assigned to a group of databases containing issues of Current
Contents.<p>
Databases are listed alphabetically by name.<p>  Users of the SIMPCI will
notice two alphabetical sequences: simple database names are in the first
sequence; names which are 'aliases' for a group of databases appear in the
second sequence. 'CC' is an alias for separate groups of CC issues, so it 
appears at the end of the list. So far, 'CC' is the only alias in use.<p>
<hr>
<a name=IXS></a>
<h2>Indexes in SIM databases</h2>
SIM databases consist of 'records'.  For example, in a database which consists of bibliographic citations and abstracts, a 'record' comprises a citation and its associated abstract, subject indexing and other information.  <p>
Records are comprised of different data elements, eg author, journal title, volume number and so on.  Subsets of the data in a record are identified as 
'fields' ( a field may contain one data element, or a group of data elements.)  The field structure of records is consistent within any one 
database, (eg, all authors are in the AUTHOR field).  Though the record 
structure varies between databases, consistency in field labels and content 
across databases is sought by the database designers.<p>
In order for the searcher to be able to retrieve data from the record (or 
from the individual fields of a record), the data must be indexed.  An index 
can include data from more than one field, and SIM allows multiple indexes 
to be defined for a database.  SIM has two types of indexes:  the Basic Index,
 and Secondary indexes.  These are predefined by the database designers 
and system administrator.<p>
<a name=BIX></a>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index generally incorporates the words from the principal text 
fields of a database.  For example, in a bibliographic database, the Basic Index would
 usually comprise words from the title, abstract, and subject descriptor (keywords)
fields.<p>
The Basic Index may be searched via the CCL Query form (SIMPCI) or the Find screen (SIMWWW).  Its component fields (eg wTitle) may also be searched in the same way.<p>
The Basic Index may also be scanned and searched by means of the Scan Index terms function (A-Z icon) in both SIMPCI and SIMWWW.<p>
The Basic Index is the default index for searching or scanning if no other index is specified.<p>
<a name=SIX></a>
<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3>
Secondary indexes are additional indexes for specific fields eg: authors, subjects, date, etc.  Currently each SIM database has its secondary indexes indexed in a special way, so that the complete contents of a field forms the index entry.  This enables t
he searcher to scan the index and pick from the list of entries.
However, it also means that if you are searching for only one word or part of a field entry in a secondary index you must truncate your search term (at the start and/or at the end).  The truncation symbol is the question mark:  ?<p>
The Secondary Indexes may be searched via the CCL Query form (SIMPCI) or the Find screen (SIMWWW).  Index names are selected from a drop-down list.<p>
The Secondary Indexes may also be scanned and searched by means of the Scan Index terms function (A-Z icon) in both SIMPCI and SIMWWW. Index names are selected from a drop-down list, and you can jump to any point in the index by scanning for the start of 
your search term.  The scan-and-search technique is the most effective for searching a secondary index, since you can see the entries that actually appear in the index and select those that are relevant.<p>
<hr>
<a name=TPM></a>
<h2>Truncation and Pattern Matching</h2>
Special symbols can be used in your search so that you can search for variants of words, or words with specific stems.  These retrieval techniques are known as 'truncation', 'stemming', 'masking' or 'pattern matching'.  The special symbols are sometimes k
nown as 'wildcards'.<p>
<a name=TRU></a>
<h3>Truncation</h3>
The 'truncation' technique enables you to retrieve word with a specific stem. The truncation symbol is the question mark:  ?   <p>
Both left-hand and right-hand truncation are available.  When you enter search text, put the truncation symbol immediately after (or before) the word stem, with NO INTERVENING SPACE.  <p>
You may use <p>
<dl>
<dd><pre><b>?</b>      unlimited number of characters<br>
<dd><b>?<i>n</i></b>     specify a maximum number of characters (<b><i>n</i></b>) to precede or follow the word stem.</pre><p>
</dl>
Examples:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  elect?  </pre>
<dd>Unlimited truncation - searches for terms with the stem <I> elect </i> - <i> elect, electric, electrically, electricity, electrified, electrifies, electrify, electrode, electrodes, electron, electrons </i> <p>
<dt><pre>  elect?4  </pre> 
<dd>Truncation from zero to 4 characters - retrieves all records containing terms with the stem and up to 4 letters after the stem, (<I> elect, electric, electrode, electron, electrons, </i> <b> but not </b> <I> electricity, electrified, electrifies, elec
trodes, electronic </I>  etc)<p>
<dt><pre>  ?ast  </pre>   
<dd>Left-hand truncation - searches for words ending in <I> ast </i> such as <I> breast, coast, contrast, east, fast, fibroblast, last, least, mast , osteoclast, past.  </i>  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand tru
ncation with caution.<p>
<dt><pre>  ?2ast  </pre>   
<dd>Limited left-hand truncation - from 0 to 2 characters  - searches for words ending in <I> ast </i> with up to 2 characters before <i> ast</i>, such as <I> coast, east, fast, last, least, past </i>  <b> but not </b> <i> breast, contrast, fibroblast, os
teoclast. </i>  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand truncation with caution.<p>
<dt><pre>  ?tech?  </pre>  
<dd>Both left and right-hand truncation - searches for words containing the string  <I> tech </I> such as <I> antechinus, biotech, biotechnology, butylcatecholate, catechol, cryotechniques, electrotechnic, hydrotechnical, pertechnate, technique, technolog
y</i> and so on.  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand truncation with caution. <p> 
<dt><pre>  ?3tech?4  </pre>  
<dd>A combination of limited left-hand and limited right-hand truncation - searches for words containing the string  <I> tech </I> with up to 3 characters before and up to 4 after, such as <i> antechinus, biotech, catechin, catechol, lytechinus, pertechna
te, technics </i> <b> but not </b><I> biotechnology, butylcatecholate, cryotechniques, electrotechnic, hydrotechnical, technique, technology</i>.  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand truncation with caution. <p> 
</dl>
When searching Secondary Indexes, a combination of left and right-hand truncation should be used if you are trying to retrieve text which does not appear at the start of the field.<p>
For example, in Current Contents (CC) you might want to find journal titles that include the words <i>  chemical </i> or <i> chemistry</i>.  If you scan the index entries from <i>  chem  </i> you can see only those that start with that stem.  If you selec
t the <b>  journal </b> (or <b> tocJournal</b>) index and search for:<br>
<pre>  ?chem?  </pre>  you will retrieve all records in which the journal title contains any word starting with <i> chem </i> - <i> Chemistry in Britain, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of the Chemical Society - Chemical Communications, Monatshefte
 fur Chemie </i>  and so on.<p> 
<a name=PLU></a>
<h3>Plurals</h3>
The plural stemming symbol <b>  ~ </b> (the tilde) is used to retrieve singular and plural forms of words.<p>
For example,<br>
<pre>   disease~  </pre>  searches for <I> disease </I>  or <I> diseases </I>  but not <I> diseased </I> <p>
<a name=PMA></a>
<h3>Pattern matching</h3>
Use the <b> # </b> symbol for 'pattern matching' or 'masking'.  <p>
<dl>
<dd><pre><b> #  </b>   exactly one character
<dd><b> #<i>n</i>  </b>  exactly <I> n </I> characters
<dd><b> ?  </b>   an unlimited number of characters (including zero)
<dd><b> ?<I>n </I></b>   zero to <I> n </I></pre>
</dl>
Examples:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  wom#n  </pre>  
<dd>Mask exactly one character - searches for <I> woman </I>  or <I> women </I> <p>
<dt><pre>  int#2state  </pre>  
<dd>Mask exactly two characters - searches for <I> interstate</I>  or <I> intrastate</I> <br>
<DT><pre>  hydro?carbon  </pre>  
<dd>Masks an unlimited number of characters - searches for all terms starting with <I> hydro</I>  and ending with <I> carbon</I>, such as <I> hydrocarbon, hydrochlorofluorocarbon, hydrofluorocarbon</I> <p>
<dt><pre>  model?1ing  </pre> 
<dd> Masks zero or one character - searches for <I> modeling</I>  or <I> modelling</I> <br><p>
</dl>
<hr>
<a name=ADJ></a>
<h2>Adjacency</h2>
When you are using the CCL Query Form in SIM PCI (or the Find screen in SIM WWW) you are really using SIM's FIND command. (It is the FIND icon on the toolbar that opens the CCL Query Form window in SIM PCI, or the Find screen in SIM WWW).  When you enter 
your search text in the CCL Query Form window, any space between terms means 'adjacency'.  That is, the words are interpreted as a phrase.<p>
When searching the Basic Index, if you enter:
<dl>
<dt><pre>  water</pre>  
<dd>SIM retrieves records containing the word <I> water </I> in any field that is indexed by the Basic Index.<br>
<dt><pre>  water pollution</pre>  
<dd>SIM retrieves records in which the words <I> water </I> and <I> pollution </I> appear adjacent to each other and in that order in any field that is indexed by the Basic Index.<br>
<dt><pre>  surface water pollution</pre>  
<dd>SIM retrieves records in which the words <I> surface </I>, <I> water </I> and <I> pollution </I> appear adjacent to each other and in that order in any field that is indexed by the Basic Index.<pr>
Thus the more words in your phrase the more specific and restrictive you search becomes.<p>
</dl>
Note that there are certain words (such as the <a href=#BOOL>Boolean</a> operators AND, OR, NOT, and some other operators such as TO [the range operator], WITH and SAME) that are 'reserved words' - that is, SIM will interpret them as operators if they are
 entered in search queries.  If you wish to include any of these words in a search of the Basic index, you should enclose them in quotation marks (<b> "</b>) so that SIM will search for the word rather than try to perform the operation represented by that
 word.  Examples are given in the <a href=#RES>  Special (Reserved) Words </a> section. <p>
You can of course use any of the <A HREF=#TRU> truncation or masking </A>symbols in adjacency searching:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  water pollut?   </pre>  
<dd>Searches for phrases such as <i>water pollutant, water pollutants, water polluting, water pollution </I><p>
</dl>
Adjacency is not available in the RANK command.  In the Rank Query form, a space entered between terms is treated as a Boolean <a href=#OR>OR</a>.<p>
<hr>
<a name=RES></a>
<h2>Use of Restoration Marks</h2>
<a name=RWD></a>
<h3>Reserved Words</h3>
Some words (operators or other words with special meanings in SIM commands) cannot be retrieved unless they are surrounded by quotation marks (").  These quotation marks are called 'restoration marks'.  The restoration marks indicate to SIM that the word 
is to be retrieved, rather than an operation performed which is represented by that word.<p>
For example, to retrieve the phrase <i> research and development </i>, your query would be entered as:
<pre> research "and" development </pre>
It could also be entered as: 
<pre> "research and development" </pre>
The quotation marks indicate that the word 'and' not the Boolean operation 'and' is meant.<p>
For example, if in the CCL Query Form you enter:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  research and development  </pre> 
<dd>SIM searches for records in which both the word  <i> research </i>and the word <i> development </i> occur.<p>
<dt><pre>  research "and" development  </pre> 
<dd>SIM searches for the phrase <I> research and development </I><br>
<dt><pre>  "to lead"  </pre>  
<dd>SIM searches for the phrase <I> to lead </I> (this is useful if you want to eliminate these records from those about the mineral <I>  lead</i>.<p>
</dl>
Some of these operators (eg, TO) and letters such as S (for Set, in the Find command) or T (for Term, in the Scan command) cause an error message to be generated if they are not enclosed in restoration marks.  <p>
Words or letters which require restoration marks if you wish to retrieve them are:
<dl>
     <dd>and
     <dd>not
     <dd>or
     <dd>to
     <dd>same
     <dd>with
     <dd>t
     <dd>s
</dl><p>
<a name=RPN></a>
<h3>Punctuation</h3>
Normal punctuation (eg, comma, fullstop, parenthesis) which is preceded or followed by a space, and hyphens, are not stored in the Basic Index.  You can ignore such punctuation in searching.<p>  
However, punctuation (other than hyphens) embedded in other text IS stored in the Basic Index.  Examples are:
<dl>
     <dd>12c/13c
     <dd>0.61m
<dd>2C2OH33N3.6HBr.7/2H2O
</dl><p>
Include such punctuation in your search text if you enter it in the CCL Query form.<p>
If the search text contains commas or parentheses, eg:
<dl>
<dd>2,4 D
     <dd>1,3 benzodioxol
     <dd>Brombyin I[(rel) ....
</dl><p>
you MUST enclose the search text in restoration marks, otherwise an error message will be generated and the search will fail. Commas and parentheses must be treated in this way in searching because they have special meanings within the SIM Find command:  
commas are used in range searching, and parentheses in Boolean combinations<p>
Hyphens and apostrophes are significant in the <b> Secondary Indexes </b>
- you must include them in your search if they are present in the text you
wish to retrieve.  (The exception is the Author index of the CC database, from
which hyphens and apostrophes are removed before CSIRO receives the data. 
Further details are in the <a href="../ccdbg.htm#AUTN">CC Database 
Guide.</a>)<p>
When searching <b> Secondary Indexes </b> if your search text includes a comma
or parentheses, you MUST enclose your search text in restoration marks.<p>
For example, you may wish to find publications by the Division of Fisheries in the CSIX database.  Division names are inverted in the Division index in this database, <i> Fisheries, Division of' </i><p>  
The best way to find this is to use the Scan Index terms feature and select
from the list of index entries.  However, you may enter the text directly into
the CCL Query Form, but if you do so you MUST surround it with restoration marks.<p>
In the CCL Query Form select the Division index.  
Type in the query box:<P>  
<PRE>	"fisheries, division of"</PRE><P>  
then click the FIND button. <p>  
Alternatively you could search just <i>fisheries</i> if you truncate before the comma.  Type in the query  
box:<P>  
<pre>	fisheries?</pre><p>  
then click the FIND button.<p>  
When in doubt, use restoration marks - SIM will ignore them if they are redundant.<p>
<hr>

<h2>Context searching</h2>
<a href="pcisrch.htm#CONTEXT">Context searching</a> (also known as word proximity searching) is done from the <b> Select an Operator </b> window in SIMPCI, and the Find (Search) screen in SIMWWW.<p>
This window is opened by clicking on the button beside the Index box in the <b>  CCL Query form </b>.  This button will usually display the   <b> = </b>  symbol, but will show another symbol if the last search operation was a context or numeric search.  T
he <b> Select an Operator </b> window provides both <b> Textual </b> and <b> Numeric </b> operators for use in your search.  The default search is 'within a field' (represented by the <b> = </b>   symbol).<p>
The <b> Textual </b> operators enable you to search for words according to their proximity to other words.  These operators are represented by the buttons marked:
<dl>
<dd><pre> <b> = </b>     in field (select the indexed field from the spin box in the <b> CCL Query form</b>.  
<dd> <b> with </b>  in same paragraph (word order ignored)
<dd> <b> same </b>  in same sentence (not currently implemented - results are the same as 'with')
<dd> <b> % </b>     within n words; word order is ignored (enter <I> n </I> (number of words) in the 'Within <I> n </I> words' box)
<dd> <b> ! </b>     within n words; word order preserved</pre>
</dl>
These operators work on the Basic index and any other field indexed by 'word' rather than 'whole field'.  Word indexes are indicated by the lower case <b> w </b>prefixing the field name in the drop down list in the  <b> CCL Query Form </b> (eg, <b> wTitle
</b>).<p>
Examples:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  biological %2 control   </pre> 
<dd>within 2 words; word order is ignored - retrieves phrases such as <I> biological control, biological weed control, biological pest control, control by biological means, control its biological function</i><p>
<dt><pre>   biological !2 control   </pre> 
<dd>within 2 words, with  word order preserved  - searches for <I> biological control, biological weed control, biological pest control </i><p>
<dt><pre>   biotechnology WITH investment  </pre> 
<dd>retrieves these terms in same paragraph (word order ignored).<p>
</dl>
The SAME operator (terms in same sentence, word order ignored) is not currently implemented.  If you use this operator, the results will be the equivalent of using WITH.<p>
<hr>
<a name=BOOL></a>
<a name=dp></a>
<h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
Boolean operators (also known as logical operators) enable the logical 
combination of search terms or result sets.  Boolean operations are 
illustrated with <a href="venn.htm">Venn diagrams </a><p>
The FIND command in SIM uses the Boolean operators OR, AND, NOT, XOR.  They may be entered in searches or used via the drop down Combinations menu in the Set History window of SIMPCI, or the Search Results Sets screen of SIMWWW.<p>
<a name=OR></a>
<b>   OR     </b> Any one of the terms must be present in the record:<br>
<pre>  groundwater OR ground water </pre><p>
<pre>  fruit OR vegetables OR cereals  </pre><p>
<pre>  s1 OR s2 OR S3 OR s4 OR s5 </pre><p>
Use OR to broaden your search by including synonyms, variant spellings or other concepts.<p>
<b>   AND     </b> Both (or all) terms must be present in the record:
<pre>  groundwater AND salinity </pre>
<pre>  water quality AND monitoring </pre>
<pre>  s7 AND s8 </pre>
<pre>  dairy products AND exports AND europe </pre><p>
Use AND to restrict your search.  The more concepts you combine with AND, the smaller your results will be.<p>
<b>   NOT     </b>   The first term but not the second must be present in the record:
<pre>  fruit NOT apples </pre>
<pre>  s1 NOT s3 </pre><p>
Use NOT to eliminate unwanted concepts, but use it with care, to ensure that you do not exclude relevant material.<p>
<b>   XOR     </b> One or other of the terms must be present in the record, but not both:
<pre>  sheep XOR goats </pre><p>
Order of precedence of operators is: AND, NOT, OR, XOR (OR and XOR equal).  That is, an AND operation will be performed before an OR operation if both operations are included in a query, unless parentheses are used to override precedence.<p>
If the search <br><pre>  foxes OR rabbits AND pest control  </pre><br> is entered, the 'rabbits AND pest control' will be processed first, then the OR operation will be done.  This means that only the 'rabbits' part of the query will be combined with 'pes
t control'; the 'foxes' part of it will include any record containing 'foxes'.<p> 
Parentheses are used to over-ride precedence so that the query is logically correct.  Operations in parentheses are processed first:<br>
<pre>  (foxes OR rabbits) AND pest control <p>
  (s1 OR s2) AND exports <br>
  joint ventures AND (china OR thailand OR malaysia) <br>
  (animal pests OR pest animals) NOT rabbits </pre><br>
NOTE: it is good practice to use brief search statements and then combine the result sets with the Boolean operators, rather than to use complicated search syntax to try to combine all your concepts into one statement.<p>
<hr>
<a name=NUMO></a>
<h3>Numeric operators</h3>
<a href="pcisrch.htm#NUM">Numeric searching</a> (also known as relational searching) is done from the <b> Select an Operator </b> window in SIMPCI, and the Find (Search) screen in SIMWWW.<p>
Use these operators to search fields containing numeric or coded data. <p> The <b> Equal to </b> operator is the default operator, and works on text fields as well as numeric ones.<p>  The fields given in the examples would be selected from the spin box i
n the CCL Query form.<p>
<dl>
<dd><pre><b>   EQ =   </b>   Equal to,  eg documentType=journal
<dd><b>   NE <>   </b>  Not equal to, eg  PublYear ne 1994
<dd><b>   GT >   </b>   Greater than, eg  PublYear gt 1980
<dd><b>   GE >=   </b>  Greater than or equal to, eg  References gt 20
<dd><b>   LT <   </b>   Less than eg, F DocumentNo lt 9400001
<dd><b>   LE <=   </b>  Less than or equal to, eg PublYear le 1990
<dd><b>   TO    </b>    Range (inclusive), eg  PublYear 1980 to 1985</pre>
</dl><p>
<hr>
<a NAME=RNK></a>
<h2>RANKING</h2>
Rank searches are used to find and display, in order of relevance, records 
which satisfy a search query.<p>
In a Rank search, SIM uses statistical information about the rarity of the query terms entered by the searcher, the number of times that the terms appear in each record, and the size of each record to determine the 50 best matches to the query.  The recor
ds resulting from a Rank search are ordered so that the most relevant are displayed first.  A maximum of 50 records is returned by the Rank process.<P> 
A Rank query cannot include Boolean, contextual, numeric or wildcard operators, though truncation may be used. Rank may be used to rank a set which was previously generated by searching or scanning; such sets may contain operators.<p>
Rank works only on the Basic Index.<p>
Rank cannot be performed when more than one database is selected.<p>
To use Rank, click the Rank icon to open the Rank Query form.  In the Rank Query text box, enter:
<ul>
<li>terms to be ranked, each separated by a space.  Do not use operators or wildcards, though you may use truncation.  Note that in a Rank search, the space between terms represents a Boolean  'OR' operation, not 'adjacency' as it does in other SIM search
es; or
<li>the number of a previous set (eg, <i>s3</i>); or
<li>the number of a previous set followed by a term (or terms) by which you wish the set to be ranked (eg,  <i>s3 marketing </i>)  This term does not have to be one which was included in your original search statement.
</ul>
Rank sets are numbered in sequence with other sets, and can be used in other searches, viewed, printed and saved just like sets created by Searching or Scanning.<p>

<H2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</H2>  

<H3>August 1995</H3><P>  

[First issued 17 October 1994; revised October 1995]  

<HR>  

<H2><B>Contents:</B></H2><P>  

I.	Searching a secondary index in SIMPCI via the CCL Query Form<BR>  

II.	Author initials<P>  

<H3>I.	Searching a secondary index in SIMPCI via the CCL Query 
Form</H3><P>  

In SIMPCI if you wish to search a secondary index (ie, any index other  

than the Basic index), take the following steps:<P>  

1.In the CCL Query form select the particular index by using the  

spin box (down arrow) beside the Index box.  [Note: secondary indexes 
are  

listed in the database guide for each SIM database].<P>  

2.Click on the index you wish to search.  Its name will display in  

the Index box.<P>   

3.Enter your search term(s) in the query box.  <p>  

In SIM 1.1d you usually do not need to enclose your search text in  

double-quotes ("). However, if your search text includes a comma,  

apostrophe or parentheses, or a word such as AND which has special 
meaning within SIM  

you must use the double-quote marks ("),  

otherwise your search will fail. (If in doubt use the double-quotes -  

SIM will ignore them if they are redundant.)  

<p>  

All secondary indexes currently available for SIM databases are indexed  

so that the entire value of the field is stored in the index. This  

means that you should use the truncation symbol (<b>?</b>) at the end of  

your search text in the CCL Query Form unless you want to retrieve only  

an EXACT match in the index for the term(s) you have typed. (If you have  

used double-quotes, put the truncation symbol outside the quote marks).  

<p>  

Because secondary indexes have the entire value of the field stored in 
the  

index, these indexes can be scanned in a meaningful way and variant  

entries selected from the list. (Use Toolbar 6 to open the Scan Index 
Terms  

window, then select the index you want, and scan for the text you wish to 
search).  

	Some examples of searching with this method are shown below.<P>  

a)	<b>To find items by M. F. Day</b><P>   

In the CCL Query Form select the Author index.  

Type in the query box:<P>  

<PRE>	day mf</PRE><P>    

then click the FIND button.  Results will appear in the Set History 
window.<P>   

b)	<b>To find items by any M. Day</b>  (ie, M. Day; M. F. Day; M. F. 
J. Day, etc)<P>  

In the CCL Query Form select the Author index.  

Type in the query box:<P>  

<PRE>	day m? </PRE><P>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the truncation symbol 
(?).<p>  

c)	<b>To find any issue of a particular journal title</b>, eg 
<i>Journal of Applied Polymer  

Science</i><P>  

This example is from the CC database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Journal index.   

Type in the query box:<P>  

 <PRE>	journal of applied polymer science?</PRE><P>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the truncation symbol 
(?).<p>  

d)	<b>To find a particular issue of a particular journal title</b>, 
such as <i>Journal of Applied Polymer  

Science</i>, volume 54, number 1, October 3rd, 1994<P>  

This example is from the CC database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Journal index.    

Type in the query box:<P>  

<PRE>	journal of applied polymer science 1994 v 54 n 1 Oct 3</PRE> <P>  

then click the FIND button.<P>  

[Note: if you wish to locate a particular journal issue, it is   

easier to use Toolbar button 6 to open the Scan Index terms window,  

select the Journal index, scan for the journal name or part of it, then  

highlight the issue you want and search for it (double click the  

highlighted item(s) or click the Search button).  Scanning an  

index allows you to see exactly what data elements are there, and the   

order in which they are presented.]<P>  

e)	<b>To find text containing a comma</b>, eg 'Fisheries, Division 
of'<P>  

  

This example is from the CSIX database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Division index.  

Type in the query box:<P>  

 <PRE>	"fisheries, division of"</PRE><P>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the quotation symbols 
(").<p>  

Alternatively you could search just <i>fisheries</i> if you truncate 
before the comma.  Type in the query  

box:<P>  

<pre>	fisheries?</pre><p>  

then click the FIND button.<p>  

f)	<b>To find a journal title containing the word AND</b>, eg 
<i>Accident Analysis and  

Prevention</i><P>  

This example is from the CC database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Journal index.<BR>  Type in the  

query box:<p>  

<pre>	"accident analysis and prevention"?</pre><p>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the quotation symbols 
(").<p>  

Alternatively, use the Scan Index function (Icon 6) to scan the index and 
select the item you want.<p>   

<a name=JAMP></a>  

g)	<b>To find a journal title containing an ampersand (&amp) (CC 
database only)</b><P>  

Ampersands (&amp) are not currently stored in the Journal index to CC.  
If the title you wish to retrieve  

contains an ampersand, please ignore that character and scan or search 
for the title as if the ampersand is not  

present.<p>  

For example, search for the title <i>Computers &amp Geosciences</i> by 
typing:<p>  

<pre>	computers geosciences</pre><p>  

in the CCL Query form or by scanning for this in the Scan Index form.<p>  

We hope to correct the omission of ampersands in CC indexes in a future 
re-load of CC.    

If you are uncertain whether the AND in a journal title is represented by 
an ampersand or the word AND, use  

the Scan Index function to check both versions in the index.<p>  

<a name=AUN></a>  

<H3>II.	AUTHOR NAMES </H3><P>  

Author initials are 'blocked together' in the SIM reference databases, 
eg<P>  

<PRE>	adey rfj  

	winter te  

</PRE><P>  

Please note that in the <b> CSIX </b> and <b> SCAN </b> databases names 
such as O'Brien DO include the 

apostrophes.  

The apostrophe must be included in the searching, and the name must be 
enclosed within double-quote  

marks:<p>  

<pre>  

	"o'brien cj"  

	"o'brien c"?  

</pre>  

In <b> CC </b> the apostrophes are 'stripped out' before we receive the 
data, so do  

not include them in your search.<p>  

<pre>  

	obrien cj  

	obrien c?  

</pre>  

Be sure you allow for this difference if you are typing your queries in  

as shown above.<P>

<H2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</H2> 

<H3>23 October 1995</H3><P> 

<HR> 

<H3>AUTHOR NAMES CONTAINING HYPHENS, APOSTROPHES OR SPACES - TREATED  

DIFFERENTLY IN CC DATABASE </H3><P> 

Please note that in the <b> CSIX </b>and <b> SCAN </b> databases 
hyphenated names such as "Staveley-

Smith", "O'Brien" and "van der Meulen" are presented correctly, and 
hyphens, apostrophes and spaces are 

included in the text and the indexes.  The hyphen, apostrophe or space 
must be included in your search, eg: 

<pre> 

	staveley-smith l 

	tyndale-biscoe ch 

	van der meulen cj 

	van gerwen ac 

	"o'brien cj" 

	"o'brien c"? 

</pre> 

[Note: in CSIX and SCAN you MUST use double quotes around names 
containing an apostrophe, otherwise 

you will not retrieve anything.  If in doubt, use the quotes - if they 
are redundant your search will still succeed. 

Use the truncation symbol (?) if you are unsure of the initials or if the 
author's initials are presented in different 

ways.] <p> 

In <b> Current Contents (CC) </b> the hyphens, apostrophes and spaces are 
'stripped out' by ISI (the publisher 

of CC) before CSIRO receives the data, so these characters do not appear 
in author names in the CC database.  

Do not include them in your search, eg in CC search for:<br> 

<pre>	staveleysmith l 

	tyndalebiscoe ch 

	vandermeulen cj 

	vangerwen ac 

	obrien cj 

	obrien c? 

</pre> 

Apologies to the CSIRO authors whose names are treated in such cavalier 

fashion by ISI.<p> 

When searching for particular authors a good technique is to use the Scan 
Index function (A-Z icon), and 

select from the list of index entries.<p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
When you perform a SIM search by entering terms, or scanning indexes or ranking terms, SIM creates a result set.  The <b> Set History </b> window will open and the set number, number of records retrieved ('hits') and the text of the query will be shown.
<p>
The result set itself is a collection of all of the records that were found by the search. Result sets are kept by SIM until the end of your session.<p>
You can work with sets to combine them in subsequent searches, or delete them, or save them (without the records they retrieved) for use again in the future. <p>
You can <a href="pcivwpr.htm#VIEW">view</a>, <a href="pcivwpr.htm#PRR">print</a> and download (<a href="pcivwpr.htm#SAV">save</a> to your local disk) the records in a set.<p>
<a name=comsets></a>
<h3>Combining Sets</h3>
Use the Combinations menu in the <b> Set History </b> window to perform Boolean operations on sets.<p>
The Boolean operators are <b> AND</b>, <b> OR</b>, <b> NOT</b>.  There are two options for <b> NOT </b> - combine in order of set number, or in reverse order.<p>
For example, if you had done two searches, the first on <I> groundwater </i> and the second on <I> salinity</i>, your <b> Set History </b> window would display something like this:
<p>
<pre>     s1   :1110     FIND groundwater
     s2   :1232     FIND salinity</pre><p>
If you wished to combine these sets with <b> AND </b> (to find records common to both sets), this is the procedure:<p>
<ol>
<li>In the <b> Set History </b> window highlight the sets you wish to combine (ie, s1, s2)<p>
<li>Click on the <b> Combinations </b>  menu<p>
<li>Select <b> AND </b> from the list of operators<p>
</ol><p>
The results (in this example, set 3) will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>
Use the same technique to combine sets with the other Boolean operators.<p>
<a name=del></a>
<h3>Deleting Result Sets from your Search Strategy</H3>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the set (or sets) in the  <b> Set History </b> window.  If you wish to select all the sets, use the menu option <b> Operations Select All </b>.<p>
<LI>Open the  <b> Operations </b>  menu.<p>
<LI>Choose the  <b> Delete </b> option.<p>
</ol><p>
<a name=savsets></a>
<h3>Saving Search Sets</h3>
The text of sets (without the records they retrieved) may be saved for use again in the future.  Sets may be saved as an ordinary saved search, or as a search to be run specifically as an SDI ( Selective Dissemination of Information, or current awareness)
.

To save a search strategy (a group of sets) as an ordinary saved search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the set (or sets) in the  <b> Set History </b> window.  If the 
set you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you must highlight all the sets that comprise the final result.  (If you wish to save all the sets, use the menu option <b> Operations Select All</b>.)<p>
<LI>Open the  <b> Operations </b>  menu.<p>
<LI>Choose one of the  <b> Create Saved Search </b> options.  The <b> without base </b> option means that the saved search will run on any database; the <b> with base </b> option means it will run only on the database in which you saved it.<p>
<LI>In the <b> Save As </b> window, enter a name for the saved search (you may choose a drive and directory as well), and click the  <b> OK </b>  button.  (Note that the file extension for a saved search strategy is <b> .sav</b>.)
</ol><p>
If you want to overwrite a previously-saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.<p>
<a name=sdi></a>
<h3>SDI Saves</h3>
An SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) search is one that is 
time stamped so that it may be used for current awareness.  When the search is run again later, only records added to 
the database since the last search are returned.<p>  
To save a search as an SDI search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the set (or sets) in the  <b> Set History </b> window.  If the 
set you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you must highlight all the sets that comprise the final result.  (If you wish to save all the sets, use the menu option <b> Operations Select All</b>.)<p>
<LI>Open the  <b> Operations </b>  menu.<p>
<LI>Choose the  <b> Create SDI </b> option.<p>
<LI>In the <b> Save As </b> window, enter a name for the saved search (you may choose a drive and directory as well), and click the  <b> OK </b>  button.  (Note that the file extension for a saved SDI search strategy is <b> .sdi</b>.)
</ol><p>
SDI searches may only be run in the database in which they were 
entered and saved.<p>
<a name=run></a>
<h3>Running a Saved Search or SDI</h3>
Saved searches or SDI searches may be run in this way:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 4 (the <b> Find Save </b> icon) to open the <b> Saved Search Form </b><p>
<li>From the File menu in this window, choose <b> Open </b><p>
<li>Select your saved search.  (Use the <b> List Files of Type </b> box to choose the appropriate file extension (<b> .sav </b> or <b> .sdi </b>)<p>
<li> The search strategy will appear in the <b> Saved Search Form </b> window<p>
<li>Open the <b> Run </b> menu, then choose  <b> Process Saved Search File </b><p>
<li>The search will be executed (note the messages in the Status line on the SIM Toolbar) and the sets will appear in the  <b> Set History </b> window<p>
<li>Open the <b> File </b> menu in the <b> Saved Search Form </b>, then choose <b> Close Window </b><p>
<li>Work with your result sets in the usual way<p>
</ol><p>
When you view an SDI search in the  <b> Saved Search Form </b>, you will see that SIM inserted a set 0 (set zero) when the search was saved.  This is the 'timeprint' - the statement that searches for records added since the time the search was last run.  
The time information is a 'system time', expressed in a form meaningful to SIM (it is a 9 digit number, eg 809780000).  This 'time stamp' will be updated automatically by SIM each time the SDI is run.  You do not have to keep saving your search strategy a
fter each SDI run.<p>
SIM also includes 'AND s0' in each search statement so that the combination of your results will represent the records added. since the last search time.<p>
<a name=edit></a>
<h3>Editing a Saved Search</h3>
Saved searches or SDI searches may be edited in the   <b> Saved Search Form </b>:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 4 (the <b> Find Save </b> icon) to open the <b> Saved Search Form </b><p>
<li>From the File menu in this window, choose <b> Open </b><p>
<li>Select your saved search.  (Use the <b> List Files of Type </b> box to choose the appropriate file extension (<b> .sav </b> or <b> .sdi </b>)<p>
<li>The search strategy will appear in the <b> Saved Search Form </b> window<p>
<li>Position the mouse pointer (cursor) in the appropriate place, and add or delete text as you wish.  If the search is an SDI search, make sure you do not delete set 0 (s=0, set zero).<p>
<li>Choose  <b> File Save File </b> to save it under the same name, or  <b> File Save File As </b> to save it under another name.<p>
</ol>
<a name=delss></a>
<h3>Deleting a Saved Search</h3>
To delete unwanted saved search strategies:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 4 (the <b> Find Save </b> icon) to open the <b> Saved Search Form </b><p>
<li>From the File menu in this window, choose <b> Open </b><p>
<li>Select your saved search.  (Use the <b> List Files of Type </b> box to choose the appropriate file extension (<b>  .sav </b> or <b>  .sdi </b>)<p>

<H3><B>Contents:</B></H3><P>
I. SDI PROFILES - SIMPCI<BR>
II.SDI PROFILES - SIMCLI<BR>
<H3>I.  SDI PROFILES - SIMPCI</H3><BR>
In SIMPCI SDI profiles may be set up using with the Create SDI Option in 
the Operations menu of the Set History window.<P>
SDI profiles are time-stamped with the time that the search was created
(or last run), and are specific to a particular database.  Each time the
SDI is run, SIM compares the date of the records in the database with the
date that the SDI was last run, so that the only records retrieved by the
search are those added to the database since the SDI was last run.  (SIM
uses the system-assigned time in the CreatTime index to do this).  In
order to get meaningful results, the SDI search MUST be entered and saved
in the database in which you wish to run it in future.
You can set up an SDI in any SIM reference database (every SIM database has the
CreatTime index which is used by the SIM SDI process).<P>
To create an SDI take the following steps:<P>
1. Create your search strategy in the database you will be using for the SDI.<BR>
2. In the Operations menu of the Set History window, choose Select
All.  This highlights all the sets in your strategy, and ensures that
they are all saved.  (Alternatively, highlight the individual sets you
wish to save before you open the Operations menu).<BR>
3. Open the Operations menu of the Set History window again.<BR>
4. Click on Create SDI.<BR>
5. In the Open window, give your saved search an appropriate name.
	(The extension must be  .sdi )<BR>
6. Your search will be saved, and time-printed.  (You won't be able to
	test it until the database is next updated)<P>
To run an SDI:<P>
1. Click SIM Toolbar button 4 to open the Saved Search Form (or open
	View Saved Searches on the Toolbar menu)<BR>
2. In the Open window, highlight the name of the saved search you
	wish to run, and click OK.<BR>
3. The search strategy will appear in the Saved Search Form window.
	(You will notice that the system has inserted a set 0 (set zero), which
	is the statement that searches for records added since the time the
	search was last run).<BR>
4. Choose Run Process Saved Search.<BR>
5. The search will be executed (note the messages in the Status line
	on the SIM Toolbar) and the sets will appear in the Set History window.<BR>
6. Choose File Close Window in the Saved Search Form.<BR>
7. In the Set History window highlight the last set.<BR>
8. Choose Print Result Set (or Save [to save results to disk]) from
	the Operations menu to output the results in your preferred format.<P>
To amend an SDI:<P>
1.  Click SIM Toolbar button 4 to open the Saved Search Form (or open
	View Saved Searches on the Toolbar menu).<BR>
2.  Choose File Open.<BR>
3.  Highlight the name of the saved search you wish to run, and click OK.<BR>
4.  The search strategy will appear in the Saved Search Form window.<BR>
5.  Edit your search (alter, insert, or delete text).<P>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
Make sure you don't delete set zero (s=0), which is the set created by SIM
to check the date on which the record was added to the database; it is this set
which makes the SDI work properly.  The time specified in set zero is amended by
SIM each time the SDI is run.<P>
Make sure when you edit the search that there are no blank lines in it.<P>
Note that search statements must use the SIM Command Line Interface syntax.
Make sure that your last statement is logically correct, includes all the previous 
sets necessary to a satisfactory result, and retains the combination  'and S=0'.<P>
</dl>
6. Choose File Save (or File Save As, if you wish to change the name
	of the search).<BR>
7. Choose File Close Window in the Saved Search Form.<P>
<H3>II.	SDI PROFILES - SIMCLI</H3><P>
To save an SDI in SIMCLI:<P>
enter the command<P>
<B>SAVE SDI filename</B><P>
(where filename is a filename of your choice, eg <B>SAVE SDI abcd123</B>).<P>
A range of sets can be saved with the command<P>
<B>SAVE SDI s5 to s10 filename</B><P>
To run an SDI in SIMCLI:<P>
enter the command<P>
<B>FIND SAVE=filename</B><P>
(where filename is the name of your SDI, eg <B>FIND SAVE=abcd123</B>)<P>

I.  Changes to CC Coverage<BR>
II. New CC Subject Categories for 1995<P>


On 21 December 1994, CIS received information from ISI about changes to 
CC coverage and new subject categories.  The letter about coverage is 
reproduced below, followed by details of the new categories.<P>

<B>I.  Changes to CC Coverage</B><P>

ISI's letter:
                                *****

<PRE><I>ISI is pleased to announce the following coverage changes to CC 
Search. We are confident these enhancements will improve the product's 
focus and usefulness, while continuing to keep you up-to-date with the 
latest research literature from the world's most prestigious scientific 
journals.

CC Search/Social and Behavioral Sciences

In response to your requests, the subject concentration has been 
re-focused emphasizing the social and behavioral sciences. We are 
expanding our coverage of key journals in the following areas which will 
improve the breadth of the database:

Psychology	Psychiatry	Sociology 
Social Work	Communication	Women's Studies 
Health Policy	Public Health	Education

To reduce the emphasis on non-related subject areas, coverage 
will be eliminated in: Law, Business, Linguistics, Geography, History, 
and Planning & Development.

CC Search/Engineering, Technology, and Applied Sciences

To better represent the new focus of the database, we've changed 
the name to CC/Engineering, Computing & Technology (CC/EC&T)

Coverage is being enhanced with the addition of 200 new titles. 
Most subject areas are being enhanced, with special emphasis on:

Materials	       Electrical & Electronics Engineering 
Chemical Engineering   Computer Technology, Applications & 
                       Engineering

... We hope that these product enhancements will provide researchers with 
more in depth coverage of the areas most important to their research.
                                *****</I>
</PRE><P>

Supplemental journal lists for each 'coverage refinement' were supplied 
by ISI.  As these are long documents, it is proposed that CIS will 
include them in its Current Contents documentation on the Web early in 1995.<P>

<H3><B>SIM Help Request Procedures</B>
</H3><P>
Two Help Desks are available for CSIRO  users of various products and
software.  For SIM users, both the ITSB and CIS Help Desks are available.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <B>ITSB Help Desk</B> provides help with software installation and
implementation, and telecommunications and network problems.  It may be
contacted on phone number<B> (06) 276 6666</B>, or email  <B>helpdesk@its.csiro.au</B><BR>
However, your initial contact should be your sysman.<P>

<LI>The <B>CIS Help Desk</B> provides help on SIM searching techniques (PC, WWW and
command line interfaces), and issues relating to database content.  It may be
contacted on phone <B>1800 810 729</B>, or<B> (03) 418 7222</B>, or email
<B>cis.helpdesk@cis.csiro.au</B></UL>
<P>
If in doubt about which help desk to approach, contact either one; staff
will log your request and forward it to the appropriate skill group.
Both Help Desks use the same software for logging queries, and
information is shared between Help Desk staff and skill group members in
a common database.<P>
For queries directed to the CIS help Desk, it would be helpful if the
following information could be provided when  you lodge your query:<P>
<UL>
<LI>SIM interface being used (PC, WWW or CLI);
<LI>database(s) searched
<LI>brief description of the problem, including what you were trying to do
<LI>number (and text if possible) of any SIM error message received
</UL>
<P>
Copies of your search strategy are useful, indeed necessary, in many 
cases.   Please fax or email these to us after you have logged your query.<P>
Your query will be answered straight away, if possible, by staff on help
desk duty.  If the staff member on duty is unable to answer it, the query
will be passed on to a search analyst in the SIM Support Group, for response 
as soon as possible.<P>
Help requests and solutions of an urgent nature, or general interest,
will be documented and distributed via the SIMulcasts newsletter and the 
SIM-USER listserver.<P>

<h2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</h2>



<h3>9 August 1995</h3><P>



<hr>







<h3>I. RHEOLOGY NOT THEOLOGY</h3><P>







If you are interested in rheology, you will be fascinated to learn that in some <I>Current Contents</I> records in SIM the word 'theology' (or 'theological', etc) appears instead of 'rheology' (or 'rheological', etc).<P>







It seems that around 560 records are affected (as at 8 August 1995).<P>  







In over 300 of these 560 records, although 'theo...' is used in many places, the word 'rheology' or a word with the stem 'rheo' does also appear somewhere in the record.  These records WOULD BE RETRIEVED by a search for word containing or starting with 'rheo' ('rheo?' or '?rheo?').<P>







Unfortunately in the other records (about 250) that have 'theo...' substituted for 'rheo...', there are NO occurrences of a word with the stem 'rheo...'.  These are records which are not concerned with theology, religion or philosophy at all and in which the 'theo...' is clearly incorrect.  The mistakes occur in titles, abstracts and keywords.  These records WILL NEVER BE RETRIEVED in a search for words containing or starting with the letters 'rheo'.  Unhappily, these records may contain the very information a scientist needs.  <P>







The errors are in the <I>Current Contents</I> data when CSIRO receives it and processes it for dissemination via SIM.  We have advised the publisher of the errors and will let you know if there is a response and whether or not we can amend the source data.<P>







In the meantime, if you are interested in rheology and wish to look at the 250-plus 'errant' records in the CC database, use this search strategy:<P>



<DL>



<DT><pre>s1  FIND theol?</pre>







<DD>		(this finds all records with the stem 'theol')<P>







<DT><pre>s2  FIND ?rheo?</pre>







<DD>	(this finds all word containing or starting with the string 'rheo')<P>







<DT><pre>s3  FIND S1 not S2</pre>



<DD>	(this finds all records containing 'theol...' which don't also include words containing 'rheo...')<P>







<DT><pre>s4  FIND ccedition=beha?</pre> 



<DD>(this finds all records in the 'behavioural sciences' subset of CC - covering philosophy, history, psychology, theology, etc)<P>







<DT><pre>s5  FIND s3 not s4</pre>



<DD>	(the result is all records containing the word 'theol...' that are not in the behavioural subset.  There are 261 records (as at 8 August 1995) - in 8 of these the word 'theo...' is correct (though the abstracts are not classified in the behavioural subset) - the remaining 253 are the records in which 'theo...' should read 'rheo...'.)<P>



</dl>



Note: hits (number of records) will change with time as more data is



added to CC - for example, the CC load of 9 August (issue 33 of 1995)



contains an additional 11 records which will be retrieved with the



search strategy set out above.<P>







My thanks to Evalyn Beaumont and a scientist at the Division of Minerals in Perth who initially noticed errors and drew them to my attention.  Such feedback is always welcomed by the SIM Management Team.<P>

I. Logging on to SIMWWW 1.3 for the first time<BR>
II. Individual userids for SIMWWW users

<P><B>I. Logging on to SIMWWW 1.3 for the first time</B>

<P>When you first logon to the new SIMWWW gateway, you should configure your preferences, especially the one which related to your computing environment. To do this:

<P>1. Click on the C icon

<P>2. The User Configuration screen will open.

<P>3. Under the heading Default File Format, choose the option that is 
appropriate to your environment.  For example, if you use the SIMWWW with 
a Mac, click on the MAC text option. This will ensure that files that 
you save to disk, etc are in the correct text format.

<P>4. Select any other configuration options you wish to implement.

<P>5. Click the Save Changes button to implement the changes you have selected.

<P>PLEASE NOTE: if you are using a generic userid the changes you implement will affect everyone who uses that userid.  

<P><B>II. Saved search strategies in SIMMWWW</B>

<P>SIMWWW users are aware that saved search strategies are saved on the SIM server rather than on the local workstation.  This means that whoever 
logs on with a generic userid can recall, run or delete any search 
strategy saved under that userid.  In the new SIMWWW the saved searches 
may also be edited.

<P>We aware that privacy and security of saved searches is an issue for some SIMWWW users, therefore it is now possible to request an individual 
userid for access to SIM.  If you log on to SIM with your own userid any 
searches you save will be accessible by you only, and by no-one else.

<P>SIMWWW users who wish to have their own <a
href="http://www.csiro.au/computing/helpdesk/userrego.htm">SIM userid</a> 
may request one from the ITSB helpdesk.  Please complete the SIM userid 
request form.

<h4>Contents:</h4>
I. Saving searches<br>
II. SDI saves<br>
III. Rerunning a saved search or SDI<br>
IV. Editing a saved search<br>
V. Deleting a saved search
<p><b>Saving searches</b>
<p>You can save a database search strategy (without the retrieved 
records) and quickly recall and repeat the search at a later date.  The 
search is saved by SIM.
<p>To save a search strategy:
<ol>
<li>Select the result sets in the 'Search Result Sets' form. (If the 
search 
strategy you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you 
must save all the search results that comprise the final result.)
<li>Select the <b>Save</b> radio button in the 'Search Strategy' line, 
and click the 'Process' button. The Save Strategy File screen will open.
<li>Enter a name for the saved search in the 'Save to File' box, and 
click the 
'Save' button.
</ol>
<p>If you want to overwrite a saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.
<a name=SDI></a>
<p><b>SDI saves</b>
<p> An SDI, or Selective Dissemination of Information, search is one that 
is 
time stamped.  When the search is run subsequently, only records added to 
the database since the last search are returned.
<p>To save an SDI search:
<ol>
<li>Select the result sets in the 'Search Result Sets' form. (If the 
search 
strategy you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you 
must save all the search results that comprise the final result.)
<li>Select the <b>Save</b> radio button in the 'Search Strategy' line and 
click the 'Process' button. The Save Strategy File screen will open.
<li>Enter a name for the saved search in the 'Save to File' box.
<li>Check the SDI box, and click the 'Save' button. The search will be 
saved 
with a set 0 (S0) line showing the creattime (time stamp of the last time 
the 
search was run).
</ol>
<p>If you want to overwrite a saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.
<p>SDI searches may only be run in the database in which they were 
entered and saved.
<p><b>Rerunning a saved search or SDI</b>
<p>Saved searches or SDI searches may be run in this way:
<ol>
<li>Click the Find Saves icon (the second FIND icon) to open the Saved 
Search Form.
<li>Select your saved search. 
<li>Click the <b>Load</b> radio button, then the 'Process' button.
</ol>
<p>The search will be executed and the sets will appear in the Search 
Result 
Sets screen or Summarize screen, depending on how SIMWWW is configured 
with your userid. Work with your result sets in the usual way. You do not 
need to re-save a search each time you run it.
<p><b>Editing a saved search</b>
<p>Saved searches or SDI searches may be edited in the Saved Search 
screen:
<ol>
<li>Select your saved search.
<li>Click the <b>Edit</b> radio button. The search strategy will appear.
<li>Position the mouse pointer (cursor) in the appropriate place, and add 
or 
delete text as you wish. If the search is an SDI search, make sure you do 
not 
delete set 0 (S0).
<li>Click the 'Save' button to save it under the same name or type in a 
new 
name in the 'File Name' box to save it under another name. (You may want 
to 
add the letters sdi to the end of your file name as SIM does not 
automatically 
do this).
</ol>
<p><b>Deleting a saved search</b>
<p>To delete unwanted saved search strategies:
<ol>
<li>Click on the 'Find Saves' icon.
<li>Click the Saved Search' icon.
<li>Select the search or searches to be deleted and click the 
<b>Delete</b> 
radio button.
<li>Click the 'Process' button to perform this operation.

R051    234    Fixed the bug that SGML viewer in PCI displayed off      
               screen when moving the PCI toolbar up that the top of    
               it was above the screen.

G390    202    Installation manual is misleading. Within Volume 3 -     
               SIM Configuration Manual - Creating a DBS Configuration  
               File, according to the manual, the simcreatedbs script   
               would ask some questions when it was run. This was       
               misleading as it would only ask questions if the user    
               was not logged on as sim. Otherwise,  it would run       
               silently.  Now the manual has been modified to reflect   
               what the script actually does.                           

G426    214    Fixed the problem that hypertext links did not work in   
               INFO database.  This problem was due to PS files being   
               stored in the DB, but not available as BMP files.

R059           Fixed the problem that it took long time to evaluate a   
               recnum query over a large database.                      

        108    Fixed bug in interactive index updating code which       
               could cause the index                                    
               to be corrupted.                                         

G355    174    The stemming algorithm has now been documented in the    
               CLI Manual.                                              

R102    253    The documentation of the DDL DELETE command was          
               incorrectly stating the syntax of the command was DDL    
               DELETE DB &quot;foo&quot; when it is in fact DDL DELETE &quot;foo&quot;.     
               The documentation has been modified to reflect the real  
               command.                                                 
               Also after a database was deleted the BASE command was   
               still showing the number of records in the deleted       
               database as the number prior to deleting the database.   
               This bug has been fixed.                                 

R105    254    There was an error in the DDL DROP MAP RECSTRUCT         
               example in Volume 4 of the manual set. This has been     
               corrected.                                               

R068           Put default FSM files in the server's configuration      
               directory.  Hence removed the error messages that were   
               displayed when the server started up.

G250           Fixed the bug that SIM PCI could not summarise if the S  
               element set contained non SGML text.  Changed the INFO   
               database and introduced a virtual SGML field containing  
               the database info.                                       

R106    256    Fixed the bug which caused the database server to core   
               dump when passing an invalid database name to EDIT       
               INSERT command. Modified the documentation to indicate   
               that a database name may optionally be specified.        

G433           The DDL ALTER ORGANISATION command incorrectly allowed   
               the address field to contain newline characters. The     
               result was that the organisations flat file became       
               corrupted. This has now been fixed all newlines in       
               organisation descriptions are mapped to spaces.          

G145           Fixed a memory leak in the code for processing MARC      
               records.                                                 

G260           Fixed the problem which happened when siminitdbs         
               creates all the databases. It left the Stylesheets       
               database permissions so that DBA's could not update it.  

R075           Fixed a problem that caused time limited licences to     
               fail if the site was not in the Australia/Melbourne      
               time zone.                                               

G295           Fixed the bug which allowed DBA create a user name with  
               ``bad'' characters such as ``\verb#\n#'' in it. Now all  
               newlines are mapped to spaces.                           

R044    232    Fixed the problem when searching some terms in SGML      
               PCDATA in combination with anything that was not PCDATA  
               (e.g. modification times or attribute values) which      
               caused the search terms were not to be highlighted.      

G073           Fixed the bug that FIND ````'''' did not work.           

G249           Fixed the bug which ignored lens size sometimes in       
               Fisheye TOC.                                             

G299           Fixed the bug which occurred when building the table of  
               content (TOC), If some records that the TOC was          
               pointing to do not exist, the SIMDBS kept growing until  
               it ran out of memory.

R122           The SGML parser could hang in some cases when an SGML    
               comment was opened but not closed before the end of the  
               document. This problem has been fixed.                   

G193           Fixed the bug that default values for element            
               attributes did not always work.                          

G447           Fixed the problem that the SGML parser did not support   
               element model groups that use the AND connector.         

G446           Fixed the problem that there was no support for          
               processing instructions. The parser now treats the       
               instructions like comments.                              

G445           Fixed the bug which occurred if the parameter entity     
               reference was followed by further attribute              
               definitions.  Now the parameter entity references can    
               be placed anywhere in the attlist declaration.           

G294           Fixed the bug that simsgmlc did not advise of a          
               successful parse.

R105    254    The DDL command for creating a database now includes a   
               reference to the section of the CLI administration       
               manual describing how to create database information     
               records for the INFO database.                           

G423           When doing edit updates, SIMCLI attempted to write its   
               temporary files to ./tmp which did not exist. This bug   
               has now been fixed.                                      

R116           Removed the blank lines that were displayed between      
               each of the legal servers when running simcli xyz        
               (unknown server).                                        

G397           Fixed the memory access problem which made the SIMCLI    
G398           core dump after failing to insert a record into          
               database.                                                

G337           Changed the field name, basename/info, of the Info       
               Database index from WORD to PHRASE in case there is      
               more than one word in the database name.                 

G186           When doing an EDIT UPDATE, the SIMCLI wrote out the      
               record in BLU format. However, if the field names were   
               reserved words, or had special characters in it, the     
               CLI did not put quotes around the field names. This      
               would cause a syntax error when reading the file back    
               in from the editor.  This problem is now fixed.          

G321           Corrected the CLI error message E1816.                   

G99            Fixed the bug which did not display an error message     
               when trying to do EDIT UPDATE but failed to find the     
               edit program, simclied.

               sets exist.

R127           Modified the function calls to simwww urlsafe in the     
               CSIRO gateway.                                           

R111           Added descriptions about how the gateway uses DTDs into

               SIM\_DTD\_PATH to the configuration directory.           

R104           In the CSIRO gateway, if the element set \bf S of a      
               database was not defined, it would fail to display the   
               summary list of a search. The error message displayed    
               was \em There are no records to summarise. The result    
               set is empty. This message was misleading as the result  
               set was not empty.  Now this error message has been      
               changed to as \em Failed to retrieve any records using   
               set name ''S''.

               error occured in a stylesheet.                           

G401           Changed the way that billing information was displayed.  
               If bill zero, output ``There was no charge for this      
               session''. Connection time is always displayed.

G315    c122   The  PCI returned error of &quot;Illegal function call&quot; when  
               all other active Windows applications were minimised,    
               but not when some were fullscreeen, or reduced-screen.   
               This bug was due to setting focus to a closed window     
               and is now fixed.                                        

G393    203    Fixed the problem that a dtd was not downloaded when     
               installing SIMPCI.                                       

G394    204    Fixed the bug that colour dropped out in SIMPCI toolbar  
               and db selection form.

G396    206    Fixed the bug about the width and behaviour of Text      
               Viewer window with databases that are using table of     
               content support.  Now it is able to prevent the viewer   
               resizing based on the CCL form position.                 

G206    c095   Fixed the bug which occured when searching for multiple  
               terms in a secondary index.  Now brackets are used to    
               surround the multiple terms.

R051    234    Fixed the bug that SGML viewer in PCI displayed off      
               screen when moving the PCI toolbar up that the top of

G390    202    Installation manual is misleading. Within Volume 3 -     
               SIM Configuration Manual - Creating a DBS Configuration  
               File, according to the manual, the simcreatedbs script   
               would ask some questions when it was run. This was       
               misleading as it would only ask questions if the user    
               was not logged on as sim. Otherwise,  it would run       
               silently.  Now the manual has been modified to reflect   
               what the script actually does.                           

G426    214    Fixed the problem that hypertext links did not work in   
               INFO database.  This problem was due to PS files being   
               stored in the DB, but not available as BMP files.

R059           Fixed the problem that it took long time to evaluate a   
               recnum query over a large database.                      

        108    Fixed bug in interactive index updating code which       
               could cause the index                                    
               to be corrupted.                                         

G355    174    The stemming algorithm has now been documented in the    
               CLI Manual.                                              

R102    253    The documentation of the DDL DELETE command was          
               incorrectly stating the syntax of the command was DDL    
               DELETE DB &quot;foo&quot; when it is in fact DDL DELETE &quot;foo&quot;.     
               The documentation has been modified to reflect the real  
               command.                                                 
               Also after a database was deleted the BASE command was   
               still showing the number of records in the deleted       
               database as the number prior to deleting the database.   
               This bug has been fixed.                                 

R105    254    There was an error in the DDL DROP MAP RECSTRUCT         
               example in Volume 4 of the manual set. This has been     
               corrected.                                               

R068           Put default FSM files in the server's configuration      
               directory.  Hence removed the error messages that were   
               displayed when the server started up.

G250           Fixed the bug that SIM PCI could not summarise if the S  
               element set contained non SGML text.  Changed the INFO   
               database and introduced a virtual SGML field containing  
               the database info.                                       

R106    256    Fixed the bug which caused the database server to core   
               dump when passing an invalid database name to EDIT       
               INSERT command. Modified the documentation to indicate   
               that a database name may optionally be specified.        

G433           The DDL ALTER ORGANISATION command incorrectly allowed   
               the address field to contain newline characters. The     
               result was that the organisations flat file became       
               corrupted. This has now been fixed all newlines in       
               organisation descriptions are mapped to spaces.          

G145           Fixed a memory leak in the code for processing MARC      
               records.                                                 

G260           Fixed the problem which happened when siminitdbs         
               creates all the databases. It left the Stylesheets       
               database permissions so that DBA's could not update it.  

R075           Fixed a problem that caused time limited licences to     
               fail if the site was not in the Australia/Melbourne      
               time zone.                                               

G295           Fixed the bug which allowed DBA create a user name with  
               ``bad'' characters such as ``\verb#\n#'' in it. Now all  
               newlines are mapped to spaces.                           

R044    232    Fixed the problem when searching some terms in SGML      
               PCDATA in combination with anything that was not PCDATA  
               (e.g. modification times or attribute values) which      
               caused the search terms were not to be highlighted.      

G073           Fixed the bug that FIND ````'''' did not work.           

G249           Fixed the bug which ignored lens size sometimes in       
               Fisheye TOC.                                             

G299           Fixed the bug which occurred when building the table of  
               content (TOC), If some records that the TOC was          
               pointing to do not exist, the SIMDBS kept growing until  
               it ran out of memory.

R122           The SGML parser could hang in some cases when an SGML    
               comment was opened but not closed before the end of the  
               document. This problem has been fixed.                   

G193           Fixed the bug that default values for element            
               attributes did not always work.                          

G447           Fixed the problem that the SGML parser did not support   
               element model groups that use the AND connector.         

G446           Fixed the problem that there was no support for          
               processing instructions. The parser now treats the       
               instructions like comments.                              

G445           Fixed the bug which occurred if the parameter entity     
               reference was followed by further attribute              
               definitions.  Now the parameter entity references can    
               be placed anywhere in the attlist declaration.           

G294           Fixed the bug that simsgmlc did not advise of a          
               successful parse.

R105    254    The DDL command for creating a database now includes a   
               reference to the section of the CLI administration       
               manual describing how to create database information     
               records for the INFO database.                           

G423           When doing edit updates, SIMCLI attempted to write its   
               temporary files to ./tmp which did not exist. This bug   
               has now been fixed.                                      

R116           Removed the blank lines that were displayed between      
               each of the legal servers when running simcli xyz        
               (unknown server).                                        

G397           Fixed the memory access problem which made the SIMCLI    
G398           core dump after failing to insert a record into          
               database.                                                

G337           Changed the field name, basename/info, of the Info       
               Database index from WORD to PHRASE in case there is      
               more than one word in the database name.                 

G186           When doing an EDIT UPDATE, the SIMCLI wrote out the      
               record in BLU format. However, if the field names were   
               reserved words, or had special characters in it, the     
               CLI did not put quotes around the field names. This      
               would cause a syntax error when reading the file back    
               in from the editor.  This problem is now fixed.          

G321           Corrected the CLI error message E1816.                   

G99            Fixed the bug which did not display an error message     
               when trying to do EDIT UPDATE but failed to find the     
               edit program, simclied.                                  

G306    119    Fixed the EDIT bug with edit update r=1 when no result   
               sets exist.                                              

G322           Fixed the bug that the program siminsty displayed an     
               incomplete usage message.

R127           Modified the function calls to simwww urlsafe in the     
               CSIRO gateway.                                           

R111           Added descriptions about how the gateway uses DTDs into  
               SIM WWWGW manual.  Modified siminitwwwcsiro to set       
               SIM\_DTD\_PATH to the configuration directory.           

R104           In the CSIRO gateway, if the element set \bf S of a      
               database was not defined, it would fail to display the   
               summary list of a search. The error message displayed    
               was \em There are no records to summarise. The result    
               set is empty. This message was misleading as the result  
               set was not empty.  Now this error message has been      
               changed to as \em Failed to retrieve any records using

               error occured in a stylesheet.                           

G401           Changed the way that billing information was displayed.  
               If bill zero, output ``There was no charge for this      
               session''. Connection time is always displayed.          

R066    242    Fixed the bug that simwww urlsafe did not convert        
               spaces into \verb#20#.                                   

R047    238    Fixed a bug in saving search histories.  Now only        
               highlighted items are saved.  If no item is selected,    
               all current histories will be saved.

<title>CLASSIFICATION SCHEME USED</title>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h2>CLASSIFICATION SCHEME USED</h2>
Robert Ho<br>
<i>22 Feb 1996</i>
<P>
Dear All,<br>
<p>
In the Voyager system, when holdings records are created, there is a<br>
facility to default your classification to the scheme you use in your<br>
library.  It normally will take the classification data (Tag 050, 080 or<br>
082) from the bibliographic record if these are present.  If the chosen<br>
default scheme is not present, the system will not generate the call
number<br>
automatically.<br>
<p>
At the moment, the generic scheme is Library of Congress Classification.<br>
This will cause problem for us who are not using this classification
scheme.  <br>
<p>
Voyager provides a selection of five classification schemes: Library of<br>
Congress, Dewey Decimal, National Library of Medicine, Superintendent of<br>
Documents and other.  <br>
<p>
For CSIRO, if you want to make use of this default facility, you have to<br>
inform Michele the classification scheme you are using so that the data
can<br>
be input through the system administration establishment.<br>
<p>
For Dewey users, there is no problem.  <br>
<p>
For UDC users, we are using Other as selected scheme - very unlikely that<br>
there are many records with Tag 080 and so mostly you will have to input
the<br>
call number yourselves.  Even if there is Tag 080, I am not sure if there
is<br>
a link between default and the tag.<br>
<p>
For ODC user, we are also using other as selected scheme - this will be
the<br>
same as for UDC.<br>
<p>
If you do not reply by the time, we shall use the information from the<br>
current Tag 966 indicator 2.  You can elect NOT to use this default<br>
facility, then you will have to have an extra step in your holdings
records<br>
creation.<br>
<p>
<p>
Please reply by COB Monday 26 February, 1996.<br>
<p>
Sorry for the late request.<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
<p>
Robert<br>

<Title>Records in Geac work file</title>

Subject: RECORDS IN GEAC WORK FILE<p>

Dear All,<p>

In the recent CUG meeting I drew the attention to the existence of records
in the Work file and their relation to the migration to the new system.
<p>
The following is a paper outlining the treatment of such as considered and
discussed by the Project Team.
<p>
Please contact me if you need any further information.
<p>
Regards,
<p>
Robert
<HR>
<B>BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS IN WORK FILE</B>
<p>
This is to inform the Network on the anticipated migration of cataloguing
data (bibliographic and holdings records) from GEAC to the Voyager system.
<p>
<B>BACKGROUND</B><p>

The GEAC system has three files of records
<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Core file</B> - records that are fully validated and the data are
available in OPAC
<LI><B>Work file</B> - records that are either new to the database (mainly
from ABN downloading and local input waiting for validation or transfer
to the Core file) or records moved from the Core file for various reasons
and are either waiting for return to Core or 'forgotten'
<LI><B>Holdings file</B> - records which are attached to the bibliographic
records and contain the holdings information
</UL>
Number of records in the Work file: 4462 (in MARCVIEW file June 1995)
<p>
Work file records could be
<UL>
<LI>new records downloaded from ABN and no action has been taken
<LI>existing records already in Core file but moved to Work file during
loading of ABN holdings information - only holdings records Accepted and
bibliographic records left in the PSP (postpone) status; holdings added to
wrong record during matching (similar ISBN, wrong BCN,etc.)
<LI>new records which have been created locally
<LI>existing records being updated
</UL>
<P>
When preparing for the migration of bibliographic and holdings data to the
new system, there is no problem with those records that are already in the
Core file and those which exist in both Work and Core files.  The holding
records attached to these records will have matching bibliographic records
in the new system.
<P>
Those records in the Work file which have either the PSP or ACC status
require action.  All these records are at present not accessible in OPAC and
are only available in BPS.
<P>
<B>ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN</B>
<P>
After much consideration and discussion, The Project Team has decided to
migrate only Core records to Voyager. This will make the new cataloguing
module much cleaner than at present. All records remaining in the Geac Work
file will NOT be migrated to Voyager. Therefore it is necessary for
Librarians to ensure all important Work records are processed so that they
reside in the Core file ready for migration to Voyager.
<P>
<B>ACTION :</B>
<P>
<DL><DT><B>That all records remaining in the Geac Work file after 'no more
cataloguing allowed' will NOT be converted and NOT migrated to the new
system.</B>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the libraries concerned to make records
available in OPAC.  It  is, therefore,  advisable to work on as many records
as possible before the conversion process.
<P>
To facilitate this cleaning up process, a new MARCVIEW database based on the
Geac Work file will be made available from the Library System Group, ITSB.
The new MARCVIEW program and data (extracted on 27/06/95) can be obtained
from Commsun and are residing within a sub-directory of the library
directory. The library directory can be accessed via the csiroftp login.
(As per CLASS) For any assistance call Lisa on the CLINES Help Desk or email
lisa@cis.csiro.au
<P>
This MARCVIEW database contains all records that are in the Work file at the
time of extraction.  Search process is via the Book location code, serial or
other formats and the presence of cataloguing date ($z).  The last
criteria is to help to reduce the number of records to be checked by those
libraries which have added such data in the holdings information field.
<P>
Divisional cataloguers can obtain a copy of MARCVIEW to identify Work
records that require attention.   Except for some libraries which have
exceptional high occurrences (over 100) in the database, the average number
of records in the work file is 25 per book location for monographs and 14
for serials.
</DL>
<P>
<B>ACTION :</B>
<P>
<DL><DT><B>That a determined effort be made to clean up the Work file. This
process can be achieved by using MARCVIEW as a guide to identify the
records in the Work file. Then modify those records as necessary, ready
for transfer to the Core file before the close off date.</B>
<P>
Any Divisional Libraries concerned about this process should contact
Robert Ho.
</DL>
<P><P>
<B>Proposed process for migration of bibliographic and holdings data to
the new system:</B>
<P>
<OL>
<B><LI></B>The database will be closed approximately four weeks before the
live date of Voyager, that is, last work-to-core operation is four weeks
before live date. This is the close off date.
<B><LI></B>Last load of ABN records will be approximately 7-10 days before
close off date (depending on the receipt of tape from ABN).  All records
(new and PSP records from this load) are expected to be in the Core file
before close off date.
<B><LI></B>All ABN records will be stockpiled for loading to the new system
from
about six weeks before live date.   These records will be in USMARC format.

<!-- Coded by Irving Chin 4 Dec 1996-->

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">

<TABLE  cellpadding=4 border=3>

<TH ALIGN="left">Task</TH><TH>Performance</TH><TH>Work- around, if 
necessary</TH>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Create pattern templates to cope with all
titles</TD> <TD>Most possibilities can be catered for. There is a
problem with dates issues are expected for  patterns based on any 
frequency more often than monthly. Slight errors in the other frequencies 
would cause no problem. Huge problems are created with all frequencies if 
date first  issue expected = 1st of a month. &quot;Bypass 
prediction&quot; doesn't seem to work as the help file would have us 
expect.</TD><TD valign=top>Where an accurate pattern is impossible (eg 
Science),  can &quot;close&quot; on volume completion, then set up again</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Set up a title to checkin</TD>
<TD>Easy, once the templates are created.  How to set the claim
period (ie how overdue to let an issue get) isn't obvious. (It  is in the 
line item defaults box). This cannot be edited in an approved order.</TD>
<TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>Create &quot;notes&quot; for some titles eg
Circ to:, Notify NEP on receipt ...</TD><TD valign=top>Very nice facility
for this. </TD> <TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Receive an issue - normal</TD>
<TD>Easy, but a lot of clicking. I would like to see the window
which appears after &quot;accept&quot; NOT hide the issue expected  
information. There still is a chance to opt out at this stage &amp; 
avoid an irretrievable error.  Being able to see the issue information 
would help. The window CAN however be  dragged. Enhancement request : 
that clicking be cut down, and that details of issue being received are 
visible at &quot;receive&quot;.</TD>
<TD valign=top>Macros save clicks, but not time</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Receive an issue when one &quot;skipped&quot;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Easy</TD> <TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>Receive a &quot;skipped&quot; issue</TD>
<TD>Easy, and the issue is automatically removed from the Problems
list, or Claim list (if a claim has been  generated)</TD>
<TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Receive a combined issue</TD>
<TD valign=top>Possible, but need to concentrate. Cannot delete the 'next
expected'. Edit the one in hand, delete the following issue,  then 
receive the one in hand.  Also,  when &quot;changing&quot; expected issue 
info, unless you copy/paste, have to type all data. Enhancement request - 
that deletion of next expected be  possible, and when 
&quot;changing&quot; an issue, the data stays put for editing?</TD><TD 
align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>Receive a separate index, supplement, special issue</TD>
<TD valign=top>These can be set up as a separate component
(&amp; hence have claims produced if  overdue), or simply 'add' an issue 
when it arrives </TD><TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>Edit &quot;next expected&quot; issue info,
or date expected </TD> <TD valign=top>Possible, but changes don't carry down
the line (as in Geac)</TD> <TD valign=top>If change is  substantial, close
pattern &amp; set up again</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Claim a skipped issue, or issue damaged on
receipt</TD> <TD valign=top>&quot;system claim&quot; is applied automatically
to skipped issues. A damaged issue is &quot;marked&quot;  &quot;claim&quot;.
Claims are then &quot;generated&quot; via Problem list. I would like to 
see the Problem list and Claim list searchable by location. Problems can be 
searched by operator ID, but  Claims not by anything location specific. 
(Enhancement request?).  Output for these types of claims has been 
produced by Hans, and contains all essential data elements. It comes in  
the form of data to merge with a mail merge document in MS Word. (as with 
Circulation notices). This file can be printed for faxing, or snail-mail, 
or the data copy/pasted to an  email.</TD>
<TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Claim an overdue issue</TD>
<TD valign=top>I haven't been able to get the system to provide alerts for
anything  overdue. </TD> <TD valign=top>Do whatever we've been doing since
Geac closed to cope with this.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Make claims after checking in</TD>
<TD valign=top>Issues discovered to be faulty AFTER receipt are a problem.
Receipts cannot be changed into claims. Nor can  they be deleted.</TD>
<TD valign=top>For issues already received before it is know a claim 
needs to be made, &quot;add&quot; an issue with identical information. 
Create a claim for this, and when it  arrives, remove this issue. Note 
could be used as a reminder. The claim however remains forever, without 
any issue information.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Subsequent claims</TD><TD valign=top>The system appears to 
be &quot;trying&quot; here, but nothing works. &quot;Subsequent 
claim&quot; is a &quot;search by&quot; option in Claim list. Also in  
Claim list is a button &quot;update claim&quot;, which remembers 
nothing put in a claim via this. The &quot;generate claim&quot; button 
results in a &quot;failed&quot; message every time.</TD> <TD 
valign=top>Maintain  records of claims in the checkin note facility.  For 
overdue things, cope as since Geac closed.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Delete a claim (e.g. because the issue
doesn't exist, is O/P or the prediction pattern was faulty)</TD>
<TD valign=top>Cannot do this in Voyager.</TD> <TD valign=top>Delete  the
issue via checkin - &quot;edit pattern&quot;, &quot;remove&quot;. The claim
remains in the system with no issue information.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Adjust details of issues after receipt, or &quot;mark&quot;
with a code eg 'deleted', 'missing'.</TD><TD valign=top>Cannot touch
received issues. Enhancement request?</TD> 
<TD valign=top>Record in &quot;note&quot;, and when/if  later version allows
this, fix things then. The popup note could become a pain.</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Change publication pattern</TD>
<TD valign=top>Easy. &quot;close&quot; the current one, select this SAME 
one &amp; set up again. (I wasted heaps of time here. Do NOT  close, then 
add a new component)</TD> <TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD valign=top>Choose issues to display in opac</TD>
<TD valign=top>The default is ALL ISSUES DISPLAY.  Click 'history', then
click issues as required for display or non- display. Adds to the 
clicking load at checkin time but we can't allow ALL issues to display in 
our multi-library system. Need a rule ... Also, enhancement request for a 
configurable  default ?</TD>
<TD align=middle>---</TD></TR>

<title>Summary of CSIRO library services available via telnet</title>
<body>

<h2>CSIRO Library Services available via telnet</h2>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
A number of telnet accounts have been set to gain access to some specific
services and some general menus.

Some of the menus interlink.<p>

<h3>CSIRO Library System - Voyager</h3>
<p>
To gain access<p>

telnet to<p>

<pre>     host:           library.csiro.au</pre>
<pre>     username:       library</pre>
<pre>     password:       no password</pre>


<h3>Menu of Libraries and Services</h3><p>

This includes all services that were previously available via the 
"megapac menu" and some extras.<p>

Some of the services available via this menu are:<p>

<dl>
<dd>CSIRO library
<dd>ABN 
<dd>Dialog
<dd>Ilanet
<dd>STN
<dd>CARL UnCover
</dl>


To gain access<p>

telnet to<p>

<pre>     host:           library.csiro.au</pre>
<pre>     username:       csirolib</pre>
<pre>     password:       no password</pre>




<h3>Hytelnet</h3>

To gain access<p>

telnet to<p>

<pre>     host:           library.csiro.au</pre>
<pre>     username:       hytel</pre>
<pre>     password:       no password</pre>



<h3>CSIRO's Public Access Gopher and Library menu</h3>

This offers access to a very minimal gopher, intended to get people 
started on gopher (before having access to the gopher software from their 
own site) using option 1 of the given menu.  The second option on the menu
gives access to the previously mentioned Library and Services Menu.<p>

To gain access<p>

telnet to<p>

<pre>     host:           library.csiro.au</pre>
<pre>     username:       info</pre>
<pre>     password:       no password</pre> 

<h3>Summary</h3>

I'd think that the account csirolib that gives access to a Menu of 
Libraries and Services is the best menu overall as it gives access to all 
the services in one go.<p>

If you use a specific service exclusively then you may use the "library", 
"austral", or "hytel" accounts.<p>

Any questions or comments please contact me.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL><DL><DD><FONT SIZE=5><B>Templates for Division home 
page</B></FONT>
<P>
<H3>Purpose</H3>
<dl><dd>
To provide downloadable templates for divisions to design their own home 
pages for the web.
</dl>
<P>
<b>Example</b>
<P>
<dl><dd>
Here is an <a href="http://www.mst.csiro.au">example</a> of a prototype home 
page design for the <b>Division of Materials Science</b> in Clayton, 
Victoria. Note that it is still under construction and many links are 
inactive.
<br>(This is also <a 
href="http://www.cis.csiro.au:8001/cis/mst/index.htm">mirrored</a> at 
CSIRO Corporate Information Management (CIM), Clayton if you 
cannot get on to the MST site).
<p>The design was done by Melissa Spencer who is a member of a project 
group comprising Nick Pitsas (CSIRO Publishing), Cynthia Love, Irving 
Chin (both CIM) and Wilna Macmillan (Divisional Librarian, Materials 
Science).
<P>
You will notice that the overall design of the web pages adhere to 
certain principles:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The graphics are customised for the Division to reflect its research 
activities e.g. the Division banner and the colour strip
<LI>The use of logical and consistent headings and links to facilitate 
quick and easy access to information about, and for the Division
<LI>Within each web page links are created to facilitate easy follow-on 
to other information
<LI>The amount of information presented in each page is kept to no 
more than two screens full to minimise the need for scrolling
</UL>
</dl>
<H3>How to arrange for your own designs</H3>
<dl><dd>
After viewing the prototype if you are interested in having something 
similar designed for your Division please contact Cynthia Love 
(Project Leader, WWW Information) via <a 
href="mailto:cynthia.love@cis.csiro.au">email</a> or by phone on (03) 
9518 5925.<P>
For those who are interested to try their hands at designing their own 
Divisional home page we have made available here for downloading, 
templates based on the Materials Science prototype.
<P>Please note they include only the basic HTML and image files required 
to build the framework of a Division home page. Further work needs to be done
to enhance the individual web pages.
<P>
Many image files are not included (eg Division banner, geographic maps) 
because they need to be customised for individual divisions. If any Division is 
interested Cynthia Love will arrange for them to be designed and the cost 
will be borne by CIM.

<Title>Downloading Quick Reference Cards</Title>
<H2>Downloading Quick Reference Cards</H2>

You can download the Quick Reference Cards in 2 ways:
<OL>
<LI>Via the web if you have <I>MS Word</I> already installed
<LI>From CCIM FTP server if you do not have <I>MS Word</I>
installed
</OL>
<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Via the web if you have <I>MS Word</I> already installed</B><P>
To use this option you must first ensure that your browser has been
configured to load up <I>MS Word</I> as a helper application after the Word
file is downloaded.
<P>
In Netscape this is achieved by going into the menus for Options, General
Preferences and then Helpers. If your browser has been properly
configured you should see a line in the <I>File type / Action /
Extensions</I> window such as:
<pre>   application/msword      WINWORD      doc</pre>
If your browser has not been properly configured, you should set up a
path to the directory on your local hard disk where your <I>MS Word</I>
program is located. Proceed as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Go into the menus for Options, General Preferences and then Helpers.
<LI>Click on <I>Create New Type</I> button. You will be presented with a
Configure New Mime Type window.
<LI>In the Mime type field, type: application<br
    In the Mime SubType field, type: msword<br>
    Click OK.
<LI>In the File extensions field, type: doc
<LI>In the Action field, activate the Launch the Application button
<LI>Click on the Browse button. You will be presented with a Select an
appropriate viewer window. Scroll through the directory listing of your
local hard disk to the subdirectory where you <I>MS Word</I> program is
installed. Select the program file winword.exe<br>
Click OK.
<LI>The browser is now correctly configured as shown by the lines
<P>
<pre>
     File type               Action       Extensions

     application/msword      WINWORD      doc</pre>
</OL>
<P>
<EM>Depending on the size of the file it may take a while for the file to be
downloaded, <I>MS Word</I> to be loaded, and the contents of the file
displayed on the screen.</EM>
<P>
<B><LI>From CCIM FTP server if you do not have <I>MS Word</I> installed</B>
<P>
If this option is chosen the system prompts you for a location on your
local hard disk to save the Word file. It then downloads the file. You
will then have to locate a machine with <I>MS Word</I> installed, load
up Word, and view/print the file.

<P>
<H3>WWW Information - Project Outline</H3>
<B>Overview of WWW in CSIRO</B><P>
The World Wide Web in CSIRO is now an accepted communications medium. In the
period March 95 - March 96 the CSIRO corporate home page was accessed on
3,763,785  occasions. Of this amount 3,322,219  (88%) were from Australian
domains and  441,566  (12%) were from overseas domains.  Of the Australian
domains 3,030,223 (91%) were from CSIRO.   Divisions have also accepted the
use of WWW as a communication tool. There are 44 servers in CSIRO's  World
Wide Web network, and only two divisions without a server.<br>
<p>
The web is used to disseminate information in the following three ways:<br>
<OL>
<LI>Internally circulated  to our staff;
<LI>Externally  to our various stakeholders; and
<LI>Gathered from external sources for our staff (key Internet resources).
</OL>
<p>
<B>Project Objectives</B><P>
<OL type=A>
<LI>To produce guidelines and standards for best practice in the 
presentation of information
on the World Wide Web
<LI>To maintain and promote the CIM web server
<LI>To establish a system of quality filters for the gathering and use of 
external information
on the web
</OL>
<p>
<B>A. WWW Developers' Toolkit</B><P>
At  present, there is a wide inconsistency in appearance, quality and
quantity of information available on the various divisional servers and in
some divisions there is no information available at all. To assist
Divisions, to bring both the diverse range of information providers together
and to create a WWW environment in CSIRO where there is a consistent level
of information available across the organisation, a <I>WWW Developers 
Toolkit</I>
is being created. This will contain:
<UL>
<LI>Style guide including a set of freely available and customised graphics
and templates;
<LI>Recommendations on how to maintain the information;
<LI>Training package on establishing and maintaining web pages for 
divisional staff; and
<LI>Guidelines on the advantages and liabilities involved in presenting
information electronically.
</UL>
<p>
<a href="webguide.htm">Here</a> is a document containing the 
structure for the guidelines. Feedback on the issues
covered is requested. The guidelines will be a dynamic document on the 
web with links to services and resources throughout. We also intend to 
link in with Divisional guidelines already in place.<P>
Examples of the templates and designs already delivered can be viewed at the
following URL which is our test area:<P>
<DL><DD>
	<a href="http://www.cis.csiro.au:8001">http://www.cis.csiro.au:8001</a>
</DL>
<P>
If you wish to have a template designed please contact me for further 
details.  We have also
developed a training package with the CIM User Support Group which has 
recently been piloted in Plant Industry.<P>
<B>New Corporate Homepage</B><P>
There have been two major pushes to modify the CSIRO homepage:
<OL>
<LI>Increased focus on delivering information to stakeholders,
<LI>Provide improved navigation through CSIRO's vast information.
</OL>
<p>
With the diversity of groups wishing to access CSIRO's WWW information, work
commenced on a new design for the CSIRO homepage. The emphasis in the design
was to make the navigation through the CSIRO WWW information easier by
targeting the audience groups. The design was created by a joint Information
Technology Services/Corporate Information Management/Publishing working
group and  was moved into production on 1st May 1996.
<p>
<B>B. CIM Web Server</B><P>
The CIM web server has been redesigned to accommodate a few changes that
have been happening. Firstly the split in our branch has allowed us more
room to spread out and present more specifically targeted information.
Secondly in order to comply with the designs that we have been promoting, we
have a new design as well. The changes have meant that instead of all
information and services relevant to the Library Network being crammed into
one (now) overcrowded page we can give them headings of their own from the
home page. It has also accommodated other client groups that our projects
have, for example the RMA network and Divisional Publications Officers.
The new server is in our test area and can be viewed at:
<DL><DD>
<a
href="http://www.cis.csiro.au:8001/cim/index.htm">http://www.cis.csiro.au:8001/cim/index.htm</a
>
</DL>
<P>
Comments are welcome. Please bear in mind that it is not finished.
<p>
<B>C. Information Scout</B><P>
There are increasing problems in both the quantity and assuring the quality
of the external links to which we provide access. This ideally  falls into
the professional area of the Library Network.  With the increased use of
electronic journals and developments that are imminent in Voyager with
regard to the 856 field, we are well placed to coordinate quality access to
external resources on the web and provide this access through the library's
catalogue.<P>
The aim is to have a coordinated and professional approach to gathering
information from the Internet for CSIRO use on the Web. The structure for a
Divisional home page should include related sites (other useful www
sites) and most do. The proposal is to offer a "What's new" type of newsbrief
distributed from here which would be a vehicle for sharing new 
information about what's new on the web as well as new ideas from the 
Divisions. <p>
I will hit you with more details on this a bit later. Any comment or 
ideas are welcome.

<h2>Database description</h2>
<a name=DBNAME>
<h3>Database name</h3>
CCPM   -   CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual
<a name=COV>
<h3>Source and Coverage</h3>

<p>The first edition of this manual was published in February 1994 in hard-copy
form and distributed to some 550 selected CSIRO staff. 

<p>The present electronic version, first launched in October 1996, represents
the first revision of this manual and has been made available to some 700
nominated staff members such as Chiefs, Program Managers, Business Managers and
Corporate Managers and Divisional Librarians.

<p><a href="divlibs.htm">Divisional Librarians</a> will be able to initiate searches on behalf
of staff members without personalised access but with a genuine need for
information from the manual.  They will also be able to assist authorised users
within their Division with SIM searches if required.  Each Divisional librarian 
has been supplied with the names of all authorised users within her/his
Division.

<p>While some sections of the manual have changed little since February 1994,
others have been substantially revised and a complete new section on
"Development & commercial exploitation of CSIRO software" has been added. 

<p>However, this version does not yet take into account the recent major
restructure of CSIRO.  The abolition of the Institutes and the introduction of
Alliances and Sectors has caused a number of significant changes in some
commercial practices, in particular in respect of delegations, that are still to
be reflected in the manual.   Thus a further major revision of the manual is
planned for the closing months of 1996.  Nevertheless, the present electronic
edition is a complete replacement of the 1994 edition, which ceases to be an
authoritative source of CSIRO's commercial practices and policies.

<p>The manual was put together with the assistance of staff across CSIRO as a
guide for everyone involved with customer relations and the technology transfer
process.  It lets people know what CSIRO's policies and procedures in respect of
these matters are, and helps them to go about their particular role in a
confident and practical way.

<a href=ccpmdbg2.htm>Sub Section SIMWWW</a>

<a name=BI>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>

<p>The Basic Index of the CCPM database, indexes the entire contents of the
CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual. The basic Index is the default index for searching 
when no index is specified in the search. It is best used when searching for a term(s) across 
the entire CCPM database. 

<p>For example, a user would select the basic index when searching for anything 
to do with  "legislation" within the entire CCPM database.

<h4>Components of the Basic Index</h4>

Two fields make up the Basic Index. They are the Heading field and the Text field. These two fields, 
when combined into the Basic Index, enable the entire database to be searched. The individual fields
which combine to make up the Basic Index can be used to limit a search to specific parts of the database.

<h4>Heading Field</h4>

<p>This field limits the search to words contained in the Section and
Sub-section headings of the CCPM database.  This field may be used to narrow a
search to specific sections of the CCPM database which deal with a certain
topic covered in the CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual. 

<p>For example, a user would select the Heading field when searching for a topic that is covered 
in the CCPM database, like "Trademarks and Business Reputation". 

<h4>Text Field</h4>

<p>This field limits the search to words contained within a Sub Section of the CCPM database. 
This field is best used when searching for a term(s) across the entire CCPM database, that are not headings. 

<h4>RNum Field</h4>

<p>This field is used to define relationships between records within the CCPM database. 
It is not to be used for searching.

<a name=SI>
<h3>Secondary Index</h3>

<h4>Policy Index</h4>

<p>This index will only search for words contained in the Policy Statements
within the CCPM database.  This index may be used to narrow a search to
information contained within policies that are described in the CSIRO Commercial
Practice Manual. 

<p>For example, a user would select the Policy Index when searching for a particular policy that has been defined 
within the CCPM database. Typically, a user would search for a term(s) which relate specifically to a Policy, like "logo" which would return any Policy statement within the CCPM database, which deals with Logos.

<a name=ST>
<h3>Searching tips</h3>

<p>When the Manual was converted into a SIM database, it was subdivided into 20
Sections (excluding the cover and imprint page) containing some 134
sub-sections. Thus a search will retrieve relevant sub-sections which may then be browsed
to locate the pertinent information.

<p>There are three methods available for searching the CCPM database.  You may
search for specific keywords (or combinations of keywords) using the CCL Query Form (icon 3),
you can scan through the list of keywords that are contained in the particular index, or you may consult
the Table of Contents (TOC) window which is a special feature of the full-text
databases in SIM.

<h4>Keyword Search</h4>

<p>A keyword search enables a user to search for a specific term or terms across
the entire CCPM database, individual Section Headings, or Sub-Section Headings. 

<p>The following example concerns a search for procedures dealing with the
assigning of rights for the use of CSIRO's logo via the SIMPCI.

<ul><li>Step 1.  Click on the <img src="findpci.gif"> icon from the SIMPCI toolbar
<p><li>Step 2.  Type the term "logo" in the CCL Query Form window and click the FIND
Button. The Set History window will then be displayed indicating the number of
hits returned for the particular search.

<p><li>Step 3. By double clicking on the result line within the Set History window,
the first relevant record for that particular search will be displayed. <a
href=ccpmdbg1.gif>see SIMPCI Sample Record</a> 
</ul>

<p>If the retrieved record occupies more than one screen, a scroll bar will
appear on the right hand side of the window. Each occurrence of the search term,
in this case "logo", will be highlighted. In addition to the relevant record, SIM
displays a Table of Contents window in which the content heading of the
retrieved record is highlighted.

<h4>Scanning Indexes</h4>

An alternate method of searching for particular keywords within the CCPM database is to 
use the Scan Index Terms option (icon 6). This option lists all terms that correspond to 
each index within the database. 

<p>The following example concerns a search for procedures dealing with the
assigning of rights for the use of CSIRO's logo via the SIMPCI.

<ul><li>Step 1.  Click on the <img src="scanpci.gif"> icon from the SIMPCI toolbar
<p><li>Step 2.  Type the term "logo" in the Scan Index Terms window and click the Scan
Button. Within the main window of the Scan Index terms Window, a alphabetic listing of 
all terms will appear, displaying the term "logo" and the corresponding number of occurances
of the word. <a href=scindex.gif>see SIMPCI Sample Record</a>
<p><li>Step 3. By highlighting the required term(s), and clicking on the Search button, the Set History window will then be displayed indicating the number of hits returned for the particular search.

<p><li>Step 4. By double clicking on the result line within the Set History window,
the first relevant record for that particular search will be displayed. <a
href=ccpmdbg1.gif>see SIMPCI Sample Record</a> 

<h4>Searching via the Table of Contents (TOC)</h4>

<p>SIM generates an automatic table of contents when full text manuals such as
CSIRO Commercial Practice Manual are searched. This allows an alternate method
of navigating through the database. The Table of Contents is made up of
hypertext links, which enable the user to move from the current section of the
manual to another, just by clicking on the associated Section or Sub Section
Heading, rather than searching for a particular term within the database. The
TOC is displayed after an initial keyword search result is displayed. 

<p>In the above example, the first record containing the word "logo" occurred in
Section 5. Intellectual property management, sub-section Trademarks and business
reputation.

<p>Clicking on one of the other sub-section headings in the TOC will immediately
display the corresponding record.  Clicking on a Section heading will retrieve
the table-of-contents record for that section and display all the sub-section
headings for that Section in the TOC. 

<p>The SIM World Wide Web Gateway search interface simulates the SIMPCI interface. The main difference
   is that the TOC is displayed above the record on the WWW, compared to the separate left-side window on the PCI.

<p>See the <a href=ccpmdbg2.htm>SIMWWW Sample Record</a> for the display of
CCPM records in the SIM World Wide Web Gateway.

Stocktake - Sector Stocktake of Research 

<A NAME="COVER"><H3>Coverage</H3></A>

<P>The CSIRO Sector Stocktake of Research database is a collection of all Sector Stocktake 
documents produced by each sector within CSIRO. The purpose of the database is to make 
available information describing the activities of each CSIRO sector. Access to this database is 
restricted to Sector Co-ordinators and other identified users.

<P>Each Stocktake of Research is broken down into a number of  ‘sector chunks’. A ‘sector 
chunk’ specifically describes the corresponding activities according to fourteen topic headings 
identified in the Sector Stocktake Proforma.

<P>Incorporated into each Stocktake of Research, is a four part Sector Outlook Summary, which 
describes the background of the Sector, an outlook specifically for the sector, how CSIRO 
relates to the sector, and also the return to Australia for the effort exerted within the sector.

<A NAME="INFO"><H3>Information Provider</H3></A>

Information for each sector has been supplied by each corresponding Sector Co-ordinator.

<A NAME="SEARCH"><H2>Searching the Database</H2></A>

There are a two primary methods available for searching the Sector Stocktake Database. 
Users may perform a standard “keyword” style search, and also navigate the database via the 
Table of Contents (TOC) window which accompanies all full text databases.

<A NAME="KEYW"><H3>Keyword Search</H3></A>

<B><I>SIMPCI</I></B><BR>
A standard keyword search enables users to search for a specific term across the all 
Stocktakes Sectors of Research within the database. For example, a user may wish to search 
across all sectors to determine which sectors have dealings with BHP:

<P>Step 1. The user would click on the FIND icon <IMG SRC="findpci.gif"> from the SIMPCI toolbar.   This will 
display the CCL Query Form.

<P>Step 2. Insert the query term “bhp” into the CCL Query Form window and press the FIND 
Button. <BR>
<IMG SRC="ccl.gif">
 
<P>Step 3. The Set History window will then be displayed. By double clicking on the set history, 
the first corresponding record will be displayed.<BR>
<IMG SRC="setbhp.gif">

<P>Step 4.  The contents of the database are broken down into two logical parts when displayed:<p>
<UL>
<LI>A Table of Contents (TOC) which highlights the position of the retrieved record within the 
database. <p>
<LI>The actual record that has been retrieved. To view the text within the document, the user 
can scroll down through the document. Each occurrence of the search term - in this case 
“bhp” - will be highlighted.<p>
</UL>

A standard keyword search enables users to search for a specific term across the all 
Stocktakes Sectors of Research within the database. For example, a user may wish to search 
across all sectors to determine which sectors have dealings with BHP:

<P>Step 1. The user would click on the FIND icon  <IMG SRC="findwww.gif"> from the SIMWWW toolbar.   This will 
display the Simple Search Form.

<P>Step 2. Insert the query term “bhp” into the Simple Search Form window and press the 
PERFORM SEARCH Button. <BR>
<IMG SRC="simsearc.gif">
 
<P>Step 3. The Search Results Set screen will then be displayed. By clicking on the ‘Show’ radio 
button, the first corresponding record will be displayed.<BR>
<IMG SRC="resuwww.gif">

<P>Step 4.  The contents of the database are broken down into two logical parts when displayed:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>A Table of Contents (TOC) which highlights the position of the retrieved record within the 
database. <p>
<LI>The actual record  that has been retrieved. To view the text within the document, the user 
can scroll down through the document. Each occurrence of the search term - in this case 
“bhp” - will be highlighted.<p>
</UL>

<A NAME="NAV"><H3>Navigating via the Table of Contents</H3></A>
Navigating through the Stocktakes of Research for each Sector can be performed using  the 
Table of Contents (TOC). Each entry in the Table of Contents is a hypertext link to the 
corresponding physical record in the database. After the user has completed an initial keyword 
search and a record has been displayed, the Table of Contents can be used to move from one 
record to another. 

<P>There are two types of  links within the Table of Contents:<p>
<ul>
<LI><B><I>Stocktake of Research Headings</I></B><p> 
These headings serve two purposes. Firstly, they link the Stocktake of Research Heading to 
the corresponding Sector Outlook Summary, and secondly, they expand the Table of 
Contents to display the corresponding Sector Chunks for the Stocktake of Research 
Heading.<p>
 <LI><B><I>Sector Chunks</I></B><p>
These link Sector Chunk Headings to the physical record in the database. Sector Chunk 
Headings are identified by an asterix (*).<p>
</ul>

<A NAME="BASIC"><H3>Basic Index</H3></A>

The basic index facilitates the ability to search across all Stocktakes of Research including all 
Sector Chunks and Sector Outlooks. This is the broadest of searches and is best used when 
searching for like terms across the whole database. For example, the basic index would be 
used to search for sectors have dealings with a certain person, or organisation.

<A NAME="SECOND"><H3>Secondary indexes</H3></A>

A number of secondary indexes are used to narrow down the search to specific parts of the 
database. The purpose of this is to reduce the number irrelevant records being retrieved. A 
number of secondary indexes have been created to enable certain parts of the database to be 
searched individually, including Sector Chunks, and Sector Outlooks.

<P><ul>
<li><B><I>Chunk</I></B><p>
The Chunk secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector Chunks 
only. This means that the search will exclude all Sector Outlook documents.

<P><li><B><I>ChunkTitle</I></B><p>
The ChunkTitle secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector 
Chunk Titles only.

<P><li><B><I>Outlook</I></B><p>
The Outlook secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector 
Outlooks only. This means that the search will exclude all Sector Chunks.

<P><li><B><I>OutlookTitle</I></B><p>
The OutlookTitle secondary index restricts the search of the database to within the Sector 
Outlook Titles only.

<P><li><B><I>RNum</I></B><p>
The RNum Secondary index enables searching of the whole database by way of searching for 
specific record numbers. Each record within the database has a unique record number. For 
example, the very first record in the database has a RNum value of “1”.
</ul><p>

<A NAME="TIPS"><H2>Searching Tips</H2></A>

To ensure efficient use of the database, advice on how to use the secondary indexes and 
navigate successfully via the table of contents has been included.

<A NAME="ACCESS"><H3>Accessing the first record</H3></A>
To access the first record of the entire database, select the Rnum secondary index in the CCL 
Query form (or Simple Search query form for SIMWWW). Type in the number “1” in the 
search window and hit FIND (SIMPCI) or PERFORM SEARCH (SIMWWW). This will 
bring up the first record in the database.

<A NAME="COMBINE"><H3>Combining searches</H3></A>
To search within a chunk on a particular term, you will need to perform a search for the term 
in the Basic index. Then change to the Secondary index of your choice and type in the second 
term. Combine the two set results using the AND operator to produce a third set history. 

<A NAME="VPS"><H2>Viewing, Printing and Saving Results</H2></A>

<A NAME="FIELD"><H3>Fieldsets</H3></A>

Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or saved to disk. If no 
fieldset is chosen, the default is F(Full). Fieldsets may be chosen in various
windows depending on whether you wish to save or print. 

<P><TABLE border=4 cellpadding=3>
<TR ALIGN="left">
<TD width=50%> <B>Fieldset</B></TD> 
<TD width=50%><B>Shows</B></TD></TR>

<TR ALIGN="left">

<TR ALIGN="left">
<TD width=50%>S (Summary)</TD>
<TD width=50%>Outlook-Titles & Chunk-Titles</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="SAVE"><H3>Saving Records to Disk</H3></A>

Currently, the ability to save records out of  Sector Stocktake of Research database has not 
yet been completed. Soon, the ability to save records as RTF(Rich Text Format), which is a 
format that is compatible with MSWORD and many other wordprocessing packages will be 
available. This will give the capability to extract information within specific Sector Chunk(s), 
and Sector Outlook(s) and be able to incorporate this information into other documents via a 
number of popular Word Processing Packages.

<A NAME="PRINT"><H3>Printing Records</H3></A>

<P><B><I>SIMPCI</I></B><BR>
Records may be saved (see above) to disk before printing or printed directly from the screen. 
To print the record you are currently viewing use the Print icon <IMG SRC="print.gif">  . To print the whole result 
set, choose the Operations, Print Result Set option in the Set History window. <BR>
<IMG SRC="sethist.gif">
 
<P><B><I>SIMWWW</I></B><BR>
In order to print records from SIMWWW, you will need to capture them to screen or disk.

<P>
CIM (formerly CSIRO Information Services) was more widely known in the library 
community as CSIRO Central Library.  When the CIM unit moved to Clayton in 
June 1996, the collection, which had a strong science and technology focus, 
was devolved to CSIRO divisional libraries, university libraries throughout 
Australia, and to the State Library of Victoria.</P>

<P>The CIM collection now focusses on library and information science, 
archives, records management, copyright, intellectual property, management 
techniques, electronic information and database management.</P>

<title>About Corporate Purchasing</title>

<FONT SIZE=5>About Corporate Purchasing</B></FONT>
<P>
The Corporate Purchasing Group provides value-added specialist
serials acquisitions services to the CSIRO Library Network. The
Group's major focus is the management of the ordering and payment
functions for the Network's 11,000 subscriptions, standing orders
and memberships worth approximately $A 6 million per annum.
<P>
The Group's serials vendor policies are determined through regular
negotiations based on our corporate purchasing power. CSIRO achieves
economies of scale through preferential pricing on purchase price
or service charges, resolution of complex problems in supply,
flexible payment schemes, coordination of the annual cancellations
and new orders process and the use of CSIRO's integrated Library
System, Voyager.
<P>
In 1996, CSIRO completed a formal tender of its entire list of
serials in line with CSIRO policy to tender out all purchasing
contracts exceeding a designated value. The Corporate Purchasing
Group demonstrated its accountability to the Organisation in obtaining
the best value for money in serial purchasing on behalf of the
Library Network. 
<P>
The Group provides advisory services such as pricing for hardcopy
serials, electronic journals and datasets and also provides serials
ordering policy documentation and serials payment information
to the CSIRO Library Network.

<B>The way we were</B><P>

CSIRO has been constantly evolving over its lifetime.  The organisation
today is vastly different from its beginnings as CSIR in 1926.  The infant
CSIR consisted of just five Divisions in 1930.  CSIRO today embraces over
30 Divisions grouped into six Institutes.
<P>
Policies change.  Research directions change.  Structures change.  Some
Divisions have been created and abandoned within the same month.  Others
have retained their identity, relatively unchanged, for more than fifty
years.
<P>
<B>What is covered here ?</B>
<P>
This resource provides a concise record of structural changes within CSIRO
since 1926.  It is intended to be a complete listing of all major
Divisional groups that have existed within CSIRO.  It sets out linkages
between groups.  It focuses on groups which have been officially designated
as separate administrative units.  Names of individual field stations and
laboratories are generally not included.
<P>
The section on "Research Support & Administration" concentrates on recent
structure of Headquarters units, especially changes since 1985.  Similarly,
the section on "Institutes" sets out the general nature of recent changes.
It does not include details of all changes to component groups.
<P>
<B>Notifying changes</B>
<P>
This resource is based on a database maintained in association with CSIRO
Index.  It was initiated in 1991.  When notifying of changes or errors,
provide supporting evidence wherever possible.<P>

<LI><b>Development:</b>   CSIRO Index is a deposit collection.  It
began as a document collection of CSIRO research output from 1916.  The
CSIX database developed from index cards used to record the document
collection from 1969.  Copies of publications produced by CSIRO (and its
predecessors) from 1916 onwards and documents authored by CSIRO staff are
stored in the CSIRO Index Collection at Clayton.  It is the sole
comprehensive collection grouping all of the organisation's publications in
one place.  This material has been continuously collected in response to
management policy since 1916.
<p>
<LI><b>Access to Documents:</b>  Photocopies <i>only </i>  are supplied
(originals are not for loan).  Contact your site Librarian to arrange an
Inter Library Loan.  Requests are handled at Clayton by the Inter Library
Loans Officer: <a href=mailto:sue.thompson@cis.csiro.au>Sue

<H2 align=center>CSIRO POLICY CIRCULAR 91/4 (revised)<BR>
PURCHASE OF BOOKS, PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTIONS AND MEMBERSHIPS</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
CSIRO purchasing policy applies generally to the acquisition of
library and related materials. However, the Organisation's ability
to share such resources and the importance of recording them call
for some specific requirements.
<H3><I>General</I></H3>

<P>
All books, periodicals and memberships purchased from CSIRO funds,
regardless of fund source, are the property of CSIRO. The CSIRO
Library Network through its bulk purchasing power has negotiated
special discounts and services with suppliers of books and periodicals
and achieved significant economies through the use of the CLINES
Acquisitions Module (eg acceptance of invoices in magnetic tape
format).
<P>
Because of the Organisation's significant investment in publications,
it is essential that a central record of these materials be maintained
to facilitate resource sharing (throughout CSIRO and with other
Australian libraries), to avoid unnecessary duplication of expensive
titles and to share price and availability information within
the CSIRO Library Network.
<P>
For many years, it has been CSIRO policy that the purchase of
all books, periodicals and memberships is coordinated through
CSIRO libraries. CSIRO Divisional Librarians are the first point
of contact for the purchase of this material on behalf of staff.

<H3><I>Books</I></H3>

<P>
The purchase of all books, technical reports, audio-visual packages,
periodical back issues and theses is arranged through Divisional
Librarians. All material acquired by Divisional Libraries is recorded
in the CLINES system, which is available online throughout CSIRO.
Wherever possible this also includes brief details of material
acquired through petty cash and the Corporate Credit Card. In
certain circumstances, bulk orders for titles required in multiple
copies throughout CSIRO are arranged by Corporate Information
Management on behalf of CSIRO Divisional Libraries. Once authorised
for payment, all invoices for books, etc are processed using the
CLINES Acquisition Module.

<H3><I>Conference Proceedings</I></H3>
<P>
All conference proceedings obtained as part of registration fees
paid by CSIRO (irrespective of fund source ownership specifically
provided for) are the property of CSIRO and should be processed
by Divisional Librarians. Staff who wish to purchase conference
proceedings or other publications may only do so with the prior
permission of their Divisional Librarian. This will avoid duplication
of material which may already be on order.

<H3><I>Periodicals/Membership</I></H3>
<P>
All periodical subscriptions, standing order titles (eg annuals)
and memberships of professional societies and associations which
are funded by CSIRO (irrespective of fund source) are arranged
through Divisional Librarians and ordered and paid centrally by
Corporate Information Management using the CLINES system. Memberships
are treated in this manner because they require periodic payment,
often involve the receipt of publications and it is sometimes
possible for CSIRO as a whole to take advantage of member discounts.
The Divisional Librarian is the first contact point for staff
wishing to obtain material of this nature.
<P>
Corporate Information Management places CSIRO's subscription list
out to tender at regular intervals. The intent is to maximise
the value of CSIRO's total purchasing power and supplier services.
<H3><I>Australian Government Credit Card</I></H3>

<P>
The policies above also apply to the use of the Corporate Credit
Card. The Conditions of Use of the card restrict the purchasing
of publications to &quot;tools of trade&quot; eg computer handbooks,
directories, etc.
<P>
In exceptional circumstances Divisional Librarians may agree to
card holders' obtaining publications. In all cases, staff must
contact the Divisional Librarian prior to the purchase of any
publication and staff who are likely to make book purchases with
the Australian Government Credit Card should obtain the clearance
of their Divisional Librarian. No subscriptions are to be acquired
through the Corporate Credit Card by CSIRO staff.

<H2>SPOTLIGHT ON NETWORKED INFORMATION IN CSIRO LIBRARIES</H2>
<P>
<B>WORKING TOGETHER: THE LINCHPIN OF SUCCESS<P>
<P> INFORMATION ACCESS GROUP</B>
<P>(by Lisa Belkin, Librarian, CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering)
<P>
<HR>
Significant effort has been undertaken recently by the IAG (Information
Access Group) to define the group's role in CSIRO. The presentation
will outline the vision, role and future objectives of the group.
 Major achievements since the inception of the IAG in 1992 will
be highlighted.  Future projects and hurdles that the group must
overcome in order to achieve its work objectives will also be
discussed.
<P>
The title of this paper is &quot;working together: the linchpin
of success&quot; as the only way for the IAG to succeed further
in the future will come from how effectively we continue working
together with other CSIRO groups and our ability to command recognition,
in order to obtain support for IAG initiatives.
<P>
The IAG comprises membership of ITS, CCIM and dataset champions
(who are predominately from the Library Network) - though membership
is open to representatives from other sectors of CSIRO.
<P>
For those who have not had a chance to read the minutes of the
21st IAG.  I will read out the groups vision and role:
<P>
<B>Vision:</B> 
<P>
The IAG plays a leading role in establishing a corporate electronic
information infrastructure for CSIRO.
<P>
<B>Role:</B>
<P>
To act as a focal point within CSIRO for facilitating access to
data sets which are of value to the Organisation.
<P>
To provide a corporate mechanism for evaluating, negotiating,
prioritising and implementing data sets.
<P>
To recommend the most efficient and cost effective means of making
available electronic data sets in order for CSIRO to undertake
world class research.
<P>
To advise on the most effective links to disparate electronic
resources.
<P>
<B>History</B>
<P>
In thinking about the future for the group it is very important
to back track and examine the IAG's past.  The IAG was formed
in 1992 as one of the specification groups for the New Library
System Project.  The group was set up to define functional requirements
of the Online Public Access Catalogue and to consider data sets,
other than traditional catalogue data, for access throughout CSIRO.
 When the IAG's set tasks were finished by March 1993, a long
list of full text, bibliographic, statistical, directory and image
data sets for future evaluation had been prepared.  At this stage
there was too much brewing to discontinue the group's activities.
 This was the halcyon period for IAG.  We had added strength of
influential, new members such as David Rofe, Mark Whatmore and
Philip Kent, and we had the support of the General Manager of
the ISB (Jinette), as the system owner - which gave the IAG most
of the ingredients for success- such as key people and commitment
to making things happen.  We had a form of official status in
the Organisation.
<P>
In August 1993 the IAG surveyed librarians and scientific staff
and found an overwhelming commitment to a Network version of Current
Contents.  In September 1994 SIM went live with Current Contents
and the CSIRO Publications Database.  Scanfile and the Material
Safety Data Sheets were released shortly after.
<P>
The move from a local stand-alone PC product to a networked version
accessible throughout CSIRO via SIM was a major success for the
IAG, saving CSIRO thousands of dollars in multiple subscriptions
and resulting in widespread access to seven editions of Current
Contents throughout the Organisation.  All CSIRO staff now have
access to Current Contents, from their desktops, and for many
sites this was a quantum leap from having one edition and accessible
only from a local standalone.  No need to preach to the converted
- most of us know how successful the implementation of Current
Contents has been in Divisions.  With over 2000 searches per month-
a number which is on the increase, this dataset has been enormously
successful.  
<P>
Late October 1994 and during 1995 members of the IAG team helped
to promote the data sets throughout CSIRO by participating as
trainers on the IT Awareness Program.  Feedback on data set suggestions
(such as recommendations to investigate Science Citation Index
and Patent Databases) obtained from CSIRO staff by the trainers
during IT Awareness has been channelled back to the IAG.  
<P>
We will be working during 1996 to implement a range of data sets
including Metadex, the Records Management Manual, the Commercial
Practice Manual, Discussions Negotiations and Agreements, World
Patents Index, IBIS and the Defined Hazardous Substances data.
<P>
The Information Access Group is also organising trial access to
ERL technology during mid 1996 which will be available throughout
CSIRO.  ERL technology enables Wide Area Network access to a number
of databases that were previously restricted to stand alone computers
or local area networks.  The ERL technology has been developed
by the company Silver Platter and it  allows users to select their
preferred platform to operate database sytems.  We hope to trial
databases such as Agricola, Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts,
Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts, Food Science and Technology
Abstracts, Human Nutrition, Iconda, Information Science Abstracts,
Life Sciences Collection, Medline, NTIS from the United States
National Technical Information Service, Tree, Tropag and Rural,
Water Resources Abstracts and Zoological Record.
<P>
We also intend to complete and make recommendations for the following
datasets:
<P>
 - SAGE
<BR>
 - Derwent World Patent Index
<BR>
 - Compendex - via SIM
<BR>
 - CASSI - less the holdings information 
<BR>
 - ISI Citations Database
<BR>
 - AESIS -
<BR>
 - CABI - via SIM
<P>
Numerous other databases for consideration during 1996 are listed
in the minutes of the 21st meeting of the IAG, which was held
in January 1996.
<P>
<B>The model</B>
<P>
Developing a model to help with the processes.  Which includes
a:
<P>
Proforma for submitting requests via WWW and a Checklist which
outlines the steps required to evaluate datasets.
<P>
<B>The ITS &amp; data set owner role</B>
<P>
Barry Cheney has prepared a document that outlines all of the
specifications and steps that are required to create a SIM database.
 The roles involve a representative of the system owner (Leigh
Parsons) and the technical experts negotiating a number of critical
areas related to dataset development.  A great deal of time and
effort is expended in the process of determining the business
functional requirements for datasets.
<P>
Other delivery mechanisms such as  www, erl, and lotus notes are
monitored by the IAG to ensure the information is provided in
the most appropriate form and not limited by the any particular
technology.  Of primary concern to the IAG is the quality of the
information.
<P>
The IAG is involved in other projects such as sponsoring information
scout (to be discussed by Cynthia Love), Information Management
Strategy- where it is my role to lobby for IAG requirements to
be incorporated into the strategy and eventually we will be able
to lobby more for Corporate discounts.
<P>
At the moment with the amount of change in the Organisation the
IAG is not making significant progress.  We are in limbo and we
need to sort out how we can deal with addressing the following
requirements, which include getting: 
<UL>
<LI>Recognition and promotion as an official group in CSIRO
<LI>Direction from system owner
<LI>Funds sponsor initiatives
<LI>Policy direction
<LI>Budget for IAG operations
<LI>Uncomplicated reporting structure
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Is the answer to the IAG's future in the New CSIRO the IMTC? The
IAG is preparing a background paper, which will be discussed at
the IMTC.  It is proposed that the IAG report via the system owner,
who is Jinette, to the IMTC.  
<P>
Regardless the IAG will continue to do great work as we recognise
the vital importance in helping to establish the working environment
of the future.  If we discontinue our efforts - it will only impact
upon the organisation's ability to do science and technology.
 What we are working towards is creation of an electronic information
environment that helps scientists keep up competitor's research,
identify new uses and applications of existing science and technology,
avoid duplication of effort, expose commercial opportunties and
contribute to the discovery of niche areas.  Ultimately we are
assisting in the creation of knowledge.

<H2>
Background document prepared for the IMTC Meeting, March 1996
<P>
IAG (Information Access Group)</H2>
<P>
<B>Vision:</B>
<P>
The IAG plays a leading role in establishing a corporate electronic
information infrastructure for CSIRO.
<P>
<B>Background:</B>
<P>
Late 1992 the IAG was formed as one of the specifications groups
for the New Library System Project.  The group was set-up to define
functional requirements of the Online Public Access Catalogue
(OPAC) and to consider data sets, other than traditional catalogue
data, for access throughout CSIRO.  By March 1993 the IAG had
completed the OPAC specification and put forward a diverse listing
of full text, bibliographic, statistical, directory and image
data sets for future evaluation.  Current Contents topped the
list as the first candidate for consideration.
<P>
In August 1993 the IAG surveyed librarians and scientific staff
to obtain a commitment to a networked version of Current Contents.
 There was overwhelming support throughout the Network for the
Current Contents project.  The switch to a tape version of the
product was a major success for the IAG, as it would save CSIRO
thousands of dollars and result in more widespread access to seven
editions of Current Contents throughout the Organisation.  All
staff would be able to access Current Contents from their desktops
and for many sites this was a quantum leap from having one edition
on a stand alone computer.
<P>
During 1994 the IAG prioritised data set work and assisted in
the implementation of Current Contents, CSIRO Publications Index,
Scanfile and the Occupational Health Material Data Safety Sheets.
<P>
Late October 1994 and during 1995 members of the IAG team helped
to promote the data sets throughout CSIRO by participating as
trainers on the IT Awareness Program.  Feedback from CSIRO users
obtained by the trainers during IT Awareness has been channelled
back to the IAG.  
<P>
During 1996 the IAG will be working to implement a range of data
sets including Metadex, the Records Management Manual, the Commerical
Practices Manual, IBIS and the Defined Hazardous Substances data.
 Investigations and recommendations will be made for approximately
fifteen other data sets of relevance to CSIRO.  Set to also commence
in 1996, the IAG will be the forum for communication and reporting
on Web data sets for the Information Scout Project.
<P>
All recommendations put forward by the IAG get recorded in the
minutes of the IAG meetings, which can be found at:
<P>
<DL><DD><a
href="/cis/csiroonly/iag/iag_minutes.htm">
http://www.cis.csiro.au/cis/csiroonly/iag/iag_minutes.htm</a>
</DL>
<P>
A model is being developed by the IAG that all CSIRO groups can
adopt for evaluting potential data set.  The IAG would be pleased
to work with other individuals and groups and record activities
on behalf of the Organisation.
<P>
<B>Role:</B>
<P>
To act as a focal point within CSIRO for facilitating access to
data sets which are of value to the Organisation.
<P>
To provide a corporate mechanism for evaluating, negotiating,
prioritising and implementing data sets.
<P>
To recommend the most efficient and cost effective means to optimise
electronic data sets in order for CSIRO to undertake world class
research.
<P>
To advise on the most effective links to disparate electronic
resources.
<P>
<B>IMTC: </B>
<P>
Official acknowledgement for the group would provide endorsement
for ongoing participation by IAG members.  As governance for information
management in CSIRO will be set by the IMTC, we seek recognition
and support from this group.  To date members of the IAG are predominately
Melbourne based.  A budget to cover resources and transportation
for interstate members would improve the balance of representatives
on the IAG.  
<P>
Access to a more influential group within CSIRO is required to
settle issues that are beyond the scope of the IAG.  
<P>
Recognition of the work of the IAG will help to ensure that information
issues do not get lost in development of the technology.
<P>
Support from the IMTC will help to encourage individuals from
other sectors within CSIRO to participate on the IAG.

<h2>Library conference dinner</h2>
29 March 1996
<hr>
     Dear All
     <P>
     I have been asked by a few people about what the appropriate<br>
     dress will be for the dinner. I feel we shouldn't insist on<br>
     long dress, black tie &amp; decorations, but best evening clobber<br>
     would be a good idea to add to the festive occasion. That<br>
     leaves it wide open (but no Doc Martens, flannies, or Tshirts<br>
     with rude slogans- unless covered with an elegant jacket).<br>
     See you there,
     <P>
     Margie <br>

<title>CSIRO Library Network Conference</title>
28 Mar 1996
<P>
     Dear all<br>
     <P>We have just received the 118th registration for our<br>
     conference so that is quite a good crowd!  Those of you<br>
     who are coming to the Cocktail Party on Sunday might like<br>
     to know there is a bus back into Civic from close to The<br>
     Lobby at 7.15pm, and also one at 7.35 pm. We have to be<br>
     out by 7pm but if some of us want to linger on the terrace<br>
     that is OK - or go for a walk in the rose gardens if you miss<br>
     the first bus. I will have copies of a map available for you<br>
     to find the bus stop.<br>
     <P>On Monday, immediately prior to lunch, we will have a group<br>
     photo taken on the terrace steps at Olims.<br>
     
     <P>On the Tuesday evening there will be a special bus to take you<br>
     from Olims to the dinner. It will leave Olims at 6.45pm (Acacia<br>
     people can walk up just one block, takes a couple of minutes)<br>
     and will be picked up at 11.30 pm to go back. Entry is via<br>
     the walkways straight into the Members Dining Room from<br>
     Queen Victoria Terrace (as there is another function in Kings<br>
     Hall which is at the front of the building). Please take note<br>
     of this and tell any other people who might be coming from<br>
     your Division. We can exit through Kings Hall (as that function<br>
     will be over by then) so those of you from far flung states<br>
     who would like to absorb the historical vibes of the place<br>
     can do so!
     <P> For the Wednesday bus trip to the libraries, there<br>
     will be lunch boxes available for you to grab and make a quick<br
     getaway, as there will not be a lot of time to fit the visits in.<br>
     Looking forward to seeing you all next week,<br>
     
     <P>Cheers<br>
     Margie

<Title>Conference update: 8 March 1996</Title>
8 March 1996
<P>
Dear All
<P>
     Just to let you all know that plans for our conference are<br>
     progressing very well. Yesterday I checked out the Lobby,<br>
     where the cocktail party is being held and I think it is<br>
     going to be great. It is a beautiful setting,the menu looks<br>
     delicious, and we will look out onto the gardens through glass<br>
     walls all around. The roses will be in their autumn blooming<br>
     just for us and we can wander out onto the terrace if it is a<br>
     pleasant evening. The Lobby is just across the road from Old<br>
     Parliament House, and close to the National Library, Science<br>
     &amp; Technology Centre, High Court and National Gallery. Great<br>
     for an evening stroll. (You will probably need to get a taxi<br>
     from Olims however, it would be quite a walk from there). We<br>
     have about 108 registrants including 12 communicator/records<br>
     people so it should be an interesting mix.<br>
     I would like you to let me know if you want to go on the quick<br>
     tour of Black Mountain Library and Wildlife Library on the<br>
     Wednesday at lunchtime? It will depend on numbers whether we<br>
     take a large bus, small bus, or even taxis. PLEASE ADVISE ASAP<br>
     for planning. (We can't go to Forestry as they will be out of the <br>
     library from 15 March for some weeks for refurbishment.)<br>
     Also, anyone staying at James Court must make their booking<br>
     by today 8 MARCH!
     <P>
     The dinner is shaping up very well too. I am going to see the<br>
     newly refurbished dining room and finalise menus on Monday. I<br>
     think it will be a great evening - Professor Elliott promises<br>
     to be most entertaining!<br>
     Best of all, the main program looks fantastic!<br>
     That is all for now. Please ask me if there is anything you<br>
     need or anything you are unsure of.<br>
     <P>
     Cheers,<br>
     Margie <br>

23 Feb 1996
<P>
     Dear All,
     <P>
     I have been asked to advise you of some changes to the<br>
     conference program for the Tuesday and Wednesday. The reasons<br>
     for this are that two presentations have had to be withdrawn:
     <P>
     <OL>
     <LI>SIM - SIM will not be on due to staff changes at VS:CL<br>
     and Sherrey Quinn having left.
     <LI>The "Valuing CSIRO Libraries" panel on the Tuesday will<br>
     not be given. At the last LNC meeting some doubt was expressed<br>
     about presenting this segment. The meeting thought it was<br>
     desirable to have a session on the future of the library<br>
     network/CUG.</OL>
     <P>
     To accommodate these changes with the minimum of confusion<br>
     to the registrants and speakers, the program now looks like this:<br>
     <P>
     <B>Tuesday</B><br>
     10.45 am   -   Lisa Belkin<br>
     11.00 am   -   Ilma Lo Iacono<br>
     4.15 pm    -   Philip Kent<br>
     4.30 pm    -   Sharon Johnson, ITS, on Lotus Notes.<br>
     <P>
     <B>Wednesday</B><br>
     2.00 pm - 3.15 pm  -   Future of the Library Network:<br>
                        Facilitated discussion on purpose, role,<br>
                        committee structures, relationship with CUG<br>
                        Jinette de Gooijer, Chair, LNC.<br>
     <P>
     Please make these changes to your program.<br>
     <P>
     Irving has put the new program up on the web and you can<br>
     print it off from there. If you have any problems, let me<br>
     know and I can send you a copy. Of course, there will be<br>
     copies of the amended program at the conference for you<br>
     when you register.<br>
     If those librarians, who are affected by these changes, have<br>
     any questions please get in touch with me. Please excuse my<br>
     not advising each one of you individually, but in the interests of <br>
     speed and efficiency, I am covering it by this lib-all.<br>
     <P>
     <B>Posters</B><br>
     I have three screens for the poster display. They are covered<br>
     with that woolly stuff - you can fasten the posters on with<br>
     velcro. I am working on getting some more screens but it would<br>
     be helpful if you could let me know who is going to do a poster.<br>
     Then I will know how many screens to set up. I think the<br>
     posters should be not much bigger than A3, so we can accommodate<br>
     everyone, but if you have made bigger ones I am sure I can<br>
     work something out. Don't forget to mention any special things<br>
     you do, services peculiar to your library, or other unusual<br>
     features.<P>
     I think that is all for now.<P>
     Please get in touch if you need to, by email, phone or fax.<P>
     Cheers,<br>
     Margie  <br>

15 Feb 1996
<P>
Dear All,
<P>
I think most of you have registered by now - if any others are<br>
planning to go to the conference you had better hurry up with<br>
your registrations!  Again,I would like to encourage you all to<br>
spread the word about our conference to anyone interested in<br>
your division - communicators, records managers, or anyone <br>
else - they will be most welcome (even for a single day<br>
registration which some records people expressed interest in).
<P>
Cheers,<br>

<P>
Dear all,
<P>
     Thank you to those who have already registered for the<br>
     conference - keep them rolling in! Don't forget the poster<br>
     display - we would like some sort of picture of each library -<br>
     poster, photos, artwork etc. so that we all can gain a better<br>
     idea of each others' libraries. Start thinking and creating<br>
     now. We will set up screens for these to be displayed, and<br>
     obviously they can't be too large or you may have difficulty<br>
     transporting them up here. Just do the best you can to give<br>
     us a picture of your library.
     <P>
     Cheers,<br>
     Margie<br>

working together! A CSIRO success story</h2>

Lisa Belkin, Chair of the Information Access Group
<HR>
<P>
Significant effort has been undertaken recently by the IAG (Information
Access Group) to define the group's role in CSIRO. The presentation will
outline the vision, role and future objectives of the group.  Major
achievements since the inception of the IAG in 1992 will be highlighted.
Future projects and hurdles that the group must overcome in order to achieve
its work objectives for 1996 will also be discussed.

<Title>Transcript of Overheads</Title>
<H2>Transcript of Overheads</H2>
Jinette de Gooijer
<HR>
<B>What is the CSIRO Library Network?</B>
<UL>
<LI>a group of libraries, all working together, cooperatively, with
commonality of practices and systems
<LI>a voluntary cooperation by and support to each member
<LI>a mechanism to express common concerns and find solutions
<LI>a life-raft for the one-person library
<LI>an ability for CSIRO to have "grunt" in the library community and 
elsewhere
<LI>has a common purpose and standards in agreed areas of work
<LI>allows face-to-face communication for dispersed libraries
</UL>
<p>
<B>Barriers to face-to-face participation</B>
<UL>
<LI>lack of clarity and knowledge about the mechanics (lots of 
unwritten rules and tacit knowledge about how things work)
<LI>the practical logistics of remoteness and geographic dispersion
<LI>higher workloads and pressures in individual libraries
<LI>staffing levels (especially in small libraries)
<LI>personal confidence
</UL>
<p>
<B>Some solutions for overcoming these barriers</B>
<UL>
<LI>more support for people to contribute
<LI>don't forget the indirect contributions that are, and can be made, 
by regional groups
<LI>email
<LI>more foreknowledge of things so that people have time to read and 
discuss issues
</UL>
<p>
<B>Some Actions we can take now</B>
<P>Although we have a lot of issues still "on the board", the following
actions are beginnings, to help the Network work through areas of concern 
(Ramon's contribution this morning was a useful step in continuing the
discussion)
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Current Committees look at ways for improving their communication,
especially for regional discussions and people less knowledgeable about 
the mechanisms
<LI>Corporate Information Management will provide explicit executive 
support for meetings (appointment of relevant staff member is expected in 
coming month)
<LI>Improve timing and dates for meetings
<LI>Mentor new participants in the Network (how?)
<LI>Agendas of regional meetings can be as flexible as need be (don't have 
to be tied to LNC &amp; CUG agendas)
</UL>
<p>

expressing any particular opinion of her own, except where it is obvious)

<Title>Mind your language - Big Sister is listening</Title>
<H2>Mind your language - Big Sister is listening</H2>
Ralph Elliot
<HR>
This paper looks at the implications of the current push for policing our
language in the name of "political correctness" and the threat which this
poses for freedom of speech and of scientific and scholarly enquiry and
discourse.
<P>
At the same time as advocating awareness of these issues, the paper also
stresses the importance of being alert to growing illiteracy and general
carelessness in the use of English evident in our society today. Among
the countless examples which he has accumulated the speaker hopes to cite
some that offer entertainment as well as edification and enlightenment.

Cliff Law
<P>
<HR>
The author's presentation will not focus on the role and activities of 
the DNC Office, and where CSIRO as a library fits within a national 
information infrastructure. Rather it will look at CSIRO as a distributed 
information network in itself, chart the changes and possible 
consequences of the "information value" reforms being undertaken by 
CSIRO, and consider what type of collaborative relationships CSIRO could 
develop in an electronic networked environment that will meet its 
customers' needs. The paper will also consider what lessons can be 
learned from reform process being undertaken by CSIRO and how these can 
help us develop a new understanding of distributed information relationships.

<H2>Spotlight on Providing Information Services in a Remote Environment</H2>
Ilma Lo Iacono
<HR>
The Division of Horticulture library at Merbein is one of a number of 
libraries within the CSIRO Library Network which is classified as 
remote.  We serve a relatively small Division, are geographically remote 
from major urban centres and we work in physical isolation from many of 
our own Divisional users, from other libraries and in intellectual 
isolation from our colleagues.  The CSIRO Library Network has always  
demonstrated that through the sharing of resources, by providing 
professional  and technical support, many of the problems faced by those 
working in a remote environment can be overcome.  In recent years, new 
and improved technologies and communication systems  have assisted in 
overcoming the tyranny of distance and have improved service provision to 
our users.  Working in isolation and in an environment of rapid and 
constant technological change, creates many challenges in the provision 
of quality information services to our staff.

<P>
Earlier this year, while beginning preparations for this paper,
I conducted a brief electronic mail survey of CSIRO Library Network
members, asking them to describe their experiences with formal
planning exercises, and inviting comments on the perceived benefits
and pitfalls.
<P>
I received responses from 34 libraries, a large slice of the Network,
and I would like to thank respondents for their thoughtful input.
I would particularly like to thank those who provided samples
of their plans.
<P>
While not all libraries were engaged in direct planning for their
own activity, all took the trouble to comment on their perceptions
of the benefits and failings of planning processes in their home
Divisions or Units.
<P>
<H3><B>What CSIRO survey revealed:</B></H3>
While this brief "straw poll' can in no way be considered
statistically rigorous or complete, it did reveal a number of
general similarities and shared concerns among CSIRO's library
community.
<P>
Overall, there was a general confusion with terminology, with
the terms "business plans" and "strategic plans" commonly
being used interchangeably, with similar content and to similar
purpose. At least one Division has removed the confusion by simply
having a "Plan".  In a number of Divisions and units,
business plans were closer to what I would consider to be annual
operational plans, with an operational bent rather than a strategic
focus. Many respondents were familiar with the preparation of
operational plans, usually linked with budget proposals and project
performance schedules, but "marketing" and "communication
plans" were rare, although a number of respondents indicated
that these were on the horizon.
<P>
There was little consistency across Divisions or even within Institutes,
and the mode of planning varied accordingly. A number of respondents
remarked that even within their own Division, the goal posts appeared
to move substantially each year, as Divisions tinkered with the
formula in an effort to find the right planning process and outcome
for their own situation. Concerns were expressed about the increasing
difficulty of long-range planning in an organisation undergoing
major and constant change.
<P>
Planning processes were in general considered to be unnecessarily
lengthy and focussed on semantics. As these processes were generally
initiated by management in a "top-down" process, there
was often not a high level of ownership by users and indeed by
junior library staff. Quixotically, despite initiation by senior
management, one frequent comment concerned lack of management
commitment to the final product when it came to the hard resourcing
decisions. The consequent difficulty of implementing plans, and
failure to evaluate the progress of plans was a source of some
frustration.  
<P>
None of these responses is particularly unusual, and certainly
none are unique to CSIRO. The literature is full of similar case
studies and findings. However, it would be painting far too black
a picture to say that there were not a number of perceived benefits
to be derived from the planning process. Within the Library Network,
the most successful plans appeared to be library, not management
initiated, focussed on a fairly small time-frame (no more than
3 years), were flexible, were used largely for internal planning,
and were visibly linked with annual operational planning and performance
assessment rounds.           
<P>
I intend today to look at how to get the best out of the planning
process and how to avoid the most common pitfalls. I will focus
on the development and continued use of a "business plan" to describe
and plan the library's environment, the framework within which
all decisions concerning products, services, service levels, staffing
and resource allocation are made, in short, its business, with
'marketing' and 'communication' plans being seen as ordinary business
elements of the plan. Where I refer to strategic plans as such,
it will be to indicate organisational, Division or Unit-level
planning which is the broader context in which the Library's business
plan must be seen.
<P>
<H3><B>What lessons can be learnt from the past?</B></H3>
We are perhaps very fortunate in that the era of the long and
detailed plan, requiring multiple appendices and statistical analyses,
has probably passed us by. Anyone who is familiar with Tom Peter's
recent works will be aware of his view that for too long, we have
been indulging in a mindless love affair with planning. Peters
and a number of other writers save their harshest words for formalised
planning processes which derive strategies from the past or copied
from competitors. While long-range planning exemplified by lengthy
written reports and ambitious attempts to see the future may have
largely outlived their usefulness, it would be premature to discard
them completely without taking some valuable lessons from them.
<P>
<H3><B>What can go wrong?</B></H3>
Traditional planning exercises such as we have seen in CSIRO have
tended to be dominated by senior management, driven by a small
central group pf planners and documented in considerable detail
Over a 5 year period, the organisation has seen scenarios ranging
from strategic plans written by a single individual to elaborate
planning processes involving all staff. In the latter case, the
battle-weary troops have tended to surrender and to implore management
to "get on with the job of managing.".  It seems to be
difficult to obtain the right balance of involvement, while moving
the plan along. 
<P>
It is very easy to become bogged down in the planning process,
to lose sight of the links the organisational &quot;big picture&quot;
and to focus unnecessarily on semantics and style. Cynicism is
easily bred when management attention appears to be focussed on
detailed inputs rather than on commitment to outcomes. Implementation
seems far off and difficult while the planning process is stretched
out. Precious time is eaten up while the work piles up at home
<P>
Alienation can occur when a group is unable to see the linkages
between its business and the mission, goals and objectives of
the parent organisation. This in itself is probably not a major
issue for senior library staff in CSIRO who often have a very
clear idea of their role and position within the organisation
but it can be significant for junior staff who may feel  that
they have little control over their own destinies. Traditionally,
there has been little suitable training or assistance available
for all levels of staff. Probably only in those Divisions who
have introduced "self-managed teams" has this deficiency been
seriously addressed.
<P>
Traditionally plans have tended to be developed and presented
along functional lines - this tends to create a bias towards the
provider's view, or what the provider thinks management wants
to see and hear, rather than what the user may want, need or value.

<P>
Fortunately, there are many valuable lessons to be learnt from
these past mistakes. What can be salvaged to turn planning into
a dynamic and useful exercise?
<P>
<a name="spot1"></a>
Before you launch into your plan, you need to ask yourself some
basic questions.
<UL>
<LI>What are you trying to achieve from your plan? What is its
primary audience? What kind of plan will work best in your Division
or Unit? What period will it cover?
<LI>What services do you want to be offering? What services do
your users want, and what characteristics of your service do they
value most? How do you want to relate to your users, and they
to you, in future?  How should you evaluate the effectiveness
of your services?
<LI>What can you continue to support, and what not? What are the
priorities?
<LI>How can you help your staff develop planning skills? How do
you intend to support professional growth in general?
<LI>And, most importantly, what is the library's philosophy towards
change? How does it expect to manage change? Does the library
fit the changing organisation? Its past value will not necessarily
be its future value. As David Penniman stated in 1990 "<I>To
remain what it is, it must change; if it does not change, it will
not remain what it is</I>.[<a href="#ref1"><B>1</B></a>]
</UL>
<P>
A well thought out plan can provide a base for clear action, establish
priorities, flag where action may be needed from other groups,
set goals against which performance can be judged, and enable
testing for consistency with organisational goals and strategies.
Importantly, it can provide a vehicle to sell new and innovative
programs to management, enable continuity during staff changes,
note critical issues and constraints on achieving desirable objectives,
and force consideration of contingencies and unknowns.
<P>
The "business" process of planning is described in Figure 1: <I>Steps to Plan</I>. 
In general terms, this provides the steps to action which can be applied to any 
business regardless of the nature of the enterprise or service.
<P>
<center>
<img  src="tuppack_fig1.gif"></center>
<P>
There is a view among some writers that the planning process is
more important than the end product; the journey is more interesting
than the destination. It is argued that acquiring a strategic
mindset, defined as the ability to think and manage strategically
is more valuable than producing an actual plan. The important
thing is to involve staff and users to create a situation where
strategies can naturally evolve and change rather than being deliberately
conceived or imposed. Involvement of the user is critical in obtaining
ownership and support, while involving all staff can improve morale
and motivation, build up team relationships and promote confidence
in the individual's ability to deliver the service.
<P>
Is it worth going to the effort and expense of producing a document
that risks being out of date before it's even been printed? Whether
or not you believe that he journey is more interesting than the
destination, there are a number of advantages in producing a formal
written plan, as the process forces planners to think through
goals and objectives carefully, provides a visual means of communicating
with a range of audiences, and is useful in reviewing progress
internally. In fact, a written plan is probably most effectively
used for internal purposes.
<P>
<H3><B>What should your plan look like?</B></H3>
<a name="spot2"></a>
<P>
The literature is full of examples, and unfortunately there is
no single simple model. I can particularly recommend the writings
of the British writer, Sheila Corrall, [<a href="#ref1"><B>2</B></a>],
 [<a href="#ref1"><B>3</B></a>] on the topic. 
<P>
There are, however, an number of "golden rules" which
may make your path towards developing your plan a much easier
one.
<P>
Long plans are not read - they are not read by management, and
perhaps even more importantly, they are not read by the people
who have to implement them. Try and ensure that it does get read
and used by your staff, and not tucked away out of sight and mind.
Keep it short! 
<P>
The most detailed section is likely to be the operational plan,
but try to restrict this as much as possible to what is new or
innovative, discrete and measurable. Highlight what is truly new.
Focus only on key business issues - don't feel the need to describe
or justify everything you do. Limit amount of background material,
or if you must include it, do so as appendices. Overloading with
detail, for example all data gathered in a comprehensive environmental
scan, is a frequent mistake. 
<P>
Keep the process simple. Expose your staff to the opportunity
to learn new skills, and ask them to examine their personal philosophies
on what constitutes success for the library. Involving your users
is critical, but think about how you do this - perhaps focus groups
could provide the answer. Can you afford to base your entire plan
on customer needs - what political or professional constraints
might mitigate against doing this?  Be realistic. Respect tradition
but don't be afraid to question it.  
<P>
Try and make it easy for others to be involved. Make main drafts
(but not too many) available on the local network for comment,
but accept that it won't be a top priority for many of your clients,
who, as you know, are very busy with their own activities. Actively
solicit frequent customer input at all stages of your activity,
and not just at the beginning and end of your planning process.
<P>
Aim to shrink your planning cycle. Developing the plan should
not be a lengthy process - the process should be short and as
succinct as possible.  After all, where you most need the time
is in the implementation of the plan, and too many plans fall
by the wayside because of failure or lack of will to implement.
A total organisational plan should take no longer than 2-3 months
from conception to communication to implementation.
<P>
Your forecast period should be short  (I recommend no more than
3, at the outside 5 years in the future). While an interesting
academic exercise, how possible is it to forecast 25 years into
the future, particularly for an activity which is often dependent
on the use of information technology? Don't update your plan any
more frequently than once a year. Too frequent planning can make
the process stall and ingrain old ideas.
<P>
Review the language you use - is it easily understood by management
and/or clients? Avoid jargon, acronyms and functional bias in
your use of language. Involve others in drafting and vetting,
but give the job of the final edit to one person only (does this
person have to be you?). Give the plan a title, preferably taken from 
the mission statement or adapted from the parent body's plan.
<P>
It is of course possible to create a number of separate plans
(ie separate business, operational plan, marketing plan) which
you may choose to work with, or alternatively you may create
<P>
an integrated plan which will incorporate the strategic vision,
marketing and communication plans, if these serve your purpose,
operational plan and not to be forgotten, an implementation review
and evaluation of the plan. The integrated plan may appear more
complex but I do recommend it as worth it in the long run. Your
choice of components of the plan will of course, depend on your
own environment.  
<P>
In general terms it is not recommended that you develop separate
marketing or communication plans unless  you serve extremely diverse
customer groups or propose substantial investment in marketing
activities to achieve significant growth in usage or income. 
<P>
In response to a number of requests, I have developed a brief
outline for an integrated plan. This is very deliberately as brief
as I could make it without losing the meaning. I have not attempted
to provide detail for any section (other writers have covered
this topic exhaustively). Rather I have attempted to provide a
modular model from which you may draw portions as you like, to
use as you like in your own situation.
<P>

<P>
<H3><B>Conclusion:</B></H3>
<P>
At the end of the day, what do we achieve with our plan? It can,
and should relate a library to its organisation and to changing
opportunities. It can identify pressures, constraints and threats
within the environment in which the library operates. It can be
used as a mode of communication, and, with a certain amount of
effort, can engender a political group and ideas-generating process
and without doubt an organisational learning process.
<P>
It can be an agent of change, and perhaps this is the most important
perspective we should all take away today. How can we, through
improved planning, make a better future for ourselves and an enhanced
service for our clients? Our future ability to provide a relevant
and effective service will depend on how well we can anticipate
and manage change at all levels of CSIRO, and how we roll with
it rather than necessarily seeking to control it. While some would
say that this is difficult, if not impossible to plan effectively
when an organisation is in transition and the future of many of
its parts is unknown, I would argue that there may never be a
better, or more necessary, time to put effort into planning. But
it is not just planning that is important - implementation is
critical, and without time and effort being directed into implementation,
the best business plan in the world is just another piece of paper.

<H3>Graphics software</H3>
There is a wide range of useful software available for editing image files. 
Please note that many of them are shareware and payment must be made if you 
wish to use a piece of software on a continuing basis.<P>
Here are the two mentioned during the workshop.
<P>
<ul>
<li><a href="order.htm">Paintshop Pro</a> (ordering information)
<dl><dd>This is an inexpensive piece of software which enables you to do photo retouching, painting, image format conversion, and screen capturing. 
Highly recommended.</dl>.
<li><B>Wingif14</B> (72K)
<dl><dd>This is a simple graphics editor which allows you to resize, rotate, 
and adjust the brightness of the image file. In fact most of you would 
probably already have a similar freeware editor called <B>LView</B> on your 
PC.<br>
<dd><B>Wingif</B> is available for downloading from CCIM FTP server. After 
downloading please use PKUNZIP to unzip. Click <a 
href="ftp://solaris.cis.csiro.au/pub/library/wingif14.zip">here</a> to proceed.
</dl>
</ul>
<P>
For those who like <B>LView</B> you can download a shareware version 
called <B>LView Pro</B> from <a 
href="http://world.std.com/~mmedia/lviewp.html">MMedia Research Corp</a> 
based in Florida. Both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 versions are available.

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2> 
<h3>Sample records</h3> 
<br><a href=csixrec1.htm>Record with abstract</a> 
<br><a href=csixrec2.htm>Record without abstract</a> 
<a name=BI> </a> 
<p> 
Note: Major descriptors are displayed in blue. 
<a name=BI> </a> 
<p> 
<h3>Basic Index</h3> 
The Basic Index contains all the words from titles, abstracts and major  
and minor descriptor fields. The Basic Index is the default index for  
searching when no index is specified.<p> 
When searching, you may search specific components of the Basic Index.<p>  
It does not matter if you use upper or lower case in searching.  Examples are shown 
below in lower case.<p> 
<p> 
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3> 
The "w" at the start of the  prefix is a convention used to indicate that 
each <i> word </i> in the search element is searchable. 
<pre><b>Search element  Field content     Example</b> 
                                        (This is the search syntax shown 
                                           in the Set History window. SIM 
                                           supplies the parentheses.)<br> 
wAbstract       Abstract          <b>find wabstract=(water %2 pollution) </b> 
                                  Find <i>water</i> within 2 words of 
                                  <i>pollution</i> in the abstract 
 
wMajorTerm      Major descriptors <b>find wmajorterm=(aquatic weeds)</b> 
                                  Find the phrase <i>aquatic weeds</i> as a major 
                                  descriptor 
 
wMinorTerm      Minor descriptors <b>find wminorterm=(weed ecology) </b> 
                                  Find the phrase <i>weed ecology</i> as a minor  
                                  descriptor 
 
wNote           Notes             <b>find wnote=(conference on materials) </b> 
                                  Find the phrase <i>conference on materials</i> in 
                                  the notes 
 
wTitle          Title             <b>find wtitle=water quality </b> 
                                  Find the phrase <i>water quality</i> in the title 
</pre> 
The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above. 
 Use the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW)  
to select a search element. These elements may not be scanned individually  
with the SCAN command (or toolbar button 6), though the Basic index as a  
whole may be scanned. 
<p> 
At present, abstracts (wAbstract search element) are included only for saleable 
publications.  
There are no abstracts for journal articles, book chapters, etc.  Searches 
 can be of "words in abstracts" by searching the wAbstract component of the Basic 
index. 
<p> 
<a name=SEC> </a> 
<br> 
<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3> 
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI in the CCL Query form; 
 or by using SIMPCI Toolbar Button 6 or Function Key F6; or SIMWWW A-Z  
icon, and selecting from the list of terms. 
All secondary indexes in CSIX are indexed by SIM with the "whole phrase" method. 
 That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. If you are  
using the CCL Query Form and do not enter the entire value of a field make  
sure you use the truncation symbol (?) at the appropriate end of your search  
text.  It does not matter if you use upper or lowercase in searching.  Examples are 
shown below in lower case. 
<p> 
<pre><b>Secondary    Field Content                     Examples 
index</b>                                       (This is the text which would be
                                                 entered in the Query box. Double  
                                                 quotes around search text

                                                 indexes, and must be entered as 
                                                 shown below.)<br>

<h3>Searching Tips</h3> 
<h4>AUTHOR SEARCHES </h4> 
Authors may be searched in two indexes in CSIX: <b>Author </b> and <b> 
AuthorCorp</b>.<p> 
<b>Author</b> - All types of authors are included in this index, ie. CSIRO/external 
and personal/corporate authors.  Assume all authors displayed are CSIRO staff (at time of publication) 
 unless they are specifically designated as 'EXT' (External) in the index, 
eg, <i> Heatwole H (EXT) </i> 
<p> 
<b>AuthorCorp</b> - This index includes entries for CSIRO Corporate Authors  - 
authors of publications in which authorship  is assigned to a CSIRO corporate name, 
rather than to a personal name, eg. 'CSIRO Information Services'.  Corporate or 
Division names are not inverted in this index. 
<p> 
<h4> AUTHOR LOCATIONS </h4> 
Author locations are indicated by an index of place names - the <b> Location </b> 
index, and an index of States - the <b> State </b> index.<p> 
<b>Location</b> - This index includes place names, eg. Parkville, VICTORIA. In this index  
names of States are abbreviated. 
<p> 
<b>State</b> - This index indicates the locations of authors, and includes the States 
of Australia (not abbreviated), and  
'overseas' to indicate non-Australian locations.  This field is relevant only to 
CSIRO authors (personal or corporate authors), not external authors.  Note: Although 
states are not abbreviated in this index, their names 
 are displayed in abbreviated form in the SIMPCI Text Viewer window. 
<p> 
<h4> SEARCHING FOR PUBLICATIONS BY CSIRO DIVISION </h4> 
Two indexes are provided for retrieving CSIRO publications by Division:  <b>  
Division </b> and <b> DivisionOrig </b><p> 
<b>Division</b> - This index contains names of CSIRO Divisions with the names 
inverted, eg, <i> Animal Health, Division of </i> 
<p> 
Only the current name of a Division appears in this index, but all former  
versions of that Division's name will be retrieved by a search on the latest  
name. For example, if you scan the <b> Division </b> index and select <i> Chemicals 
 and Polymers, Division of </i> documents published under all  
previous names of the Division (eg. Division of Applied Chemistry; Division 
 of Applied Organic Chemistry) will also be retrieved. The Division name  
under which the document was actually published will be displayed in the  
citation in the Text Viewer window. 
<p> 
When Division names are selected from this index, records containing 
 personal authors from that Division (and all former Divisions) are retrieved. 
<p> 
For documents by staff of a particular Division (under the name that  
Division had at a particular time), select from the <b> DivisionOrig </b> index.  
For documents corporately authored by a Division, select from the  
<b>  AuthorCorp </b> index. 
<p> 
It is recommended that you search this index using the Scan Index  
technique. If you use the CCL Query Form you should enclose your search  
text in quotes (") and truncate if you don't enter the full name. 
<p> 
<b>DivisionOrig</b> - This index contains the original names of all CSIRO Divisions, 
with the name inverted,  
eg "Building Research, Division of". Select from this index to retrieve the  
names of Divisions under which documents were actually published. 
<p> 
It is recommended that you search this index using the Scan Index technique.  
If you use the CCL Query Form you should enclose your search text in quotes (") 
 and truncate if you don't enter the full name. 
<p> 
<h4> SUBJECT SEARCHING </h4> 
Words from the titles, abstracts and subject descriptors form the Basic Index in 
CSIX, so the easiest way to search for a topic is to enter the terms of interest in 
the Query form.<p> 
For searching on subject index terms, two fields are available: <b> Descriptor </b> 
and <b> ClassCodes</b>.<p> 
<b>Descriptor</b> - Two levels of descriptors are assigned: Major terms and Minor 
Terms.  Records entered prior to 1989 contain Major Terms only. Records entered  
from 1989 onwards contain both Major Terms and Minor Terms. By searching 
 the <b> Descriptor </b> index both types of descriptors may be retrieved. It is 
 possible to limit a search to Major Terms by searching on the <b> wMajorTerm </b>  
component of the Basic index. Similarly, Minor Terms can be searched in  
the <b> wMinorTerm </b>component of the Basic index.<p> 
Some recent records (especially externally-published works) may not  
yet contain Descriptors.  Citations are added promptly to CSIX; indexing terms 
(descriptors) are added somewhat later. 
<p> 
<b>Classification Codes</b> - The  <a href="/cim/csix/csixdbg.app.htm"> 
classification codes</a> (<b> ClassCodes </b> index) are broad subject categories which appear in all 
records from 1978 onwards.   Documents may have more than one classification code. 
Search this index if you are interested in items on a broad general topic. 
<p> 
<h4>TITLE SEARCHING </h4> 
Title words may be searched in the Basic Index, or in its <b> wTitle </b> component. 
<p> 
A specific <b> Title </b> index provides a list of all titles in the database.  The 
<b> Title </b>index enables whole titles (of articles, monographs, etc.) to be 
scanned and searched. Leading articles (A, An, The) have been excluded. Titles 
starting 
 with symbols or numerals appear at the top of the list.<p> 
<h4>DOCUMENT TYPE</h4> 
The DocumentType field appears in all records from 1984 onwards (it does  
not appear in most earlier records). Only one Document Type is given per record: 
<pre> 
<b>Type                   Explanation</b><br> 
<b>Book/book chapter</b>      [includes monographs (single or multivolume) and  
                            extracts from monographs] 
<b>Conference proceedings</b> [includes workshops and seminars; poster abstracts] 
<b>Electronic media</b>       [includes CD-ROMS] 
<b>General scientific</b>     [includes "popular" magazines] 
<b>Information sheet</b>      [includes posters] 
<b>Journal article</b>        [includes an article appearing in a monographic series] 
<b>Miscellaneous</b> 
<b>Newsletter</b> 
<b>Patent</b>                 [used 1969-1977 only] 
<b>Technical report</b> 
<b>Unpublished</b> 
</pre> 
<h4> ISBNs and ISSNs </h4> 
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) are indexed in the <b> ISBN </b> index.  
The numbers have been entered in the form 0306445336 (with no hyphens and no spaces 
between the numbers). 
<p> 
International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs) are indexed in the <b> ISSN </b> index.  
ISSNs have been entered in the form 1030-1887 (hyphens separate the two groups of 
four numbers). 
<p> 
<h4> LIBRARY CALL NUMBER </h4> 
The <b> CallNo </b> (Call Number) index contains a number (usually a Dewey decimal 
number) indicating the shelf  
location of monographs within the CSIRO Index collection at Clayton 
 (VS:CL Index). A small proportion of documents in the database are not  
held in the CSIRO Index collection. In such cases, the CSIRO Library code 
 is displayed, of one location where the document is held (eg. WS:RL).  Only one 
 call number/library holdings code is displayed, though items may actually be 
 held in several locations. More locations may be available in the CSIRO Library System. 
<p> 
<h4>PRICE INFORMATION</h4> 
Price Information is indexed in the <b>  PriceInfo </b> index.  This field was added 
in 1994: it applies only to CSIRO-published works (and externally-published works 
which are sold through the CSIRO Bookshop).  Most records do not contain this data.  
This field so far includes the following variants (only one per record): 
<pre><b>Chapter in Divisional publication 
Chapter in saleable publication 
From Division/Institute only 
Out of print 
Saleable (from CSIRO Bookshop)</b></pre> 
<a name=VPS> </a><hr> 
<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RESULTS</h2> 
<h3>Fieldsets</h3> 
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or  
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets 
 may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save 
 or print. 
<pre><b>Fieldset         Contains</b> 
   B (Brief)	DocumentNo, Author, AuthorCorp, Title, Source, PublYear 
   c (Citation)	Title, Source, PublYear  
   F (Full)	All fields 
   S (Summary)	Title 
</pre> 
<p> 
<h3>Formats</h3> 
<h4>Text-only (ASCII) format</h4>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the 
above lists, and the "Text only" format. The records will be saved to disk 
in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc. 
After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>Courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<p>
<h4>Pro-Cite format</h4>
For saving records in Pro-Cite format, choose an appropriate fieldset, and the "Pro-Cite Bib" format.
The saved file is an ASCII file that may be loaded into a Pro-Cite database.

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<h3>Sample records</h3>
<br><a href=ccreci.htm>Item record</a>
<br><a href=ccrect.htm>Table-of-Contents record</a><p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index of the CC database comprises words from the titles, 
abstracts, author keywords and ISI keywords of individual item records.  
<p>
The Basic index is the default index for searching when no index is 
specified in the search. Case is not specific in searching - it does not matter whether you use upper or lower case in entering your search terms. Further details on searching the Basic index are given in the <a href=#TIPS> Searching Tips </a>section.<p>
<p>
<h4>Components of the Basic index</h4>
Components of the Basic Index may be searched in the CCL Query Form 
(toolbar button 3). 
The "w" prefix to the fieldname (search element) is a convention used to indicate that each word is searchable.
<pre><b>
Search element   Field content     Examples</b> (This is the search syntax shown
                                    in the Set History window)

wTitle	         Title of article    <b>find wtitle=(bird species)</b>
                                     wTitle contains the phrase <i>bird species</i>

wAbstract        Abstract of article <b>find wabstract=(feeding same birds)</b>
		                     the word <i>feeding</i> is in the same sentence
                                     as <i>birds</i> in the abstract

wDescriptor      Author keywords     <b>find wdescriptor=(bird diets)</b>
                                     "bird diets" is either an author-keyword 
                                      or an ISI-keyword
</pre>
The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown 
above. Use the drop-down list in the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search 
screen (SIMWWW) to select the Basic Index, or one of its components (which are prefixed by a 'w').  These components may not be scanned individually with the SCAN command (or 
the A-Z icon), though the Basic index as a whole may be scanned.<p>
<a name=SEC> </a>
<h3>Secondary indexes</h3>
The secondary indexes may be searched from the CCL Query Form (toolbar
 button 3) or from the Scan Index Terms window (toolbar button 6, or 
function key 6), then selecting from the drop-down list.
<p>
In the SIMWWW gateway, use the A-Z icon or the Simple Search screen.
<p>
All secondary indexes in CC are indexed with the "whole phrase" method. 
That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. Although 
information may be retrieved from the secondary indexes by 
using the CCL Query Form, the recommended search technique is to use 
the Scan Index Terms window and select from the list of entries in the index. <p>
If you do use the CCL Query Form to search the secondary 
indexes, <b> make sure </b> you use the truncation symbol (?) at the start or end of your search string unless you have entered all the text to be found in the field. For example, the journal index contains not only the journal title but also the issue de
tails (eg, 'journal of neuroscience methods 1994 v 53 n 2 aug')<br>
The secondary indexes with a "toc" prefix provide direct access to TOC 
records. All other secondary indexes are for elements of individual item 
records. Further details on searching the Secondary indexes for data elements such as author name, journal title, etc are given in the <a href=#TIPS> Searching Tips </a>section.<p>

<a name=WOR></a>
<h3>Searching for Words (Searching the Basic Index)</h3>
Source journals for CC are published in Australia, North America and Europe.
 Variants in spellings (such as labour/labor, organisation/organization) do
 occur in the database. When searching, use OR to retrieve variants,
eg, labor OR labour. You can also use the masking characters "?" (which
matches zero or more characters) or "#" (exactly one character).
<pre>eg,	<b>labo?r</b>          retrieves <i>labor, labour</i>
	<b>organi#e</b>        retrieves <i>organise, organize</i>
</pre>
The "?" is also a truncation symbol - use it when searching for plurals or other words with the same stem:
<pre>eg,	<b> electron? </b>        retrieves <i> electron, electronic, electronics, electrons </i> 
</pre>
<p>
<a name=AUTN></a>
<h3>Searching for Author Names (Searching the Author Index)</h3>
In the CCL Query Form select the Author index.   
Type the author name and initials in the query box:   
<PRE>	day mf</PRE>     
then click the FIND button.  Results will appear in the Set History window.  <p> 
If you are unsure of the initials, truncate your search with the '?'
<PRE>	day m? </PRE>
and you will retrieve all authors with a first initial 'M' (Day M, Day MB, Day MF, and so on).   
<p>
In author names in Current Contents (CC), hyphens, apostrophes and spaces are 'stripped out' by ISI (the publisher of CC) before CSIRO receives the data, so these characters do not appear in author names in the CC database in SIM.  
Do not include hyphens, apostrophes or spaces in your author search, eg in CC search for:<br> 
<pre>	staveleysmith l     NOT    staveley-smith l
	tyndalebiscoe ch    NOT    tyndale-biscoe ch
	vandermeulen cj     NOT    van der meulen cj
	vangerwen ac        NOT    van gerwen ac
	obrien cj           NOT    o'brien cj 
</pre><p>
When searching for particular authors a good technique is to use the Scan Index function (A-Z icon), and 
select from the list of index entries.<p> 
<p>
<a name=JOTI></a>
<h3>Searching for Journal Titles</h3>
<h4>A particular journal title </h4>
To find any issue of a particular journal title, eg <i>Journal of Applied Polymer   
Science</i><br>   
In the CCL Query Form select the Journal index.    
Type in the query box:   
 <PRE> journal of applied polymer science?</PRE>  
then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the truncation symbol (?).  Because this index includes the entire value of the field (including issue details as well as journal title), you must truncate your search in order to retrieve something.
A search on the <b> journal </b> index will retrieve individual item records.  If you wish to retrieve Table of Contents (TOC) records, select the 
<b> tocjournal </b> index instead of the <b> journal </b> index.<p> 
<h4>A particular issue of a journal title </h4>
To find a particular issue of a journal title, eg <i>Journal of Applied Polymer   
Science</i>, volume 54, number 1, October 3rd, 1994<P>   
In the CCL Query Form select the Journal index.     
Type in the query box:   
<PRE>	journal of applied polymer science 1994 v 54 n 1 Oct 3</PRE>   
then click the FIND button. 
A search on the <b> journal </b> index will retrieve individual item records.  If you wish to retrieve Table of Contents (TOC) records, select the 
<b> tocjournal </b> index instead of the <b> journal </b> index.<p> 
[Note: if you wish to locate a particular journal issue, it is    
easier to use the A-Z Toolbar button (no 6 in SIMPCI ) to open the Scan Index terms window,   
select the Journal index, scan for the journal name or part of it, then   
highlight the issue you want and search for it (double click the   
highlighted item(s) or click the Search button).  Scanning an   
index allows you to see exactly what data elements are there, and the    
order in which they are presented.]<P>
<h4> Journal Titles containing 'and' </h4>
To find a journal title containing the word <b> and </b>, eg <i>Accident Analysis and   
Prevention</i><P>   
In the CCL Query Form select the Journal index.  Type in the   
query box:   
<pre>	"accident analysis and prevention"?</pre>   
then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the quotation symbols (").  You must use these to retrieve the word 
<b> and </b> in order to distinguish it from the Boolean operator <b> and. </b><p>   
Alternatively, use the Scan Index function (A-Z icon) to scan the index and select the item you want.<p>    
<h4> Journal Titles containing an ampersand (&amp) </h4>
Ampersands (&amp) are not currently stored in the Journal index to CC.  If the title you wish to retrieve   
contains an ampersand, please ignore that character and scan or search for the title as if the ampersand is not   
present.<p>   
For example, search for the title <i>Computers &amp Geosciences</i> by typing:   
<pre>	computers geosciences</pre>   
in the CCL Query form or by scanning for this in the Scan Index form.<p>   
We hope to correct the omission of ampersands in CC indexes in a future re-load of CC.     
If you are uncertain whether the AND in a journal title is represented by an ampersand or the word AND, use   
the Scan Index function to check both versions in the index.<p>   
<a name=SEAD></a>
<h3>Searchable Data</h3>
The Basic index and all the secondary indexes except those with the "toc" prefix 
provide direct access to the CC individual item records.
  This means that individual items may be retrieved by:
<ul>
<li>words from title, abstract and keywords;
<li>author name and initials;
<li>author's affiliation (address);
<li>document type;
<li>language of publication of the article;
<li>number of references cited in the article;
<li>journal title;
<li>ISSN;
<li>publication year;
<li>keywords (author-assigned and ISI-assigned [also known as KeyWords 
Plus&#174;]), when available in the record;
<li>page number of start of citation;
<li>CC edition (eg, AGRI, BEHA, CLIN, LIFE, PHYS, TECH);
<li>CC issue number
<li>CC broad subject category; 
<li>The Genuine Article&#174; (TGA) number;
<li>date loaded in to SIM.
</ul>
In general, when searching a secondary index using the CCL Query Form 
it is not necessary to use double quotes (") around the query terms, 
unless your search term contains commas, parentheses or special words such as 'and'. 
If in doubt, put quotes around your text. Use the truncation symbol (?) if 
you are not entering the entire value of the field in your query. 
Note that the truncation symbol should be placed outside any 
quotes, eg  "agri"?
<p>
The recommended technique for searching secondary indexes is to scan 
the index, then pick from the list.<p>
<a name=TOCR></a>
<h3>Table of Contents (TOC) Records</h3>
Table of contents (TOC) records may be directly searched using the four 
indexes whose names are prefixed by "toc" (see the list of Secondary indexes).
<p>
<a name=TOCS></a>
<h4>Browsing TOC Records by Subject</h4>
To browse TOC records by subject, use the tocCCedition index 
in which the edition type (<b>AGRI, BEHA, CLIN, LIFE, PHYS, 
TECH</b>) is given together with volume and issue details.  Use the Scan Index 
feature to select a specific edition and issue, or several issues.  Alternatively, search 
the tocCCedition index (remember to truncate your search, eg. <b>tech?</b>) 
in the CCL Query Form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW).
<br>
Alternatively, browse TOC records via the subject categories.  Use the 
tocCategory index, which indexes the broad CC subject categories associated 
with each CC edition.  A list of these categories, for each CC subset, is 
given in the Appendices. Note that in SIM, however, these categories will be 
displayed in alphabetical order when the tocCategory index is scanned.
<p>
<a name=TOCJ></a>
<h4>Browsing TOC Records by Journal Title</h4>
Use the tocJournal index to select issues of a particular journal whose 
contents pages you wish to scan.  
<br>
Alternatively, search for contents pages of a particular journal, by 
choosing the tocJournal index in the CCL Query Form, and enter the name of 
the journal in the query text box. Remember to use truncation if you don't
wish to search for particular volume and issue details, eg "journal of 
neuroscience methods"?
<p>
<a name=TOCT></a>
<h4>Retrieving TOC records by TGA number</h4>
TOC records may also be retrieved by searching for The Genuine Article&#174; 
number in the tocGenArtNo index.<p>
<hr>
<a name=VPS> </a>
<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RECORDS</h2>
<h3>Fieldsets</h3>
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or 
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets 
may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save or 
print.
<pre>
<b>Fieldset                  Shows</b>
    A (Abstract)	DocNo, wTitle, Author, Journal, PageNumber, wAbstract, wDescriptor, tocPage
    B (Brief)		DocNo, wTitle, Author, Journal, PageNumber, wDescriptor, tocPage
    C (Citation)	DocNo, wTitle, Author, Journal, PageNumber, tocPage
    F (Full)		All fields
    S (Summary)		DocNo, wTitle, tocPage
</pre>
If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full).
<p>
<h3>Saving Records to Disk</h3>
<b>Text-only (ASCII) format</b><br>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the 
above lists, and the "Text only" format. The records will be saved to disk 
in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc. 
After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<p>
<b>Pro-Cite formats</b><br>
For saving records in Pro-Cite format the following options are available:
<pre>
<b>ProCite-Bib  CC</b>       Pro-Cite RecordType (ie, C), Author, Title, 
                      Journal title, Date, vol no, issue no, page numbers.
   
<b>ProCite-Medium  CC</b>    Pro-Cite RecordType (ie, C) containing: Author, 
                      Reprint author, Title, Journal title, Date, Vol no,
                      Issue no, Page numbers, ISSN, Language, Document 
                      type, Genuine Article Number, Descriptors (Keywords).
   
<b>ProCite-Full  CC   </b>   Pro-Cite RecordType (ie, C), Author, Reprint author,
                      Title, Journal title, Date, vol no, issue no, 
                      page numbers, ISSN, Language, Document type, 
                      Abstract, Genuine Article Number, Descriptors (Keywords).
</pre>
Please note that the ProCite formats are intended for use with CC individual item records, not TOC records.<p>
Each record output from the SIM CC database includes a copyright attribution statement. This attribution 
is required by ISI, the publisher of CC, to be given in all CC outputs.  If you have generated a Pro-Cite format file from CC and then load the file into a word processor, you will observe that the copyright attribution statement appears 
among other fields in the "medium" or "complete" Pro-Cite formats, not at 
the end as it does in the "bib" format. 
For Pro-Cite output from SIM the attribution has been placed in the highest available 
unused Pro-Cite field for CC records, hence its appearance before data (such as the 
abstract) which has a higher field number in Pro-Cite.<p>
<b>Reference Manager format</b><br>
Reference Manager format is a tagged format which conforms with 
Reference Manager "RIS format specifications" for journal references. 
To save records in Reference Manager format use the following format:  
Ref-Manager  CC
<p>
Please note that the Reference Manager format is intended for use with CC individual item records, not TOC records.<p>

<H3>Coverage</H3>

The DHS database is a standard list of designated hazardous substances. There are 1,959 entries with some substances duplicated under variant names. The access and use of the DHS database is restricted to CSIRO staff only. 

<P>The DHS database acts as a "front end" to the CSIRO Materials Safety Datasheets database (MSDS). Most of the DHS records have hypertext links to the corresponding MDSD records. Those substances without a hypertext link to MSDS are in the process of hav

ing the corresponding MSDS sheet prepared.

<P>Note that you do not have to select the MSDS as well as the DHS from the list to use the link between them. Clicking on the hypertext link in DHS will activate the MSDS database for you.

<H3>Basic Index</H3>

The Basic Index of the DHS database consists of two fields, risk phrases and safety phrases.
The Basic Index is the default index when no other index is specified in the search. Case does not need to be specified in searching - it does not matter whether you use upper or lower case in entering your search terms. This index can be used 
to search for specific risk or safety phrases.
<P>
<p>Alternately, each component of the Basic Index can be searched separately.

<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>

<P><TABLE border=4 cellpadding=3>

<TD width=20%>find wSafetyPhrases=Keep out of reach of children</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<p>The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above. Use
the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW) to select a
search element. These elements may not be scanned individually with the SCAN
command (A-Z icon), though the Basic index as a whole may be scanned. 

<A NAME="secindex"></A>
<H3>Secondary Indexes</H3>

The difference between using the secondary indexes and the basic index is that in the basic index the individual words of chemical names, or separate numerical fragments of the CAS number are separately indexed, whereas in the secondary index the whole value of the name or number is indexed.<BR>

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<a href=msdsrec.htm><b>Sample record</b></a>
<p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index contains all the free text words used in the descriptive
 fields, ie this is a "word" index.  The Basic Index is the default index 
for searching when no index is specified.  It is not suitable for 
searching on chemical names (for this purpose, use the secondary index "Names" 
outlined below).
<p>
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>
The following fields of the record are included in the Basic Index:
<dl>
<dt>Dangerous goods field
<dt>Uses field
<dt>Product characteristics fields:
<dd>- Appearance, Solubility, Other properties, Ingredients in mixture.
<dt>Health hazard data fields: - all information.
<dt>First aid information fields: - all information.
<dt>Precautions for use fields: - all information.
<dt>Safe handling information fields: - all information.
</dl>
All these fields are indexed by SIM using the "word" indexing method, and 
this is indicated by the leading "w" in the names (search prefixes) of 
these indexes.
<pre><b>
Search prefix	Field content</b>
<b>wAdviceToDr</b>     First Aid information:  Advice to doctor
<b>wAppearance</b>     Product characteristics:  Appearance
<b>wChronicEffect</b>  Health hazard data:  Chronic health effects
<b>wEffectEye</b>      Health hazard data:  Effect on eyes
<b>wEffectInhale</b>   Health hazard data:  Effect of inhaling
<b>wEffectSkin</b>     Health hazard data:  Effect on skin
<b>wEffectSwallow</b>  Health hazard data:  Effect of swallowing
<b>wEnginControl</b>   Precautions for use:  Engineering controls
<b>wExposureStd</b>    Precautions for use:  Exposure standards
<b>wFAidEye</b>        First Aid information:  For eye contact
<b>wFAidInhale</b>     First Aid information:  For inhalation
<b>wFAidSkin</b>       First Aid information:  For skin contact
<b>wFAidSwallow</b>    First Aid information:  If swallowed
<b>wFireExplosion</b>  Safe handling information:  Fire/explosion hazard
<b>wFlammability</b>   Precautions for use:  Flammability
<b>wIngredientMix</b>  Product characteristics:  Ingredients in mixture
<b>wOtherInfo</b>      Safe handling information:  Other information
<b>wOtherProperty</b>  Product characteristics:  Other properties
<b>wProtection</b>     Precautions for use:  Personal protection
<b>wSolubility</b>     Product characteristics:  Solubility in water
<b>wSpillDisposal</b>  Safe handling information:  Spills and disposals
<b>wStoreTransport</b> Safe handling information:  Storage and transport
<b>wUses</b>           Uses
</pre>
Search prefixes may be used to specify components of the Basic Index.
<p>
For searching using SIMPCI, choose one of the fields from the drop down list
 in the CCL Query 
Form (Button 3).
<p>
These are examples showing the search syntax which appears in the Set History 
window when one of the components of the basic Index is searched.
<pre>
<b>find wchroniceffect=(liver damage)
find wstoretransport=(impact)
find wfireexplosion=(toxic fumes)
</b></pre>
The components of the Basic Index may be searched separately as the 
examples above show. 
However, they may not be scanned individually with the Scan function. The 
Basic index as a whole may be scanned, and a selection made from the list.
<a name=SEC> </a>
<p>
<h3b>Secondary Indexes</h3>
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI by using the FIND icon 
(Button 3), and selecting the appropriate field from the dropdown list in 
the CCL Query Form, or by using the SCAN icon (Button 6) and selecting 
terms from the appropriate indexes.
<p>
In SIMWWW use the Find button and the dropdown list in the Simple Search screen;
 or use the A-Z icon to open the Scan Indexes form.
<p>
All secondary indexes in MSDS are indexed by SIM with the "whole phrase" method.
  That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. Although 
information may be retrieved from the secondary indexes by using the CCL 
Query Form, the recommended search technique in SIMPCI is to scan the index
 and select from the resulting list. If you do use the CCL Query Form to search 
these indexes, make sure you truncate your search text with the "?" symbol if
 you do not enter an entire value for the field.
<p>
<pre><b>
Index        Field content     Examples</b>
CASnumber    CAS numbers       <b>118-96-7</b>
Date         Date of creation  <b>930309</b>
HAZCHEMcode  HAZCHEM code      <b>2we</b>
Name         Chemical name     <b>2,4,6-trinitrotoluene</b>
             Trade names       <b>entsufon</b>
             Other names       <b>tnt</b>
UNnumber     UN number         <b>1356</b>
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Notes on Secondary Indexes</h3>
<b>CAS number</b><br>
CAS number should only be searched on the full number; truncation gives 
unpredictable results.
<p>
<b>Date</b><br>
Searching can only be done on the full date. Use the relational operations 
in the CCL Query Form to search partial dates. Truncation does not work. 
eg. select the Date Index; click the = button. Click on the numeric operator. 
The search will look like this: <b>f date>=930000</b>.
<p>
<b>Name</b><br>
It was decided to make the Name Index a secondary index so that names 
could be scanned ie. names are not included in the Basic Index. The 
latter is a word index which would have broken complex chemical names into 
unsearchable fragments. Unfortunately, this means that simple 
chemical names (eg. "ammonium fluoride"), do not appear in the basic index. 
The Name index includes chemical, product and trade names and can be 
scanned and searched. If the name includes punctuation such as commas or
 parentheses, you should enclose your search text with double quotes 
(") if you are searching in the CCL Query Form.
<p>
<b>UN number</b><br>
UN numbers cannot be reliably searched or scanned.  This is due to a parsing 
problem which we hope will be fixed in the future.  The difficulty is that 
some of the numbers have a qualifier in brackets after them, causing them 
to be filed in a different sequence in the scan index.  Searching on the 
full number is successful, but truncation only works if the number has a
 qualifier.
<a name=TIPS> </a>
<p>
<h3>Searching Tips</h3>
<b>Names</b><br>
Finding chemical, trade and product names can be done most easily using 
the Scan Index facility (PCI toolbar button 6); A-Z icon in SIMWWW.
<p>
<b>Fields not indexed</b><br>
These fields are not indexed because of inconsistency in the data:
<dl>
<dt><dd>Boiling point
<dt><dd>Melting point
<dt><dd>Vapour pressure
<dt><dd>Specific gravity
<dt><dd>Flammability limits
<dt><dd>Flash point
<dt><dd>Auto-ignition temperature
</dl>

use one of the system defaults. These defaults are the same as the Output 
formats listed above. Use the Toolbar Display Fields Icon in SIMPCI and 
the SHOW or SUMMARISE commands in SIMCLI.
<p>
<h3>Saving records to disk</h3>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the above list,
 and the "Text-only" format. The records will be saved to disk in ASCII format
and may be loaded into an application program or emailed, etc.

<h3>Coverage</h3>
The SCAN database corresponds to <i>Scan</i>file, a weekly current awareness printed
bulletin compiled by the Corporate Library &amp; Information Service. 
It is produced primarily for the staff of CSIRO, but the printed edition
is also available to industry, business, government agencies, research and
educational institutions, and the community. SCAN is eclectic in that 
articles are selected to cover current and emerging issues in research
management and science and technology policy. Subject content is science
and technology policy, R&amp;D management, social and economic issues of
 R&amp;D, personnel management, corporate intelligence. Over 200 current 
Australian and international journals are scanned. Titles of journals include:
<i>Harvard Business Review, Search, Scitech, Management Decision, 
Management World, Journal for Quality and Participation, Long Range Planning,
Science, Nature, New Scientist, Prometheus, Human Resource Management</i>.

<h2>SEARCHING THE DATABASE</h2>
<h3>Sample record</h3>
<img src=scanrec.gif>
<a name=BI> </a>
<p>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index of the SCAN database comprises words from the title and
abstract of each record.  The Basic Index is the default index for searching when no index is
specified in the search. eg.
<pre><b>find commercialisation</b>      (searches for the word <i>commercialisation</i>
			     in the Basic Index)
<b>find intellectual property</b>  (searches for the phrase <i>intellectual property</i>
                             in the Basic Index)</pre>
When searching you can specify components of the Basic Index.
<p>
<h3>Components of the Basic Index</h3>
The `w' at the start of the prefix is a convention used to indicate that each <i>word</i> in
the search element is searchable.
<pre><b>Search Element   Field content         Examples</b> (This is the search syntax
					shown in the Set History window)

wTitle          Title of article       <b>find wtitle=intellectual property</b>
wAbstract       Abstract of article    <b>find wabstract=collaborative research</b></pre>
The components of the Basic index may be searched separately as shown above.
Use the CCL Query form (SIMPCI), or the Simple Search screen (SIMWWW)
to select a search element. These elements may not be scanned individually
with the SCAN command (A-Z icon), though the Basic index as a
whole may be scanned.
<p>
<a name=SEC> </a>
<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3
The secondary indexes may be searched in SIMPCI by using toolbar button 6, 
(or function key 6) to open the Scan Index Terms window, choosing an index, then selecting from the list of terms.
Alternatively they may be selected and searched in the CCL Query Form (SIMPCI).
<p>
In the SIMWWW gateway, use the A-Z icon or the Simple Search screen.
<p>
All secondary indexes in SCAN are indexed with the 'whole phrase' method. 
That is, the entire value of a field is stored in the index. Information
may be retrieved from the secondary indexes as shown in the examples below. 
It is necessary to use the truncation symbol (?) if the search term you 
enter does not include the entire value of the field. However, the 
recommended search technique is to scan the index and select from the 
resulting list.
<pre><b>Search Prefix   Field content               Examples</b>        
  
Author          Author names and initials   <b>mitchell gr</b>
CreationTime    System-assigned time of     <b>79644000</b> 
                  database record creation
DocNumber       Unique record number        <b>950201</b>
Issue           Issue number                <b>649</b>
Journal         Journal name                <b>new scientist</b>
PublYear        Year published              <b>1995</b>
</pre>
<a name=TIPS> </a>
<h3>Searching tips</h3>
There is an abstract included in every record. 
<p>
There are no subject indexing terms in SCAN so for subject searching
 use the Basic index. 
<p>
Source journals for SCAN are published in Australia, North America and Europe.
 Variants in spellings (such as labour/labor, organisation/organization) do
 occur in the Basic index. When searching, use OR to retrieve variants, 
eg. labor OR labour. You can also use the masking characters "?" (which 
matches zero or more characters) or "#" (exactly one character).
<pre>eg.	<b>labo?r</b>          retrieves <i>labor, labour</i>
	<b>organi#e</b>        retrieves <i>organise, organize</i>
</pre>
The "?" is also a truncation symbol - use it when searching for plurals or other words with the same stem:
<pre>eg,	<b> commerc? </b>        retrieves <i> commerce, commercial, commercialisation </i> 
</pre>
<p>
Note that authors' initials are blocked together with no space between them.
<pre>eg.  <b>abbott ge</b></pre>
All initial articles (A, An, The) are removed from the start of the 
journal names except for those in a few titles such as <i> The Bulletin </i>, <i> The Times</i>, 
etc. In order to search these few journal names properly the 'The'
 must be included in your search.
<pre>eg.  <b>the bulletin</b></pre>
Alternatively, use the Scan Index Terms operation and pick from the list. The
few titles retaining an initial 'The' will file under T.

<h2>VIEWING, PRINTING and SAVING RESULTS</h2>
<h3>Fieldsets</h3>
Fieldsets enable different parts of the record to be viewed, printed or 
saved to disk. If no fieldset is chosen, the default is F (Full). Fieldsets 
may be chosen in various windows depending on whether you wish to save or 
print.
<pre><b>Fieldset         Contains</b>
   B (Brief)     wTitle
   F (Full)      All fields
   S (Summary)   DocNumber, wTitle, Author, Source, PublYear
</pre>
<h3>Saving records to disk</h3>
When saving records to disk, choose an appropriate fieldset from the 
above lists, and the 'Text-only' format. The records will be saved to disk
 in ASCII format and may be loaded into an application program or 
emailed, etc.  After you load the records into your word processor, make sure you select the entire file and change your font to <b>courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.
<p>
<h3>Document supply</h3>
SCAN users who have identified relevant citations in SIM should first contact their Divisional Librarian for supply of the original documents.  Please quote the SCAN Document number, eg. <b>930245</b> in your request.<p>
If the item is not held in your library your Divisional Librarian will arrange an inter-library loan for you from the Corporate Library &amp; Information Service. 
<p>
(<b>Note</b>: All requests must comply with the Copyright Act 1968 as amended.)

<h2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</h2> 
<h3>6 December 1995</h3> 
<p>First issued 29 August 1995
<hr> 
<h3>Contents:</h3> 
 
<p>I.	Quick browsing in SIMPCI<br> 
II.	Interrupt function in SIMPCI<br>
III.	Configuring options in SIMWWW 
		
<p><b>I. Quick browsing in SIMPCI</b> 

<p>After retrieving a set result, you can view the titles by clicking icon 
number 8 to open the Summary List window. 

<p>Quick browsing - to move through the set 10 records at a time, click on 
the scroll bar near the up or down arrow.

<p>To move through the set one record at a time - click on either arrow in the 
scroll bar.

<p><b>II. Interrupt function in SIMPCI</b>

<p>To interrupt a long search - <b>such as an SDI or saved search</b> - or 
a <b>save to disk operation</b>, click on the STATE button in the right hand 
corner of the SIM toolbar. If you have interrupted a save to disk operation 
then the message 'dump cancelled' will be displayed. Click on OK to return to 
searching.

<p>Please note that, unfortunately, this will not interrupt printing.

 <p><b>III. Configuring options in SIMWWW</b>
 
 <p>Use the Configure icon, (the ninth icon <b>on the SIMWWW form</b>) to configure certain user options. 
 
 <p><b>Make sure that when you change an option, you scroll down to the 
bottom of the screen and click on the "Update user configuration" button.</b>
 
 <p>An example of this is could be to select a default database for log on. 
This means that whenever you log on you are connected to the database you 
selected as the default. That database name will be displayed immediately 
under the Databases icon.
 
 <p>Important note: With generic userids, if one person changes the 
configuration (eg. to choose a default database), all users of that generic id will be affected.

<h2>An occasional series of SIM searching tips from CIS</h2>

<h3>6 December 1995</h3>
<p>[First issued 9 October 1995]
<hr>

<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>I. Search limits in SIMPCI 1.1d<br>
II.	Saving search strategies (SIMPCI)<br>
III.	Editing saved search strategies (SIMPCI)<br>
IV.	Sending saved search strategies (SIMPCI)<br>
V.	Sending saved search results

<p><b>I. Search limits in SIMPCI 1.1d</b>
		
<p>SIMPCI 1.1d has a limit of 256 characters in one search string. For example, if you have many sets to OR together, you should highlight only about 25 to combine at a time:
<p><pre>eg.  s=1 OR s=2 OR s=3 .....OR s=25</pre>

<p>If you wanted to combine more than 25, do them in groups then OR 
together the sets representing the groups:
<p><pre>eg.
<p>s76          s=1 OR s=2 OR s=3 ...OR s=25
s77          s=26 OR s=27 OR s=28 ... OR s=50
s78          s=51 OR s=52 OR s=53 ... OR s=75
s79          s=76 OR s=77 OR s=78</pre>

<p>SIMPCI 1.3 has no limits on search statement length.

<p><b>II. Saving search strategies (SIMPCI)</b>

<p>Search strategies may be saved with options given in the Set History window Operations menu. You may save a strategy for use in a particular database, use in any database, or as an SDI.

<p>In order to save a search using the SIMPCI client, you must first highlight the set or sets you want to save.

<p>If you are not sure about which option you want to use for saving a search 
(ie. Create Saved Search with Base, Create Saved Search without Base, Create SDI), then save the search without a base first. You can then re-run it and re-save it as one of the other options, giving each a slightly different name.
<p><pre>eg.
cat.sav (for search without base)
catcsix.sav (for search in CSIX i.e. with base)
catcc.sdi (for the same search run as an SDI in Current Contents)</pre>

<p>Note: There is presently a bug in SIMWWW which does not allow you to do this.

<p><b>Full documentation for saving searches can be found in the SIMPCI 
Tutorial.</b>

<p><b>III. Editing saved search strategies</b>

<p>Saved search strategies can be edited and renamed. First, click Icon 4 to open the Saved Search form, then use File Open to load your search into the window.

<p>To edit comment lines into a saved search, follow this procedure:

<p>1.	The first line must be blank.<br>
2. You can insert a line after the initial blank one which is your message 
preceded by a hash (#).<br>
3. If the database name is present in the saved search, it will appear on the third line.<br>
4. If you want another comment lower down in the same search you cannot use #  again (it tells you already have a set # and you cannot have 
another one).  You may use other non-numeric characters such as *. <br>
5. When you run the search you will receive a parameter such as: 
 
<p><pre># FIND {Whatever message you have typed in}
eg.	# FIND This search was first run 10 Aug 95.</pre>
 
<p>with the resultant number of hits being zero. That will not affect your "real" search parameters which have real numbers.<br>

<p>Note: You must not have a blank line within the search.

<p>If you wish to save your search strategy with another name, use the File Save As option. Be aware that if you run the edited search it will automatically be saved and will overwrite the original. Therefore if you wish to retain the original version, save the new version under another name before running it.

<p><b>IV. Sending saved search strategies</b>

<p>Saved search strategies can also be copied and transferred to another machine or person.

<p><b>SIMPCI:</b><br>
 Copy the .sav file to a diskette using Windows File Manager <b>or</b> highlight and copy the search to the Windows clipboard and then paste it into an email message and send to the other person).

<p><b>SIMWWW:</b> <br>
1. In the Search Result Sets window choose the 'Capture' radio button (on the Search Strategy line), then click the 'Process' button. This will take you to the Print Search Strategy window. <br>
2. Click the <b>Email to:</b> radio button and type in an email address (making sure to include the whole address, even if you are emailing someone in your own domain). <br>
3. Click the 'Process' button. SIM will take you back to the Search Result Set window and will produce a message verifying that the search strategy has been sent.

<p><b>V. Sending saved search results</b>

<p><b> SIMPCI:</b><br>
Although you cannot cut and paste directly from within SIM to your word processor or email software,  you can easily do so with the plain text file which is saved from SIM:

<p>1.	Perform your search.<br>
2. Highlight the set you want, and choose 'Operations Save' in the Set 
History window. (This saves results of the set to disk).  The Process 
Records form will open.<br>
3. Choose the appropriate Fieldset in the upper 'Use Fieldsets' box (i.e. 
Full, Summary, Citation, etc.), and Text-only in the lower 'Use Record 
Format(s)' box, then click the 'Process'  button.<br> 
4. You will be prompted to enter a file name, and you can choose  the 
drive and directory too. The records will be saved to disk in a plain 
ASCII file.  

<p>You can load this file into your word processor, cut and paste from it, 
attach it to  your email software, etc. (If you view it in your word processor, 
view it with the courier font - this is a  fixed-space font, and the spacing will 
then look OK.)

<p><b>SIMWWW:</b> <br>
1. Click on the Search Result Sets icon (which is the sixth icon from the left of the screen - the 'S1,S2' button).<br>
2. Select the 'Capture' radio button (on the <b>Records in Set</b> line) and click the 'Process' button. The Capture Records screen will appear. <br>
3. Select the <b>Email to:</b> and <b>Records in Range</b> radio buttons - nominating the results you wish to send. <br>
4. Choose the appropriate Style (for emailing, usually Text-only) and Field Set and  type in an email address (making sure to include the whole address, even if you are emailing someone in your own domain). <br>
5. Click the 'Process' button. SIM will take you back to the Search Result Sets window and will produce a message verifying that the search has been sent.

<h2>Introduction </h2>
The <a href="../simoverv.htm"> SIM software implementation </a> within 
CSIRO provides a high quality information service to scientists, managers and
staff.  Several databases are available, and more are planned.
<hr>
<a name=SDB></a>
<h2>SIM Databases </h2>
Each SIM database is named with a brief mnemonic code, eg CSIX for CSIRO Index. 
Labels or aliases for groups of databases may also be assigned, eg, CC is 
the label assigned to a group of databases containing issues of Current
Contents.<p>
Databases are listed alphabetically by name.<p>  Users of the SIMPCI will
notice two alphabetical sequences: simple database names are in the first
sequence; names which are 'aliases' for a group of databases appear in the
second sequence. 'CC' is an alias for separate groups of CC issues, so it 
appears at the end of the list. So far, 'CC' is the only alias in use.<p>
<hr>
<a name=IXS></a>
<h2>Indexes in SIM databases</h2>
SIM databases consist of 'records'.  For example, in a database which consists of bibliographic citations and abstracts, a 'record' comprises a citation and its associated abstract, subject indexing and other information.  <p>
Records are comprised of different data elements, eg author, journal title, volume number and so on.  Subsets of the data in a record are identified as 
'fields' ( a field may contain one data element, or a group of data elements.)  The field structure of records is consistent within any one 
database, (eg, all authors are in the AUTHOR field).  Though the record 
structure varies between databases, consistency in field labels and content 
across databases is sought by the database designers.<p>
In order for the searcher to be able to retrieve data from the record (or 
from the individual fields of a record), the data must be indexed.  An index 
can include data from more than one field, and SIM allows multiple indexes 
to be defined for a database.  SIM has two types of indexes:  the Basic Index,
 and Secondary indexes.  These are predefined by the database designers 
and system administrator.<p>
<a name=BIX></a>
<h3>Basic Index</h3>
The Basic Index generally incorporates the words from the principal text 
fields of a database.  For example, in a bibliographic database, the Basic Index would
 usually comprise words from the title, abstract, and subject descriptor (keywords)
fields.<p>
The Basic Index may be searched via the CCL Query form (SIMPCI) or the Find screen (SIMWWW).  Its component fields (eg wTitle) may also be searched in the same way.<p>
The Basic Index may also be scanned and searched by means of the Scan Index terms function (A-Z icon) in both SIMPCI and SIMWWW.<p>
The Basic Index is the default index for searching or scanning if no other index is specified.<p>
<a name=SIX></a>
<h3>Secondary Indexes</h3>
Secondary indexes are additional indexes for specific fields eg: authors, subjects, date, etc.  Currently each SIM database has its secondary indexes indexed in a special way, so that the complete contents of a field forms the index entry.  This enables t
he searcher to scan the index and pick from the list of entries.
However, it also means that if you are searching for only one word or part of a field entry in a secondary index you must truncate your search term (at the start and/or at the end).  The truncation symbol is the question mark:  ?<p>
The Secondary Indexes may be searched via the CCL Query form (SIMPCI) or the Find screen (SIMWWW).  Index names are selected from a drop-down list.<p>
The Secondary Indexes may also be scanned and searched by means of the Scan Index terms function (A-Z icon) in both SIMPCI and SIMWWW. Index names are selected from a drop-down list, and you can jump to any point in the index by scanning for the start of 
your search term.  The scan-and-search technique is the most effective for searching a secondary index, since you can see the entries that actually appear in the index and select those that are relevant.<p>
<hr>
<a name=TPM></a>
<h2>Truncation and Pattern Matching</h2>
Special symbols can be used in your search so that you can search for variants of words, or words with specific stems.  These retrieval techniques are known as 'truncation', 'stemming', 'masking' or 'pattern matching'.  The special symbols are sometimes k
nown as 'wildcards'.<p>
<a name=TRU></a>
<h3>Truncation</h3>
The 'truncation' technique enables you to retrieve word with a specific stem. The truncation symbol is the question mark:  ?   <p>
Both left-hand and right-hand truncation are available.  When you enter search text, put the truncation symbol immediately after (or before) the word stem, with NO INTERVENING SPACE.  <p>
You may use <p>
<dl>
<dd><pre><b>?</b>      unlimited number of characters<br>
<dd><b>?<i>n</i></b>     specify a maximum number of characters (<b><i>n</i></b>) to precede or follow the word stem.</pre><p>
</dl>
Examples:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  elect?  </pre>
<dd>Unlimited truncation - searches for terms with the stem <I> elect </i> - <i> elect, electric, electrically, electricity, electrified, electrifies, electrify, electrode, electrodes, electron, electrons </i> <p>
<dt><pre>  elect?4  </pre> 
<dd>Truncation from zero to 4 characters - retrieves all records containing terms with the stem and up to 4 letters after the stem, (<I> elect, electric, electrode, electron, electrons, </i> <b> but not </b> <I> electricity, electrified, electrifies, elec
trodes, electronic </I>  etc)<p>
<dt><pre>  ?ast  </pre>   
<dd>Left-hand truncation - searches for words ending in <I> ast </i> such as <I> breast, coast, contrast, east, fast, fibroblast, last, least, mast , osteoclast, past.  </i>  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand tru
ncation with caution.<p>
<dt><pre>  ?2ast  </pre>   
<dd>Limited left-hand truncation - from 0 to 2 characters  - searches for words ending in <I> ast </i> with up to 2 characters before <i> ast</i>, such as <I> coast, east, fast, last, least, past </i>  <b> but not </b> <i> breast, contrast, fibroblast, os
teoclast. </i>  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand truncation with caution.<p>
<dt><pre>  ?tech?  </pre>  
<dd>Both left and right-hand truncation - searches for words containing the string  <I> tech </I> such as <I> antechinus, biotech, biotechnology, butylcatecholate, catechol, cryotechniques, electrotechnic, hydrotechnical, pertechnate, technique, technolog
y</i> and so on.  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand truncation with caution. <p> 
<dt><pre>  ?3tech?4  </pre>  
<dd>A combination of limited left-hand and limited right-hand truncation - searches for words containing the string  <I> tech </I> with up to 3 characters before and up to 4 after, such as <i> antechinus, biotech, catechin, catechol, lytechinus, pertechna
te, technics </i> <b> but not </b><I> biotechnology, butylcatecholate, cryotechniques, electrotechnic, hydrotechnical, technique, technology</i>.  Note that the entire index is searched to satisfy this query - use left hand truncation with caution. <p> 
</dl>
When searching Secondary Indexes, a combination of left and right-hand truncation should be used if you are trying to retrieve text which does not appear at the start of the field.<p>
For example, in Current Contents (CC) you might want to find journal titles that include the words <i>  chemical </i> or <i> chemistry</i>.  If you scan the index entries from <i>  chem  </i> you can see only those that start with that stem.  If you selec
t the <b>  journal </b> (or <b> tocJournal</b>) index and search for:<br>
<pre>  ?chem?  </pre>  you will retrieve all records in which the journal title contains any word starting with <i> chem </i> - <i> Chemistry in Britain, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of the Chemical Society - Chemical Communications, Monatshefte
 fur Chemie </i>  and so on.<p> 
<a name=PLU></a>
<h3>Plurals</h3>
The plural stemming symbol <b>  ~ </b> (the tilde) is used to retrieve singular and plural forms of words.<p>
For example,<br>
<pre>   disease~  </pre>  searches for <I> disease </I>  or <I> diseases </I>  but not <I> diseased </I> <p>
<a name=PMA></a>
<h3>Pattern matching</h3>
Use the <b> # </b> symbol for 'pattern matching' or 'masking'.  <p>
<dl>
<dd><pre><b> #  </b>   exactly one character
<dd><b> #<i>n</i>  </b>  exactly <I> n </I> characters
<dd><b> ?  </b>   an unlimited number of characters (including zero)
<dd><b> ?<I>n </I></b>   zero to <I> n </I></pre>
</dl>
Examples:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  wom#n  </pre>  
<dd>Mask exactly one character - searches for <I> woman </I>  or <I> women </I> <p>
<dt><pre>  int#2state  </pre>  
<dd>Mask exactly two characters - searches for <I> interstate</I>  or <I> intrastate</I> <br>
<DT><pre>  hydro?carbon  </pre>  
<dd>Masks an unlimited number of characters - searches for all terms starting with <I> hydro</I>  and ending with <I> carbon</I>, such as <I> hydrocarbon, hydrochlorofluorocarbon, hydrofluorocarbon</I> <p>
<dt><pre>  model?1ing  </pre> 
<dd> Masks zero or one character - searches for <I> modeling</I>  or <I> modelling</I> <br><p>
</dl>
<hr>
<a name=ADJ></a>
<h2>Adjacency</h2>
When you are using the CCL Query Form in SIM PCI (or the Find screen in SIM WWW) you are really using SIM's FIND command. (It is the FIND icon on the toolbar that opens the CCL Query Form window in SIM PCI, or the Find screen in SIM WWW).  When you enter 
your search text in the CCL Query Form window, any space between terms means 'adjacency'.  That is, the words are interpreted as a phrase.<p>
When searching the Basic Index, if you enter:
<dl>
<dt><pre>  water</pre>  
<dd>SIM retrieves records containing the word <I> water </I> in any field that is indexed by the Basic Index.<br>
<dt><pre>  water pollution</pre>  
<dd>SIM retrieves records in which the words <I> water </I> and <I> pollution </I> appear adjacent to each other and in that order in any field that is indexed by the Basic Index.<br>
<dt><pre>  surface water pollution</pre>  
<dd>SIM retrieves records in which the words <I> surface </I>, <I> water </I> and <I> pollution </I> appear adjacent to each other and in that order in any field that is indexed by the Basic Index.<pr>
Thus the more words in your phrase the more specific and restrictive you search becomes.<p>
</dl>
Note that there are certain words (such as the <a href=#BOOL>Boolean</a> operators AND, OR, NOT, and some other operators such as TO [the range operator], WITH and SAME) that are 'reserved words' - that is, SIM will interpret them as operators if they are
 entered in search queries.  If you wish to include any of these words in a search of the Basic index, you should enclose them in quotation marks (<b> "</b>) so that SIM will search for the word rather than try to perform the operation represented by that
 word.  Examples are given in the <a href=#RES>  Special (Reserved) Words </a> section. <p>
You can of course use any of the <A HREF=#TRU> truncation or masking </A>symbols in adjacency searching:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  water pollut?   </pre>  
<dd>Searches for phrases such as <i>water pollutant, water pollutants, water polluting, water pollution </I><p>
</dl>
Adjacency is not available in the RANK command.  In the Rank Query form, a space entered between terms is treated as a Boolean <a href=#OR>OR</a>.<p>
<hr>
<a name=RES></a>
<h2>Use of Restoration Marks</h2>
<a name=RWD></a>
<h3>Reserved Words</h3>
Some words (operators or other words with special meanings in SIM commands) cannot be retrieved unless they are surrounded by quotation marks (").  These quotation marks are called 'restoration marks'.  The restoration marks indicate to SIM that the word 
is to be retrieved, rather than an operation performed which is represented by that word.<p>
For example, to retrieve the phrase <i> research and development </i>, your query would be entered as:
<pre> research "and" development </pre>
It could also be entered as: 
<pre> "research and development" </pre>
The quotation marks indicate that the word 'and' not the Boolean operation 'and' is meant.<p>
For example, if in the CCL Query Form you enter:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  research and development  </pre> 
<dd>SIM searches for records in which both the word  <i> research </i>and the word <i> development </i> occur.<p>
<dt><pre>  research "and" development  </pre> 
<dd>SIM searches for the phrase <I> research and development </I><br>
<dt><pre>  "to lead"  </pre>  
<dd>SIM searches for the phrase <I> to lead </I> (this is useful if you want to eliminate these records from those about the mineral <I>  lead</i>.<p>
</dl>
Some of these operators (eg, TO) and letters such as S (for Set, in the Find command) or T (for Term, in the Scan command) cause an error message to be generated if they are not enclosed in restoration marks.  <p>
Words or letters which require restoration marks if you wish to retrieve them are:
<dl>
     <dd>and
     <dd>not
     <dd>or
     <dd>to
     <dd>same
     <dd>with
     <dd>t
     <dd>s
</dl><p>
<a name=RPN></a>
<h3>Punctuation</h3>
Normal punctuation (eg, comma, fullstop, parenthesis) which is preceded or followed by a space, and hyphens, are not stored in the Basic Index.  You can ignore such punctuation in searching.<p>  
However, punctuation (other than hyphens) embedded in other text IS stored in the Basic Index.  Examples are:
<dl>
     <dd>12c/13c
     <dd>0.61m
<dd>2C2OH33N3.6HBr.7/2H2O
</dl><p>
Include such punctuation in your search text if you enter it in the CCL Query form.<p>
If the search text contains commas or parentheses, eg:
<dl>
<dd>2,4 D
     <dd>1,3 benzodioxol
     <dd>Brombyin I[(rel) ....
</dl><p>
you MUST enclose the search text in restoration marks, otherwise an error message will be generated and the search will fail. Commas and parentheses must be treated in this way in searching because they have special meanings within the SIM Find command:  
commas are used in range searching, and parentheses in Boolean combinations<p>
Hyphens and apostrophes are significant in the <b> Secondary Indexes </b>
- you must include them in your search if they are present in the text you
wish to retrieve.  (The exception is the Author index of the CC database, from
which hyphens and apostrophes are removed before CSIRO receives the data. 
Further details are in the <a href="../ccdbg.htm#AUTN">CC Database 
Guide.</a>)<p>
When searching <b> Secondary Indexes </b> if your search text includes a comma
or parentheses, you MUST enclose your search text in restoration marks.<p>
For example, you may wish to find publications by the Division of Fisheries in the CSIX database.  Division names are inverted in the Division index in this database, <i> Fisheries, Division of' </i><p>  
The best way to find this is to use the Scan Index terms feature and select
from the list of index entries.  However, you may enter the text directly into
the CCL Query Form, but if you do so you MUST surround it with restoration marks.<p>
In the CCL Query Form select the Division index.  
Type in the query box:<P>  
<PRE>	"fisheries, division of"</PRE><P>  
then click the FIND button. <p>  
Alternatively you could search just <i>fisheries</i> if you truncate before the comma.  Type in the query  
box:<P>  
<pre>	fisheries?</pre><p>  
then click the FIND button.<p>  
When in doubt, use restoration marks - SIM will ignore them if they are redundant.<p>

<h2>Context searching</h2>
<a href="pcisrch.htm#CONTEXT">Context searching</a> (also known as word proximity searching) is done from the <b> Select an Operator </b> window in SIMPCI, and the Find (Search) screen in SIMWWW.<p>
This window is opened by clicking on the button beside the Index box in the <b>  CCL Query form </b>.  This button will usually display the   <b> = </b>  symbol, but will show another symbol if the last search operation was a context or numeric search.  T
he <b> Select an Operator </b> window provides both <b> Textual </b> and <b> Numeric </b> operators for use in your search.  The default search is 'within a field' (represented by the <b> = </b>   symbol).<p>
The <b> Textual </b> operators enable you to search for words according to their proximity to other words.  These operators are represented by the buttons marked:
<dl>
<dd><pre> <b> = </b>     in field (select the indexed field from the spin box in the <b> CCL Query form</b>.  
<dd> <b> with </b>  in same paragraph (word order ignored)
<dd> <b> same </b>  in same sentence (not currently implemented - results are the same as 'with')
<dd> <b> % </b>     within n words; word order is ignored (enter <I> n </I> (number of words) in the 'Within <I> n </I> words' box)
<dd> <b> ! </b>     within n words; word order preserved</pre>
</dl>
These operators work on the Basic index and any other field indexed by 'word' rather than 'whole field'.  Word indexes are indicated by the lower case <b> w </b>prefixing the field name in the drop down list in the  <b> CCL Query Form </b> (eg, <b> wTitle
</b>).<p>
Examples:<p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>  biological %2 control   </pre> 
<dd>within 2 words; word order is ignored - retrieves phrases such as <I> biological control, biological weed control, biological pest control, control by biological means, control its biological function</i><p>
<dt><pre>   biological !2 control   </pre> 
<dd>within 2 words, with  word order preserved  - searches for <I> biological control, biological weed control, biological pest control </i><p>
<dt><pre>   biotechnology WITH investment  </pre> 
<dd>retrieves these terms in same paragraph (word order ignored).<p>
</dl>
The SAME operator (terms in same sentence, word order ignored) is not currently implemented.  If you use this operator, the results will be the equivalent of using WITH.<p>
<hr>
<a name=BOOL></a>
<a name=dp></a>
<h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
Boolean operators (also known as logical operators) enable the logical 
combination of search terms or result sets.  Boolean operations are 
illustrated with <a href="venn.htm">Venn diagrams </a><p>
The FIND command in SIM uses the Boolean operators OR, AND, NOT, XOR.  They may be entered in searches or used via the drop down Combinations menu in the Set History window of SIMPCI, or the Search Results Sets screen of SIMWWW.<p>
<a name=OR></a>
<b>   OR     </b> Any one of the terms must be present in the record:<br>
<pre>  groundwater OR ground water </pre><p>
<pre>  fruit OR vegetables OR cereals  </pre><p>
<pre>  s1 OR s2 OR S3 OR s4 OR s5 </pre><p>
Use OR to broaden your search by including synonyms, variant spellings or other concepts.<p>
<b>   AND     </b> Both (or all) terms must be present in the record:
<pre>  groundwater AND salinity </pre>
<pre>  water quality AND monitoring </pre>
<pre>  s7 AND s8 </pre>
<pre>  dairy products AND exports AND europe </pre><p>
Use AND to restrict your search.  The more concepts you combine with AND, the smaller your results will be.<p>
<b>   NOT     </b>   The first term but not the second must be present in the record:
<pre>  fruit NOT apples </pre>
<pre>  s1 NOT s3 </pre><p>
Use NOT to eliminate unwanted concepts, but use it with care, to ensure that you do not exclude relevant material.<p>
<b>   XOR     </b> One or other of the terms must be present in the record, but not both:
<pre>  sheep XOR goats </pre><p>
Order of precedence of operators is: AND, NOT, OR, XOR (OR and XOR equal).  That is, an AND operation will be performed before an OR operation if both operations are included in a query, unless parentheses are used to override precedence.<p>
If the search <br><pre>  foxes OR rabbits AND pest control  </pre><br> is entered, the 'rabbits AND pest control' will be processed first, then the OR operation will be done.  This means that only the 'rabbits' part of the query will be combined with 'pes
t control'; the 'foxes' part of it will include any record containing 'foxes'.<p> 
Parentheses are used to over-ride precedence so that the query is logically correct.  Operations in parentheses are processed first:<br>
<pre>  (foxes OR rabbits) AND pest control <p>
  (s1 OR s2) AND exports <br>
  joint ventures AND (china OR thailand OR malaysia) <br>
  (animal pests OR pest animals) NOT rabbits </pre><br>
NOTE: it is good practice to use brief search statements and then combine the result sets with the Boolean operators, rather than to use complicated search syntax to try to combine all your concepts into one statement.<p>
<hr>
<a name=NUMO></a>
<h3>Numeric operators</h3>
<a href="pcisrch.htm#NUM">Numeric searching</a> (also known as relational searching) is done from the <b> Select an Operator </b> window in SIMPCI, and the Find (Search) screen in SIMWWW.<p>
Use these operators to search fields containing numeric or coded data. <p> The <b> Equal to </b> operator is the default operator, and works on text fields as well as numeric ones.<p>  The fields given in the examples would be selected from the spin box i
n the CCL Query form.<p>
<dl>
<dd><pre><b>   EQ =   </b>   Equal to,  eg documentType=journal
<dd><b>   NE <>   </b>  Not equal to, eg  PublYear ne 1994
<dd><b>   GT >   </b>   Greater than, eg  PublYear gt 1980
<dd><b>   GE >=   </b>  Greater than or equal to, eg  References gt 20
<dd><b>   LT <   </b>   Less than eg, F DocumentNo lt 9400001
<dd><b>   LE <=   </b>  Less than or equal to, eg PublYear le 1990
<dd><b>   TO    </b>    Range (inclusive), eg  PublYear 1980 to 1985</pre>
</dl><p>
<hr>
<a NAME=RNK></a>
<h2>RANKING</h2>
Rank searches are used to find and display, in order of relevance, records 
which satisfy a search query.<p>
In a Rank search, SIM uses statistical information about the rarity of the query terms entered by the searcher, the number of times that the terms appear in each record, and the size of each record to determine the 50 best matches to the query.  The recor
ds resulting from a Rank search are ordered so that the most relevant are displayed first.  A maximum of 50 records is returned by the Rank process.<P> 
A Rank query cannot include Boolean, contextual, numeric or wildcard operators, though truncation may be used. Rank may be used to rank a set which was previously generated by searching or scanning; such sets may contain operators.<p>
Rank works only on the Basic Index.<p>
Rank cannot be performed when more than one database is selected.<p>
To use Rank, click the Rank icon to open the Rank Query form.  In the Rank Query text box, enter:
<ul>
<li>terms to be ranked, each separated by a space.  Do not use operators or wildcards, though you may use truncation.  Note that in a Rank search, the space between terms represents a Boolean  'OR' operation, not 'adjacency' as it does in other SIM search
es; or
<li>the number of a previous set (eg, <i>s3</i>); or
<li>the number of a previous set followed by a term (or terms) by which you wish the set to be ranked (eg,  <i>s3 marketing </i>)  This term does not have to be one which was included in your original search statement.
</ul>
Rank sets are numbered in sequence with other sets, and can be used in other searches, viewed, printed and saved just like sets created by Searching or Scanning.<p>

<H2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</H2>  

<H3>August 1995</H3><P>  

[First issued 17 October 1994; revised October 1995]  

<HR>  

<H2><B>Contents:</B></H2><P>  

I.	Searching a secondary index in SIMPCI via the CCL Query Form<BR>  

II.	Author initials<P>  

<H3>I.	Searching a secondary index in SIMPCI via the CCL Query 
Form</H3><P>  

In SIMPCI if you wish to search a secondary index (ie, any index other  

than the Basic index), take the following steps:<P>  

1.In the CCL Query form select the particular index by using the  

spin box (down arrow) beside the Index box.  [Note: secondary indexes 
are  

listed in the database guide for each SIM database].<P>  

2.Click on the index you wish to search.  Its name will display in  

the Index box.<P>   

3.Enter your search term(s) in the query box.  <p>  

In SIM 1.1d you usually do not need to enclose your search text in  

double-quotes ("). However, if your search text includes a comma,  

apostrophe or parentheses, or a word such as AND which has special 
meaning within SIM  

you must use the double-quote marks ("),  

otherwise your search will fail. (If in doubt use the double-quotes -  

SIM will ignore them if they are redundant.)  

<p>  

All secondary indexes currently available for SIM databases are indexed  

so that the entire value of the field is stored in the index. This  

means that you should use the truncation symbol (<b>?</b>) at the end of  

your search text in the CCL Query Form unless you want to retrieve only  

an EXACT match in the index for the term(s) you have typed. (If you have  

used double-quotes, put the truncation symbol outside the quote marks).  

<p>  

Because secondary indexes have the entire value of the field stored in 
the  

index, these indexes can be scanned in a meaningful way and variant  

entries selected from the list. (Use Toolbar 6 to open the Scan Index 
Terms  

window, then select the index you want, and scan for the text you wish to 
search).  

	Some examples of searching with this method are shown below.<P>  

a)	<b>To find items by M. F. Day</b><P>   

In the CCL Query Form select the Author index.  

Type in the query box:<P>  

<PRE>	day mf</PRE><P>    

then click the FIND button.  Results will appear in the Set History 
window.<P>   

b)	<b>To find items by any M. Day</b>  (ie, M. Day; M. F. Day; M. F. 
J. Day, etc)<P>  

In the CCL Query Form select the Author index.  

Type in the query box:<P>  

<PRE>	day m? </PRE><P>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the truncation symbol 
(?).<p>  

c)	<b>To find any issue of a particular journal title</b>, eg 
<i>Journal of Applied Polymer  

Science</i><P>  

This example is from the CC database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Journal index.   

Type in the query box:<P>  

 <PRE>	journal of applied polymer science?</PRE><P>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the truncation symbol 
(?).<p>  

d)	<b>To find a particular issue of a particular journal title</b>, 
such as <i>Journal of Applied Polymer  

Science</i>, volume 54, number 1, October 3rd, 1994<P>  

This example is from the CC database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Journal index.    

Type in the query box:<P>  

<PRE>	journal of applied polymer science 1994 v 54 n 1 Oct 3</PRE> <P>  

then click the FIND button.<P>  

[Note: if you wish to locate a particular journal issue, it is   

easier to use Toolbar button 6 to open the Scan Index terms window,  

select the Journal index, scan for the journal name or part of it, then  

highlight the issue you want and search for it (double click the  

highlighted item(s) or click the Search button).  Scanning an  

index allows you to see exactly what data elements are there, and the   

order in which they are presented.]<P>  

e)	<b>To find text containing a comma</b>, eg 'Fisheries, Division 
of'<P>  

  

This example is from the CSIX database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Division index.  

Type in the query box:<P>  

 <PRE>	"fisheries, division of"</PRE><P>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the quotation symbols 
(").<p>  

Alternatively you could search just <i>fisheries</i> if you truncate 
before the comma.  Type in the query  

box:<P>  

<pre>	fisheries?</pre><p>  

then click the FIND button.<p>  

f)	<b>To find a journal title containing the word AND</b>, eg 
<i>Accident Analysis and  

Prevention</i><P>  

This example is from the CC database.  In the CCL Query Form select the 
Journal index.<BR>  Type in the  

query box:<p>  

<pre>	"accident analysis and prevention"?</pre><p>  

then click the FIND button.  Note the use of the quotation symbols 
(").<p>  

Alternatively, use the Scan Index function (Icon 6) to scan the index and 
select the item you want.<p>   

<a name=JAMP></a>  

g)	<b>To find a journal title containing an ampersand (&amp) (CC 
database only)</b><P>  

Ampersands (&amp) are not currently stored in the Journal index to CC.  
If the title you wish to retrieve  

contains an ampersand, please ignore that character and scan or search 
for the title as if the ampersand is not  

present.<p>  

For example, search for the title <i>Computers &amp Geosciences</i> by 
typing:<p>  

<pre>	computers geosciences</pre><p>  

in the CCL Query form or by scanning for this in the Scan Index form.<p>  

We hope to correct the omission of ampersands in CC indexes in a future 
re-load of CC.    

If you are uncertain whether the AND in a journal title is represented by 
an ampersand or the word AND, use  

the Scan Index function to check both versions in the index.<p>  

<a name=AUN></a>  

<H3>II.	AUTHOR NAMES </H3><P>  

Author initials are 'blocked together' in the SIM reference databases, 
eg<P>  

<PRE>	adey rfj  

	winter te  

</PRE><P>  

Please note that in the <b> CSIX </b> and <b> SCAN </b> databases names 
such as O'Brien DO include the 

apostrophes.  

The apostrophe must be included in the searching, and the name must be 
enclosed within double-quote  

marks:<p>  

<pre>  

	"o'brien cj"  

	"o'brien c"?  

</pre>  

In <b> CC </b> the apostrophes are 'stripped out' before we receive the 
data, so do  

not include them in your search.<p>  

<pre>  

	obrien cj  

	obrien c?  

</pre>  

Be sure you allow for this difference if you are typing your queries in  

as shown above.<P>

<H2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</H2>

<HR> 

<H3>AUTHOR NAMES CONTAINING HYPHENS, APOSTROPHES OR SPACES - TREATED  

DIFFERENTLY IN CC DATABASE </H3><P> 

Please note that in the <b> CSIX </b>and <b> SCAN </b> databases 
hyphenated names such as "Staveley-

Smith", "O'Brien" and "van der Meulen" are presented correctly, and 
hyphens, apostrophes and spaces are 

included in the text and the indexes.  The hyphen, apostrophe or space 
must be included in your search, eg: 

<pre> 

	staveley-smith l 

	tyndale-biscoe ch 

	van der meulen cj 

	van gerwen ac 

	"o'brien cj" 

	"o'brien c"? 

</pre> 

[Note: in CSIX and SCAN you MUST use double quotes around names 
containing an apostrophe, otherwise 

you will not retrieve anything.  If in doubt, use the quotes - if they 
are redundant your search will still succeed. 

Use the truncation symbol (?) if you are unsure of the initials or if the 
author's initials are presented in different 

ways.] <p> 

In <b> Current Contents (CC) </b> the hyphens, apostrophes and spaces are 
'stripped out' by ISI (the publisher 

of CC) before CSIRO receives the data, so these characters do not appear 
in author names in the CC database.  

Do not include them in your search, eg in CC search for:<br> 

<pre>	staveleysmith l 

	tyndalebiscoe ch 

	vandermeulen cj 

	vangerwen ac 

	obrien cj 

	obrien c? 

</pre> 

Apologies to the CSIRO authors whose names are treated in such cavalier 

fashion by ISI.<p> 

When searching for particular authors a good technique is to use the Scan 
Index function (A-Z icon), and 

select from the list of index entries.<p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
When you perform a SIM search by entering terms, or scanning indexes or ranking terms, SIM creates a result set.  The <b> Set History </b> window will open and the set number, number of records retrieved ('hits') and the text of the query will be shown.
<p>
The result set itself is a collection of all of the records that were found by the search. Result sets are kept by SIM until the end of your session.<p>
You can work with sets to combine them in subsequent searches, or delete them, or save them (without the records they retrieved) for use again in the future. <p>
You can <a href="pcivwpr.htm#VIEW">view</a>, <a href="pcivwpr.htm#PRR">print</a> and download (<a href="pcivwpr.htm#SAV">save</a> to your local disk) the records in a set.<p>
<a name=comsets></a>
<h3>Combining Sets</h3>
Use the Combinations menu in the <b> Set History </b> window to perform Boolean operations on sets.<p>
The Boolean operators are <b> AND</b>, <b> OR</b>, <b> NOT</b>.  There are two options for <b> NOT </b> - combine in order of set number, or in reverse order.<p>
For example, if you had done two searches, the first on <I> groundwater </i> and the second on <I> salinity</i>, your <b> Set History </b> window would display something like this:
<p>
<pre>     s1   :1110     FIND groundwater
     s2   :1232     FIND salinity</pre><p>
If you wished to combine these sets with <b> AND </b> (to find records common to both sets), this is the procedure:<p>
<ol>
<li>In the <b> Set History </b> window highlight the sets you wish to combine (ie, s1, s2)<p>
<li>Click on the <b> Combinations </b>  menu<p>
<li>Select <b> AND </b> from the list of operators<p>
</ol><p>
The results (in this example, set 3) will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>
Use the same technique to combine sets with the other Boolean operators.<p>
<a name=del></a>
<h3>Deleting Result Sets from your Search Strategy</H3>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the set (or sets) in the  <b> Set History </b> window.  If you wish to select all the sets, use the menu option <b> Operations Select All </b>.<p>
<LI>Open the  <b> Operations </b>  menu.<p>
<LI>Choose the  <b> Delete </b> option.<p>
</ol><p>
<a name=savsets></a>
<h3>Saving Search Sets</h3>
The text of sets (without the records they retrieved) may be saved for use again in the future.  Sets may be saved as an ordinary saved search, or as a search to be run specifically as an SDI ( Selective Dissemination of Information, or current awareness)
.

To save a search strategy (a group of sets) as an ordinary saved search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the set (or sets) in the  <b> Set History </b> window.  If the 
set you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you must highlight all the sets that comprise the final result.  (If you wish to save all the sets, use the menu option <b> Operations Select All</b>.)<p>
<LI>Open the  <b> Operations </b>  menu.<p>
<LI>Choose one of the  <b> Create Saved Search </b> options.  The <b> without base </b> option means that the saved search will run on any database; the <b> with base </b> option means it will run only on the database in which you saved it.<p>
<LI>In the <b> Save As </b> window, enter a name for the saved search (you may choose a drive and directory as well), and click the  <b> OK </b>  button.  (Note that the file extension for a saved search strategy is <b> .sav</b>.)
</ol><p>
If you want to overwrite a previously-saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.<p>
<a name=sdi></a>
<h3>SDI Saves</h3>
An SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) search is one that is 
time stamped so that it may be used for current awareness.  When the search is run again later, only records added to 
the database since the last search are returned.<p>  
To save a search as an SDI search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the set (or sets) in the  <b> Set History </b> window.  If the 
set you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you must highlight all the sets that comprise the final result.  (If you wish to save all the sets, use the menu option <b> Operations Select All</b>.)<p>
<LI>Open the  <b> Operations </b>  menu.<p>
<LI>Choose the  <b> Create SDI </b> option.<p>
<LI>In the <b> Save As </b> window, enter a name for the saved search (you may choose a drive and directory as well), and click the  <b> OK </b>  button.  (Note that the file extension for a saved SDI search strategy is <b> .sdi</b>.)
</ol><p>
SDI searches may only be run in the database in which they were 
entered and saved.<p>
<a name=run></a>
<h3>Running a Saved Search or SDI</h3>
Saved searches or SDI searches may be run in this way:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 4 (the <b> Find Save </b> icon) to open the <b> Saved Search Form </b><p>
<li>From the File menu in this window, choose <b> Open </b><p>
<li>Select your saved search.  (Use the <b> List Files of Type </b> box to choose the appropriate file extension (<b> .sav </b> or <b> .sdi </b>)<p>
<li> The search strategy will appear in the <b> Saved Search Form </b> window<p>
<li>Open the <b> Run </b> menu, then choose  <b> Process Saved Search File </b><p>
<li>The search will be executed (note the messages in the Status line on the SIM Toolbar) and the sets will appear in the  <b> Set History </b> window<p>
<li>Open the <b> File </b> menu in the <b> Saved Search Form </b>, then choose <b> Close Window </b><p>
<li>Work with your result sets in the usual way<p>
</ol><p>
When you view an SDI search in the  <b> Saved Search Form </b>, you will see that SIM inserted a set 0 (set zero) when the search was saved.  This is the 'timeprint' - the statement that searches for records added since the time the search was last run.  
The time information is a 'system time', expressed in a form meaningful to SIM (it is a 9 digit number, eg 809780000).  This 'time stamp' will be updated automatically by SIM each time the SDI is run.  You do not have to keep saving your search strategy a
fter each SDI run.<p>
SIM also includes 'AND s0' in each search statement so that the combination of your results will represent the records added. since the last search time.<p>
<a name=edit></a>
<h3>Editing a Saved Search</h3>
Saved searches or SDI searches may be edited in the   <b> Saved Search Form </b>:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 4 (the <b> Find Save </b> icon) to open the <b> Saved Search Form </b><p>
<li>From the File menu in this window, choose <b> Open </b><p>
<li>Select your saved search.  (Use the <b> List Files of Type </b> box to choose the appropriate file extension (<b> .sav </b> or <b> .sdi </b>)<p>
<li>The search strategy will appear in the <b> Saved Search Form </b> window<p>
<li>Position the mouse pointer (cursor) in the appropriate place, and add or delete text as you wish.  If the search is an SDI search, make sure you do not delete set 0 (s=0, set zero).<p>
<li>Choose  <b> File Save File </b> to save it under the same name, or  <b> File Save File As </b> to save it under another name.<p>
</ol>
<a name=delss></a>
<h3>Deleting a Saved Search</h3>
To delete unwanted saved search strategies:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 4 (the <b> Find Save </b> icon) to open the <b> Saved Search Form </b><p>
<li>From the File menu in this window, choose <b> Open </b><p>
<li>Select your saved search.  (Use the <b> List Files of Type </b> box to choose the appropriate file extension (<b>  .sav </b> or <b>  .sdi </b>)<p>
<li>The search strategy will appear in the <b> Saved Search Form </b> window<p>
<li>Choose <b> File Delete Current File </b>  to delete the saved search file.<p>

<H3>I.  SDI PROFILES - SIMPCI</H3><BR>
In SIMPCI SDI profiles may be set up using with the Create SDI Option in 
the Operations menu of the Set History window.<P>
SDI profiles are time-stamped with the time that the search was created
(or last run), and are specific to a particular database.  Each time the
SDI is run, SIM compares the date of the records in the database with the
date that the SDI was last run, so that the only records retrieved by the
search are those added to the database since the SDI was last run.  (SIM
uses the system-assigned time in the CreatTime index to do this).  In
order to get meaningful results, the SDI search MUST be entered and saved
in the database in which you wish to run it in future.
You can set up an SDI in any SIM reference database (every SIM database has the
CreatTime index which is used by the SIM SDI process).<P>
To create an SDI take the following steps:<P>
1. Create your search strategy in the database you will be using for the SDI.<BR>
2. In the Operations menu of the Set History window, choose Select
All.  This highlights all the sets in your strategy, and ensures that
they are all saved.  (Alternatively, highlight the individual sets you
wish to save before you open the Operations menu).<BR>
3. Open the Operations menu of the Set History window again.<BR>
4. Click on Create SDI.<BR>
5. In the Open window, give your saved search an appropriate name.
	(The extension must be  .sdi )<BR>
6. Your search will be saved, and time-printed.  (You won't be able to
	test it until the database is next updated)<P>
To run an SDI:<P>
1. Click SIM Toolbar button 4 to open the Saved Search Form (or open
	View Saved Searches on the Toolbar menu)<BR>
2. In the Open window, highlight the name of the saved search you
	wish to run, and click OK.<BR>
3. The search strategy will appear in the Saved Search Form window.
	(You will notice that the system has inserted a set 0 (set zero), which
	is the statement that searches for records added since the time the
	search was last run).<BR>
4. Choose Run Process Saved Search.<BR>
5. The search will be executed (note the messages in the Status line
	on the SIM Toolbar) and the sets will appear in the Set History window.<BR>
6. Choose File Close Window in the Saved Search Form.<BR>
7. In the Set History window highlight the last set.<BR>
8. Choose Print Result Set (or Save [to save results to disk]) from
	the Operations menu to output the results in your preferred format.<P>
To amend an SDI:<P>
1.  Click SIM Toolbar button 4 to open the Saved Search Form (or open
	View Saved Searches on the Toolbar menu).<BR>
2.  Choose File Open.<BR>
3.  Highlight the name of the saved search you wish to run, and click OK.<BR>
4.  The search strategy will appear in the Saved Search Form window.<BR>
5.  Edit your search (alter, insert, or delete text).<P>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
Make sure you don't delete set zero (s=0), which is the set created by SIM
to check the date on which the record was added to the database; it is this set
which makes the SDI work properly.  The time specified in set zero is amended by
SIM each time the SDI is run.<P>
Make sure when you edit the search that there are no blank lines in it.<P>
Note that search statements must use the SIM Command Line Interface syntax.
Make sure that your last statement is logically correct, includes all the previous 
sets necessary to a satisfactory result, and retains the combination  'and S=0'.<P>
</dl>
6. Choose File Save (or File Save As, if you wish to change the name
	of the search).<BR>
7. Choose File Close Window in the Saved Search Form.<P>
<H3>II.	SDI PROFILES - SIMCLI</H3><P>
To save an SDI in SIMCLI:<P>
enter the command<P>
<B>SAVE SDI filename</B><P>
(where filename is a filename of your choice, eg <B>SAVE SDI abcd123</B>).<P>
A range of sets can be saved with the command<P>
<B>SAVE SDI s5 to s10 filename</B><P>
To run an SDI in SIMCLI:<P>
enter the command<P>
<B>FIND SAVE=filename</B><P>
(where filename is the name of your SDI, eg <B>FIND SAVE=abcd123</B>)<P>

I.  Changes to CC Coverage<BR>
II. New CC Subject Categories for 1995<P>


On 21 December 1994, CIS received information from ISI about changes to 
CC coverage and new subject categories.  The letter about coverage is 
reproduced below, followed by details of the new categories.<P>

<B>I.  Changes to CC Coverage</B><P>

ISI's letter:
                                *****

<PRE><I>ISI is pleased to announce the following coverage changes to CC 
Search. We are confident these enhancements will improve the product's 
focus and usefulness, while continuing to keep you up-to-date with the 
latest research literature from the world's most prestigious scientific 
journals.

CC Search/Social and Behavioral Sciences

In response to your requests, the subject concentration has been 
re-focused emphasizing the social and behavioral sciences. We are 
expanding our coverage of key journals in the following areas which will 
improve the breadth of the database:

Psychology	Psychiatry	Sociology 
Social Work	Communication	Women's Studies 
Health Policy	Public Health	Education

To reduce the emphasis on non-related subject areas, coverage 
will be eliminated in: Law, Business, Linguistics, Geography, History, 
and Planning & Development.

CC Search/Engineering, Technology, and Applied Sciences

To better represent the new focus of the database, we've changed 
the name to CC/Engineering, Computing & Technology (CC/EC&T)

Coverage is being enhanced with the addition of 200 new titles. 
Most subject areas are being enhanced, with special emphasis on:

Materials	       Electrical & Electronics Engineering 
Chemical Engineering   Computer Technology, Applications & 
                       Engineering

... We hope that these product enhancements will provide researchers with 
more in depth coverage of the areas most important to their research.

<H3><B>SIM Help Request Procedures</B>
</H3><P>
Two Help Desks are available for CSIRO  users of various products and
software.  For SIM users, both the ITSB and CIS Help Desks are available.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <B>ITSB Help Desk</B> provides help with software installation and
implementation, and telecommunications and network problems.  It may be
contacted on phone number<B> (06) 276 6666</B>, or email  <B>helpdesk@its.csiro.au</B><BR>
However, your initial contact should be your sysman.<P>

<LI>The <B>CIS Help Desk</B> provides help on SIM searching techniques (PC, WWW and
command line interfaces), and issues relating to database content.  It may be
contacted on phone <B>1800 810 729</B>, or<B> (03) 418 7222</B>, or email
<B>cis.helpdesk@cis.csiro.au</B></UL>
<P>
If in doubt about which help desk to approach, contact either one; staff
will log your request and forward it to the appropriate skill group.
Both Help Desks use the same software for logging queries, and
information is shared between Help Desk staff and skill group members in
a common database.<P>
For queries directed to the CIS help Desk, it would be helpful if the
following information could be provided when  you lodge your query:<P>
<UL>
<LI>SIM interface being used (PC, WWW or CLI);
<LI>database(s) searched
<LI>brief description of the problem, including what you were trying to do
<LI>number (and text if possible) of any SIM error message received
</UL>
<P>
Copies of your search strategy are useful, indeed necessary, in many 
cases.   Please fax or email these to us after you have logged your query.<P>
Your query will be answered straight away, if possible, by staff on help
desk duty.  If the staff member on duty is unable to answer it, the query
will be passed on to a search analyst in the SIM Support Group, for response 
as soon as possible.<P>
Help requests and solutions of an urgent nature, or general interest,
will be documented and distributed via the SIMulcasts newsletter and the 
SIM-USER listserver.<P>

<h2>An occasional series of SIM Searching Tips from CIS</h2>



<h3>9 August 1995</h3><P>



<hr>







<h3>I. RHEOLOGY NOT THEOLOGY</h3><P>







If you are interested in rheology, you will be fascinated to learn that in some <I>Current Contents</I> records in SIM the word 'theology' (or 'theological', etc) appears instead of 'rheology' (or 'rheological', etc).<P>







It seems that around 560 records are affected (as at 8 August 1995).<P>  







In over 300 of these 560 records, although 'theo...' is used in many places, the word 'rheology' or a word with the stem 'rheo' does also appear somewhere in the record.  These records WOULD BE RETRIEVED by a search for word containing or starting with 'rheo' ('rheo?' or '?rheo?').<P>







Unfortunately in the other records (about 250) that have 'theo...' substituted for 'rheo...', there are NO occurrences of a word with the stem 'rheo...'.  These are records which are not concerned with theology, religion or philosophy at all and in which the 'theo...' is clearly incorrect.  The mistakes occur in titles, abstracts and keywords.  These records WILL NEVER BE RETRIEVED in a search for words containing or starting with the letters 'rheo'.  Unhappily, these records may contain the very information a scientist needs.  <P>







The errors are in the <I>Current Contents</I> data when CSIRO receives it and processes it for dissemination via SIM.  We have advised the publisher of the errors and will let you know if there is a response and whether or not we can amend the source data.<P>







In the meantime, if you are interested in rheology and wish to look at the 250-plus 'errant' records in the CC database, use this search strategy:<P>



<DL>



<DT><pre>s1  FIND theol?</pre>







<DD>		(this finds all records with the stem 'theol')<P>







<DT><pre>s2  FIND ?rheo?</pre>







<DD>	(this finds all word containing or starting with the string 'rheo')<P>







<DT><pre>s3  FIND S1 not S2</pre>



<DD>	(this finds all records containing 'theol...' which don't also include words containing 'rheo...')<P>







<DT><pre>s4  FIND ccedition=beha?</pre> 



<DD>(this finds all records in the 'behavioural sciences' subset of CC - covering philosophy, history, psychology, theology, etc)<P>







<DT><pre>s5  FIND s3 not s4</pre>



<DD>	(the result is all records containing the word 'theol...' that are not in the behavioural subset.  There are 261 records (as at 8 August 1995) - in 8 of these the word 'theo...' is correct (though the abstracts are not classified in the behavioural subset) - the remaining 253 are the records in which 'theo...' should read 'rheo...'.)<P>



</dl>



Note: hits (number of records) will change with time as more data is



added to CC - for example, the CC load of 9 August (issue 33 of 1995)



contains an additional 11 records which will be retrieved with the



search strategy set out above.<P>







My thanks to Evalyn Beaumont and a scientist at the Division of Minerals in Perth who initially noticed errors and drew them to my attention.  Such feedback is always welcomed by the SIM Management Team.<P>

<HR>

<H3>Contents:</H3>

I. Logging on to SIMWWW 1.3 for the first time<BR>
II. Individual userids for SIMWWW users

<P><B>I. Logging on to SIMWWW 1.3 for the first time</B>

<P>When you first logon to the new SIMWWW gateway, you should configure your preferences, especially the one which related to your computing environment. To do this:

<P>1. Click on the C icon

<P>2. The User Configuration screen will open.

<P>3. Under the heading Default File Format, choose the option that is 
appropriate to your environment.  For example, if you use the SIMWWW with 
a Mac, click on the MAC text option. This will ensure that files that 
you save to disk, etc are in the correct text format.

<P>4. Select any other configuration options you wish to implement.

<P>5. Click the Save Changes button to implement the changes you have selected.

<P>PLEASE NOTE: if you are using a generic userid the changes you implement will affect everyone who uses that userid.  

<P><B>II. Saved search strategies in SIMMWWW</B>

<P>SIMWWW users are aware that saved search strategies are saved on the SIM server rather than on the local workstation.  This means that whoever 
logs on with a generic userid can recall, run or delete any search 
strategy saved under that userid.  In the new SIMWWW the saved searches 
may also be edited.

<P>We aware that privacy and security of saved searches is an issue for some SIMWWW users, therefore it is now possible to request an individual 
userid for access to SIM.  If you log on to SIM with your own userid any 
searches you save will be accessible by you only, and by no-one else.

<P>SIMWWW users who wish to have their own <a
href="http://www.csiro.au/computing/helpdesk/userrego.htm">SIM userid</a> 
may request one from the ITSB helpdesk.  Please complete the SIM userid 
request form.

<h4>Contents:</h4>
I. Saving searches<br>
II. SDI saves<br>
III. Rerunning a saved search or SDI<br>
IV. Editing a saved search<br>
V. Deleting a saved search
<p><b>Saving searches</b>
<p>You can save a database search strategy (without the retrieved 
records) and quickly recall and repeat the search at a later date.  The 
search is saved by SIM.
<p>To save a search strategy:
<ol>
<li>Select the result sets in the 'Search Result Sets' form. (If the 
search 
strategy you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you 
must save all the search results that comprise the final result.)
<li>Select the <b>Save</b> radio button in the 'Search Strategy' line, 
and click the 'Process' button. The Save Strategy File screen will open.
<li>Enter a name for the saved search in the 'Save to File' box, and 
click the 
'Save' button.
</ol>
<p>If you want to overwrite a saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.
<a name=SDI></a>
<p><b>SDI saves</b>
<p> An SDI, or Selective Dissemination of Information, search is one that 
is 
time stamped.  When the search is run subsequently, only records added to 
the database since the last search are returned.
<p>To save an SDI search:
<ol>
<li>Select the result sets in the 'Search Result Sets' form. (If the 
search 
strategy you want to save is the result of several combined searches, you 
must save all the search results that comprise the final result.)
<li>Select the <b>Save</b> radio button in the 'Search Strategy' line and 
click the 'Process' button. The Save Strategy File screen will open.
<li>Enter a name for the saved search in the 'Save to File' box.
<li>Check the SDI box, and click the 'Save' button. The search will be 
saved 
with a set 0 (S0) line showing the creattime (time stamp of the last time 
the 
search was run).
</ol>
<p>If you want to overwrite a saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.
<p>SDI searches may only be run in the database in which they were 
entered and saved.
<p><b>Rerunning a saved search or SDI</b>
<p>Saved searches or SDI searches may be run in this way:
<ol>
<li>Click the Find Saves icon (the second FIND icon) to open the Saved 
Search Form.
<li>Select your saved search. 
<li>Click the <b>Load</b> radio button, then the 'Process' button.
</ol>
<p>The search will be executed and the sets will appear in the Search 
Result 
Sets screen or Summarize screen, depending on how SIMWWW is configured 
with your userid. Work with your result sets in the usual way. You do not 
need to re-save a search each time you run it.
<p><b>Editing a saved search</b>
<p>Saved searches or SDI searches may be edited in the Saved Search 
screen:
<ol>
<li>Select your saved search.
<li>Click the <b>Edit</b> radio button. The search strategy will appear.
<li>Position the mouse pointer (cursor) in the appropriate place, and add 
or 
delete text as you wish. If the search is an SDI search, make sure you do 
not 
delete set 0 (S0).
<li>Click the 'Save' button to save it under the same name or type in a 
new 
name in the 'File Name' box to save it under another name. (You may want 
to 
add the letters sdi to the end of your file name as SIM does not 
automatically 
do this).
</ol>
<p><b>Deleting a saved search</b>
<p>To delete unwanted saved search strategies:
<ol>
<li>Click on the 'Find Saves' icon.
<li>Click the Saved Search' icon.
<li>Select the search or searches to be deleted and click the 
<b>Delete</b> 
radio button.
<li>Click the 'Process' button to perform this operation.

G393    203    Fixed the problem that a dtd was not downloaded when     
               installing SIMPCI.                                       

G394    204    Fixed the bug that colour dropped out in SIMPCI toolbar  
               and db selection form.                                   

G395    205    Fixed the bug that Text Viewer window could not be       
               resized.

G396    206    Fixed the bug about the width and behaviour of Text      
               Viewer window with databases that are using table of     
               content support.  Now it is able to prevent the viewer   
               resizing based on the CCL form position.                 

G206    c095   Fixed the bug which occured when searching for multiple  
               terms in a secondary index.  Now brackets are used to    
               surround the multiple terms.                             

G208    c091   Fixed the problem with saving search histories.          

G325           Renamed style sheet from tocstyle to tocman.dtd.         
               Fixed the problem that TOCSTYLE.STY could not be found.  

R051    234    Fixed the bug that SGML viewer in PCI displayed off      
               screen when moving the PCI toolbar up that the top of    
               it was above the screen.

G390    202    Installation manual is misleading. Within Volume 3 -     
               SIM Configuration Manual - Creating a DBS Configuration  
               File, according to the manual, the simcreatedbs script   
               would ask some questions when it was run. This was       
               misleading as it would only ask questions if the user    
               was not logged on as sim. Otherwise,  it would run       
               silently.  Now the manual has been modified to reflect   
               what the script actually does.                           

G426    214    Fixed the problem that hypertext links did not work in   
               INFO database.  This problem was due to PS files being   
               stored in the DB, but not available as BMP files.

R059           Fixed the problem that it took long time to evaluate a   
               recnum query over a large database.                      

        108    Fixed bug in interactive index updating code which       
               could cause the index                                    
               to be corrupted.                                         

G355    174    The stemming algorithm has now been documented in the    
               CLI Manual.                                              

R102    253    The documentation of the DDL DELETE command was          
               incorrectly stating the syntax of the command was DDL    
               DELETE DB &quot;foo&quot; when it is in fact DDL DELETE &quot;foo&quot;.     
               The documentation has been modified to reflect the real  
               command.                                                 
               Also after a database was deleted the BASE command was   
               still showing the number of records in the deleted       
               database as the number prior to deleting the database.   
               This bug has been fixed.                                 

R105    254    There was an error in the DDL DROP MAP RECSTRUCT         
               example in Volume 4 of the manual set. This has been     
               corrected.                                               

R068           Put default FSM files in the server's configuration      
               directory.  Hence removed the error messages that were   
               displayed when the server started up.

G250           Fixed the bug that SIM PCI could not summarise if the S  
               element set contained non SGML text.  Changed the INFO   
               database and introduced a virtual SGML field containing  
               the database info.                                       

R106    256    Fixed the bug which caused the database server to core   
               dump when passing an invalid database name to EDIT       
               INSERT command. Modified the documentation to indicate   
               that a database name may optionally be specified.        

G433           The DDL ALTER ORGANISATION command incorrectly allowed   
               the address field to contain newline characters. The     
               result was that the organisations flat file became       
               corrupted. This has now been fixed all newlines in       
               organisation descriptions are mapped to spaces.          

G145           Fixed a memory leak in the code for processing MARC      
               records.                                                 

G260           Fixed the problem which happened when siminitdbs         
               creates all the databases. It left the Stylesheets       
               database permissions so that DBA's could not update it.  

R075           Fixed a problem that caused time limited licences to     
               fail if the site was not in the Australia/Melbourne      
               time zone.                                               

G295           Fixed the bug which allowed DBA create a user name with  
               ``bad'' characters such as ``\verb#\n#'' in it. Now all  
               newlines are mapped to spaces.                           

R044    232    Fixed the problem when searching some terms in SGML      
               PCDATA in combination with anything that was not PCDATA  
               (e.g. modification times or attribute values) which      
               caused the search terms were not to be highlighted.      

G073           Fixed the bug that FIND ````'''' did not work.           

G249           Fixed the bug which ignored lens size sometimes in

G299           Fixed the bug which occurred when building the table of  
               content (TOC), If some records that the TOC was          
               pointing to do not exist, the SIMDBS kept growing until  
               it ran out of memory.

R122           The SGML parser could hang in some cases when an SGML    
               comment was opened but not closed before the end of the  
               document. This problem has been fixed.                   

G193           Fixed the bug that default values for element            
               attributes did not always work.                          

G447           Fixed the problem that the SGML parser did not support   
               element model groups that use the AND connector.         

G446           Fixed the problem that there was no support for          
               processing instructions. The parser now treats the       
               instructions like comments.                              

G445           Fixed the bug which occurred if the parameter entity     
               reference was followed by further attribute              
               definitions.  Now the parameter entity references can    
               be placed anywhere in the attlist declaration.           

G294           Fixed the bug that simsgmlc did not advise of a          
               successful parse.

R105    254    The DDL command for creating a database now includes a   
               reference to the section of the CLI administration       
               manual describing how to create database information     
               records for the INFO database.                           

G423           When doing edit updates, SIMCLI attempted to write its   
               temporary files to ./tmp which did not exist. This bug   
               has now been fixed.                                      

R116           Removed the blank lines that were displayed between      
               each of the legal servers when running simcli xyz        
               (unknown server).                                        

G397           Fixed the memory access problem which made the SIMCLI    
G398           core dump after failing to insert a record into          
               database.                                                

G337           Changed the field name, basename/info, of the Info       
               Database index from WORD to PHRASE in case there is      
               more than one word in the database name.                 

G186           When doing an EDIT UPDATE, the SIMCLI wrote out the      
               record in BLU format. However, if the field names were   
               reserved words, or had special characters in it, the     
               CLI did not put quotes around the field names. This      
               would cause a syntax error when reading the file back    
               in from the editor.  This problem is now fixed.          

G321           Corrected the CLI error message E1816.                   

G99            Fixed the bug which did not display an error message     
               when trying to do EDIT UPDATE but failed to find the     
               edit program, simclied.

               sets exist.

R127           Modified the function calls to simwww urlsafe in the

R104           In the CSIRO gateway, if the element set \bf S of a

G403           Fixed the bug that no error message was returned if an   
               error occured in a stylesheet.                           

G401           Changed the way that billing information was displayed.  
               If bill zero, output ``There was no charge for this      
               session''. Connection time is always displayed.          

R066    242    Fixed the bug that simwww urlsafe did not convert        
               spaces into \verb#20#.                                   

R047    238    Fixed a bug in saving search histories.  Now only        
               highlighted items are saved.  If no item is selected,    
               all current histories will be saved.

G315    c122   The  PCI returned error of &quot;Illegal function call&quot; when  
               all other active Windows applications were minimised,    
               but not when some were fullscreeen, or reduced-screen.   
               This bug was due to setting focus to a closed window     
               and is now fixed.                                        

G393    203    Fixed the problem that a dtd was not downloaded when

               Viewer window with databases that are using table of     
               content support.  Now it is able to prevent the viewer   
               resizing based on the CCL form position.                 

G206    c095   Fixed the bug which occured when searching for multiple

G390    202    Installation manual is misleading. Within Volume 3 -     
               SIM Configuration Manual - Creating a DBS Configuration  
               File, according to the manual, the simcreatedbs script   
               would ask some questions when it was run. This was       
               misleading as it would only ask questions if the user    
               was not logged on as sim. Otherwise,  it would run       
               silently.  Now the manual has been modified to reflect   
               what the script actually does.                           

G426    214    Fixed the problem that hypertext links did not work in   
               INFO database.  This problem was due to PS files being   
               stored in the DB, but not available as BMP files.

R059           Fixed the problem that it took long time to evaluate a   
               recnum query over a large database.                      

        108    Fixed bug in interactive index updating code which       
               could cause the index                                    
               to be corrupted.                                         

G355    174    The stemming algorithm has now been documented in the    
               CLI Manual.                                              

R102    253    The documentation of the DDL DELETE command was          
               incorrectly stating the syntax of the command was DDL    
               DELETE DB &quot;foo&quot; when it is in fact DDL DELETE &quot;foo&quot;.     
               The documentation has been modified to reflect the real  
               command.                                                 
               Also after a database was deleted the BASE command was   
               still showing the number of records in the deleted       
               database as the number prior to deleting the database.   
               This bug has been fixed.                                 

R105    254    There was an error in the DDL DROP MAP RECSTRUCT         
               example in Volume 4 of the manual set. This has been     
               corrected.                                               

R068           Put default FSM files in the server's configuration      
               directory.  Hence removed the error messages that were   
               displayed when the server started up.

G250           Fixed the bug that SIM PCI could not summarise if the S  
               element set contained non SGML text.  Changed the INFO   
               database and introduced a virtual SGML field containing  
               the database info.                                       

R106    256    Fixed the bug which caused the database server to core   
               dump when passing an invalid database name to EDIT       
               INSERT command. Modified the documentation to indicate   
               that a database name may optionally be specified.        

G433           The DDL ALTER ORGANISATION command incorrectly allowed   
               the address field to contain newline characters. The     
               result was that the organisations flat file became       
               corrupted. This has now been fixed all newlines in       
               organisation descriptions are mapped to spaces.          

G145           Fixed a memory leak in the code for processing MARC      
               records.                                                 

G260           Fixed the problem which happened when siminitdbs         
               creates all the databases. It left the Stylesheets       
               database permissions so that DBA's could not update it.  

R075           Fixed a problem that caused time limited licences to     
               fail if the site was not in the Australia/Melbourne      
               time zone.                                               

G295           Fixed the bug which allowed DBA create a user name with  
               ``bad'' characters such as ``\verb#\n#'' in it. Now all  
               newlines are mapped to spaces.                           

R044    232    Fixed the problem when searching some terms in SGML      
               PCDATA in combination with anything that was not PCDATA  
               (e.g. modification times or attribute values) which      
               caused the search terms were not to be highlighted.      

G073           Fixed the bug that FIND ````'''' did not work.           

G249           Fixed the bug which ignored lens size sometimes in       
               Fisheye TOC.                                             

G299           Fixed the bug which occurred when building the table of  
               content (TOC), If some records that the TOC was          
               pointing to do not exist, the SIMDBS kept growing until  
               it ran out of memory.

               instructions like comments.                              

G445           Fixed the bug which occurred if the parameter entity     
               reference was followed by further attribute              
               definitions.  Now the parameter entity references can    
               be placed anywhere in the attlist declaration.           

G294           Fixed the bug that simsgmlc did not advise of a          
               successful parse.

R105    254    The DDL command for creating a database now includes a   
               reference to the section of the CLI administration       
               manual describing how to create database information     
               records for the INFO database.                           

G423           When doing edit updates, SIMCLI attempted to write its   
               temporary files to ./tmp which did not exist. This bug   
               has now been fixed.                                      

R116           Removed the blank lines that were displayed between      
               each of the legal servers when running simcli xyz        
               (unknown server).                                        

G397           Fixed the memory access problem which made the SIMCLI    
G398           core dump after failing to insert a record into          
               database.                                                

G337           Changed the field name, basename/info, of the Info       
               Database index from WORD to PHRASE in case there is      
               more than one word in the database name.                 

G186           When doing an EDIT UPDATE, the SIMCLI wrote out the      
               record in BLU format. However, if the field names were   
               reserved words, or had special characters in it, the     
               CLI did not put quotes around the field names. This      
               would cause a syntax error when reading the file back    
               in from the editor.  This problem is now fixed.          

G321           Corrected the CLI error message E1816.                   

G99            Fixed the bug which did not display an error message     
               when trying to do EDIT UPDATE but failed to find the     
               edit program, simclied.                                  

G306    119    Fixed the EDIT bug with edit update r=1 when no result   
               sets exist.                                              

G322           Fixed the bug that the program siminsty displayed an     
               incomplete usage message.

R127           Modified the function calls to simwww urlsafe in the     
               CSIRO gateway.                                           

R111           Added descriptions about how the gateway uses DTDs into  
               SIM WWWGW manual.  Modified siminitwwwcsiro to set       
               SIM\_DTD\_PATH to the configuration directory.           

R104           In the CSIRO gateway, if the element set \bf S of a      
               database was not defined, it would fail to display the   
               summary list of a search. The error message displayed    
               was \em There are no records to summarise. The result    
               set is empty. This message was misleading as the result  
               set was not empty.  Now this error message has been      
               changed to as \em Failed to retrieve any records using   
               set name ''S''.                                          

G403           Fixed the bug that no error message was returned if an   
               error occured in a stylesheet.                           

G401           Changed the way that billing information was displayed.  
               If bill zero, output ``There was no charge for this      
               session''. Connection time is always displayed.          

R066    242    Fixed the bug that simwww urlsafe did not convert        
               spaces into \verb#20#.                                   

R047    238    Fixed a bug in saving search histories.  Now only        
               highlighted items are saved.  If no item is selected,    
               all current histories will be saved.

</dl>
<a NAME=INTR></a>
<h2><b> Introduction</b></h2>
<b>SIM PCI:</b><p>
<ul>
<li>is a graphical user interface (GUI) running under Microsoft windows<p>
<li>supports the Common Command Language for online searching (international standard ISO-8777) in a graphical way.<p>
</ul>
<p>
This means that the SIMPCI interface enables searchers to use a mouse and the 'point and click' technique.  Query forms, in which search terms are entered, together with menus, buttons, and pull-down lists are provided for operation of the SIM search func

tions.<p>
<b>Search features include:</b><p>
<ul>
<li>search one or multiple databases<p>
<li>view or print results<p>
<li>save results in a variety of electronic formats<p>
<li>display, store and recall search strategies<p>
<li>run regular current awareness searches (SDIs)<p>
<li>rank results (according to relevance to a chosen topic)<p>
<li>hypertext links, which enable users to move to related information (some databases only)<p>
<li>display of retrieved information in a formatted way, rather than as ASCII text.  That is, special characters such as Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts, and mathematical symbols are all displayed.  Retrieved information is displayed by the Waterl

oo Browser, text viewer software which is incorporated in SIM PCI.<p>
</ul>
<b>The Waterloo Viewer:</b><p>
<ul>
<li>presents SGML documents to the user.  (SIM databases comprise documents marked up in SGML - Standard Generlised Markup Language - which describes the structure and components of a document).<p>
<li>uses a style sheet for presentation of documents. Style sheets are stored centrally on the SIM Data Base Server (SIM DBS) where they can be updated and modified once only.  They are downloaded to the PC at first log on after installation of SIM PCI, a

nd are then stored locally on the PC.  SIMPCI will automatically download new style sheets whenever a modification is detected in the master copy on the SIM DBS.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Obtain SIM PCI by consulting your Systems Manager, or by using the CSIRO Software Installation (CSI) utility.  Check with your SysMan first if you have any queries or if SIM PCI is on your local LAN.<p>

<h2>Technical Summary</h2>
<h3> What is SIM PCI?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is a graphical user interface (GUI) running under Microsoft windows<p>
<li>It supports the query syntax of the  Common Command Language for online searching (International Standard ISO-8777)<p>
</ul>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Written using Visual Basic 3.0 and C Programming Language<p>
<li>Runs under Windows 3.1<p>
<li>Uses a Winsock 1.1 compliant TCP/IP networking software (eg: Trumpet Winsock, FIT, Chameleon).  <p>
<li>SIMPCI itself is not a z39.50 client, but uses a simplified communications protocol to communicate with a Gateway process (SIM PC Gateway) on a Unix host (Solaris or SunOS)<p>
<li>SIM PC Gateway uses z39.50 to communicate with the SIM DBS<p>
<li>SIM API (Application Programming Interface) handles all low level TCP/IP communication between SIM PCI and the Gateway<p>
</ul>
<h3>Client/Server Division of Tasks</h3>
<p>
<img src="../sim_components.gif">
<p>
<b>SERVER</b><p>
<ul>
<li>SIMDBS - central to the SIM Installation (Database Server)<p>
<li>SIMDBS stores all data, user and billing information, online help, indexes and utility databases (DTDs and Styles)<p>
</ul>
<b>CLIENT</b><p>
<ul>
<li>PC Gateway - Connects to Server<p>
<li>Can be on same physical machine or remote<p>
<li>All communication performed using Z39.50 protocol across TCP/IP 
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)<p>
</ul>
In addition to SIM PCI, SIM has two other clients: SIM World Wide Web 
gateway <a href="../simtute.htm">SIM WWW</a> and SIM Command Line 
Interface (SIM CLI).<p>
For further technical information, please consult the INFO database in SIM (<i>CSIRO users only </i>) or <a

<li>In the Log in window, type your userid at the name prompt, then press Enter
<p><li>Type the password at the password prompt, then press Enter
<p><li> Press Enter again to log on, or Click on the Log on button with the mouse<p>
</ul>
Userid and password are case sensitive, so use lower case.  <b>See your Divisional Librarian to obtain the userid and password.</b><P>
You are now logged onto SIM.
<P>

<h3>SELECTING A DATA BASE</H3>

You should see the following window:
<b>Database Selection Form</b><P>
For each database, the selection form gives the database name, the number 
of documents available to be searched and a very brief description of the database.<p>
To see a slightly longer description of a database, select its name in the list, then click on the 'Database Help' 
button.<p>
To connect to a database, scroll down the database list, double click on the database you want (or highlight it 
with one click, and then click on the 'OK' button on the bottom of the window).  The <b> CCL Query Form </b> will open.
<P>

You can select a new database any time during a SIM session.  To open, 
click on icon 2 (the 'Select Database (Disk)' icon on the SIM toolbar) and select from the list as before.
<P>
<a href="../simdoc2.htm">Database guides</a> are available for each 
database in SIM.<p> <h3>LOGGING OFF</h3>
To log out of SIM-PCI, choose <b> File Exit </b> from the toolbar menu. The session and billing 
details are displayed.  Click <b> OK </b> to terminate the SIM PCI session.<P>
If SIM is running but you do nothing in it for 20 minutes, the connection 
to the server is automatically lost.  You will need to exit SIM and 
re-establish the connection<P>

<p>

<H3><b>Contents</b></H3>
<ul>
<li><a href=#TOOLBAR>Introduction </a><p>
<li><a href=#LAYOUT>Toolbar Layout </a><p>
<li><a href=#BUTTONS>Toolbar Buttons </a><p>
<li><a href=#MENUS>Toolbar Menus </a><p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<a name=TOOLBAR> </a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
When you log onto SIM PCI, the SIM toolbar appears. The toolbar<p>
<ul>
<li>is displayed at the top of the screen<p>
<li>displays your current status and what you are allowed to do<p>
<li>enables the user to select a function by toolbar button (icon), <p>
function key or menu
</ul><p>
The number of buttons available will be dependent on where you are at any 
one time.  Some buttons are not 
visible until their use is appropriate.  For example, when you first log 
on, only the Servers selection and MS 
DOS buttons are visible.<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name=LAYOUT> </a>
<h3> TOOLBAR LAYOUT</h3>
<IMG SRC=simmenu.gif>
<p>
<p>
On the SIM toolbar:<p>
<UL>
<li>there are standard window menus: such as File, Edit, View, Options 
and Help.<p>
<li>the toolbar buttons activate search-related functions (such as Find, 
Rank, Scan, View, Print, Save)<p>
<li>the line below the Toolbar buttons tells you which database(s) you 
are connected to (<b>Bases:</b>); what formats are used for display 
(<b>Display:</b>); the set number being viewed (<b>Set:</b>) and the 
number of records in the set.<p>
<li>the <b>Status</b> line shows what is happening when requests are 
made, current status, some error messages and so on.  It displays 
commands being forwarded to the SIM database server and any messages 
regarding search failure.  Other error messages will be displayed in a 
separate window and will require you to confirm by clicking an 'OK' button.<p>
<li><b>State:</b> (next to Status Line) displays the current working 
state, ie. whether SIM PCI is <i>Idle</i> (waiting for user input) or 
<i>Searching</i>.  The State button can also be used to cancel a search 
or save operation that appears to be taking too long.<p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<a name=BUTTONS> </a>
<H3> TOOLBAR BUTTONS</H3>
The buttons (icons) on the toolbar are used to open or close the 
functional windows in SIM.  Some icons are not visible until their use is 
appropriate.  The 'viewing' icons appear only when you are viewing

<h2>RETRIEVING INFORMATION</h2>
With SIM PCI you have several ways of retrieving information:<p>
<ul>
<li>entering your search terms to find all records containing those terms (use the CCL Query Form); <p>
<li>scanning an index, and searching for the terms you pick from a list (use icon 6 and the Scan Index Terms window);<p>
<li>entering search terms to be ranked, so that only the 50 records most relevant are retrieved (use icon 5 and the Rank Query Form).<p>
</ul>

Each of these search techniques generates a result set, which is a collection of all of the records that were found by the search.  Result sets are kept by SIM until the end of your session.  You can view, print, and download (save to your local disk) the
 records in a set. You can use result sets as part of subsequent searches, or delete them.  The search strategy (the text of sets without the records they retrieved) may be saved for use again in the future.<p>
<hr>
<a name=CCL> </a>
<h2>USING THE CCL QUERY FORM </h2>
<a name=SIMP> </a>
<H3>Simple Searches - Searching the Basic Index</h3>
After you select a database at log on, the <b> CCL Query Form </b> opens.  <p>
The upper box in this form is the Index box, where the index which is currently being searched is shown.  SIM databases have several (sometimes many) <a href="inforet.htm#IXS"> indexes</a>.  The default index for searching is the Basic index, which typic
ally contains the 
text fields such as title, abstract, descriptors and notes.  In other words, a search using the Basic index searches individual words.<p>
The other indexes are known as Secondary Indexes.  To search another 
index, click the arrow and select from the list. The indexes which are 
available for each SIM database are explained in detail in the SIM  <a 
href="../simdoc2.htm">database guides</a>.<p>

The lower box is the Query text box, where search terms are entered.<p>
To the right of the Index box there is a button (usually showing the  <b> = </b>  symbol), which is used to open the window in which you can perform <a href=#CONTEXT> contextual</a> and <a href=#NUM> numeric </a> (relational) operations on your search ter
ms.<p>
To initiate a search, type a word or words in the query text box and click the <b> Find </b>   button (or press <b> Enter</b>). <p>
Example:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Basic index if it is not already selected <p>
<li>Enter <I> groundwater </i> in the query box <p>
<li>Click the  <b> Find </b>    button (or press  <b> Enter</b>) <p>
</ol>
The <b> Set History </b>  window will open and the results will appear there.  The set number, number of records retrieved ('hits') and the text of the query will be shown.<p>
Word <a href="inforet.htm#ADJ"> adjacency </a>is automatic in SIM for text you search in the Basic index in the <b> CCL Query form</b>.  For example, to search for the term <I>  biological control</i>, enter the two words in the Query text box.  SIM auto
matically searches 
for records where the two words appear adjacent to each other and in that order.  <p>
If you want records where  <I> biological </i> and  <I> control </i> appear anywhere in the record, you would 
use the Boolean <b> AND </b>  operator, eg <I>  biological <b> and </b> control </I>.  
<p>
<a href="inforet.htm#TRU">Truncation</a> and <a href="inforet.htm#PMA"> 
masking </a> can be used.  For example, <I> control? </I> retrieves all word starting with the stem <I> control </I> - <I> control, controlled, controlling, controls </i> and so on.<p>
<a name=SOI> </a>
<h3>Searching other Indexes (Secondary Indexes)</h3>
Indexes contain specific fields. When you do a search, it is the selected 
index that determines the fields that are searched for the term that you 
enter.  Therefore, not every field is searched every time you do a search.<p>
Secondary indexes are additional indexes for specific fields eg: authors, subjects, date, etc.  Currently each SIM database has its secondary indexes indexed in a special way, so that the complete contents of the field forms the index entry.  This enables
 the searcher 
to scan the index and pick from the list of entries.
However, it also means that if you are searching for only one word or part of a field entry in a secondary index you must truncate your search term (at the start and/or at the end).  The truncation symbol is the question mark (?).<p>
To search a secondary index, click the down arrow beside the Index box in the <b> CCL Query form </b> and select from the list.  For example, to find a specific author in CC:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select Author in the drop-down list<p>
<li>Enter the name in the Query text box, eg  <I> collins ac </i><br>(end your term with a question mark, eg  <I> collins a? </i>, if you are unsure of the initials, or are entering only part of the likely contents of the field).<p>
<li>Click the  <b> Find </b>  button (or press  <b> Enter</b>).<p>
</ol>
The indexes which are available for each SIM database are explained in detail in the SIM  <a href="simdoc2.htm">  database guides</a>.<p> 
<a name=COMBIX> </a>
<h3>Combining Terms from Two Indexes</h3>
The small check box below the query text box in the <b>  CCL Query form </b>  allows another index to be selected, so that a query can include search terms from different indexes.  Another query box will appear when the check box is selected.  The search 
operation between these fields is a <a href="inforet.htm#BOOL"> Boolean </a>AND.<p>
For example, if your search topic is <i>  the ecology of coral reefs </i> and you are using the CC database:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Basic index if it is not already selected <p>
<li>Enter <I> coral reefs </i> in its query box <p>
<li>Click on the check box<p>
<li>Choose the KeywordISI index from the list opened by clicking on the lower down-arrow<p>
<li>Enter <I> ecology </i> in the lower query box  <p>
<li>Click the  <b> Find </b>  button (or press  <b> Enter</b>)  <p>
</ol>
This will retrieve records which satisfy both search specifications - records containing both <i>  coral reefs </i> in the Basic index and <I> ecology </i> in the KeywordISI index.<p>
<a NAME=CONTEXT></a>
<H3>Searching for Terms according to Context or Proximity</h3>
Context searching is done from the <b> Select an Operator </b> window.<p>
This window is opened by clicking on the button beside the Index box in the <b>  CCL Query form </b>.  This button will usually display the   <b> = </b>  symbol, but will show another symbol if the last search operation was a context or numeric search.  T
he <b> Select an Operator </b> window provides both <b> Textual </b> and <b> Numeric </b> operators for use in your search.  The default search is 'within a field' (represented by the <b> = </b>   symbol).<p>

The <b> Textual </b> operators enable you to search for words according to their proximity to other words.  These operators are represented by the buttons marked:
<dl>
<dd><pre> <b> = </b>     in field (select the indexed field from the spin box in the <b> CCL Query form</b>.  
<dd> <b> with </b>  in same paragraph (word order ignored)
<dd> <b> same </b>  in same sentence (not currently implemented - results are the same as 'with')
<dd> <b> % </b>     within n words; word order is ignored (enter <I> n </I> (number of words) in the 'Within <I> n </I> words' box)
<dd> <b> ! </b>     within n words; word order preserved</pre>
</dl><p>
These operators work on the Basic index and any other field indexed by 'word' rather than 'whole field'.  Word indexes are indicated by the lower case <b> w </b>prefixing the field name in the list from which you choose the <b> CCL Query Form </b> (eg, <b
> wTitle </b>).<p>
For example, you may wish to find records about 'biological controls'.  You will want to find records containing text such as:<br>
<I>	     biological control(s)<br>
	     biological weed control(s)<br>
	     control by biological means<br>
	     controlling weeds by biological methods</i><p>
You can use the <b> Within <I> n </i> words </b> operators (<b> % </b> or <b> ! </b>) to find relevant records:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Basic index in the <b> CCL Query form </b> <p>
<li>Type the first word of your phrase in the Query box:  <i> biological </i><p>
<li> Click on the button showing the  <b> = </b>  sign<p>
<li>When the <b> Select an Operator </b> window appears, type  <b> 3 </b>  in the <b> Within <I> n </i> words </b> box, and click the  <b> % </b>  button.  This means 'within 3 words, in any order'<p>
<li> The  <b> CCL Query form </b>  will appear.  Note that a second query box has appeared.  This is for the second term in the context query.  <p>
<li>Type  <I> control? </i> in the second query box.  (The <b> ? </b>   is the truncation symbol - use it to retrieve <i> control</i>, <I> controls</i>, <I> controlling </i> and so on.)<p>
<li>Click the  <b> Find </b>  button (or press  <b> Enter</b>)<p>
<li>The set will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>
</ol><p>
Remember to open the <b> Select an Operator </b> window again and select the  <b> = </b>  button if you wish to return to normal searching for your next set.  Selecting the   <b> = </b>  button returns the  <b> CCL Query form </b>   to the default 'in fie
ld' search function.<p>
<A NAME=NUM></A>
<H3> Searching with the Numeric (Relational) Operators</h3>
Numeric (relational) searching is also done from the <b>  Select an Operator </b> window.<p>
This window is opened by clicking on the button beside the Index box in the <b>  CCL Query form </b>. This button will usually display  <b> = </b>  , but will show another symbol if the last search operation was a context or numeric search. <p>  
The numeric operators are listed in the left hand side of the window.  These operators can be used in the fields which contain numeric values.  The most common and useful application of this technique is to search for publication year.<p>
For example, if you wish to search for items published in or after 1994, you would search the PublYear field for a value greater than or equal to (<b> &gt;= </b>)  1994.<p>
<ol>
<li>In the <b> CCL Query form </b>, click on the arrow beside the Index box, scroll down and select PublYear<p>
<li>Type the year in the Query box:  <I> 1994 </i><p>
<li>Click on the button beside the Index box (it shows <b>  =  </b>  or another symbol)<p>
<li>When the <b> Select an Operator </b> window appears click on the <b> &gt;= </b> button<p>
<li> The  <b> CCL Query form </b>  will appear<p>
<li>Click the  <b> Find </b>  button (or press  <b> Enter</b>)<p>
<li>The result set will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<br><p>
</ol>
<hr>
<A NAME=SCAN></A>
<h2>SCANNING INDEXES</h2>
You can scan any of the indexes within any database for any term.  This 
is the easiest method of finding information in the Secondary 
indexes, which are indexed by field, not by individual word as in the Basic 
index.<p>
The term you scanned for is shown amid about 10 index entries above and below it in the alphabetical sequence. If the exact term you want is not found, the list shows the best 
approximation. You can then use any term from the index to search the 
database for matching records.<p>
Scanning the index is useful if you are unsure of the exact spelling of a 
term, or you wish to search for several variants of a term.  It also enables you to find and search for a misspelt word.<p>
To scan the indexes:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click icon 6 (the 'A-Z' icon) to open the <b> Scan Index Terms </b> window<p>
<li>Type the term (or part of the term) you wish to scan in the Term box at the top of the form<p>
<li>Click the down arrow beside the Index box, and choose from the drop-down list the index you wish to scan <p>
<li>Click the <b> Scan </b> button at the bottom of the form<br><p>
When you see the term(s) you wish to search for:<p>
<li>Click on your choice(s) to highlight them<p>
<li>Click on the  <b> Search </b>  button at the foot of the form<p>
</ol><p>
Note: if your terms appear on more than one screen in the  <b> Scan Index Terms </b> window, highlight them and search for them one screen at a time.  The highlighting does not persist from one screen to another in this window.<p>
SIM will search for the terms you have highlighted and the results will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.  If you have searched for more than one term, highlight the relevant sets in the <b> Set History </b> window and use the  <b> Combinations O
R </b>  menu option to combine the sets.<p>
<P>
<hr>
<a NAME=RANK></a>
<h2>RANKING</h2>
Rank searches are used to find and list, in order of relevance, records 
which satisfy the search query.  A rank search statement may not contain 
Boolean, pattern matching and wildcard operators.<p>
SIM performs a statistical analysis on the database to determine the 
importance of the keywords.  It then orders the records resulting from a 
rank search, with most important listed first.  A maximum of 50 records 
are retrieved.<P>
<a NAME=SIMPRANK></a>
<h3>Simple Ranking</h3>
To perform a rank search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on icon 5 (the RANK icon) to open the <b> Rank Query form </b> <p>
<li>Enter a word or words in the Rank query text box, eg <I> fruit </i>  <i> vegetable </i>  <I> export </i><p>
Don't use operators or wildcard symbols.<p>
Note that in a Rank search, the space between terms represents a Boolean  <b> OR </b>  operation, not adjacency.<p>
<li>Click the  <b> Rank </b>  button, or press  Enter<p>
</ol>
The results will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>  Rank sets can be used and viewed just like Find sets (sets created in the  <b> CCL Query form</b>).<p>
A rank search may only be performed on one database at a time.  
Therefore, it cannot be used if you select multiple databases.<p>
Specific fields cannot be rank searched.  A rank search only searches the 
fields included in the Basic index.<p>
<A NAME=RANKPS></A>
<h3>Ranking a Previous Set</h3>
One of the most useful applications of RANK is to perform a rank search 
on a previous set:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on icon 5 (the RANK icon) to open the <b> Rank Query form </b> <p>
<li>Enter the set number (eg s3) <p>
<li>Click the  <b> Rank </b>  button, or press  <b> Enter </b><p>
</ol><p>
The results will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>
<a NAME=RANKTM></a>
<h3>Ranking a Set by Another Term </h3>
You can also rank a previous set by another term (a
term which was not in the original search).  For example, you could rank a previous search on <I> coral reefs </i> according to the term <I> pollution</i>.  The result set will present those relating to pollution first, followed by those not containing th
e word  <I> pollution</i>.<p>
Suppose your <I> coral reefs </i> set is set 1 (s1).  The steps are:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on icon 5 (the RANK icon) to open the <b> Rank Query form </b><p>
<li>In the Rank query text box enter the set number followed by the new term (eg <I> s1 pollution </i>) <p>
<li>Click the  <b> Rank </b>  button, or press  <b> Enter </b><p>
</ol><p>
The results will appear in the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>

<a NAME=VIEW></A>
<h2>VIEWING RECORDS</h2>
To view the records of the result set, you may:<p>
<ul>
<li>Double click on a result set in the  <b> Set History </b> window, or <p>
<li>Highlight the set you wish to view, then click on the  <b> eye </b>  button on the SIM Toolbar, or<p>
<li>View a summary list of titles by clicking icon 8, or using <b>  Operations Summarize </b> from the <b> Set History</b> window.<p>
</ul><p>
When you double click on a result set in the  <b> Set History </b> window, or click on the  <b> eye </b>  button, the  <b> Text viewer </b>  window will open and the first record in the set displays in it.  From there, you can :<p>
<ul>
<li>Step through the full records, one by one (use the text viewer controls on the SIM toolbar)<p>
<li>Jump to any record in the set (type the record number in the box after <b>  Set: </b> on the toolbar<p>
<li>Print the records<p>
</ul>
The default display in the  <b> Text Viewer </b>  window is the entire record (F or Full fieldset).<p>
If you wish to view different formats or fields:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <b> Display Fields </b> icon (to the left of the <b>  eye </b> button)<p>
<li>Choose a Field Set in the upper window of the  <b> Display Fields Form </b><p>
<li>Click the <b> Use Selected Fields </b> button<p>
</ol><p>
The record will be shown in the <b> Text Viewer </b> window in the display format you selected.<p>
<dt>Field sets (display formats) are available for different purposes.  Some examples are:<p>
<dd><b> F </b>	Full format (all fields)<p>
<dd><b> B </b>	Brief format (a subset of fields)<p>
<dd><b> C </b>	Citation only (fields containing elements of a bibliographic citation, excluding the abstract)
<p>
A complete list of field sets for each database is given in the appropriate <a href="simdoc2.htm"> database guide</a>.<p>
<A NAME=HYP></a>
<h3>Hypertext Links</h3>
Some SIM databases have hypertext links between related records, enabling the searcher to jump from one section of text to another related area of text.  The hypertext trail is recorded and may be followed back and forth using the hypertext control button
s on the SIM toolbar.<p>
In the Current Contents (CC) database, individual item records are automatically linked to the corresponding table of contents record for that issue of the journal.  You can jump to the table of contents, and any of the records referenced from there, by c
licking on the red hypertext links shown in the displayed record.  (You will know your mouse pointer is positioned over a hypertext link if the arrow changes to a pointing finger.)<p>
As you jump between records using the red hypertext links, the hypertext 
navigation buttons on the toolbar become usable.  They allow you to move forwards and 
backwards through the documents you have already displayed in the 
hypertext trail.<p>
<P>
<a NAME=SUML></a>
<h3>Viewing a Summary List</h3>
To view a summary list of titles in your result set:<p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight your chosen set in the  <b> Set History </b> window.<p>
<li>Click icon 8, or <p>
<li>Choose <b> Operations Summarize </b> from the <b> Set History </b> window.<p>
</OL><p>
Either of these actions will open the  <b> Summary List </b>  window. This window displays a one entry per line list of the records in the set.<p>
Scroll through the list:<p>
<ul>
<li>one record at a time - click the up or down scrollbar arrows<p>
<li>10 records at a time (one screen-full) - click in the scrollbar just above or below the relevant arrow.<p>
</ul><p>
From this form, you can select and mark any number of records in the set and:<p>
<ul>
<li>View the records (double click in the list on the record you wish to view)<p>
<li>Print the records<p>
<LI>Save the records to your workstation (known as 'saving to disk' or 'downloading').<p>
</UL><p>
If you wish to mark records, do so before you scroll to the next screen.<p>
Note that the <b>  Summary List </b> form has a <b> Fields </b> button in the top left corner.  Click this if you wish to view, print or save a different set of fields.  The default for saving or printing is the 'Full' (F) fieldset.<p>
<hr>
<a NAME=PRR></a>
<h2>PRINTING RECORDS</h2>
You can print your search results in several ways: <p>
<ul>
<li>Use the  <b> Printer </b>  icon on the SIM Toolbar to print the document displayed in the text Viewer window.  Note: this prints ONLY the document you are currently viewing.<p>
<li>Choose the menu option <b> Operations Print Result Set  </b> from the  <b> Set History </b> window. (Make sure the set you wish to print is highlighted in the  <b> Set History </b> window.)<p>
<li>Use the <b> Print Marked </b> button in the <b> Summary List </b> window to print selected records.<p>
</ul><p>
All text formatting (fonts, bold, italics) will be preserved if you print with on eof these options.<p>
All fields (ie, the default 'Full' fieldset) will be printed unless you select a different fieldset by means of the <b>  Display Fields </b>  button on the toolbar, or the  <b> Fields </b>  button in the <b> Summary List </b>  window.<p>
Note:	When you print a result set with the <b> Operations Print Result Set  </b> menu option from the  <b> Set History </b> window, every record in your set will be printed, but you will have to click <b>  OK </b> in a printer dialogue window for <b> each
 </b> record.  (This is a function of the Waterloo Browser Text Viewer software). <p>
An alternative to this tedious process is:<p>
<ol>
<li>Save the records to a file on your workstation<p>
<li>Load the file into your word processing software<p>
<li>Select the entire document<p>
<li>Select a 'fixed space' font such as Courier (this is because the saved file is plain ASCII text, not formatted, and the fixed space font makes the record layout correct)<p>
<li>Print the file from your word processor<p>
</ol><p>
<hr>
<a NAME=SAV></a>
<h2>SAVING RECORDS TO DISK</h2>
You can save ('download') your results to disk in several ways: <p>
<ul>
<li>Use icon 10 (the  <b> Diskette </b>  icon) on the SIM Toolbar to save the document displayed in the <b> Text Viewer </b>.  Note: this saves ONLY the document you are currently viewing.<p>
<li>Choose the menu option <b> Operations Save </b>  from the  <b> Set History </b> window. (Make sure the set you wish to save is highlighted in the  <b> Set History </b> window.)<p>
<li>Use the <b> Save Marked </b> button in the <b> Summary List </b> window to save selected records.<p>
</ul>
The Process Records window will appear:<p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a field set (for example, B - brief, F - full, S- summary) in the upper section (<b>Use Field Sets</b>) <p>
<li>Select a format in the lower section (<b>Use Record Format</b>) (only those appropriate for the database will be shown) <p>
<li>If you wish all the records in the set to be written into one file on your disk, make sure that there is an X in the <b>  Write all records to one file </b> check box.  (Click on the check box to turn the X on or off).<p>
<li>Click on the  <b> Process </b>  button.<p>
<li>The  <b> Save As window </b>  opens.  In this window you may assign a file name and nominate a drive and/or directory.  (If you choose an existing file name, a window will open which offers you the options of appending to the file, or overwriting it.)
<p>
<li>Click  <b> OK </b>  to save the file.<p>
<li>Click on the  <b> Close </b>  button to close the  <b> Process Records </b>  window.<p>
</ol>
The saved file is a plain ASCII file.  Outside SIM you can use this file with your applications software: edit it, print it, email it, or load it into your personal database software (if you have saved it in the format appropriate for that software). <p>
If you wish to view these records in your word processing software, make sure that after you load them you select the entire file and change your font to <b>courier</b> so that the record layout is correct.<p><br>

<LI>Under the heading Default File Format, choose the option that is
appropriate to your environment.  For example, if you use the SIMWWW with
a Mac, click on the MAC text option. This will ensure that files that
you save to disk, etc are in the correct text format.<p>
<LI>Select any other configuration options you wish to implement.  (For 
example, you may choose a default database (ie, you will automatically 
connect to this database each time you log on); adjust the length and/or 
width of certain windows; choose to have either the Search Results Sets, 
the Summarize screen or the View Record screen display after a search; 
show words instead of the SIM icons.)<p>
<LI>Click the Save Changes button to implement the changes you have selected.<p>

<h2>Searching the Basic Index</h2>
<p>To initiate a search of the selected database, click the 'FIND' icon 
to 
display the Simple Search form.
<p>To initiate a single word search, a phrase search or a simple Boolean 
search, type a word or words to find in the query box and click the 
'Perform Search' button. 
<p>Example:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Basic Index if it is not already selected.<p>
<li>Enter <i>groundwater</i> in the query box.<p>
<li>Click the 'Perform Search' button.<p>
</ol>
<p>Depending on how SIMWWW has been configured for your userid, either 
the Search Result Sets screen or Summarize screen will open and the 
results will appear. In the Search Result Sets screen, the set number, 
number of records retrieved ('hits') and the text of the query will be 
shown. In the Summarize screen, a one line, hyperlinked entry per record 
is displayed.
<p><a 
href="inforet.htm#ADJ">Word adjacency</a> is automatic in SIM.  For example, 
to search for the term <i>biological control</i>, enter the two words and SIM 
automatically searches for records where the two words appear adjacent to each other. If you want records where <i>biological</i> and 
<i>control</i> appear anywhere, you would have to use the <a 
href="inforet.htm#BOOL">Boolean</a> <i>and</i> operator.
<p><a 
href="inforet.htm#IXS">Indexes</a> contain specific fields. When you do a 
search, it is the selected index that determines the fields that are 
searched for the term that you enter.  Therefore, not every field is 
searched every time you do a search. For example, the Basic index is the 
default and typically contains free text fields such as title, abstract, 
descriptors and notes.  In other words, a search using the Basic index 
searches individual words. To search specific fields, click the down 
arrow and select from the drop down list.  For example, to find publications 
from a specific year in CSIX, select PublYear, enter the year in the query box 
and click the 'Perform Search' button.
<p>The indexes which are available for each SIM database are explained in 
detail in the SIM <a 
href="../simdoc2.htm">database guides</a>.
<hr>
<a name=SCAN></a>
<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>You can scan any of the indexes within any database for any term.  
This is the easiest and best method for finding information in the Secondary 
indexes which are indexed by field, not by individual word as in the 
Basic index.  If the exact term you want is not found, the index lists 
the best approximation.  You can then use any term from the index to 
search the database for matching records.
<p>Scanning the index is useful if you are unsure of the exact spelling 
of a term, or a word is spelt incorrectly in the index.
<p>To scan the indexes:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Scan index icon (the 'A-Z' icon) to open the Scan Indexes 
window.<p>
<li>Type the term (or part of the term) you wish to scan in the Term box.<p>
<li>Click the down arrow beside the Index box, and choose from the 
drop-down list the index you wish to scan.<p>
<li>Click the 'Scan' button at the bottom of the form. The result of an 
index scan is a list of the entire index you selected, at the term, or 
its nearest approximation, that you entered. If you want to then search 
the database using an index term, select the term and click the 'Search 
using selected term(s)' button.  This will open the either the Search 
Result Sets window or Summarizing records screen (depending on how SIMWWW 
has been configured for your userid.)<p>
</ol>
<p>If your terms appear on more than one screen in the Scan Index Terms 
window, highlight them and search for them one screen at a time. The 
highlighting does not persist from one screen to another in this window.
<p>You can select several terms from the list.  To select contiguous 
terms, 
hold down the  Shift  key and select the first and last term.  To select 
non-contiguous terms, use the  Ctrl  key on the PC or the  Command  
(apple) key on the Mac, during selection.
<hr>
<a name=RANK></a>
<h2>Ranking</h2>
<p>Rank searches are used to find and list, in order of relevance, 
records which satisfy the search statement.  A rank search statement may not 
contain Boolean, pattern matching or wildcard operators.
<p>SIM performs a statistical analysis on the database to determine the 
importance of the keywords.  It then orders the records resulting from a 
rank search, with most important listed first.  A maximum of 50 records 
are listed.<p>To perform a rank search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the RANK icon.<p>
<li>Enter a word or words in the text box, eg. <i>fruit vegetable export</i>.
Note that in a Rank search, the space between terms represents a Boolean 
<b>OR</b> operation, not adjacency.<p>
<li>If you wish SIM to remove all punctuation within words, check the 
'Sanitise text' button.<p>
<li>Click the 'Search' button.<p>
<li>The results will appear in either the Search Result Sets screen or 
the Summarize Records screen (depending on how SIMWWW has been 
configured). Rank sets can be used and viewed just like Find sets (sets 
created in the 'Simple Search' form).<p>
</ol>
<p>A Rank search may only be performed on one database at a time.  
Therefore, it cannot be used if you select multiple databases.
Specific fields cannot be rank searched.  A rank search only searches the 
fields specified in the Basic index.
<h3>Ranking a previous set</h3>
<p>One of the most useful applications of RANK is to perform a rank 
search 
on a previous set:<p>
<ol>
<li>Display the Search Result Sets window and note the set number (eg. 
set 3 entered as s3). <p>
<li>Click the rank icon to move to the Ranked Search screen.<p>
<li>Enter the set number (eg s3) in the text box and click 'Search'.<p>
<li>The results will appear in the screen configured for your userid.<p>
</ol><p>
<h3>Ranking a set by another term</h3>
<p>You can rank a previous set by another term (a term which was not in 
the original search).  For example, you could rank a search on 
<i>fruit</i> 
and <i>vegetables</i> according to the term <i>marketing</i>.  This lists 
the entries with those relating to <i>marketing</i> first, followed by 
those not containing the word <i>marketing</i>.
<p>The steps are:<p>
<ol>
<li>Display the Search Result Sets window and note the relevant set 
number (eg. set 3 is used as s3). <p>
<li>Click the rank icon to move to the Ranked Search screen.<p>
<li>Enter the set number followed by the new term, eg. enter s3 
<i>marketing</i> and click the 'Search' button.<p>
<li>The results will appear in the screen that is configured for your 
userid (i.e either Search Result Sets or Summarize Records).<p>
</ol>
<hr>
<a name=WORK></a>
<h2>Working with Sets</h2>
<p>When a SIM search is complete, the results and the options are shown 
in 
the Search Result Sets window (if SIMWWW is configured for your userid 
this way). Using the radio buttons, select the option you want, and click 
'Process'. 
<p>The following options appear as radio buttons:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Combine Sets:</b> AND/OR/1st NOT 2nd/2nd NOT 1st<p>
<li><b>Set Operations:</b> RANK set/DELETE set<p>
<li><b>Records in Set:</b> Show/Summarize/Capture<p>
<li><b>Search Strategy:</b> Save/Capture<p>
</ul>
<p>If SIM is configured to show the Summarize screen, a summary list of 
hyperlinked records appears.
<p>The result set itself is a collection of all the records that were 
found by the search. Result sets are kept by SIM until the end of your 
session.<p>
<p>You can work with sets to combine them in subsequent searches, or 
delete them, or save them (without the records they retrieved) for use 
again in the future.
<p>You can view, print and download (save to your local disk) the records 
in a set.
<a name=DEL></a>
<h3>Deleting result sets</h3><p>
<p><ol>
<li>Highlight the set or sets in the 'Search Result' window.<p>
<li>Choose the <b>DELETE set</b> radio button.<p>
<li>Click the 'Process' button.<p>
</ol><p>
<a name=SAV></a>
<h3>Saving searches</h3>
<p>You can save a database search (without the retrieved records) and 
quickly recall and repeat the search at a later date.  The search is 
saved by SIM.
<p>To save a search strategy:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the result sets in the 'Search Result Sets' form. (If the 
search strategy you want to save is the result of several combined 
searches, you must save all the search results that comprise the final 
result.)<p>
<li>Select the <b>Save</b> radio button and click the 'Process' button. <p>
The Save Strategy File screen will open.
<li>Enter a name for the saved search in the 'Save to File' box, and 
click the 'Save' button.<p>
</ol>
<p>If you want to overwrite a saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.
<a name=SDI></a>
<h3>SDI saves</h3>
<p> An SDI, or Selective Dissemination of Information, search is one that 
is 
time stamped.  When the search is run subsequently, only records added to 
the database since the last search are returned.
<p>To save an SDI search:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the result sets in the 'Search Result Sets' form. (If the 
search strategy you want to save is the result of several combined 
searches, you must save all the search results that comprise the final 
result.)<p>
<li>Select the <b>Save</b> radio button and click the 'Process' button. 
The Save Strategy File screen will open.<p>
<li>Enter a name for the saved search in the 'Save to File' box.<p>
<li>Check the SDI box, and click the 'Save' button. The search will be 
saved with a set 0 (S0) line showing the creattime (time stamp of the 
last time the search was run).<p>
</ol>
<p>If you want to overwrite a saved search, use the same name for the new 
search.  The old saved search will be overwritten.
<p>Saved searches may only be run in the database in which they were 
entered and saved.
<a name=RER></a>
<h3>Rerunning a saved search or SDI</h3>
<p>Saved searches or SDI searches may be run in this way:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Saved Searches icon to open the Saved Search Form.<p>
<li>Select your saved search. <p>
<li>Click the <b>Load</b> radio button, then the 'Process' button.<p>
</ol>
<p>The search will be executed and the sets will appear in the Search 
Result Sets screen or Summarize screen. Work with your result sets in the 
usual way. You do not need to re-save a search each time you run it.
<a name=ED></a>
<h3>Editing a saved search</h3>
<p>Saved searches or SDI searches may be edited in the Saved Search screen:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select your saved search.<p>
<li>Click the <b>Edit</b> radio button. The search strategy will appear.<p>
<li>Position the mouse pointer (cursor) in the appropriate place, and add 
or delete text as you wish. If the search is an SDI search, make sure you 
do not delete set 0 (S0).<p>
<li>Click the 'Save' button to save it under the same name or type in a 
new name in the 'File Name' box to save it under another name. (You may 
want to add the letters sdi to the end of your file name as SIM does not 
automatically do this).<p>
</ol>
<a name=DSS></a>
<h3>Deleting a saved search</h3>
<p>To delete unwanted saved search strategies:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the 'Find Saves' icon.<p>
<li>Click the Saved Search' icon.<p>
<li>Select the search or searches to be deleted and click the 
<b>Delete</b> radio button.<p>
<li>Click the 'Process' button to perform this operation.<p>
</ol>

<h2>Viewing Records</h2>
<p>The steps you take to view a record depend on the screen you are at.
<p>To view the records of the result set, click the <b>Show</b> radio button in the Search Result Sets screen, then click the 'Process' button. 
<p>If SIMWWW is configured to show the View Records screen straight after a search, the first record in the set will be displayed. 
<p>From there, you can :<p>
<ul>
<li>Step through the full records, one by one.<p>
<li>Print the records.<p>
<li>Jump to any record in the set.<p>
</ul>
<p>The default display in the View Records screen is the entire record (Full Display).
<p>If you wish to view different formats or fields:<p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the down arrow in the <b>Field Sets</b> box.<p>
<li>Scroll down the list and choose a Field Set.<p>
<li>Click the 'Change' button.<p>
</ol>
<p>The record will be shown in the View Records screen in the display format you selected.
<p>Field sets (display formats) are available for different purposes. These  are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Full Display<p>
<li>Brief Display with Abstract<p>
<li>Brief Display without Abstract<p>
<li>Citation<p>
<li>Title-only Summary<p>
</ul>
<p>You can choose a Style in which to view the records. The default for viewing is Web-Browser, but if you click on the down arrow next to the Style box, you can select another Style.
<a name=HYP></a>
<h3>Hypertext Links</h3>
<p>Some databases have <a href="pcivwpr.htm#HYP">  hypertext links</a> between related records, enabling the searcher to jump from one section of text to another related area of text. The hypertext trail is recorded and may be followed back and forth usi
ng the hypertext control buttons on the SIM toolbar.
<p>In the Current Contents database, records are automatically linked to the corresponding table of contents record for that issue of the journal. You can jump to the table of contents, and any of the records referenced from there, by clicking on the blue

 hypertext links shown in the displayed record. (You will know your mouse pointer is positioned over a hypertext link if the arrow changes to a pointing finger).
<p>As you jump between records using the blue hypertext links, the hypertext navigation buttons on the toolbar become usable. They allow you to move forwards and backwards through the documents you have already displayed in the hypertext trail.
<a name=SUM></a>
<h3>Summarizing Records</h3>
<p>To view a summary list of titles in your result set, select the <b>Summarize</b> radio button on the Search Result Sets screen. This displays a one entry per line, hyperlinked list of the records in the set. Click on the hyperlink to view the full reco

rd. Using the Configure icon you can elect the view this screen immediately after every search.
<hr>
<a name=PRINT></a>
<h2>Printing and Saving-To-Disk</h2>
<p>When you print records or save, you must use the software on your workstation, like a word processor or text editor, to open the saved files and print them.
<p>You can print or save, single, multiple or all the records from the summary form on the Summary Result Sets window.  You can also print individual records from the full view of the record.
<a name=PC></a>
<h3>Using Netscape - for PCs</h3>
<p>First execute a search, then:<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <b>Capture</b> radio button in the 'Records in Set' line on the Search Result Sets screen.<p>
<li>Click the 'Process' button.<p>
<li>There are three ways to print your search results:<p>
</ol>
<ul><p>
<li>Print to the screen (then use the Netscape option File, Print)<p>
<li>Save-to-disk (then print the file using applications software, eg. wordprocessor) <p>
<li>Print individual records from the full view of the record (View Record screen).<p>
</ul>
<h4>PRINT TO SCREEN</h4>
