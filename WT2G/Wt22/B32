<H3>FLEMINGS</H3>




<H2> <B>The search for a strategy</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>UK merchant bank Robert
Fleming is in dire need of a good performance in 1996. It's unlikely to get one.
With thousands of new employees hired in a bid to extend the global network,
revenues have not grown fast enough to cover costs. Shareholders are restless.
Charles Olivier reports</B> </H4> 

<P> Privately owned UK bank Robert Fleming has
had an awful year. In January, there were allegations of insider dealing. In June
Bill Harrison, its head of investment banking, resigned. In August, there was an
asset-management scandal at Jardine Fleming that led to the resignation of the
Hong Kong-based investment bank's chairman, Alan Smith. No wonder John Manser,
Flemings' previously unruffled chief executive, is beginning to look rather
frazzled. Last month, shortly after announcing a management shake-up in the wake
of the Hong Kong irregularities, he warned that the 120-year old bank might be
forced to move out of London to avoid overzealous regulators.

<P> The fireworks may not be over yet. Manser has called an emergency meeting of
senior Flemings executives scheduled for later this month to discuss the progress
of the globalization plan he launched in 1990. Over the past six years, Flemings
has hired thousands of new employees in a bold bid to transform itself from an
asset-management firm with a strong banking presence in Hong Kong into a global
investment bank &#173; or, as Flemings puts it, a global investment bank except
in the US.

<P> Revenues have failed to keep pace with the escalating costs involved. Net
profits fell from &#163;143 million ($214 million) in 1993/94 to &#163;115
million in 1994/95 and &#163;87.9 million in 1995/96. The current year looks like
being another tough one. "Flemings is an accident waiting to happen," says a
senior corporate financier at a rival UK bank. "They have more than 7,000
employees, but they just aren't doing enough business to pay for them. They need
to make some changes."

<P> Manser is likely to come under considerable pressure from the bank's
independent shareholders to reduce costs. Between them they own over 40% of the
bank and over the past two years have sat patiently by while Robin Fleming, the
bank's amiable old-Etonian chairman, turned down countless offers from
prospective buyers. At the height of the M&amp;A craze that swept UK banking in
1994/95 corporate financiers estimated that Flemings could have fetched &#163;2.5
billion.

<P> Generous dividends and brave talk of Flemings becoming a global investment
bank persuaded most investment trusts and fund managers with stakes in the bank
to go along with a strategy of maintaining independence. But with profits
continuing to fall, and the value of the business now half what it was before the
embarrassing debacle at Jardine Fleming Investment Management, many will no doubt
be wondering if they haven't made a mistake. They will want to see costs brought
in line with revenues. "We have been a very happy shareholder in Flemings," says
Jeremy Tighe, fund manager of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust which
has a 5% stake. "But if they were forced to cut dividends because they were in
trouble, their position of independence might be more difficult to sustain."

<P> <B>A family under pressure</B>

<P> The Fleming family, which has the biggest single shareholding &#173; around
35% &#173; is desperate to avoid this. The bank employs at least 20 family
members many of whom are none too bright and might find it hard to find lucrative
employment elsewhere were the bank to be sold. There is an apocryphal story that
at the opening of Fleming's South African office, Robin Fleming mistook former
England international footballer Bobby Charlton for the governor of the South
African central bank.

<P> Faced with a revolt from outside shareholders, the Fleming family is likely
to take the view that a slimmed-down family bank (albeit a highly specialized
one) is better than no family bank at all. They too will want some answers from
Manser.

<P> Executives such as Peter Jamieson, the bank's vice-chairman, are likely to
argue that it is still to early to condemn a strategy that has only been in place
a few years. "You don't create a powerful market position in the market we are
operating in overnight," says Jamieson. "Every department is excited about the
prospects in front of it." Others such as Bernard Taylor (head of corporate
finance) and Tom Hughes-Hallett (European broking), will fight hard to stop their
departments being trimmed. All in all, the Flemings executives' meeting is likely
to be fiery.

<P> Back in October 1993, the mood at Flemings' glass-roofed headquarters at
Copthall Avenue in the City of London had been one of quiet confidence. Growing
pressure on European governments to facilitate the development of private rather
than state pension provision was widely expected to lead to a fund management
bonanza for the bank, which had set up offices all over Europe way ahead of the
rest of the competition. Jardine Fleming, the bank's Hong Kong joint venture with
trading house Jardine Matheson, had had a tremendous year, generating $240
million of net profit in the year to March 1993 on strong growth in Asian
markets. The decision to set up offices in countries such as Thailand ahead of
rivals also seemed to be paying off as Jardine Fleming picked up a steady stream
of Asian equity and equity-linked mandates.

<P> Encouragingly for Manser, heavy investment in European investment banking
operations seemed to be bearing fruit. In 1992, Flemings had won its first major
capital markets mandate outside Asia &#173; a &#163;1.6 billion share issue for
UK pharmaceuticals company Wellcome, which was later to merge with Glaxo. Ian
Hannam, the young equity syndication whizz-kid hired from Salomon Brothers the
previous year, had impressed the City with the execution of the deal (albeit at
the cost of annoying his fellow lead-managers), and more mandates seemed certain.

<P> Convinced that it was only a matter of time before Flemings took its place at
the forefront of European investment banking, Manser brought in Bill Harrison, a
punchy corporate financier from Lehman Brothers, to run the investment banking
division. Brash and aggressive, with a penchant for footballing metaphors,
Harrison quickly shook the bank's corporate finance department into action. Out
went the low-margin advisory work for small and medium-sized companies, in came
big-ticket, high-margin M&amp;A. "We are going for the big guys," he told staff.

<P> Guessing (probably correctly) that to succeed in investment banking Flemings
would need a strong securities arm, Manser decided to go on a hiring spree.
Between March 1993 and March 1994, the securities department hired nearly 700 new
staff including Tom Hughes-Hallett, a broking specialist from Swedish bank
Enskilda, who was appointed head of Flemings' UK and European securities
operations.

<P> There was also a rapid expansion in Fleming's network in 1993/94, with joint
ventures signed with two leading foreign brokers &#173; Ord Minnett in Australia
and Martin &amp; Co in South Africa. The bank now employed over 5,600 staff in 42
offices in over 30 countries.

<P> <B>Short-term miracles</B>

<P> By March 1994, Manser was being lauded as a miracle worker. His bold
expansion strategy had sent net profits soaring to more than &#163;143 million
for the year. Earnings per share had increased to a remarkable 299.8 pence,
against 149.6 pence the previous year. Shareholders jostled around to slap the
great man on the back after dividends rose by 32% to 50 pence per share.

<P> Once again, Jardine Fleming was the main driver of profi1ts thanks to strong
growth in Asian stock markets. But other areas were beginning to show encouraging
signs. The joint venture set up with US fund manager <BR> T Rowe Price was
generating strong profits with total funds under management for US clients up to
$16 billion. Investment banking was progressing slowly, but the bank was
cultivating closer relationships with a range of big multinationals thanks to its
participation in such privatizations as British Telecom 3, Rh&ocirc;ne Poulenc
and Repsol.

<P> In his 1994 annual report statement, Robin Fleming waxed lyrical about the
expansion: "We can look back on the growth of our global business with some
pride. We now have 42 offices in 30 countries with over 5,600 staff, of whom 55%
are employed outside the UK. This global presence, combined with our financial
standing and the diversity of our services, bodes well for the future."

<P> Manser was more cautious, noting that 1993 was an exceptional year and
warning that "it is unlikely that this combination of events will be repeated for
some time to come". Nevertheless, he wrote in his review of the year: "The
outlook for financial markets seems good."

<P> This proved to be a false hope. In the wake of the US Federal Reserve's
decision to raise interest rates in February 1994, emerging markets crashed. The
bank's enlarged securities division struggled to find deals to do, while falling
markets hit asset-management income hard. Owing to some unfortunate
asset-allocation decisions, the bank's investment trusts did particularly poorly,
with only three out of 14 trusts outperforming their index benchmarks.

<P> Investment banking had a good 1994 and 1995 &#173; winning high-profile deals
including ING's takeover of Barings, and Associated British Food's
reorganization. However, a worrying number of Flemings' transactions ended in
failure, such as Enterprise Oil's failed bid for Lasmo, and the bank still seemed
to lack the reputation of its major rivals. It lost out to SBC on the bid to
advise Trafalgar House on its bid for Northern Electric (which was particularly
galling given Flemings' strong links to Jardine Matheson, Trafalgar's owners).
The European securities business, meanwhile, was moving very slowly, with a
return on costs of &#173;45% during the year.

<P> <B>Costs out of control</B>

<P> Few analysts were surprised, therefore, when Flemings announced in March 1995
that net profits had fallen to &#163;119.6 million. Market conditions had been
very tough after all, and it was to be expected that the new, enlarged group
would take a while to find its feet. But the rise in costs was beginning to cause
concern. Flemings now had 6,775 staff costing it &#163;351 million a year, way
above the &#163;235.1 million target set by Manser the previous year.

<P> Manser himself was keenly aware of this. "We are now entering rather a
critical phase in the development of our businesses," he wrote to staff in an
internal business plan published in May 1995. "It is vital that we ensure that
costs are kept under sensible control."

<P> Nevertheless, he decided to plough ahead with new overseas ventures. During
1995, Flemings set up a joint venture in Peru, Fleming Latin Pacific. Not long
after, it formed Electra Fleming, a 50/50 joint venture with UK-based
venture-capital firm Electra Investment Trust. Jardine Fleming added three new
exchanges to those it covered &#173; in Korea, Thailand and India. Staff numbers
continued to rise as a result, reaching well over 7,000 by the end of the year.
Unfortunately for Manser, the bank's final push coincided with continued
instability in Asian markets. Jardine Fleming was holding on to its dominant
position in Asian GDRs and equity-linked deals, but when the markets were this
flat it could do nothing.

<P> Outside Asia, the bank was going great guns. The investment banking
department worked on more than 40 M&amp;A mandates during 1995, including
advising Dresdner Bank on its acquisition of Kleinwort Benson. Despite the poor
performance in 1994, the asset-management side was gaining clients, particularly
in the fast-expanding family of specialist emerging market investment trusts. By
the end of year, Flemings had nearly &#163;58 billion of funds under management.

<P> The UK pension fund department had finally begun to win back the clients it
had lost in the late 1980s, and the move into money-purchase or defined
contribution scheme management was looking very promising.

<P> <B>Cape in good shape</B>

<P> The South African office was doing especially well. It acted as bookrunner on
all four major equity issues launched in 1995, and advised two leading companies
on South African M&amp;A transactions &#173; UK conglomerate Hanson on its
disposal of Ever Ready South Africa and French food company Danone on its
investment in Clover Holdings, a local milk-products group.

<P> But without Jardine Fleming on top form, Flemings found it hard to generate
enough business to cover rising costs. Net profits for the year to March 1996
fell to &#163;87.9 million as a result. Not wishing to alarm staff, Manser took
an optimistic line, stressing that the expansion strategy was almost complete and
that the bank would now "reap the rewards we have made in the last three years".

<P> Sadly, such optimism has proved badly misplaced. So far this year, Flemings
has won almost no non-Asian capital market transactions of note except for a $810
million equity placement for UK insurance company Sun Life. The resignation of
Bill Harrison in June has left the European corporate finance team without a real
big-hitter capable of winning important advisory mandates. Jardine Fleming's
reputation was seriously damaged in August by revelations that a senior fund
manager, Colin Armstrong, had been diverting profitable trades away from the
bank's funds into personal accounts. The bank was fined &#163;400,000 by
regulator Imro and required to pay compensation of $19.3 million. Early this
month a major client of Jardine Fleming's fund management arm, the Hong Kong
Jockey Club, withdrew an account worth an estimated HK$800 million (US$100
million), and other investors had already withdrawn between US$50 million and
US$100 million.

<P> European savings markets (particularly private pensions) have grown far more
slowly than had been expected, leaving Flemings' expensive European asset
managers underemployed.

<P> First-half figures for the year to March 1997 have yet to be released, but it
is a sure bet that they will show a further decline in profits and an increase in
costs. Manser is likely to put two main options to the executives' meeting later
this month: essentially either cost-cutting or pressing on in the hope of an
upturn in Flemings' fortunes.

<P> The cost-cutting route would involve taking the knife to loss-making
operations such as European broking and, perhaps, European investment banking.
Cost savings here would give the bank more management time to concentrate on
building up emerging markets businesses, some of which are doing very well. But
it would be a tremendous blow to the bank's collective ego, not to mention a
confirmation that expanding into these areas had been a futile move in the first
place.

<P> Manser's alternative is to press on as before in the hope that Jardine
Fleming will have a good year and generate enough profits to cover Flemings'
loss-making European enterprises until they are strong enough to stand on their
own. Given the lethargic state of most Asian markets, and the appalling publicity
generated by the fund-management scandal, this seems unlikely. Even Henry Strutt,
Jardine Fleming's new chairman, admits that 1996 is likely to be a tough year.
"After two dismal years, we all hoped that we would see a strong market this
year. But it has been pretty patchy frankly. Better than last year, but not an
unmitigated bull market."

<P> Either way, the future is likely to be painful. Fleming does not have the
capital to compete with big US banks in the international investment banking
markets and it has shot itself in the foot in Asia, where it did have an
advantage. But a future without a European distribution or investment banking arm
is likely to make life difficult for its emerging market offices, which rely on
placement power to win capital-raising and M&amp;A mandates.

<P> Flemings could stick to asset management, picking up fat dividend cheques off
Jardine Fleming, but there's little excitement in that. Perhaps they should have
sold out after all. &#009;*

<H2>Time for a cultural revolution </H2>
<H4>Let's face it: most investment banks are still dreadfully badly managed.
They suffer from turf battles, weak risk controls and staff who care more
about this year's bonus than about the long-term future of the firm. The
answer: to create a strong corporate culture with a built-in bias towards
co-operation, long-termism and tight controls. Brian Caplen reports on the
firms that are succeeding in developing such a culture, and suggests ways
others might go about it </H4>
Salesmen at Bear Stearns who underachieve are told to clear their desks
at corporate headquarters on New York's Park Avenue and move to less-glossy
premises nearby. Seating them among fellow non-stars in unglamorous surroundings
is the firm's way of saying &quot;do better&quot;. Only if results improve
will they be allowed back. <BR>
<BR>
Some long-serving executives refuse to go quietly into exile. They appeal
over the head of chief executive James Cayne to long-time chairman Alan
Greenberg. Jumping the chain of command is an acceptable practice at Bear
Stearns, but so far no struggling sales executive has gained a reprieve
by doing it. Strictly no favouritism is another rule of the firm. <BR>
<BR>
Why does Bear Stearns go to all this trouble over poor performers, when
most Wall Street firms simply kick them out and hire new talent? It's because
over the years Bear Stearns has built up one of the strongest corporate
cultures in investment banking. The culture consists of a number of principles
and procedures that the firm tries to stick to in all circumstances. One
principle is that high producers who suffer burn-out are given a chance
to recover. At the same time, a commitment to meritocracy implies that experienced
employees will not be spared performance checks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I regard our culture as our single most important competitive asset.
It is our culture which differentiates us the most from our competitors,&quot;
says Cayne. &quot;It's so easy to have a set of rules that make sense and
follow them, but people just don't do it. It's so easy to have a process
whereby you investigate yourself periodically, but how many people do it?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Bear Stearns commissions a thorough survey of the firm every three years.
One consultant's study of it was published in 1994 as a 55-page document,
described grandly as &quot;A case study of strategic flexibility, organized
chaos, positive politics and strong leadership&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Fellow Wall Streeters are cynical about such declarations of cultural perfection.
They think they indicate over-confidence and may presage a fall. &quot;When
a firm comes out with a consultant's report describing itself as wonderful
that's the time to short the stock,&quot; says an executive with a rival
firm. Others argue that Bear Stearns' methods, such as the designation of
some staff as ratters to spot misdemeanours, and financial rewards for whistle-blowers,
would be contrary to their own banks' ways of doing things. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ratting is not in the culture of this place,&quot; says a Salomon
Brothers executive who asked not to be named. &quot;The errors we reported
and the write-offs that we took [in fourth quarter 1994, Salomon Inc took
$278 million in pre-tax charges arising from accounting errors over several
years] are things that people didn't know about because of the decentralized
nature of the place and the lack of investment in [measurement] capabilities
that went on for a while. I don't think that anyone deliberately tried to
hide them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even if Salomon's philosophy is a world apart from that at Bear Stearns,
the goal is the same: to run the bank better. This involves having a culture
and systems that deliver results, protect against fraud and failure, and
facilitate performance measurement. <BR>
<BR>
These sorts of concepts are fairly fresh to investment banks. That's remarkable,
because to most companies in other industries they have become as basic
as ABC. The reason is the nature of the business: investment banks' essential
assets are the investment bankers themselves, a labour force that has proved
difficult to control and is vociferously opposed to being managed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Herding squirrels</B> <BR>
<BR>
One investment bank president likens overseeing investment bankers to &quot;herding
squirrels&quot;. Other observers compare the industry's management challenge
to that of a Hollywood film studio or a top sports team. The problem is
that the individual stars consider themselves more important than the franchise
of the institution they supposedly serve. Their eye is on making short-term
profits rather than building a business, and if the rewards don't meet expectations
or are better somewhere else, they walk. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Historically, investment banks have been dominated by producers. To
become the chief executive was not desirable. The compensation was related
to production,&quot; says John Gutfreund, the former chief executive of
Salomon Brothers who is now an independent consultant. &quot;Slowly, the
cottage industry has begun to modernize and professional management has
begun to insinuate itself,&quot; he says. &quot;But the psyche of the people
in the business is still not turned towards management. It's turned towards
production: doing the big deal, the big trade, the big sale.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Asks Gutfreund: &quot;Why would you want to try to manage a group of stars
who really don't think they want management nor need it?&quot; For one thing
it's because investment banks are becoming more and more beholden to shareholders,
and these investors are demanding that normal commercial practices be applied.
The swaggering attitudes in investment banking were all very well when banks
were partnerships, and distribution of earnings between owners and employees
was much the same thing; or when profits were rising so fast, as in the
1980s, that there was plenty for all. In the tougher 1990s, banks have suffered
sharp downturns but bankers' remuneration has tended to be &quot;sticky
downwards&quot;: when profits increased, investment bankers' pay increased
in step, but as bank profits have fallen, salaries and bonuses have not
contracted at the same pace. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The rights to the profits that a bank makes have been hi-jacked by
the senior management and staff while the risks are still with the shareholders,&quot;
says Norman Bernard, chairman of First Consulting, a London-based firm that
advises banks. &quot;It's an absurd situation,&quot; says Bernard's colleague
Claire Gouzouli, a director of the firm. &quot;In the bad years, shareholders
get nothing and in the good years, they only get a little.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There is, however, a tension between the pressure for tighter control and
the need to expand that suggests that a full-blown transformation won't
come easily. Industry profits may be under pressure but there is a widespread
view that investment banking rather than commercial banking is the way to
boost them again. This is adding capacity in the investment banking sector
rather than diminishing it. In the recent wave of takeovers, firms have
been acquired by universal banks not to rationalize and take capacity out,
but to obtain skills and expand. The expansion of the market and the establishment
of global operations is increasing demand for investment bankers. Bankers'
ability to ratchet up their salaries is likely to remain unimpaired for
some time to come. The clearest example of this is Salomon Brothers' difficulties
in changing the way it pays its employees. <BR>
<BR>
In late 1994, Salomon attempted to introduce a controversial compensation
scheme that led to a classic showdown between shareholder and employee.
Super-investor Warren Buffett, who has put $1 billion into parent company
Salomon Inc since 1987 and is a strong advocate of payment by results, is
known to be behind the arrangement. The scheme linked bonuses for client
business to return-on-equity targets and forced traders to bank their bonuses
and pay back part of them if the firm subsequently made losses. But the
defections of senior staff that resulted persuaded Salomon Brothers to back
down in June. It introduced a more generous package in October with higher
base salaries, and bonuses in the form of two-year notes. <BR>
<BR>
The malaise afflicting investment banking (if you are a shareholder), or
the gravy train (if you are an employee), cannot last for ever. The likelihood
is that as more parts of the business become commodities - straightforward
transactions that can be replicated very simply on a mass scale - these
will be stripped out and performed at lower cost using less expensive labour,
trained specifically to perform a limited number of tasks. Eurobonds and
plain-vanilla derivatives are two products in line for such treatment. &quot;Fixed-income
origination will become tomorrow what lending is today: a business of low
margins that is essentially another loss-leader for other products,&quot;
says David Hunt, a principal in the London office of consultants McKinsey.
This will not affect the sector's rocket scientists, who will continue to
earn the huge rewards appropriate to successful high-margin product development.
<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, chief executives of investment banks are going to be under
increasing pressure from shareholders to bring volatile businesses under
tighter control, and deliver better earnings streams, at a time when market
conditions are not conducive to an all-out battle with labour. New systems
of control and compensation will have to be introduced by persuasion rather
than force. That's why the building of a corporate culture in which prescribed
behavioural standards are strongly reinforced, without stifling initiative
and enterprise, is going to be increasingly important to the future success
of investment banks. <BR>
<BR>
This is no easy task. Investment banks which see this as a cure for their
ills must engage in self-analysis and introspection to decide how it can
best be achieved. There is an array of consultants and experts waiting to
advise on a wide range of strategic and management issues in return for
fat fees. They undoubtedly have many good ideas, especially if they have
had experience in other industries and professions. But on some banking
issues their views diverge sharply from those of their potential clients.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Goldman model</B> <BR>
<BR>
The consultants' model institution is Goldman Sachs because of its collegial
and collectivist culture. The basis of that culture is Goldman's partnership
structure which many consultants believe is the correct formula for an investment
bank. They argue that people businesses where the major assets &quot;go
down in the elevator every night&quot;, such as law firms, accountants,
consultants and investment banks, should naturally be run as partnerships.
In such arrangements, the tension between shareholders and employees largely
disappears, employees have a long-term commitment to the business with their
future rewards tied to the firm's success, and a more stable and co-operative
atmosphere develops. By contrast, most consultants have few good things
to say about a firm such as Salomon Brothers whose culture they regard as
too individualistic and self-motivated, generating little in the way of
employee loyalty, and subject to wild excesses and huge swings in earnings.
<BR>
<BR>
Bankers respond to this critique by pointing out that most Wall Street firms
used to be partnerships but, as they grew, transformed themselves into public
companies. Large partnerships have several shortcomings: reaching decisions
is often difficult because of the many views that need to be taken into
account; with partners putting their own capital on the line investment
banks run this way can be overly conservative and risk-averse; and the high
cost of capital raised by a partnership compared with equity capital is
a brake on profitability. Goldman Sachs, rivals point out, is struggling
with its partnership structure and could well go public in future. In November
Goldman executives denied this, but at the same time reorganized the management
structure in a way that strengthens top executive control and makes Goldman
more like a corporation. <BR>
<BR>
Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive of Travelers Group, of which
Smith Barney forms part, believes that beyond the capital-raising advantages
of going public, the status sends the right message to an investment bank's
clients. &quot;When you are selling to your clients the idea that access
to public markets is something important, should not it also be important
to you as a firm?&quot; he asks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Countering machismo</B> <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is to create an ethos of loyalty to a public company among
employees - one in which individuals put the firm's interests ahead of their
own. &quot;We try to have people in responsible positions who understand
shareholder value, who aren't greedy, and are interested in having a batting
average that is good for a long period of time,&quot; says Weill. &quot;Not
a batting average that is like Babe Ruth's one year, then doing nothing
the next.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The next task is to provide your carefully selected people with an environment
and compensation package that encourages positive rather than negative behaviour.
The remedy may be surprisingly simple, at least in concept. The big egos
and machismo atmosphere that typically develop in an investment bank are
highly dangerous. Employees do not ask questions in such environments because
they are afraid of looking stupid or getting jumped on. In the worse cases,
high-powered traders become a law unto themselves so that no-one can get
them to explain what they do. Good management is about asking questions,
often basic ones, over and over again, and it is essential to cultivate
an inquiring culture. The risks of failing to do so are losses and fraud.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In some investment banks, a culture has developed where placing big
bets is all about manhood,&quot; says McKinsey's Hunt. &quot;A typical attitude
is: 'If you don't let me do it my own way, then you don't trust me'. This
has negative implications for the well-being of the institution.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Humphrey Percy, former global head of foreign exchange at BZW, makes a similar
point. &quot;Machismo in an organization discourages people from asking
questions because they get yelled at,&quot; he says. &quot;It's important
that management create a culture of open discussion because there is always
a chance that someone has noticed something the rest have missed.&quot;
BZW, he says, did not suffer from this failing. In the 1980s, he recalls,
when the bank was racking up large profits arbitraging financial futures
at 200 basis point spreads on Chicago's Mercantile Exchange, the then chief
executive Lord Camoys (now non-executive deputy chairman), came down personally
to find out how the money was being made. He wanted to know how the process
worked, how much could be lost and whether contracts could be cancelled.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In any business, an important senior management function is to question
basic processes, question people, question performance. If management doesn't
do that, it can't possibly hope to improve things,&quot; says Ken Rowe of
corporate psychologists Young Samuel Chambers. <BR>
<BR>
Standard Chartered employs an external adviser to attend senior management
meetings and check the policy-making process. &quot;He makes sure we are
asking the right questions and allocating our time in the best way,&quot;
says group executive director John McFarlane. &quot;He played an important
role in the thinking behind our decision to promote ourselves as an emerging
markets bank, something which the organization essentially was but which
had not been fully exploited.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At a more nuts and bolts level, Weill of the Travelers Group says: &quot;We
ask as many, and often more, questions about a profitable trade as we would
if money had been lost.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When senior managers and traders ask questions, others are not afraid to
and everyone accepts the idea of accountability. At Bear Stearns the idea
that a trader could refuse to explain himself to an internal auditor is
regarded as heretical. &quot;Forget it,&quot; says chief executive Cayne.
&quot;Not in a million years. They wouldn't dream of trying. If the internal
audit walks in, it's over. It's like the SEC coming.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Risk control</B> <BR>
<BR>
The important point, however, is not that the internal audit is especially
tyrannical, but that no employee is beyond reproach. In the wake of the
massive trading losses made by Barings, Daiwa and other banks, all institutions
have been reviewing their risk-control systems. Risk-control skills are
prized above all others and risk-control managers are at a premium in the
jobs market. <BR>
<BR>
But the best system is only as good as the people operating it, and a bank
cannot consider itself well insulated from potential disasters unless it
has developed a vigilant culture. A key behavioural pattern that has to
be established is that mistakes can be tolerated, but that surprises and
failure to come clean on errors cannot. If the working environment is allowed
to become too tough and threatening, confessions are unlikely to be forthcoming.
Chief executives must cultivate a more liberal atmosphere if they want to
hear about mistakes before they are irrevocably overwhelmed by them. <BR>
<BR>
One way of encouraging staff to open up is to institute an extensive cross-evaluation
process which may involve employees in assessing their superiors, their
peers, their subordinates and even themselves, or some combination of the
four. The more people who are involved in evaluation, the better the chances
of filtering out bias and arriving at an honest conclusion. At Merrill Lynch,
an employee is evaluated by anyone he or she has substantial contact with
and such a pool may involve as many as 50 to 70 people. &quot;Everyone trusts
the system,&quot; says John Heimann, the firm's chairman of global financial
institutions. &quot;It protects you against the boss who doesn't like you.
It protects the organization against the boss who thinks you're the neatest
trick in shoe leather.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Peer evaluation automatically promotes behaviour that is good for the group
rather than the individual, and in most cases this translates into actions
that are positive for the firm. Employees who defend their desks against
others in the firm, and who channel excessive energies into beating the
system, get marked down by their colleagues. <BR>
<BR>
At Goldman Sachs, says First Consulting's Gouzouli, &quot;extraordinary
efforts are put into measuring the performance of its employees. An employee
writes reports on people above, below and equal to them in the firm, and
all this is fed into the evaluation system. In the evaluation, one of the
worst things you could do is not be a good corporate citizen. If you didn't
come and help a colleague when it was needed, that goes down very badly.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Negative internal politics - staff fighting each other rather than the competition
- inevitably arises in every institution from time to time. But some environments
are more likely to encourage it than others. Historically, Salomon Brothers
was decentralized, more a collection of businesses than a single firm, with
individual compensation packages put together in a way that provided strong
incentive for managers to fight over the allocation of shared costs that
would affect their performance. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It took a vigilant executive to go past that and say: 'Look, you're
playing games.' It needed measurement,&quot; says a Salomon Brothers' executive.
&quot;This year for the first time we now have one operating committee running
the whole firm and for the first time there are a team of people actually
worried about the firm, instead of a representative council with a bunch
of people worried about their part of the firm. That's a big difference.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Incentives</B> <BR>
<BR>
Not surprisingly, compensation is the aspect of staff motivation that firms
spend the most time deliberating. Implementing packages that share the gains
and losses of business volatility between shareholders and employees will
be a major challenge. A recent survey of securities firms in the City of
London indicates both a lack of agreement on how to change the present system
and a fear among firms of going out on a limb. Of those interviewed, 30%
feared major staff defections if annual bonuses were scrapped, 18% believed
that staff would react negatively to a bonus system based on long-term results,
and 18% had no ideas about alternative methods. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is always a lot of discussion about the best long-term way to
incentivize top City people,&quot; says John Sims, managing director of
headhunter Napier Scott which carried out the research. &quot;Our survey
shows that, while only 12% like the present system, there is no consensus
about change. Also, the companies know that if they changed unilaterally
to a longer-term system there would be mass desertions and/or a collapse
in morale. This is a business where workers have to be highly motivated
to create that competitive edge.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The whole aim of building a strong corporate culture is to create that competitive
edge in a non-destructive way. As far as compensation is concerned, there
are two crucial elements: compensation should be based on the firm's performance
(especially its long-term performance) as well as the individual's, and
no-one, however brilliant, should be given remuneration in excess of the
terms of the scheme. <BR>
<BR>
At Merrill Lynch, bonus payments are decided on the basis of the individual's
performance and come from two pools: 75% from the area of the firm in which
someone works, 25% from the whole firm. Under this system it is not possible
to stack costs onto another's P&amp;L because the calculation base is too
wide. The abandoned Salomon system, with bonuses tied to return on equity
and kept in cold storage, is the right approach - if it can be implemented.
<BR>
<BR>
According to the study put out by Bear Stearns, the firm &quot;will not
be held hostage by any employee, even if that person is a top producer.
Threats to leave the firm if certain conditions are unmet fall on deaf ears.
Such ultimatums can lead to termination of the relationship.&quot; Says
Cayne: &quot;You can't claim anything in this organization. At the end of
the year everybody writes a report on himself and that includes me.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
While the cultural benefits of Bear Stearns' compensation system are difficult
to assess, the total wages bill as a percentage of net revenue does illustrate
the advantages. Consistently around 50%, the figure is lower than that of
most of its rivals. Indeed, <I>The Wall Street Journal </I>has described
Bear Stearns &quot;as one of Wall Street's most tight-fisted firms&quot;.
Furthermore, the firm's capital accumulation plan in which 92% of senior
managing directors participate, electing to defer more than 30% of their
compensation and take it in the form of stock, creates a bond between employee
and shareholder. <BR>
<BR>
The experience of small partnerships <I>can</I> offer useful lessons to
the large public companies even if the complete model is inappropriate.
SBC Warburg, for example, is reported to be drawing on the experiences of
O'Connor, the Chicago boutique it took over in 1991. At O'Connor, rewards
were not showered exclusively on top producers but distributed more evenly
among the partners. SBC's chief executive is said to be looking at introducing
such a system for the whole company. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dynamic tension</B> <BR>
<BR>
Other firms that emphasize the team rather than the star performer are Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan. &quot;When competitors criticize Goldman, what they
tend to mean is that the firm has fewer stars. Part of the Goldman culture
is that they don't have stars, they have a team,&quot; says Michael Flanagan
of Lipper Analytical Securities. Adds David Rogers, a management professor
at New York University's Stern School of Business: &quot;Part of JP Morgan's
formula has been not to tolerate stars nor rainmakers. They haven't been
interested in heroes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The team as an essential management tool is a favoured recipe of McKinsey's
Hunt. In a paper entitled &quot;What future for Europe's investment banks?&quot;,
he advocates replacing pyramid structures in which &quot;too often, fiefdoms
emerge around product lines or countries that make rapid change in response
to market opportunities difficult to execute&quot;, with flat ones in which
teams of experts are brought together to focus on a particular client or
product. Since the teams change rapidly as business conditions alter, team
members gain broad experience and view the firm as a whole rather than concentrating
only on their departments. Another echo of the partnership structure in
this approach is the absence of pure managers - everyone is both a producer
and a manager. <BR>
<BR>
Some analysts consider the crisis in investment banking so serious that
a particularly active style of management is needed. &quot;You must get
dynamic tension in an organization, which arrives from having people whose
job it is to watch one another,&quot; says Bill Acker, managing partner
of corporate psychologists Acker Deboeck &amp; Company. The important thing
for an investment bank wishing to change its culture is to discover where
power really lies, which is usually not where the CEO thinks it lies. There
will always be a group of managers somewhere near the top who will be resistant
to change. To get to the core of an organization, says Acker, &quot;you
have to discover what is being discussed in the washroom&quot; and then
act on this knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Investment bankers think management is of no consequence,&quot; says
the Stern School's Rogers. &quot;There is a whole anti-management culture
that has existed for some time.&quot; He thinks that banks could benefit
from an injection of outside management expertise to approach problems in
new ways, and predicts that management shake-ups will produce something
of a convergence between the cultural extremes of collectivist firms such
as Goldman Sachs and individualistic ones such as Salomon Brothers. The
optimal bank would draw on the positive features of both models. <BR>
<BR>
The most difficult thing is to get the right balance between control and
allowing employees to take business initiatives, which is essential for
the success of an investment bank. Take Merrill Lynch, where, says Lipper's
Flanagan, &quot;the shareholder is number one in the firm's mind&quot;.
But this has been achieved by extensive controls. &quot;The firm is ruled
by numbers,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
A Salomon Brothers' executive says: &quot;Some people have left here to
go to Merrill Lynch which has this great platform, this terrific global
reputation. But some ex-Salomon people find they are just cogs in a machine.
They have less freedom, less autonomy and so are less creative.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most consultants think that a middle way is possible. &quot;Banks should
devolve power rather than give it away,&quot; says Acker &quot;Devolving
power doesn't mean becoming indisciplined. The purpose of the centre of
an institution is to monitor and limit the risk that the periphery undertakes.&quot;
Says McKinsey's Hunt: &quot;What you want to release is the business initiative
of these people; what you want to control is the financial risks that they
are taking.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Could an outsider identify and seize this mid-position more easily than
an insider? The clearest example of an outsider coming into banking is Martin
Taylor, who was appointed chief executive of the Barclays group in August
1993 and is credited with taking decisive steps to modernize the institution.
Previously, he was chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles and before joining
that company worked as a journalist. Although Barclays is one of the four
UK clearing banks, included in the group is the investment banking arm BZW
and so Taylor is having to get to grips with investment banking challenges.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Time for reform</B> <BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, he believes the same basic approach can be taken to both
types of business. He also believes that most investment banks will end
up attached to commercial banks for reasons of capital needs, and so the
difficulty of managing the two under one roof will have to be solved. <BR>
<BR>
Taylor's view is that Barclays (including BZW) suffered in the past from
&quot;confusing formality with discipline&quot;. Says Taylor: &quot;People
thought if they were stuffy and behaved in a certain way - dressed in a
certain way, came to meetings in a certain way and said things in a certain
order, followed the agenda properly - then by some sympathetic magic the
business would be well ordered ... Actually what we want is a business where
people don't feel the need to come to meetings and never take their jackets
off, and read out a 14-page prepared document; that's a waste of time. I
want a culture where people have read the documents, where the documents
are good and clear, where they can be challenged and discussed quickly and
decisions made.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He adds: &quot;Everything I have said applies to the group. BZW is less
given to mumbo jumbo than the retail bank, but if people think investment
banks are not given to mumbo jumbo they don't know much about investment
banks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On the advantages of being an outsider, Taylor says: &quot;It has helped
me enormously not to be a Barclays' insider and not to have come from another
bank....There is an ever-present danger of getting sucked in. I am constantly
on my guard against it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But not every investment bank can count on a talented outsider coming in
to fix it. Nor will all banks be successful in building corporate cultures
which allow good managerial practice to blossom. What will happen to the
others? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The balance has swung to the individual being far more important than
the organization,&quot; says Gutfreund. &quot;It will swing back eventually.
In a down-cycle they will have their come-uppance, when everybody is getting
killed. When the excesses on one side outweigh the advantages economically,
that's the time for reform.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<bR> 
<H3>Re-engineering the bank </H3>
It's not just investment banks that need to rebuild their corporate cultures.
Commercial banks face similar challenges. <BR>
<BR>
When American IT expert Joseph De Feo went out into rural England to talk
to bank managers about automated credit analysis, the response was far from
positive. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I thought I was going to get lynched,&quot; says De Feo. &quot;People
treated me with shock and horror. They thought the bank manager had to make
these decisions eyeball-to-eyeball with the customer.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Barclays' UK bank managers were also deeply attached to a laborious method
for monitoring the progress of working capital loans, called debenture monitoring.
The method was not consistent across the country and involved getting most
information straight from the client. <BR>
<BR>
De Feo, then chief information officer now director of group operations
and technology, asked them why they bothered. &quot;What? Not do debenture
monitoring?[in our normal way]&quot; was a typical response. Says De Feo:
&quot;Barclays has a centuries old tradition and they thought I was trying
to turn it into an American bank.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Barclays has now introduced a product called Lending Advisor which analyzes
credit and assists with debenture monitoring. The product is helping to
improve the quality of the loan portfolio in the small-business sector.
This is an important development because group chief executive Martin Taylor
considers small- and middle-market business lending a higher-risk activity
than most investment banking activities. <BR>
<BR>
But in commercial banks using old-fashioned methods, managers are often
blissfully unaware of the risks they run. <BR>
<BR>
That was fine while margins were large enough to cope with the proportion
of loans that went bad. But in the current competitive environment, with
tighter margins and greater risk of default, it can spell disaster. <BR>
<BR>
To avoid this, smart commercial banks are streamlining their lending. They
are also reorganizing the entire way their institutions work, including
the functioning of the back office, the collection and storage of customer
information, the role of the marketing department and the measurement of
returns on different products. <BR>
<BR>
To sort out the problems, bank management will have to be completely overhauled.
Many banks are so poorly managed that professionals from other sectors,
such as retailing and manufacturing, will need to be brought in to provide
a fresh perspective. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Historically, banks were public utilities, and utilities don't attract
fine minds,&quot; says David Rogers, a management professor at New York's
Stern School of Business. One banker says banks produce top administrators
who get large complex projects completed to schedule, but not managers with
entrepreneurial skills. <BR>
<BR>
The skills that commercial banks need, instead, are those of marketers able
to brand bank products, and those of salesmen able to sell both commercial
and investment banking services. They also require managers who can reorganize
processes and come up with more efficient ways of working. At the lower
levels, they need flexible production-line workers who can be moved from
area to area, as demand dictates, and also deal with customers. <BR>
<BR>
The new commercial bankers must ask a fundamental question that their predecessors
failed to pose: what is banking? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most bankers have typically never asked this question,&quot; says
Peter Boggis of consultants CSC Index which carried out a major re-engineering
programme for Britain's Lloyds Bank. &quot;You rarely get a crisp, well-<BR>
articulated answer from a senior banking executive on why their bank should
be allowed to exist, and what value they create for their customers.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
With loans to even the largest corporates now only marginally profitable,
managing the relationship to provide other services is likely to be far
more important in revenue terms than straight lending. If corporate lending
and investment banking are not managed as part of the same relationship,
a bank will be throwing away opportunities. Former managers from Marks &amp;
Spencer, Procter &amp; Gamble and RJR Nabisco may be better at spotting
such customer-service lapses than bankers. <BR>
<BR>
To make money, however, a bank has to do more than win business, it also
has to keep costs low as it executes that business. That means reorganizing
the back office. Bank back offices have been compared to the mass-production
systems of the motor industry prior to the Japanese-led revolution in lean
manufacturing. Like car-makers, outmoded banks have the high fixed costs
of dedicated assembly lines which make one kind of product using workers
trained to do one kind of task. Difficulties arise reacting to a situation
where, for example, interest rates decline and the demand for savings products
goes down, but the demand for refinancings goes up. Savings product workers
cannot be moved to refinancings, and refinancing workers are swamped with
a volume of work that they cannot deal with. <BR>
<BR>
To sort out the back office, banks need to draw on manufacturing skills.
&quot;A number of leading banks have hired managers skilled in techniques
such as just-in-time production and quality at source, and put them in the
back office,&quot; says Cherine Chalaby, head of financial markets with
Andersen Consulting in London. &quot;Error correction is one of the largest
cost components in a back office and manufacturers are often the best people
to improve it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Neither the back office nor the front office can do a good job without good
information. In their book <I>Re-engineering the corporation<B>, </B></I>James
Champy and Michael Hammer quote the example of a bank that set a $20 million
credit limit for a corporate client and instructed the various departments
to stick to it. They all complied, each to the full amount, pushing the
bank's exposure way over the limit. Information was not shared between departments
and the error was discovered only when the client went bankrupt. <B><I>-
BC<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><BR> 
<H3>All bankers are equal </H3>
Obey the Friday rule. Attend the risk committee. Run for mayor. <BR>
<BR>
Communism may be dead, but slogans and committees are alive and well at
Bear Stearns. The aim is to build controls into the culture so that executives
don't have to micro-manage, and employees are given room to innovate. <BR>
<BR>
Hence the Friday rule which lays down that traders must sell any losing
positions on Friday and which ensures no losing positions are held over
the weekend. Anyone in a position to put the firm's capital at risk meets
each Monday afternoon to explain what they are doing and why. The risk committee
is described by some as a &quot;cold sweat&quot; meeting. <BR>
<BR>
On the other side of the balance, Bear Stearns' employees are expressly
given the freedom to fail. That's the way, the firm believes, to encourage
entrepreneurship and the growth of new business. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Bear Stearns measures failure in terms of opportunities that were
not pursued (as opposed to dollars lost in pursuit of opportunities),&quot;
says a consultant's report on the firm's culture. &quot;Failure is defined
not as betting on the wrong horse, but failing to bet at all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The &quot;run for Mayor&quot; slogan signifies the firm's belief that only
staff who are popular can get things done and that, contrary to the dog-eat-dog
spirit of Wall Street, it's important to be liked. Other edicts include:
&quot;Be contrarian; avoid the fads and keep businesses in hibernation&quot;;
&quot;Hire smart people and give them room to manoeuvre&quot;; &quot;Use
committees to protect the balance of power and to ensure decisions are sound&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite the scepticism of rival firms, and the eerie feeling that some of
the exhortations to do better, work harder, produce more could have come
straight from <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I>, the Bear Stearns' system seems
to work. The firm has avoided the excesses and turf battles that have wreaked
havoc at other investment banks. That has in turn helped the bottom line.
While net income fell to $240.6 million for the year ended June 30 1995,
from $387 million the previous year, the result continues the firm's 72-year
history of profitability. <BR>
<BR>
Could Bear Stearns' culture work for other firms? Taken over wholesale,
probably not. Imposing such a strong culture on staff used to a looser environment
would have them running for cover. But many banks could benefit from studying
and adapting some of Bear Stearns' techniques. - <B><I>BC<BR>

<H3>Tips for better banks </H3>
<B>Create a police force </B>No risk-control system is perfect. Unless specific
staff are given the responsibility to track down wrongdoings, the rogue
trader will conclude he won't get caught. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reward whistle-blowers</B> A percentage of an uncovered fraud or loss
is a fair reward and an incentive for employees to report infringements
to management. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Encourage questions and discussion </B>A firm that doesn't ask questions
remains ignorant. A company in which all questions, however seemingly dumb,
are treated as legitimate has a better chance of staying healthy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Work in teams and committees </B>Teams working across product areas help
lower walls, broaden employees' experience and encourage them to view the
company as whole. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Keep meetings short </B>Putting time limits on meetings pushes them to
reach decisions rather than prevaricating. Try holding meetings standing
up - it's a good way to keep them short.<B> <BR>
<BR>
Cross-evaluation</B> Staff should be evaluated by any employee they have
substantial dealings with. This fosters co-operation and good behaviour
between employees. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Self-evaluation </B>An employee who has to write a report on himself
is forced to take a hard critical look at his or her performance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Payment in shares </B>The tried and trusted method of tying an employee's
fortunes in with those of the firm is still the best. Where a bank is not
listed or is part of a larger group, a phantom share<B> </B>can be created
to act as a proxy for its performance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Retention of bonuses </B>Keeping bonuses on ice and demanding that a
portion be paid back in bad years is the best way of ensuring that employees
share in losses as well as profits. But beware - such schemes can be difficult
to implement. <p>

<H3>INTER-DEALER BROKERS</H3>
<H2>Will brokers go broke? </H2>
<H4>A few have already. For inter-dealer brokers, the expansion of electronic
dealing and a hiccup in derivatives activity have, at best, necessitated
refocusing and downsizing. Only those with special expertise and those that
dominate a niche will emerge stronger from the changes. Stephanie Cooke
reports </H4>
Inter-dealer brokers (IDBs) are by nature a secretive, competitive bunch.
So when it comes to meeting legal deadlines for filing annual results, many
firms, most of which are privately owned, wait until the last minute. This
past year most have performed so dismally that they had an added reason
for stalling. One big broker in London was said to have done so badly that
it chose to pay a fine for missing the deadline rather than report on time.
The rumour was false, but such is the mood of doom among brokers that it
was highly plausible. &quot;There is total disarray in the market,&quot;
says a London broking firm head. &quot;There is tremendous overcapacity.
There will inevitably have to be consolidation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Not all brokers feel so close to the precipice, but for many the dynamics
of the markets they operate in have changed so fundamentally that their
survival is in question. Most seriously challenged are brokers in spot foreign
exchange. This is primarily because of the rapid growth of electronic broking
but also a result of overcapacity among voice brokers (the traditional telephone-dealing
services). But nearly every sector of the capital markets in which IDBs
operate has been affected. This is partly because of reduced interest rate
volatility, but is also the result of a downturn in the growth of derivatives
activity last year because of highly publicized disasters, such as the Orange
County losses and the collapse of Barings. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't think we are looking at a cyclical change; I think we're looking
at a structural change,&quot; says David Hagan, head of Trio Holdings in
London, which owns the Martin Brokers Group. Because of orchestrated stabilization
of interest rates and exchange rates among the G7, Hagan says, &quot;you
no longer get the wild swings you used to get&quot;. What is more, he says,
&quot;our customer base is more focused on risk in the wake of Barings and
Daiwa, which has constrained speculative trading. And the consolidation
among the very largest banks, such as Chase/Chemical/ManHan and Mitsubishi/Bank
of Tokyo, has produced fewer players with a consequent reduction in liquidity.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Translated into the nuts and bolts of broking, this has meant drastically
reduced commissions and volume discounts and, at the bottom line, lower
profits. Exco's consolidated profits last year were less than half the previous
year's, down to &#163;10.2 million ($15.4 million) from &#163;23.5 million.
Tullett &amp; Tokyo Forex International reported first-half profits in 1995
(the latest figures available) of &#163;5.8 million, compared with &#163;17.3
million in the same period a year earlier. Intercapital Group reported a
drop from &#163;18.5 million in the year ending March 1994 to &#163;7.3
million for the same period in 1995, though it expects improved results
this year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bypassing brokers</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimates that in April 1995
the average daily turnover in global exchange markets in spot, forward and
forex swap contracts was $1,230 billion, compared with $820 billion in April
1992. That, says the BIS, suggests a rate of expansion of 50% between 1992
and 1995, compared with 39% in the previous three-year period. And growth
was almost twice as large in forwards - where electronic brokers are
not direct competitors to voice brokers - as in spot transactions.
In view of this increased activity, why are brokers suffering so much? <BR>
<BR>
In practice, changes in the market are having a differential effect -
not all brokers <I>are</I> suffering. The tendency is for brokers with particular
expertise and/or dominance of a market sector to get more and more of the
business. This was particularly evident in the spot forex market following
the launch by Reuters and EBS (Electronic Broking System) of their electronic
services more than two years ago; business among the voice brokers migrated
to the big players, MW Marshall in particular, but also Tullett &amp; Tokyo
and Harlow Butler. This forced other firms, such as Trio and most of Exco's
spot forex operations, out of the market altogether. Although the electronic
inter-dealer broking offered by Reuters and EBS (the short-lived Tokyo-based
Minex system has been absorbed by EBS) operates only in the spot forex market,
other electronic systems and screen-based pricing, sometimes offered by
the brokers themselves, have made it easier for financial institutions outside
the dealer loop to deal directly with banks - or among themselves -
bypassing brokers altogether. <BR>
<BR>
Reuters' Dealing 2000-1 (which preceded the Reuters electronic IDB, Dealing
2000-2) enables financial institutions in virtually any financial market
to execute and settle deals automatically without going through a broker
(and brokers themselves are big users of the system). Meanwhile, firms such
as Intercapital offer screen-based prices for interest rate swaps and options.
Intercapital's Reuters page has become one of the most closely watched in
the world. These electronic systems probably go some way toward explaining
why the category of &quot;other financial institutions&quot; (those outside
the dealer loop, such as institutional investors) are playing a bigger role
in forex trading. The BIS survey showed that while inter-dealer activity
still accounted for two-thirds of overall foreign exchange turnover, &quot;other
financial institutions&quot; increased their market share from 12% to 20%
between 1992 and 1995 at the expense of non-financial institutions and bank
dealers. <BR>
<BR>
The success of Dealing 2000-2 and EBS (owned by a consortium of banks) in
spot forex is indisputable. As part of its April 1995 survey for the BIS,
the Bank of England (BoE) reported that brokers still handled 35% of the
total foreign exchange business in London (which accounts for almost twice
as much turnover as the US and handles 30% of worldwide business). Of the
35%, 30% was handled by voice brokers and 5% was electronic business. (Electronic
brokers did not figure in the 1992 survey.) In the US, electronic brokers
handled 13% of the business, with voice brokers' share of the market falling
from 30% in 1992 to 24% in 1995. The BoE survey pointed out, however, that
the electronic brokers' business was mainly in three currency pairs: 77%
of the deals they handled involved US dollar/Deutschmark, Deutschmark/French
franc and Deutschmark/Swiss franc. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1992, voice brokers have been hardest hit in dollar/Deutschmark trading,
with their share of London interbank spot business falling from 39% to 26%.
There was one bright spot: as electronic broking has taken off it seems
to have encouraged more trading. &quot;Over the same period,&quot; says
the BoE report, &quot;the electronic brokers took 23% of the London market
in the currency pair, indicating that nearly half of this turnover came
from the creation of new brokered business - typically low-value interbank
transactions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A year later, Reuters estimates that in the spot market overall the two
electronic systems now control 40% of the business by volume. Roslyn Wilton,
Reuters' managing director for transaction products, says that with some
4,500 key stations in over 1,000 banks, Reuters now brokers 25 currency
pairs, with 90% of the business coming from eight of these. EBS is concentrated
in fewer currency pairs and in the lucrative dollar/Deutschmark market is
very strong . &quot;It's really taken off much quicker than we anticipated,&quot;
says Wilton. &quot;The first year was tough, but once we reached a critical
mass it just took off.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Voice brokers such as Trio were badly hit by the rapid expansion of electronic
business. &quot;In the beginning of '94 EBS would do $10 billion a week
in dollar/Deutschmark business,&quot; says Trio's Hagan. &quot;By the end
of '94 it was up to $20 billion a week, whereas we we would average $30
billion a week on our spot desk in Germany alone. But from the beginning
of '95 EBS went up an exponential curve and it is now in excess of $100
billion a week.&quot; Even successful firms like Marshall found the going
tough. &quot;We haven't lost market share among the group [of voice brokers],
but the group itself has lost market share,&quot; says a Marshall source.
&quot;With the electronic systems and pressure on commissions you're having
to run to stand still.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Trio took the strategic decision to leave the spot forex market late in
1994, closing the London desk early in 1995, pulling out of spot in Tokyo
and Hong Kong in the middle of the year, then closing Singapore. In October
it sold its German business, Bierbaum &amp; Co, to Exco. Recently it has
announced the sale of its Swiss office to a domestic Swiss broking company.
Overall, in the past 15 months it has reduced its staff from some 900 to
450. &quot;We had seven desks in spot dollar/Deutschmark,&quot; says Hagan.
&quot;We now have none. We don't do spot forex at all, which for many years
was a core product for Martins. Our core products now are forward foreign
exchange, arbitrage, deposit broking, domestic sterling and, globally, some
highly specialized niche areas such as OTC equity options.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Exco also reacted dramatically, slashing its workforce last year by 17%
and closing almost all its London spot forex operations. &quot;There is
evidence that the advent of the electronic matching systems has changed
the nature of the spot foreign exchange market,&quot; says Exco chief executive
Peter Edge in the company's latest annual report. &quot;This caused us to
re-evaluate our position in this market and we decided to focus on the major
international products and on our existing strengths, withdrawing from products
where we judge the prospects to be poor.&quot; Although Exco's &#163;6 million
purchase of Bierbaum in October 1995 included that firm's flagship D&uuml;sseldorf-based
spot dollar/Deutschmark business and its Frankfurt deposit-broking business,
the move has been portrayed in hindsight as being motivated more by a desire
to get hold of the Frankfurt fixed-income securities business and to gain
a stronger continental footing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The electronic broking system has basically changed the whole market,&quot;
says Thomas Fischer Henrichsen of Exco Bierbaum in D&uuml;sseldorf. &quot;We've
been hit on two fronts. The turnover has fallen and the commission has fallen.&quot;
In the &quot;old days&quot;, he says, there were five-pip spreads, whereas
now they are one or two; and whereas a couple of years ago the commission
would be Dm25 per $1 million turnover, the rate is now half that. As in
London and other major markets, smaller banks that once depended on voice
brokers to execute trades now find it cheaper to use electronic trading,
bypassing not only the brokers but also the big banks. The ability of these
smaller players to deal direct is certainly a significant element in falling
spreads and commissions; big banks and brokers no longer hold all the cards.
<BR>
<BR>
One potentially hopeful event for Exco Bierbaum is the decision of media/broking
conglomerate MAI to move its business in dollar/Deutschmark from Frankfurt
to London, with effect from July. Its German-based M&uuml;ller team will
work alongside MAI's London-based Harlow Butler broking team, creating a
larger operation in one centre and enabling the company to economize on
its communications network. This may leave the field more open for Exco
Bierbaum in Germany. &quot;It gives us a much better chance on the Continent,&quot;
says Henrichsen. <BR>
<BR>
Although spot forex is proving difficult for traditional players, other
foreign exchange markets, particularly options, offer some hope. The BIS
survey reported gross turnover in swap markets rising by 56% in the three
years to April 1995 and turnover in options more than doubled (although
options still accounted for only 4% of overall activity). Swaps now account
for the second largest volume of turnover after spot transactions, whose
share fell from 58% to just under half, the BIS report said. In London the
proportion of gross turnover accounted for by forwards increased from 48%
to 59%, with nearly 80% of the increase coming from activity in the swaps
market. <BR>
<BR>
This increase in forward activity has been a big boon for some brokers.
Cantor-Fitzgerald, a New York-based broker which made its name in government
securities, is a case in point. It does not broker spot deals, but within
the past few years it has moved aggressively into forwards, focusing initially
on the two most actively traded currency pairs, the dollar/Deutschmark and
dollar/yen. With its well-established worldwide network of screens it had
a natural position for advertising prices and gave its customers a new way
of doing business on the market. It claims to be the only brokerage firm
to offer screen-based brokerage of forex forwards, and plans to provide
a non-name give-up service (the usual practice is for clients' identities
to be revealed for purposes of clearing and settlement after the deal is
struck); its strong $200 million capital base allows it to provide in-house
clearing for clients. &quot;If you call other brokers about forex they groan,&quot;
says Howard Lutnick, president and CEO. &quot;Our revenues in forex were
up 150%-200% at the end of last year.&quot; And although forex is still
a small part of the business (US government securities and equities account
for almost half), Lutnick says, &quot;Foreign exchange is the fastest-growing
business we have.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Trio is developing a software system to enhance its broking operation. It
will be similar to the equity IDB screens in London, which Hagan had a large
hand in developing while at Tullett &amp; Tokyo. He believes that Trio controls
a significant share of the London forward market, particularly in longer-dated
instruments (over one month) - and that if the electronic firms move
into the market he could benefit in the same way as large players in spot
forex have. &quot;If we're at or near the top of the pack the migration
of liquidity will come to us,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
The old world of voice broking is rapidly being transformed rather than
disappearing. Even in spot forex, where electronic brokers offer direct
competition, it is doubtful that voice brokers will entirely disappear.
For one thing, the electronic brokers don't want them to. Voice brokers
add flexibility, thus contributing to liquidity. And although the banks
themselves participate in EBS, it is not in the interest of their dealers
to have the market dominated by one system. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Niche markets</B> <BR>
<BR>
One tendency is for smaller trades to be routed through the electronic systems
and bigger tickets to be handed to the voice brokers. Reuters' Wilton suggests
that this may be gradually changing. She now sees the occasional $10 million,
or even $20 million, deal appearing among the average $1 million to $2 million
lots on the electronic system. Nevertheless, it would seem that dealers
for the most part still prefer the familiarity of a trusted voice broker
who can use his discretion in finding takers on the other side. &quot;I
would suggest a verbal broker in forex has an average trade seven to 10
times larger than an electronic one,&quot; says Cantor-Fitzgerald's Lutnick.
<BR>
<BR>
What's more, voice brokers can still make money in the less mature spot
markets. Prebon Yamane, which decided five years ago to stay out of the
high-volume markets (dollar/Deutschmark, dollar/yen, etc), has remained
in less mature sections, such as spot Ecu and emerging Asian markets. As
a result, says Prebon Yamane deputy managing director Stephen Miles, electronic
trading &quot;has not had anywhere near the effect that it is has had on
some of our competitors&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Electronic brokers look set to move into the forward markets - as early
as the end of this year some brokers believe. The electronic firms are reticent
about their plans, but admit to looking actively at the possibility. Computerizing
bank credit positions over time is problematic. In the spot market, the
credit position is easier to handle: the computers hold the limit of every
bank with every other bank - and that can be adjusted daily -
so the price displayed to the user is absolutely firm. In forward markets,
however, credit limits vary. A bank with a &#163;500 million limit for overnight
transactions may have only a &#163;5 million credit for a five-year deal.
Some brokers believe the sheer number of limits a computer would have to
hold would make it impossible for electronic brokers to go beyond one month.
Reuters' Wilton acknowledges the problem: &quot;The credit side of forwards
is much more complex than in spot forex. It's going to be some time before
we feel comfortable we have something that works.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even in sectors without electronic competition, the broking business is
proving as tough as it is in spot markets. The various fiascos in derivatives
have taken their toll. &quot;There was this obsession with risk, how to
minimize it, exacerbated by Barings and Daiwa Bank, and it had a huge dampening
effect on speculation in the money markets,&quot; says a broker. The total
notional amount of all privately negotiated new contracts among the member
firms of Isda (International Swap &amp; Derivatives Association) in interest-rate
swaps, currency swaps and interest-rate options rose nearly 45% in the first
half of 1994, but in the second half fell from $4.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion
(within the three categories, only currency swaps rose). Activity picked
up again in the first half of 1995, but not to much above the level of the
first half of 1994 (final figures for the year are not yet available). <BR>
<BR>
Swaps are the second most actively traded product in the forex markets,
but brokers are finding it hard to make money on them because they have
become relatively standardized, which means they can often be negotiated
without brokers. When they do go through brokers, standardization means
that banks have more leverage to squeeze commissions. Options are the &quot;new
game in town&quot;, says one broker. But they do not yet offer the volume
that big brokerage firms depend on. <BR>
<BR>
Success in niche markets breeds competition from large brokers seeking volume.
Intercapital chairman Michael Spencer started broking interest rate swaps
in 1985 and had a successful run for many years. Ten years later, though,
Intercapital had to fight hard to maintain its share of a market it largely
created (the firm's misfortunes were exacerbated by the loss of its entire
emerging markets team to Cantor-Fitzgerald 18 months ago - a new team
is expected to be in place within a few months). Over the past five years
commissions on interest rate swaps have dropped by 70%, Intercapital managing
director David Gelber says. Commissions are now of the order of a quarter
of a basis point and other brokers complain of even higher volume discount
arrangements. Gelber says there is no choice. &quot;Sensible brokers will
enter into volume discount arrangements. You cannot be a niche player in
this environment,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
The firm is starting to recover. Gelber says profits showed &quot;considerable&quot;
improvement in the year ending in March. &quot;Commissions haven't risen
in the last 12 months but we have increased market share,&quot; he says.
The firm is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel - at the
expense of the competition. &quot;I now think commissions have reached a
point where some firms are going to find it hard to survive. The name of
the game is market share,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
A more recent London success story is a firm called Sunrise. Five years
ago Mike Hudson, its founder, saw an opportunity in equity index options.
&quot;When we set up, there wasn't a market,&quot; he says. &quot;Since
then our revenue has doubled every year. I see revenues going up and up
and up. The only thing that will stop it is some sort of regulatory change.&quot;
But Hudson is aware that Sunshine will have to adapt, since firms like Prebon
Yamane and Trio are moving into the area. &quot;It's a bit like a product
life cycle curve. As a market gets more deep and liquid you get more conservative
institutions coming in.&quot; And, by definition, more brokers. So Sunrise
has moved into over-the-counter options markets in aluminium, gold and other
metals. &quot;We want a market with the same kind of margins and volume
- relatively underdeveloped,&quot; Hudson says. <BR>
<BR>
But for most firms, the outlook is pretty dismal. Their trials have been
reflected in their stock market performance. Trio's share price was 50p
early in 1994 but hit a low of 6p and is now only 7.5p. Exco's was 200p
in September 1994 and is now only 102p. Other firms, such as Intercontinental
Exchange Partners and Cedar Street in Switzerland, have gone out of business
altogether. Not surprisingly merger rumours are flying: will it be Prebon
and Marshall, or Exco and Marshall - or Marshall and Trio? Will MAI
demerge Harlow Butler and Garban as it concentrates on its flashy new media
business? What about Tullett? The problem for most of these firms is that
even though they can be major cash cows, they are difficult to value because
their biggest asset is goodwill. A number of them, still burdened with debt
from the last round of mergers and takeovers, now technically have negative
net worth. One thing is certain. Brokers are keeping a close eye on each
other's balance sheets - that is, once the companies have got around
to filing them. <BR>

<H3>BANK ARCHITECTURE</H3>


<H3> <B>Towards a machine for working in</B></H3>
 <H4> <B>Bank buildings were once designed to convey solidity and
reliability. Then they went through a phase of gigantism. Now the emphasis is on
user-friendliness and functionality. But there are still hints here and there of
<I>folies de grandeur</I>. Stephanie Cooke reports</B> </H4> 

<P> Sir Norman Foster is not famous for understated buildings: he's responsible for the Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong, the huge radio aerial outside Barcelona, and the
redevelopment of the Reichstag in Berlin. Commerzbank's new building in Frankfurt
will be Europe's tallest. But its architects, Sir Norman Foster &amp; Partners,
insist that winning a height competition isn't the point. Banks are no longer
seeking to outreach each other in opulence. They're looking for an efficient use
of space.

<P> Barclays' new headquarters, in the City of London's Lombard Street, follows
this principle. It says nothing specific about Barclays &#173; it could as easily
house any other bank or a blue-chip company for that matter. Today, grand design
has been replaced by functional business support.

<P> The trend is for architects of banks in Europe and the US to give as much
consideration to the needs of the profit-makers inside as to bending the necks of
customers and passers-by outside. The landmark design in this trend, years ahead
of its time when it was finished in the 1980s, was ING Bank's quirky headquarters
in Amsterdam, extraordinary to behold, but kind to its inhabitants.

<P> So what has happened to the old-style megaliths, conceived in the 1980s? The
redevelopment of Peterborough Court, Fleet Street, home of Goldman Sachs in
London, is a good example of power-style. Never mind the vast cylindrical columns
that face you in the front entrance or the rectilinear patterns of the glass and
steel lobby walls. It is the elevators themselves that tell the tale. Horizontal
steel straps on the inside doors, echoing the lobby motif and fixed solidly in
place with exposed bolts, work their magic as the doors shut silently, but
firmly. The passenger is enthralled by the building's palpable strength.

<P> In this edifice, which serves as Goldman's European headquarters, the medium
is indisputably the message. The building speaks of power, of deal-flow, of
secret knowledge. "'Muscular' is how a lot of people describe it," a receptionist
confides.

<P> Some grand bank buildings belie the troubled present state of their
occupants. In Paris, Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, the subject of an multi-billion
dollar government bail-out, has created a new building at Bercy Expo resembling
nothing less than a cathedral. In London, Nomura Securities moved into 1 St
Martin's-le-Grand, once the headquarters of the General Post Office (GPO), only
months before Nomura's president in Japan, Yoshihisa Tabuchi, was forced to
resign after a share-support scandal.

<P> Not that Tabuchi didn't leave his mark on the sumptuously restyled Nomura
House. In a private executive dining room he installed a circular stained-glass
window that was seen only by the bank's most important visitors.

<P> Also in London is the European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development, a
magnificent monument to the ego of Jacques Attali, the bank's disgraced former
president. Attali ordered rough-hewn marble slabs from the quarries of Carrara in
Italy. It was message overkill &#173; the bank was not in financial difficulties,
but its building caused it no end of public relations grief.

<P> The London offices of Daiwa Europe, which is unconnected with the
scandal-stained Daiwa Bank, are in the opulent turn-of-the-century Phoenix
Assurance building on King William Street. The lobby is a grand affair of
patterned marble with an octagonal middle formed by marble pillars and a
spectacular chandelier hanging from a translucent dome. But Daiwa Europe is
following the trend to more functionality. Construction is under way of a new
building of glass, metal and stone (designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership,
famous for the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Lloyd's of London building) on
the corner of London Wall and Wood Street. The building, due to be completed in
1998,<B> </B>will be stepped back in three stages, with the tallest section 15
storeys high, with roof gardens. It might be impressive, but it will be
functional, and won't be opulent.

<P> <B>Adaptable outlook</B>

<P> Opulence is obsolete. When it comes to modern bank architecture there are two
things that matter &#173; adaptability and utility. Banking business is
constantly changing, so the buildings must be readily adaptable. Banks also need
large areas for trading floors, which is partly why many new buildings have their
elevators and other services on the outside edges rather than in the middle. But
adaptability also suits Anglo-Saxon property speculators, who insist that even
banks be housed in "signature" buildings with resale potential. Barclays
contracted for just such a structure when it tore down its old headquarters
at<BR> 54 Lombard Street.

<P> The drive for flexibility and saleability has influenced style. But style as
a projection of corporate image is mostly seen in publicly visible places &#173;
the building's exterior, lobbies and, of course, the executive suites where
visitors are entertained. The rest of these buildings are essentially
warehouse-like shells for trading, settlement and corporate finance.

<P> The drive toward functionality has undoubtedly influenced the use of
materials. Gilding, crystal and the injudicious use of marble are out; stone,
wood and base metals are in. JP Morgan's London building, in the old City of
London School, incorporates a modern version of an Italian piazza. The interior
is a simple, dry-wall affair and, says an admiring architect, the structure is
"very undemanding". Space can be rearranged easily. "What's interesting about JP
Morgan," says the architect, "is the extreme modesty of the building. Even the
boardroom is not extravagant."

<P> Barclays has also downplayed the glitz. The sumptuous "golden gates" that
used to guard the entrances to its old headquarters have been quietly removed
from their original position. One pair of them hangs inconspicuously on the high
walls on either side of the Gracechurch Street entrance, but they have been
allowed to develop an understated bronze patina. Unless you cast your eye upwards
and sideways on the way in you don't see them; the other pair is in storage.
"They are very keen not to have that image [of golden gates] now," says Terry
Brown of architects GMW which designed the new headquarters. "One brief for 54
Lombard Street was that it should be operationally to a very high standard and
that it should reflect that on the outside. They are escaping from the grand
imagery. The idea is to convey that money is being spent to support an efficient
business."

<P> Even among Paris banks &#173; whose middle name is grandiosity, says one
British architect &#173; the emphasis has changed to the sleek, light and
functional. Three major banks, Banque Paribas, Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale and Banque Indosuez, are involved in rehousing themselves
in modern buildings where space is moveable and no-one, bar traders, is far from
a window. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale has already moved to a
twin-towered affair in La D&eacute;fense and is now totally refitting the
building to make better use of the space. Paribas is not likely to give up its
famous Orangerie, but its traders, who now work above the lovely courtyard, will
eventually be moved to more functional quarters in a new building on the site of
an old garage.

<P> But the French are not totally forsaking grandeur. The lobby of the new
SocGen building is three storeys high, all marble and glass, and there is a metal
sculpture in the middle with a pool of water beneath it. Light pours in from a
huge glass dome at the top. "When you are in the entrance you have a feeling of
power, a lot of power," sighs a French architect.

<P> That discreet commodity, power, is expressed in many ways. The Bank of
China's building in Hong Kong is downright threatening. One of its triangular
knife-edges points directly to the governor's mansion and the two poles at the
top resemble chopsticks in a rice bowl, sticking straight up. This, say the
practitioners of <I>fengshui</I> (the Chinese system based on energy flow used to
position buildings propitiously), signifies death. Local gossip says the bank may
be built on a stream, which is  bad <I>fengshui</I> &#173; especially for a bank:
it means that the money "will run out of your house".

<P> <B>A new approach</B>

<P> When the HSBC building opened in 1985, the then deputy chairman William
Purves made no bones about it. The structure, he declared, was a "factory
containing all the plant and machinery required to conduct our business". It was
the most expensive factory ever built.

<P> But the build-higher competition, which is reaching frenzied proportions in
south-east Asia, may finally be dying out in Europe and America, Canary Wharf
notwithstanding. Norman Foster's new Commerzbank building, scheduled for
completion in 1997, is 254 metres high. But it is high not because of a desire to
express power so much as to take best advantage of space. The building is being
constructed next to the existing Commerzbank tower opposite the Frankfurter Hof
in downtown Frankfurt. Despite its great height it has features which soften and
shape the building: there are the curved lines of the triangular exterior and
gardens that spiral up and around the building. It is intended to be an
assemblage of small villages with sky-gardens 50 storeys high.

<P> "I think the days of height contests are over," says Dieter Jaeger of the
Frankfurt-based Quickborner Team, the planning consultants for the building.
Frank Duffy, a leading British architect with the firm DEGW, agrees: the pure
North American skyscraper is under attack, he says, ironically just after it
established itself at Canary Wharf. Before that development, he maintains,
British architects simply failed to construct decent bank buildings. The
difference in the quality of office accommodation between an American and a
British bank "still has to be measured in decades", he says.

<P> Pressure for a conceptual change comes from two sources, says Duffy: the
growing realization among British architects that consumers of office space are
becoming more demanding and the move toward a totally different approach in
northern Europe. "It is open season on the philistinism of UK office developers,"
he says in <I>The Changing City</I>, a book he wrote with Alex Henney. "The great
need is for an alternative image of the office to that of a money-multiplying,
inhuman, non-life-enhancing tower."

<P> The best example of what they mean &#173; perhaps the only example &#173; is
the ING headquarters in Amsterdam, a Hansel-and-Gretel-type village of 10 low
towers whose walls slope in different directions (leading sound upwards to reduce
noise nuisance) and creating a crazy quilt-like pattern along an S-shaped line.
Duffy and Henney note that there are no parallel lines in the entire structure.
The building is extremely user-friendly: no-one sits more than six metres from a
window; windows can be opened; and restaurants, snack bars, post room, library,
film theatre and conference rooms are all reached along an indoor walkway.
Outside, employees can stroll through a splendid two-level Japanese-style garden.

<P> Whether such a setting is conducive to the creation of synthetic financial
instruments remains to be seen, but since it (or rather its previous incarnation
NMB-Postbank) moved into the building, ING has by no means been in a backwater of
international banking. Duffy says that, architecturally, the building is at the
forefront of innovative design.

<P> But in general, banks, unlike many electronics and telecoms companies,
haven't yet woken up to the "second wave" of thinking. The skyscraper
encapsulated the Anglo-American principle of leveraging space: increasing value
by multiplying square footage in the air. Now, he says, bank managements should
be thinking more imaginatively about space &#173; and time. This might involve
devising multiple uses for offices that are currently under-utilized, and
spreading different functions geographically, at the same time creating office
environments that are employee-friendly. The space occupied by corporate
financiers, for example, who spend most of their time out of the office, could be
shared or used differently. Dealmakers often work on airplanes, in other people's
offices, and in their own corporate conference rooms. All that time their own
offices are empty.

<P> Duffy sees the need for an attitude change: "You don't have to get everyone
in the same place. You can drive buildings to produce more work. The relationship
of people and space is fundamentally going to change."

<P> It may be difficult to picture someone like a senior partner in corporate
finance at Goldman Sachs in London, friendly as he may be with subordinates,
sharing office space at Peterborough Court &#173; even if he <I>is</I> hardly
ever there. On the other hand, for a deal-maker the idea of leveraging time and
space while they are under-utilized must have some appeal.

<H2>BASHKORTOSTAN </H2>
<H4>Petrochemical revenues, a contented population and wide-ranging autonomy
from Moscow have protected this republic on the Urals from the coldest winds
of economic change, while the state continues to subsidise basics like food
and transport. But there is much to interest foreign investors and a considerable
need for foreign cash to bring industry up to date <BR>

<B>A slow pace of reform has saved the republic from the gravest effects
of change, but problems still remain <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
Mention Bashkortostan to the average international investor and the reaction
will probably be one of mystification. The relatively large autonomous Russian
republic, roughly the same size of France, is not accustomed to drawing
attention to itself. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, Bashkortostan has spent most of its history trying to blend in.
The Bashkirs are not a particularly warlike people. Traditionally they were
nomads herding sheep, horses and other animals during the summer months
when they lived in portable dwelling tents called <I>yurts</I>. Now Bashkirs
are thin on the ground: they make up only a quarter of the population of
just over 4 million, outnumbered by Russians (39%) and Tatars (28%), not
to mention the other 70-odd ethnic nationalities inhabiting the republic's
143,600 sq km area. <BR>
<BR>
Despite their minority status, however, the Bashkir philosophy permeates
the present government led by the popularly elected Murtaza Rakhimov. Having
won substantial autonomy from the Russian Federation, Rakhimov has set out
to avoid the worst effects of what he sees as a misdirected reform effort.
<BR>
<BR>
While Bashkortostan is bound by Russian legislation, it has considerable
discretion and has its own gradualist version of economic reform involving
a rejection of anything even remotely connected to shock therapy and a concern
for social welfare that would test the finances of richer states: Bashkortostan
favours food subsidies, free transport and regular payments to its pensioners.
It has tried to isolate itself from Russia's high inflation and headlong
rush to privatise. <BR>
<BR>
While this economic programme might seem calculated to end in financial
disaster, so far Bashkortostan has been able to pull it off, partly because
of hard-currency earnings from its foreign trade in petrochemicals and partly
due to an enviably contented population. <BR>
<BR>
Privatisation provides one illustration of the republic's own approach to
reform. The Ufa administration has the right to pursue its own policy for
republic-owned property, which accounts for the vast majority of enterprises
located in Bashkortostan. Salavat Murtasin, chairman of the State Property
Management Committee of Bashkortostan says: &quot;I'm no Chubais [Russia's
former privatisation minister]. The situation is a bit different here than
in Russia. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The transition to a market economy is impossible without privatisation
but it must be gradual to avoid mistakes. We want to make sure we are on
the right track.&quot; The committee itself has little power: it can make
recommendations, but generally executes decisions made by the president
and cabinet. <BR>
<BR>
By January 1 this year, 1,120 Bashkortostan companies had been privatised,
817 of them municipal enterprises. Murtasin says around 60% of all the republic's
assets have been privatised, but the state still holds an average 48% stake
in most companies. He calculates that a third of the working population
is employed by privatised industry. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are still rather a lot of unprivatised companies, especially
in the engineering sector and companies connected to the defence industry.
Some will not be privatised, like those in telecoms, water services, grain
processing, storage and transport. We are developing ways to monitor these
properties, to decide if they should remain under state control or be privatised.
This will be a joint decision taken with the cabinet of ministers,&quot;
explains Murtasin. <BR>
<BR>
The main priority for this year's programme is to analyse the first results
of privatisation. &quot;We expected privatised companies to be more efficient
and the shareholders more interested in developments, but this did not happen,&quot;
explains Murtasin. State companies are more efficient than some privatised
companies, he says. When privatisation touched leading industries such as
energy, chemicals, oil refining and petrochemicals, the state still clung
to a substantial package of shares. &quot;The main task now is not just
to privatise for privatisation's sake,&quot; he adds. <BR>
<BR>
Another job for Murtasin is the vertical integration of companies in the
oil, refining, metallurgical, ferrous and non-ferrous sectors. The idea
is to group companies in a holding structure which investors will find more
attractive than individual companies. Investment tenders are expected for
projects such as the Bashkortostan Copper and Sulphur Plant and companies
in the food processing sector but he admits that most firms still require
substantial modernisation to attract foreigners. <BR>
<BR>
So far Bashkortostan has attracted little investment although there have
been some notable successes. One is the sports shoe manufacturing plant
Bash-Kelme in Meleuz where the Spanish company Kelme has a joint venture.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has provided
a $11m loan for the project which represents the first direct private-sector
financing in eastern Europe involving a Spanish sponsor. An Italian firm
is involved in constructing a $150m polypropylene manufacturing unit at
Ufaorgasynies, while the German firm Lurgi is involved in a new ethyl styrene
operation at Salavatnefteorgasyntez. <BR>
<BR>
The main attraction for foreign investors will be in Bashkortostan's fuel
and energy sector. There are opportunities, despite the fall in oil production
in the republic to 17.75m tonnes last year, down 9% over 1994. It is predicted
to fall still further. Recent estimates say the republic's 60-year-old oil
deposits will run out within 15 years. Secondary and tertiary recovery technology
is needed for existing wells, although exploration is continuing. <BR>
<BR>
Alexander Perlevsky, head of the Bashkortostan fuel-power complex department
at the Council of Ministers, believes oil refining rather than exploration
and production will be the main target of foreign investors. &quot;We are
reconstructing existing facilities, very often with the assistance of western
investors. We are attracting some credits, for example from the Saxon government.
Almost every oil refinery is talking to foreign companies. It is not enough
for us to do it by ourselves,&quot; he says. Oil production negotiations
are falling away as larger and more lucrative deposits in Siberia tempt
firms away. <BR>
<BR>
Another area where western investment is needed is the maintenance and renewal
of the existing pipeline network. Bashkortostan has over 100,000 km of production
pipelines and over 250,000 km of oil product lines on its territory. Around
a third have been in use for over 30 years and corrosion is now causing
serious problems. Pollution from leaking pipes is another major problem,
which has had its share of environmental disasters, including a big oil
spill in December 1995. Requests for aid from federal institutions have
met with a very limited response. As an autonomous republic, Bashkortostan
has opened its own trade offices representations in Vienna and Moscow to
attract more foreign investment to the republic. &quot;Through Vienna we
have contacts with neighbouring countries, such as the Czech and Slovak
Republics and Hungary,&quot; says Marat Sharipov, first deputy prime minister
at the ministry of foreign affairs and responsible for attracting foreign
investment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Direct ties to the world </B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;We try to use our representatives to make international contacts.
A delegation from the United Nations Development Organisation came to Ufa
because of them. We are now connected to the UN environmental programme
[which] should help attract another set of foreign investors,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<BR>
Bashkortostan also cooperates with the EU Tacis programme, mainly through
its Moscow head of office, Jean Bagh. &quot;We hope to organise training
for ministry and other civil servants through the Tacis programme. We have
also spoken about development and cooperation with help from international
organisations via our trade representatives,&quot; he explains. <BR>
<BR>
Cooperation between Bashkortostan and Russia has improved. &quot;Now the
Russian foreign ministry makes many efforts to coordinate its activities
with the republic in foreign trade. A special coordinating and consulting
council has been set up by Russia with all republics represented. I think
it is a very efficient body,&quot; says Sharipov. Some foreign countries
have close ties with Bashkortostan. Germany, the biggest trade partner after
Finland, is keen on continuing cooperation. A German consulate may open
in Ufa this year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;German companies are booming in Russia but they are not rushing into
Bashkortostan,&quot; says Sharipov. &quot;Our argument is that Bashkortostan
is a rather steady place in a rather unsteady geopolitical area, our economic
situation is stable. Results show there are opportunities [and] a gradual
increase in industrial output. We are growing, we are raising production.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Light industry and consumer goods production is a target for foreign investments.
The republic has a lot of wool, says Sharipov, and it wants to process more
of it rather than exporting the raw material. Turkish and German firms are
among possible investors. <BR>
<BR>
Food processing is another area and given that about a third of the republic
is covered in forests, little is done to process timber and wood. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign trade contributes a lot to Bashkortostan's economy. For the first
time since 1985 exports increased last year, doubling over 1994 to $1.88bn.
This figure includes all foreign trade, including that with former Soviet
republics. Imports also rose to $405m with the largest increases in engineering
goods (47%), chemicals (14%) and food products (13%). The lion's share of
exports, 61%, were attributed to the chemical and petrochemical sectors.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Twenty years ago we produced 50 million tonnes of oil a year. Last
year we produced around 17 million tonnes. You can draw your own conclusions
from those figures. We exported around 3m tonnes of crude oil last year.
The other exports were oil and petrochemical products - over 8 million tonnes,&quot;
explains Sharipov. Bashkortostan wants to increase exports of oil products,
but first it needs to reconstruct refineries. Still, increased exports mean
more money for cash-starved companies. But officials worry that unstable
rouble exchange rates this year will cut exports. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Plans for export potential </B><BR>
<BR>
In the medium term the republic has its own plans, says Sharipov. &quot;We
envisage the increase of exports of processed goods from oil refineries
and some in the engineering sector as well as furniture from our wood. We
have the potential for over $2bn of exports by the year 2005 from the engineering
and defence sectors, if we can make investments in these areas.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Direct foreign investment priorities are reconstruction and the development
of new factories and product capacity. The country also needs help in banking,
transport, telecommunications and general financial services. In return
it offers some advantages over Russia, such as extra legal protection for
investors involved in specific investment projects. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have a list of sectors of interest for foreign investors. My advice
to them is that they should come here and talk to others who have invested
here. The experience of our partners is our best advertising,&quot; concludes
Sharipov. <BR>
<BR>
One such is Arturo Moratto, an affable former professor of Russian representing
the Italian firm Technimont, who has been working in Russia since the '70s.
The company's latest project, the Ufa synthesis factory, is plant number
41. &quot;Bashkortostan has a lot of needs. It needs to revamp all its oil
plants, otherwise it cannot compete on the western market. Russia needs
to review its policies on energy costs and on the cost of transport on Russian
territory. That accounts for a very large percentage of costs,&quot; explains
Moratto. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the outcome of June's Russian presidential elections, Moratto says
change will be limited. He forecasts tighter central control, which might
be a good thing given the amount of confusion over payments and contracts
over the past few years. As for the republic in general, he continues to
be optimistic. &quot;I think it's good here. They have many resources and
Bashkortostan is a fairly quiet place. Any changes are made step-by-step
and there is no shock policy. I think that has been a wise policy.&quot;
says Moratto. <BR>
<BR>
Although Ufa has a reputation as a quiet backwater of the Russian Federation,
not everyone is so laid-back. The state bank BashCreditBank is one organisation
which belies the sleepy, small-town atmosphere of Ufa. Headed by Azat Kurmanaev,
a dynamic import from Novosibirsk, BashCreditBank has managed to change
the republic's banking sector in just over two years. <BR>
<BR>
It operates as the state financing arm for projects. But under Kurmanaev,
the bank only operates on commercial principles: &quot;We perform the same
functions as a national bank, but we have no supervisory authority. We are
the main investment bank for the state of Bashkortostan,&quot; explains
Kurmanaev. &quot;We work on market laws although we are a state bank. We
don't use our dividends to give money to our shareholders, we accumulate
them and with this money we reinvest. That's the primary difference between
us and normal commercial banks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Money from internal sources </B><BR>
<BR>
In fact BashCreditBank is anything but normal in a Russian context. Kurmanaev
has made the bank into an example of efficiency, representating the image
he wants to project. He sees one of his main duties as making BashCreditBank
a model for other commercial banks in Bashkortostan and complains that too
many companies still think banks exist to hand out free money. Money costs
money and the sooner Bashkir companies learn this the better off they will
be, he says. &quot;I have never thought western investment would play a
large role in our country. I think anyone who does not realise this will
fail. We need money from internal sources,&quot; says Kurmanaev. But this
financing is not cheap and must be on a commercial footing. <BR>
<BR>
With strong characters like Kurmanaev the republic may able to attract foreign
investment and convince its own entrepreneurs that the economic future is
bright. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="culture-trove"></A>A LEVANTINE FLAVOUR </H3>
<B>Despite its reputation as remote, Bashkortostan has played host to some
major cultural names </B><BR>
<BR>
Bashkortostan or indeed its capital city, Ufa, are hardly places associated
with the world's cultural scene. Yet the autonomous Russian republic was
the birthplace of one of the world's greatest ballet stars, Rudolf Nureyev.
Mikhail Bulgakov, the author of one of the 20th century's classics, <I>The
Master and Margarita</I>, also spent time in Ufa, albeit in exile. <BR>
<BR>
Bashkortostan is rightly proud of its cultural heritage which blends traditional
Russian with the more exotic and eclectic Bashkir and Tatar folk cultures.
It is this mix of cultures, together with outstanding natural beauty, that
the authorities hope will one day make Bashkortostan a new tourist destination.
<BR>
<BR>
At present, however, it is difficult to image a less likely tourist spot.
Before the republic can begin to compete it needs to make itself more accessible.
Although there is a daily flight between Ufa and Istanbul, as well as three
flights to Moscow and back, the republic is isolated. The main international
airport has plans for expansion but it lacks finance. Ambitious road reconstruction
in Ufa will help relieve some of the pressure on the capital, but once outside
the city limits, roads are inadequate for the local traffic as well as the
heavy lorries transporting goods from western Siberia. <BR>
<BR>
The railway, like anywhere in Russia, is in need of serious upgrading. Telecoms,
although improving, are far from what the even lower end of the tourist
market would expect. <BR>
<BR>
Hotels in the capital are improving and new ones are planned, but accommodation
is generally Soviet-style, even though the welcome is warm and service is
more often than not given with a genuine smile. <BR>
<BR>
Bashkortostan's dream of earning serious amounts of revenue from tourism
is not impossible, although it may be premature. The republic boasts over
600 rivers and 800 lakes and around a third of its territory is covered
by forests which so far remain relatively unspoiled and undeveloped. <BR>
<BR>
At the southern end of the Ural Mountains, it has a lot to offer, from winter
sports to summer camping. The republic has 34 spas, some with mud baths
and hot springs, and four major nature reserves with dozens of species of
wild animal and hundreds of plants. <BR>
<BR>
Hunting outside the park areas is encouraged and although the Bashkirs themselves
are more interested in bee-keeping than shooting, they are nevertheless
skilled with hunting rifles and fishing rods. <BR>
<BR>
The unusual blend of east and west in the Bashkir and Tatar cultures lends
a Levantine element to the republic which despite its eastward leanings
is firmly European. The colourful pageantry of the Bashkirs, coupled with
their openness to visitors, should ensure success if the government can
find the money - or tempt investors - to modernise transport, telecoms and
accommodation. <BR>
<BR>
In an attempt to aid development, the government has established a tourism
ministry. It says there are many locations suitable for tourist and recreational
facilities and is eager to organise trips for potential investors to view
the sites. <BR>
<BR>
In the capital city some improvements have already been made to Ufa's main
hotel, Rossiya, where two floors have been redecorated by an Austrian company.
Three more hotels are being built in the business centre of the city by
Chinese, Yugoslav and Turkish companies. <BR>
<BR>
Together with improvements to the city's road and air links, a small start
has been made to furthering Bashkortostan's tourist prospects.<BR><BR>
 <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="spa-treatment"></A>TAKING THE WATERS</H3>
<B>The republic's northern Salavat region is a typical small rural area
with an unusual set of ambitions </B><BR>
<BR>
The Salavat region is typical of Bashkortostan's non-industrial areas. Primarily
a rural district, the population of only 29,000 is relatively well-off compared
with other similar areas in Russia. The region is tucked into the foothills
of the Ural Mountains in the north of the republic. <BR>
<BR>
Salavat boasts a selection of small food-processing plants, a variety of
state and private farms and few other facilities. But the head of the region,
Rafkat Muratov, hopes to change that and attract foreign investment into
the area. <BR>
<BR>
At present, he is content to concentrate on improvements like building new
homes. &quot;Since the beginning of the '90s, we have built twice as many
private homes as in Soviet times. The administration helps by providing
loans and cheap materials,&quot; he says. People live in traditional wooden
houses, most of them heated by wood stoves. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have modest ambitions. We try to build surfaced roads each year.
We are converting homes in the district to gas heating and organising their
connection to gas pipelines,&quot; explains Muratov. <BR>
<BR>
One way to raise living standards is to bring new business to the area.
One of the newest investment projects takes advantage of the region's most
famous natural resource, the Kurgazak mineral spring. Its water is now being
bottled in a modern, environmentally friendly plant owned by Poly-press
Kurgazak. <BR>
<BR>
The plant has produced 16,000, 1.5 litre bottles a day since 1994 using
Italian machinery and is part-owned by Lukoil, a major Russian oil firm.
<BR>
<BR>
Shtanko Alexei, manager at the bottling plant, usually lives in Ufa but
finds life in the countryside and work for a private company to his liking:
&quot;We see results of our work in privatised company. We see the more
water we produce the more money we get. It is difficult to speak of the
future. Meanwhile, I like to work here. It means good prospects as well
as fresh air and excellent living conditions - not like in Ufa.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Near the bottling plant is another potential cash-cow for the region, the
Yangantau Health Resort on top of Hot Mountain near the village of Chulpan.
The resort, founded in 1937, is famous for the hot steam rising from the
ground there and which is said to help cure a variety of ailments including
arthritis and stomach pains. <BR>
<BR>
Although the resort currently caters for Russians, management of the state-run
institution hopes to attract foreign tourists in future. This will not be
easy. The place is a difficult drive from Ufa of more than three hours and
the nearest railway station is 45km away. Most visitors are expected to
make their own way to the mountaintop resort. <BR>
<BR>
Once there, foreign guests may be disappointed. Most of the buildings are
constructed in typical Soviet-style, without any attempt to blend them into
the surrounding forests. The facilities are also in need of extensive renovation.
<BR>
<BR>
Alfred Akbashev, vice-manager of the resort and in charge of patient treatments,
is keen to attract foreign tourists but admits the resort needs extensive
improvements before it is ready to receive them. An expansion programme,
estimated to cost around $11 million, is planned but hopes of privatisation
are slim and without that there is little chance of foreign investment.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want to improve services and quality and train personnel to speak
English. We are expanding facilities and building a new steamhouse, at a
cost of $2 million, using Turkish workers,&quot; he explains.

<H3><A NAME="presidents-view"></A>A BALANCING ACT </H3>
<B>President Murtaza Rakhimov is an intriguing mixture of the wily and pragmatic
who seeks national consensus <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
Murtaza Rakhimov, president of Bashkortostan, is a mixture of wily western-style
politician and pragmatic eastern ruler. Born in 1934 in the southern village
of Tabakano, he entered politics from industry, having been the manager
of a petrochemical company. <BR>
<BR>
Rakhimov was elected as president in 1993 and there is no new election scheduled
until December 1998. Although he cannot be elected for another term, it
is likely that his successor will be chosen far in advance of the plebiscite.
<BR>
<BR>
The republic's politics are characterised by consensus rather than confrontation
and there is no serious opposition to Rakhimov or his policies. &quot;We're
not extreme here. We avoid new experiences and radical politics,&quot; says
one figure close to the president. <BR>
<BR>
The only real worry, according to the president, is the possibility of someone
other than Boris Yeltsin winning June's Russian presidential elections.
Rakhimov is a keen supporter of Yeltsin and proud of his friendship with
the Russian ruler. He worries that someone else in the Kremlin could give
less support to decentralisation of powers, and consequently leave Bashkortostan
less room for political manoevre. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Balancing the peoples </B><BR>
<BR>
Rakhimov has deftly balanced the requirements of his multiethnic republic,
divided almost equally between Bashkirs, Tatars and Russians. He has also
secured the republic's special status within the new Russian Federation.
A 1994 agreement ensures Bashkortostan a large amount of autonomy but firmly
ties it to Moscow. Rakhimov points out, with a smile, that Bashkortostan's
first accord with Russia was signed in 1557. &quot;We didn't fight with
Russia like Tatarstan. We freely joined Russia. We understood that it was
useless to fight.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Such pragmatism has ensured Rakhimov's continued popular support. He has
some leeway in tempering the republic's transition from the Soviet system
and has cushioned his republic from the worst effects of economic reform,
although there is still some way to go before it reaches a more extensive
stability and prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
The president rejects shock therapy and blames Yeltsin's bad advisers for
the problems now facing Russia. His idea of economic progress is a slow,
steady movement and he rejects ideas such as rapid privatisation and the
removal of the old state-managed price controls. He uses as much as possible
the little room for manoeuvre that his accord with Russia gives the republic
to mitigate the most profound changes. <BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;We pay our salaries&quot; </B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Chubais achievement was to put people at the edge of the road
selling goods because they could not live on their salaries,&quot; says
Rakhimov referring to Russia's recently sacked privatisation minister. &quot;You
see this on the road which goes through Chelyabinsk oblast [region], but
you do not see that in Bashkortostan. &quot;Unlike the other regions we
pay salaries and pensions. We try to help the low income groups. We have
problems, but these are the result of Russia's economic policies.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Rakhimov is proud that transport in Ufa is still free (except for taxis
and express buses), and food prices and housing are subsidised. This may
have kept the population quiet and relatively content, but it is putting
a strain on Bashkortostan's limited budget and Rakhimov's soft-landing reforms
are about to get a bit of a push. <BR>
<BR>
The republic's oil is running out and the republic needs to restructure
its industry. Foreign investment is needed if plans for reconstruction of
the republic's petrochemical and chemical industry are to be fulfilled.
To attract the money needed, Bashkortostan will have to make concessions
to reform. <BR>
<BR>
However, the president says foreign investors need political stability more
than anything and Bashkortostan can supply that in quantity. &quot;Why should
western investors come here and work for free? They will only come if there
is political stability and they can make a profit. We understand foreign
investors are not sure of the political situation and need guarantees that
there will be no reversal of policies. We can give those guarantees. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have a lot of foreign companies operating here helping with the
technical reconstruction of the petroleum and oil refining sectors. We have
attracted experts from Holland in agriculture. But we need investment in
the military-industrial complex to help with conversion [to civilian production].
Without investment in the form of western technology it will be difficult
to achieve economic growth,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Rakhimov also notes that Bashkortostan is ready to give investors guarantees.
The republic needs money and management skills to develop its natural resources
as well as those industries which need modernisation to survive. &quot;We
want to use our national wealth efficiently and effectively, but our equipment
is obsolete. We are not competitive on world markets. So if our economy
develops in a good way, then we will have a better life for all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>A need for state support </B><BR>
<BR>
The president wants the Russian Federation to do more to support local industry
and advocates state support for manufacturing, industry and agriculture.
&quot;Why import something when it is available on the local market?&quot;
he asks. He tells foreign investors to use local suppliers rather than imports
and ties investment to further expansion of Bashkortostan's industrial base.
<BR>
<BR>
Looking forward to his retirement from politics, Rakhimov takes a more philosophical
tone: &quot;I hope for a future for Bashkortostan where our economy develops
rapidly. I hope living standards here are the same as Europe [some day].
I want to see Russia make efficient use of its natural wealth and this could
ensure good economic growth in our republic, too,&quot; he concludes. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="refined-tastes"></A>REFINED TASTES </H3>
<B>With local oil production declining, the republic's refineries have had
to look elsewhere for supplies<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
For three decades Bashkortostan has been one of Russia's major petrochemical
producers. Although the industry has been affected by the nationwide decline
in industrial output, the fall in production in the republic has not been
as great as in other regions. Exports are growing and supplying a much-needed
source of foreign currency for both the republic and the refineries. <BR>
<BR>
Bashneftechim, the republic's leading refiner, was set up as a holding company
by the government which owns 90% of its shares, in order to revitalise and
restructure the republic's petrochemical sector. Ownerhsip of the remaining
shares is split between its four refineries; Novoil Nov-Ufimsk, Ufa Oil
Refinery, the Ufaneftchim Refinery and Ufaorgasynies. <BR>
<BR>
Vladimir Rakitsky, vice-president of Bashneftechim, is typical of the new-breed
Russian manager, confident about the future but battling with the complexities
of the Russian economy. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have around a 12% share of the Russian market in oil products,
and in some we have a monopoly,&quot; he says. The decline in Bashkortostan's
oil production means the company now depends on Siberia for three-quarters
of its oil supplies. Despite this, the firm's sales volume has been growing.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At a time when Russian refinery sales have fallen around 5% over the
past year, our company has increased its sales. We made a profit and exported
around $700 million worth of products last year. These can compete in western
markets,&quot; says Rakitsky. <BR>
<BR>
A staggering 70% of Bashneftechim's sales are made on a non-cash basis.
This includes state orders, where the republican or federal government asks
the company for oil products in return for tax rebates to an equivalent
value, or simple barter arrangements between Bashneftechim and other companies,
like the railways or electricity providers. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is very little cash around and that's why we support our exports.
We get real money for those,&quot; says Rakitsky. <BR>
<BR>
This explains why he is so keen on export expansion but although he expects
even higher sales this year, much depends on what the federal government
does. &quot;It is hard to compete with western companies and products from
a cost point. We are not competitive, but we are trying. We try to make
most of our exports higher quality to match our buyers' requirements.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Complicated internal price system </B><BR>
<BR>
The problem is that although Russian oil prices are still lower than world
prices, due to a complicated government-controlled internal pricing structure,
many of Bashneftechim's products cost more in Russia than foreign imports.
So Bashneftechim exports some products below cost simply to gain much-needed
hard currency. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;For example, the world market price for ethyl alcohol is around $200
a tonne, while the Russian price is twice as high. We lose money on exports,
but need the cash and need to maintain our position on foreign markets,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many refineries are producing below cost or cutting capacity. We are
still able to work to 60% of capacity. This year is critical for the economy
because if there is an economic revival we'll see increased demand and faster
development overall,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Internal competition is not a worry for Bashneftechim and plans to build
more refinery capacity, particularly in western Siberia, pose no threat.
Rakitsk. points out that there are only 28 refineries in Russia, while the
US market, with a similar structure, has over 400 refineries. &quot;I'm
not scared of competition,&quot; he says. &quot;But I don't understand why
we are constructing new facilities [in western Siberia] when there is no
profit and [other] refineries are operating below capacity.&quot; He wants
Bashneftechim to continue modernising while consolidating its position in
the international markets. <BR>
<BR>
One example of this is the contruction by the Italian firm Technimonet,
part of Montedison, of a $150 million manufacturing unit at Ufaorgasynies.
&quot;We also have some contacts with companies helping us to produce unleaded
fuels,&quot; says Rakitsky. Financing such projects depends on continued
export revenue, however, rather than product exchange and non-cash sales.
&quot;These sales serve as a guarantee for finance. It is important to develop
joint production and to try to attract foreign investors,&quot; he adds.

LONDON FINANCIAL MARKET
</H3>
<P>
<H2>Don't let Labour ruin it </H2>
<p>
<H4>There's a good chance the next UK government will be left-of-centre
Labour, whose previous terms of office have usually ended in inflation and
currency crisis. Soft-spoken Labour politicians can't allay fears - among
foreign investors and City practitioners - that a change of government will
trigger a market correction and more controls on the financial sector. The
reason for the fears: new-look Labour's overtures to private capital are
vague and non-committal. Even Labour supporters are saying it's time to
put flesh on the bones. By David Shirreff </H4>
<p>
<font size=3>
Imagine you're in Boston managing a portfolio of international equities.
It's 14 months to a UK general election which the left-of-centre Labour
Party will probably win. What do you do? <BR>
<BR>
Nothing. It's too early to tell whether the effect of the election will
be more than a blip on the political-economic map of Europe. <BR>
<BR>
However, the wise Bostonian is gathering information about Britain's new-look
Labour Party. This may help him or her decide if a change in government
will trigger just a small correction in the UK markets or a fundamental
change. <BR>
<BR>
Stuart Bell, Labour spokesman on corpor-ate affairs, visited New York and
Boston last October, courtesy of UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson, and
attempted to allay investors' fears. It was an opportunity for New Labour
and the most important investment community in the world to meet. <BR>
<BR>
Bell, a former international lawyer - tall, soft-spoken - could pass as
an investor himself. But at a dinner in New York for Kleinwort's investment
clients his remarks on plans for a windfall tax on the profits of British
utilities &quot;didn't go down too well&quot;, says an eyewitness. &quot;You
could see his audience taking note that the cost of capital in the UK would
rise.&quot; (They might have forgotten, or may never have noticed, that
it was a Conservative government which gouged a windfall tax from the banks
in 1981.) <BR>
<BR>
US investors are still asking fundamental, perhaps naive questions about
the Labour Party: How much experience does it have of government? Won't
it fall into the old vice of tax and spend? Can it manage the UK economy
<I>and</I> perform as the party of fairness? <BR>
<BR>
By the third and last day of his trip, Bell had learned to calm his audience
with positive pro-market speak and more guarded vagueness about Labour policies.
He let it be understood that his party doesn't need to make promises to
get elected. <BR>
<BR>
For foreign investors that may be good enough. One US investor with five
years' experience in the UK feels less threatened by a Labour victory than
he would have been 10 to 15 years ago. Gilman Gunn, head of international
investment at Keystone Distributors in Boston, sees a Labour Party which
has &quot;little room for manoeuvre&quot; on fiscal and borrowing policy,
because of the EU's Maastricht criteria on debt, budget deficit and inflation,
which Labour aspires to. He sees a Labour Party &quot;trying to tone down
its policies&quot;, and a &quot;malaise in the Tory government&quot; which
suggests it may be time for a change. <BR>
<BR>
Before the election - whether it's in October this year, as Kleinwort Benson
predicts, or at the latest possible date, May 22 1997 - Labour will keep
plugging away at the international investment community, assuring fund managers
that the old Labour bugbears are banished forever, and that, with foreign
investors' support, there needn't be a run on sterling. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Comical reluctance</B> <BR>
<BR>
Shadow chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) Gordon Brown will
visit the US this month and will tour France and Germany in May. Labour
leader Tony Blair will visit US president Bill Clinton in April and speak
to the US-UK Chamber of Commerce in New York. His tour to Singapore and
Japan in January gave leading east Asian businessmen a hint of his long-term
plans for the British economy. <BR>
<BR>
As a profile-raising exercise abroad, this may be sufficient. But at home,
there is rising impatience in the financial community, even among the Labour
faithful, that these people don't know what they're talking about. They
won't be drawn into debate on the nitty-gritty. Senior Labour politicians
show an almost comical reluctance to spell out their future government's
policies. <BR>
<BR>
There is a tactical reason for this. Labour veterans have painful memories
of the detailed election manifesto of 1983, dubbed &quot;the longest suicide
note in political history&quot;. They're not going to blow their chances
this time with cacophonous and discordant utterances from the shadow cabinet.
Labour's shadow treasury and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) teams
are almost too bland and harmonious in their teamwork, as if Blair had put
a gag on free thought. &quot;The Tories taught them that lesson,&quot; says
an investment banker. &quot;There's no value in internal divisions.&quot;
Hence the bridle on shadow ministers commenting<B> </B>on anything approaching
firm policy. &quot;Remember where they've come from,&quot; says Chris Haskins,
chairman of Northern Foods. &quot;They're having to make policy without
the great Whitehall system behind them. I'd like to see a bit more, but,
like them, I'd be inclined to keep my powder dry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Alistair Darling, Labour's spokesman on financial affairs, spent most of
a meeting on February 12 with the great and good of British finance - regulators,
former regulators, bankers and academics - dodging attempts to nail down
Labour's plans for the financial sector. &quot;I'm wary of grand plans,&quot;
he countered. But, he hinted, &quot;we're talking about fewer rules&quot;.
And he added: &quot;Whatever works best is what we want.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Darling is a former barrister, skilled at the measured response (see interview),
but he gives no comfort that Labour knows where it's going in the financial
sector. It is as though the shadow treasury were putting their plans for
the sector out to tender, waiting for the bids to come in, not only looking
for the best price, but also for some ideas. <BR>
<BR>
To those used to the conviction politics of the 1980s this may seem odd.
But for optimists it's an opportunity: here is the Labour Party offering
its services as an agent of reform and change in the financial area. Its
policies haven't solidified - yet: they're open to suggestion. New Labour,
as it calls itself, is approaching the question apparently without a hidden
ideological agenda - or without a fixed idea in its head. One member of
the party faithful sees this as a step forward: &quot;A few years ago policy
would have been decided at a party conference.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The regulation of London's financial markets is in urgent need of reform.
Few practitioners would deny this. The Securities &amp; Investments Board
(SIB), the watchdog of the financial self-regulatory organizations (SROs),
wants more teeth and fewer regulatory overlaps. There is confusion between
the roles of the UK treasury, the DTI, the Bank of England, the SIB and
the various SROs and on how they handle the two main functions of supervision:
prudential supervision to guard against systemic risk, and business-conduct
supervision to protect the consumer. The Financial Services Act (FSA), which
triggered London's Big Bang in October 1986, understandably didn't quite
foresee the gigantic development of the wholesale financial markets. Now,
because of the expense and confusion of multiple regulation, and possible
blind spots, it is time to rationalize and improve the act. An incoming
Labour government open to new ideas will find this easier than a tired Conservative
administration. <BR>
<BR>
That, at least, is the thinking of Michael Taylor, lecturer in finance at
London's Guildhall University, whose blueprint for a new dual structure
of financial regulation (<I>Twin Peaks</I>), was discussed at that meeting
with Darling, arranged by London's Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation.
Taylor, formerly at the Bank of England, believes there is an opportunity
for reform now which won't be just a knee-jerk reaction to some financial
disaster. &quot;A government which can get regulation right,&quot; he encouraged
Darling, &quot;will win a lot of friends in the City.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But how good is Labour at getting the right advice? As an opposition party
it has no direct access to official sources such as civil servants in the
treasury, the Bank of England or the DTI. Until 1993 its main source of
research was the Labour Finance &amp; Industry Group (LFIG), a kind of alternative
civil service. But this has always been hampered by the fact that participants
are members of the Labour Party, although LFIG has striven to avoid factious
party politics. With a sudden rush of new party members last autumn there
was a danger LFIG would turn into something else, a battleground between
Old Labour and New Labour ideologies. But the civil-service ethos was quickly
restored, say party insiders. Other sources of ideas and assistance are
the Fabian Society and the independent but left-leaning Institute for Public
Policy Research (IPPR). <BR>
<BR>
In 1993 Gerald Frankel, a deputy chairman of LFIG, with the weakness of
its partisanship in mind, founded the more arms-length Industry Forum. &quot;One
of the reasons I started it was out of sheer disgust that opposition parties
can't get access or funds for research,&quot; says Frankel, who is the forum's
chairman. Nick Matthews, who was its first secretary, underlines its catholic
nature: &quot;You don't have to be even remotely sympathetic to the Labour
Party; an interest in public policy development will do.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Industry Forum now has around 300 corporate or individual members, including
AT&amp;T (UK), Cargill, Hambros, ICL and the Institute of Directors. It
is open to anyone involved in business or the City professions, most of
whom are asked to pay a &#163;500 annual contribution towards costs. Membership
took off when Tony Blair became party leader and especially after he had
the party conference vote for the removal of Clause Four of Labour's constitution,
which called for public ownership of the means of production and exchange.
&quot;The trickle has become a flood,&quot; says Matthews, who now works
on industry policy at party HQ in Walworth Road. <BR>
<BR>
Last month the forum went public on six task forces set up to study aspects
of business and finance: one, on City and financial services, is chaired
by Stuart Bell, and includes experts from JP Morgan, Hambros, NatWest, and
a former adviser to the Bank of England. &quot;I'm there as an individual,
I'm not representing my firm,&quot; says Geoff Lindey of JP Morgan Investment
Management. He's not a member of the Labour Party but would like to see
it get good advice. At meetings of the forum he recalls some &quot;very
robust discussions at which prejudices and dogmas were being challenged&quot;.
In discussions on market liquidity, short-termism and its impact on capital
formation, &quot;one member of the Labour Party took a very pragmatic view,
insisting 'this is the way markets work'&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
But the Industry Forum stops short of policy-making: lobbying for special
interests is taboo. &quot;We're not going to rewrite policy for &#163;500,&quot;
says Matthews, &quot;for &#163;5 million, possibly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The LFIG has its own study groups which are closer to writing policy, but
LFIG members are resigned to producing documents without knowing their ultimate
fate. &quot;We're merely the workers in the vineyard,&quot; says Tony Smith,
a former finance director, who chairs the LFIG's City Study Group. &quot;We
don't take political initiatives. We can call on a lot of different brains.
But what the shadow cabinet does with our work is their business.&quot;
The LFIG's City Study Group is working on four topics: reform of UK banking,
funding for industry, insider dealing and financial regulation. <BR>
<BR>
Mads Andenas, director of the centre of European law at King's College,
London, heads the group looking at alternative regulatory structures. &quot;The
only starting point we have,&quot; says Andenas, &quot;is that the present
system is unsatisfactory.&quot; But there is some urgency. This group had
its first meeting in February and is expected to produce some guidelines
by May at the latest. Andenas emphasizes the group's job is not to set policy,
but to explore two main themes. The first is better coordination of regulation,
trying to answer the question: &quot;Do you need a coordinated central regulator,
or is it possible to get free-standing independent regulators to coordinate?&quot;
Andenas points out that the SIB, as mentioned in a report by its chairman,
Sir Andrew Large, has strict disciplinary powers which so far &quot;it just
hasn't used&quot;. The second quest: can Labour come up with a structure
for financial regulation that distinguishes it from what the Conservatives
might do? <BR>
<BR>
The existence of this LFIG group, and its blank sheet of paper, suggests
Labour doesn't yet have a blueprint for regulation, even in the recesses
of the shadow cabinet. Darling insists that getting the philosophy of regulation
right is more important, but less newsworthy, than imposing new structures.
The broad philosophy is that there should be a guard against systemic risk,
and consumer protection, with sharp enough teeth to be effective, but a
minimum of red tape, to avoid distorting the market. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A generalized approach won't do, because we're dealing with several
different [financial] industries,&quot; says Darling. Labour doesn't regard
the sector as a &quot;greenfield site - that would be costly and damaging&quot;,
he says. Nor does it fancy imitating a foreign structure, such as the US
Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC): &quot;I'm not keen on the SEC's
excessively legalistic nature.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Revamping financial regulation is not Labour's top priority. The party may
recommend changes in codes of practice even before the election, but any
reform of the law - the Companies Act or Financial Services Act - is unlikely
to be tackled before the second session of a Labour-controlled parliament,
in October 1998, says corporate affairs spokesman Bell. That leaves plenty
of time to get lobbying if you haven't already. <BR>
<BR>
<B>City supporters club</B> <BR>
<BR>
Access to top Labour politicians has become harder as their chances of forming
the next government have increased. A handful of advisers and known Labour
sympathizers can provide access to their thinking, if not to them. Derek
Scott, economics director at BZW, works two days a week as economic adviser
to Tony Blair. Peter Fanning, structured-debt expert at NatWest, is on secondment
to shadow chief secretary to the treasury Andrew Smith; former <I>Financial
Times</I> leader writer Ed Balls works with Gordon Brown. Left-leaning city
economists include Gavyn Davies at Goldman Sachs, Neil McKinnon at Citibank
and Gerry Holtham, formerly with Lehman Brothers, now director of the IPPR.
<BR>
<BR>
There are also well-known City figures who have long been in the Labour
camp - Lord (Clive) Hollick, group managing director of media and financial
services group MAI, Lord (Simon) Haskel chairman of the Perrott Group, and
Jonathan Charkham, a director of Great Universal Stores. <BR>
<BR>
Then there are the armies of consultants and political lobbyists, some of
whom have hastily changed their political complexion or hired people with
Labour Party credentials. Some consultancies which always had good Labour
connections are now heavily in demand: Richard Faulkner, three times a Labour
parliamentary candidate, at Westminster Communications; Tony Page at GJW
Government Relations; and David Pitt-Watson, of Braxton Associates, who
is deputy chairman at LFIG. <BR>
<BR>
There are also the many sympathizers in the City who would like to have
some input, but haven't, because of possible career repercussions, or because
they haven't been asked. Terry Smith of stockbrokers Collins Stewart, whose
1992 book <I>Accounting for Growth</I> terminally irritated his then employer
UBS Philips &amp; Drew, received some calls from Gordon Brown's office,
but they weren't followed up. &quot;I'd like to help whoever I think is
doing the right thing,&quot; says Smith, who is politically neutral. &quot;Without
being unkind, I think Alistair Darling's utterances on the City are incredibly
naive. Some of the stuff I got [in my book] would have been a huge stick
to beat people with.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Labour has lacked a dialogue with more neutral figures and those prepared
to argue with them or play devil's advocate. &quot;Off the record, they're
bloody useless at it,&quot; says a Labour-supporting industrialist. &quot;They
waste their time listening to millionaire socialists from Hampstead, they're
too deferential in their approach to the CBI and too apprehensive about
financial London. The LFIG are dull and unimaginative - hardly freethinkers.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
As the shadow cabinet and its machinery get closer to an election and the
scent of victory, rivalries are emerging, confides an MP near to the action.
Would-be ministers are mapping out their careers, already keen to put their
stamp on this or that policy, sometimes to the detriment of better teamwork.
In the offices at 7 Millbank, a stone's throw from the Palace of Westminster,
there is an almost tangible hunger for power after 17 years in the wilderness.
<BR>
<BR>
For some observers this is reassuring. They would like to see some stronger
personalities emerge from Blair's dream team, which under present heavily
managed conditions come across as a bunch of Blair clones. <BR>
<BR>
The danger is that debate on policy issues will be as limited among pre-election
Labourites as it is among the lame-duck Tories. Roger Berry, Labour MP for
Kingswood, claims this isn't so. In November he published a Fabian Society
tract called <I>Against a Single Currency</I>, while his colleague Keith
Hill wrote a second Fabian pamphlet, <I>For a Single Currency</I>. Says
Berry: &quot;My pamphlet fits into Labour doctrine, so does Keith's. It's
not a matter of principle, but whether the economic benefits outweigh the
costs.&quot; Although there are Eurosceptics in the parliamentary Labour
Party, &quot;there's a clear overwhelming majority who are for Europe&quot;,
says Berry. Mark Hendrick, a Labour member of the European parliament, contrasts
this relaxed situation - &quot;We have cracks&quot; - with that of the Conservative
party - &quot;they have fault-lines&quot;. Since Labour's leading Eurosceptic,
Bryan Gould, left for an academic post in New Zealand, the danger of a party
split on Europe has receded, says a Labour supporter in the City. <BR>
<BR>
But New Labour's ability to unite its party on such issues as a sensible
level for a minimum wage (to which it is committed), the application of
the Maastricht Treaty's social chapter, corporate and personal taxation,
and a policy on monopolies and mergers, will be the test of its friendly
overtures to business. The mergers and acquisitions fraternity are taking
no chances and are getting in the big deals before a change of regime. &quot;In
this sense the threat of a Labour government has helped the market,&quot;
says an investment banker. <BR>
<BR>
City analysts fear that the bigger Labour's majority in the House of Commons,
the more difficulty Blair will have in containing the left wing of his party.
&quot;We'd be more comfortable with a 20 or 30 majority,&quot; says Philip
Isherwood, UK strategist at Kleinwort Benson. &quot;With a large one of
say 100, the paybacks would start.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Blair's colleagues insist he is looking beyond a single victory to two or
three five-year terms in office. There is no rush to secure fair-weather
votes and no promise to change things from day one. For the financial sector,
Labour's plans are still fluid. And this coincides with a rethink worldwide
about the function of markets, the effectiveness of various financial models
- such as the German and the Japanese - and the best principles of corporate
governance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Recasting market philosophy</B> <BR>
<BR>
This is a reaction to the apparent failure of free-market economics to maintain
growth, employment and reinvestment at satisfactory levels through the business
cycle. Intervention by government or government agencies is out of fashion
across all major western political parties, but not only socialists are
looking for a change in the way business is financed. This may not be a
question of legislation. Too little is known about the effect of volatility
and short-termism on the fortunes of corporations. The longer-term German
and Japanese house-bank models, championed in the past, have recently taken
a battering. <BR>
<BR>
Labour, having discarded the baggage of Clause Four and much of the trade
unionist clap-trap of the last generation, is in a position to recast its
philosophy of markets from the basic elements - saving habits, views of
return on capital, regulation, market practice and long-term concerns such
as acceptable levels of employment, taxation, investment, education and
growth. <BR>
<BR>
Blair in January drew attention to his concept of a stakeholder society.
It seems this was little more than a signpost, deliberately pointing several
ways, neither rejecting free markets - and the concept of maximizing shareholder
value - nor wholly embracing them. &quot;I think it's an attitude of mind,
rather than a set of policies,&quot; says Richard Faulkner of lobbyists
Westminster Communications. &quot;Tony [Blair] means giving people opportunities,&quot;
says a shadow cabinet adviser, &quot;not red tape or legislation.&quot;
Bob Bischof, German-born chairman of UK moving-equipment maker Boss Group
sees virtue in a model based more on codetermination and a close relationship
with banks - one of his first moves, after taking over the British firm,
was to sack his clearing bank (because of its attitude to a company faced
with insolvency) and sign up with three German banks. &quot;The stakeholder
model has served Germany very well,&quot; says Bischof. &quot;But every
system degenerates. With Teutonic efficiency the red tape has started to
surround the model. Nevertheless it's the right one for the 21st century.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Others don't feel so comfortable about implications of the stakeholder concept.
&quot;The term is either meaningless or dangerous,&quot; says Tim Melville-Ross,
director-general of the Institute of Directors. &quot;If it means doing
no more than the best-run companies do already, that's fine. If it means
legislation, and that companies are obliged to be accountable to many interests,
then it's bad news. The joint-stock company is a clear and sharp way of
running an organization.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Labour is reluctant to commit itself while the debate on corporate governance
and short-termism is so hot and various studies are still in progress. Some
have already appeared: an LFIG study on corporate governance completed last
October; a paper by the Confederation of British Industry on short-termism;
a campaign by the Royal Society of Arts, <I>Tomorrow's Company</I>, on what
the best of British companies should aim for. The IPPR is about to publish
the results of a commission on public policy and British business. It recently
released some of the papers, on short-termism, insider-dealing and the like,
submitted to the commission by economists and leading businessmen. Most
of all, Labour is waiting for the findings of the committee on corporate
governance chaired by ICI chairman Sir Ronald Hampel - successor to the
Cadbury committee and likewise sponsored by the London Stock Exchange and
the accountancy profession - which is due to report by the end of 1997.
<BR>
<BR>
It seems that Labour might ride into office on a wave of new economic fashion,
just as Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives coincided with a fashion
for hard-nosed Chicago School economics. New Labour's would be a more soft-nosed,
European style, with an emphasis on wider employment - without which neither
Labour, nor perhaps any other government, will commit to European economic
and monetary union. <BR>
<BR>
And in the next few months Labour will be forced to spell out more than
just generalizations on policy. Cynics believe it will then show itself
in something closer to its true colours. <BR>
<BR>
But Bischof of Boss puts the Labour phenomenon in a European perspective:
&quot;Labour now shows an amazing willingness to work,&quot; he says. &quot;They've
changed practically beyond recognition. In England, everything tends to
become a political football. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In Germany, new things and fundamental things are always carried by
all parties. Moreover, the social-market economy was invented by the [right-of-centre]
Christian Democratic Union - they're just to the left of Labour. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's why I don't have any problem talking to people in Labour about
business and economics.&quot; n <BR>

<H3>Through a glass darkly </H3>
<B>Alistair Darling, Labour's spokesman on the City, insists that the rejuvenated
Labour Party is planning reform of <BR>
financial regulation, without a hidden socialist agenda. But does the party
have any agenda at all? David Shirreff asks the questions</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are you getting good non-partisan advice?</B> <BR>
<BR>
They come to us all the time - people who wouldn't vote Labour in a month
of Sundays. It's valuable to get advice from somebody who doesn't like you
- in terms of your politics, not personally - because he's highly likely
to be helpful. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How much influence does this advice have?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We have no interest in marching forward with a policy that just isn't going
to work. At the end of the day we may have to disagree and say well this
is the direction we're going - but if it's flawed or it has an unintended
consequence, I'd rather know now than later. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you plan to take supervision out of the Bank of England?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Nobody is suggesting, at the moment, that we're going to take it away from
the bank. We are looking at it. We need to reduce the number of regulators
and to simplify the structure. We've said we think the SIB [Securities &amp;
Investments Board] should be directly responsible for regulation, and it's
not clear if there's any merit in maintaining this contractual relationship
between the SIB and its executive agencies, the SROs [self-regulatory organizations].
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Won't you lose the benefit of practitioners <BR>
participating in supervision?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We're not talking about direct regulation from the government. We want to
keep people in the industry as part of the regulatory process. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Would you foresee a kind of Securities &amp; Exchange Commission?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The SEC is an American creation for the American market and we are not importing
it. The important thing is to make sure there is one lead regulator. It's
disastrous if everybody thinks somebody else is looking at it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Would you say that's happening at the moment?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Yes. It's perfectly obvious from Barings it was happening. The board of
banking supervision identified that. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Isn't that more a problem of cooperation between regulators here and
regulators abroad?</B> <BR>
<BR>
That's a separate problem. The need to get greater international cooperation
is something of increasing urgency. There's an added problem because you've
got markets in competition with each other, where the regulator has one
eye on transgressions in the market and another eye on the competition.
That's a completely different commercial problem. <BR>
<BR>
<B>You have a study group on insider dealing. What's the worry there? That
the law isn't good enough?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Well, our laws don't work. Nobody's going to tell me that there are only
50 suspected cases of insider dealing in the last 15 years. Nobody believes
that. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you mean that you can't get convictions?</B> <BR>
<BR>
One of the things we're looking at is giving power to deal with insider
dealing to the regulatory regime, to the SIB, and my own belief is that,
if people thought it was likely they'd be caught, they'd stop doing it.
The more open companies are, the less problem there is. I think that the
analyst's lunch and the business lunch are an invitation to insider dealing.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you have a policy on short-termism?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Economic stability in every sense is very important, nearly everybody will
tell you that you can do all sorts of things you want but for goodness sake
have a level economic horizon so we can plan eight years ahead. The question
is can we do something more than that through the fiscal system? Make it
more likely that people would hold on to investments longer-term. We have
no conclusive view on that. What you're after is a change of culture and
if you look at Hermes [the Post Office pension fund], if you look at other
investors they are beginning to change and say &quot;OK, this is what we
want this year, but what do we want in five or 10 years' time&quot;. My
guess is that that cultural change will spread. These things come in waves.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Can the government enforce such a change?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Of course a government very much colours the whole culture of the country,
especially when you're a very strong government. Mrs Thatcher dominated
the political scene in the 1980s. But governments can't do these things
in isolation; there's got to be an underlying mood. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are you afraid of alienating the City?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I'd only be afraid of something if I thought it was going to happen. The
City isn't a uniform, homogeneous entity, it's lots of different industries,
with many different views; some firms trade in this country; some are here
but trade elsewhere, and so on. Business generally - and the City is no
exception - doesn't like change. Businesses can operate in any environment
in the world; they can operate in a dictatorship, in a democracy; they can
operate with a government that's left-wing, right-wing, or has bits in between,
as long as they know roughly what it's going to do. Consequently I'm not
afraid of the City at all. For the last four or five years, we haven't been
wooing or courting these people: we've been explaining what our policy is.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>You seem to be very shy of publishing your <BR>
policies.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The experience in the last few years is that politicians who make promises
they can't keep will live to regret it - such as &quot;we will reduce taxes
year-on-year, we'll not include VAT [value-added tax]&quot; - you have to
be very careful about that. If you look when there have been sea changes
in politics, in '64, '79, '96 or '97 - people aren't looking for chapter
and verse. <BR>
<BR>
<B>People are worried about your plans for <BR>
utilities.</B> <BR>
<BR>
We still have to sort out - and the government's not near this at all -
the appropriate regulatory framework for utilities, where you have a monopoly
and the market is not going to provide the competition that you ideally
want. I see no sign of it happening in the privatized utilities. <BR>
<BR>
<B>You think all it needs is regulation?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I think you need a proper regulatory regime. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Would you renationalize any of the utilities?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We're certainly not going to spend money buying one back. There are a hundred
and one things I might want to spend money on but going to Lord Hanson wanting
to buy back [electricity distributor] Eastern isn't one of them. <BR>
<BR>
<B>So you don't think there's a case for renationalizing any of the industries?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The only one - and I don't think it will be sold off in the first place
- is the railways, and even so, if a franchise has been let, we've said
no-one should be in any doubt that it will run its course. But it's not
going to continue. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What about your threatened windfall tax?</B> <BR>
<BR>
You have the absurd situation where you've got a huge amount of cash being
generated by these companies, through their monopoly position, which is
being used to fight takeovers and the rest of it. (Americans are trying
to buy into this industry because the cashflows aren't so tightly controlled.)
And you've got the huge drag of unemployment. We think it would be far better
to use the windfall tax to get people out of unemployment. It seems to me
to be common sense. <BR>
<BR>
<B>It isn't something you'd make a habit of?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Thatcher government put a windfall tax on banks in 1981. But a windfall
is a windfall. <BR>
<BR>
<B>There has been talk of a development bank. Is that still a live issue?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I think at the last election we said we would set up a national investment
bank or something - we're not going to do that. At the moment we're committed
to setting up regional development agencies, which would bring together
private-sector money and maybe a bit of public-sector money. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Could you see pensions invested in something like Singapore's Central
Providence Fund?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Singapore is very interesting to go and see, but we're not going to buy
somebody else's solution off the shelf. Singapore's compulsory savings scheme
is also tied up with housing finance, which ours wouldn't be. Even if there
was such a thing I think there would be an even greater need for independent
financial advice (IFA). I've said on many occasions that the IFA sector
is very important. Indeed I'd hate to get to a situation where only providers
give advice, because they would advise you to take their product. And that
would apply as much to the state as it would to the private sector. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What do you understand by the term &quot;stakeholder society&quot;?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Stakeholding in crude terms means ensuring, generally, that everyone has
a stake in society: they have the opportunity to work, the opportunity to
educate themselves, and so on. What we're talking about is a change of culture.
People, whether they work on the shop floor or in the boardroom, all feel
committed and a part of the enterprise, and they know that if they have
increased effort they'll get an appropriate reward. The culture of &quot;them
and us&quot;, which is the traditional British approach, has got to end.
Now many successful companies are beginning to do that, so there are some
very helpful signs of that sort of change. <BR>
<BR>
<B>I've heard concerns that, under Labour, companies won't be run for the
benefit of the shareholders.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Who's suggesting that? Will Hutton?* He's not the Labour Party. I do wish
these people would listen to what we say rather than believe what Dr Mawhinney
[Conservative party chairman] has got to say. That maybe tells you something
about where their prejudices come from. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Is Will Hutton's book damaging to the image of New Labour?</B> <BR>
<BR>
No. It's a very good book. It stimulates a lot of thought. But for heaven's
sake it doesn't mean we agree. It's not a manifesto. Will Hutton's analysis
in many cases is right. It's where it gets to the &quot;Thus it can be seen&quot;
bit that I think we part company - like controlling dividends and things
like that. Also, having been to Japan, I don't quite share his optimism
about the Japanese economy. It's a good book and he's a very thoughtful,
nice man, but he's not a politician, he's a journalist, an author - and
he doesn't pretend to be a politician. It's like us quoting Hayek at the
Tories and saying &quot;Ah there you are, it's all written down there&quot;:
they could say with some justification that he didn't write the last Tory
manifesto, even though he might have had some influence on it indirectly.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you have much faith in European economic and monetary union?</B> <BR>
<BR>
My guess is that people will continue to travel along the road, but I think
they'll accept that the time to decide is when we have sustainable convergence.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Aren't the Maastricht criteria rather arbitrary?</B> <BR>
<BR>
If you look again at what they say, the convergence criteria are rather
wider than one might think. This is not a mechanical question. It's deeply
political as well as being deeply economic. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Isn't labour mobility the problem for Europe?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Yes, labour mobility is a problem. But let's just accept it's a problem
and let's deal with that reality rather than say &quot;to hell with it,
you'll get it sooner or later&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Isn't the Labour Party split on Europe?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Not in the party leadership, no. There are varying degrees of enthusiasm,
but there isn't the equivalent of [Conservative Euro-sceptics Michael] Portillo,
or [Peter] Lilley, or anything like that. On our side, it's not a false
unity at all. People are generally happy with the direction we're going.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>I've seen two Fabian documents written by Labour MPs, one for monetary
union, the other against.</B> <BR>
<BR>
One of Mrs Thatcher's undoubted contributions to this country was that she
stifled debate. If you weren't on her side you were wrong and anything you
said was to be shot down. It's healthy that people should think about these
things. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Under what conditions would you re-enter Europe's exchange rate mechanism
(ERM)?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We have no plans to enter the ERM. No-one, but no-one, is suggesting that
we do. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Technically, in the run-up to monetary union you would have to be in
the ERM for two years.</B> <BR>
<BR>
I believe so, yes. But no-one is suggesting it. The ERM as we knew it certainly
doesn't exist. I think it's like many other of these things, it's parked
on a siding at the moment and nobody is in any great hurry to get it back
out.

<H3>UNITED KINGDOM</H3> 
<H2>Britain's finished revolution </H2>
<H4>Institutional investors loved privatization in the 1980s when the UK
government sold off sleepily run companies with undervalued assets such
as Cable &amp; Wireless and Associated British Ports. They are less interested
in highly regulated utilities with heavy long-term investment plans - all
that's on offer these days. As the government struggles to whip up enthusiasm
for this year's disposal candidates, Railtrack and British Energy, Jonathan
Ford looks at the end of the City's love affair with privatization </H4>
It is indicative of the downbeat mood in which the government and its advisers
are approaching this May's privatization of UK railway operator Railtrack
that no high-profile public relations campaign is planned to market the
issue to private investors. &quot;Four years ago we might have promoted
it as a symbol of the renaissance of the railway, but there is not much
appetite for that now,&quot; admits David Freud, managing director of the
sale coordinator, SBC Warburg. &quot;It will be a pragmatic, practical campaign
emphasizing the company's role in the railway network, the reliability of
its earnings and the share value.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To a generation of popular capitalists reared on the hysteria surrounding
Sid and Frankenstein's monster (the advertising creations which promoted
the share sales of British Gas and the electricity companies when they were
privatized respectively), this seems like pretty dry stuff, hardly designed
to provoke a flood of applications from Joe Public. Railtrack's public relations
consultants Dewe Rogerson may insist that Sid and his like have been ditched
because of the growing sophistication of private investors in the 1990s,
but it's hard to escape the conclusion that this new sober approach represents
a response to the British public's increasing disenchantment with the concept
of privatization as a whole. <BR>
<BR>
Professor Colin Robinson, a director of the economic think-tank which provided
much of the early intellectual ammunition for privatization, the Institute
of Economic Affairs (IEA) believes that after this year's two major privatization
offerings - Railtrack's in May and nuclear power generator British Energy's
later in the year - the UK's privatization programme will grind to a halt
unmourned, the victim of growing public hostility. &quot;For the time being,
it looks as if privatization in Britain may well have run its course,&quot;
he says gloomily. <BR>
<BR>
Robinson attributes the unpopularity of privatization to the government's
failure to introduce competition when privatizing previously monopolistic
state-owned sectors. &quot;The government has talked a great deal about
its enthusiasm for introducing competition, the benefits to consumers and
the economy, and so on,&quot; he says, &quot;but it hasn't proved to be
very keen on actually doing so. Raising money has always come first.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>A privatization too far?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Regulation - the government's preferred alternative to liberalizing markets
- is now seen as a failure and in need of urgent reform. Critics point out
that its faults have been illuminated by the recent wave of bids for electricity
and water companies, which revealed unsuspected profitability and well-padded
balance sheets. <BR>
<BR>
If regulatory failure has made privatization a dirty word with the general
public, how has this affected the attitude of institutional investors to
the government's disposal programme and, in particular, to Railtrack's and
British Energy's offerings? After all, institutional money is the engine
driving privatization. Institutions price the deals and without their support
privatizations can't happen. <BR>
<BR>
Although institutional investors agree that the national mood has swung
heavily against further sales, with the forthcoming flotation of Railtrack
attracting particular criticism, most are surprisingly sanguine about public
opinion. &quot;I think if you look back over the history of the UK privatization
programme, you'll find that with every major privatization, public opinion
was against. Everyone said: 'It's a privatization too far',&quot; says Alastair
Ross Goobey, chief executive of fund management company Hermes. &quot;And
in most cases, once the companies had been sold off and turned out to work
rather better in the private sector, all these objections were forgotten.
After all, who now says that British Telecom should be run by the state?
Would anyone really want to return to the system we had when it was run
by the GPO[general post office]?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Railway privatization demonstrates many of the problems the government faces
in drumming up enthusiasm. Railtrack's proposed flotation is merely the
final stage in the complex two-year restructuring exercise required to prepare
the vast old inefficient state railway corporation British Rail for sale.
The purpose of this process, according to one banker, was to carve up a
loss-making monolith into &quot;bite-sized chunks&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Many fund managers profess to be baffled by the industry structure which
has emerged from the restructuring, whose byzantine complexity has already
attracted much derisive comment. <BR>
<BR>
At its centre is Railtrack, the only successor company to British Rail which
will be floated. Railtrack owns the rail network, including 16,000 kilometres
(10,000 miles) of track, 2,500 stations, 90,000 bridges and 980 tunnels.
Its income, &#163;2.3 billion last year, comes mainly from the access charges
it levies on the 25 train operating companies (TOCs) and three freight companies
the government has established with the intention that they will be run
by private-sector operators on seven-year franchises. <BR>
<BR>
These franchisees will be subsidized by the state to the tune of at least
&#163;700 million a year (most analysts believe the ultimate figure will
be nearer &#163;1 billion). Thus far, only three TOCs have been franchised,
and the programme has become enmeshed in a legal battle with a railway passenger
pressure group protesting against possible service cuts. <BR>
<BR>
Railtrack's principal operating expenditure will be on maintaining the network.
This it will not do directly, but through 13 specialist infrastructure maintenance
companies, which are currently being sold off to private-sector bidders,
principally construction and engineering groups. And then there is the rolling
stock, which will be owned by three rolling stock companies (Roscos). These
were sold at the end of last year, largely to management groups, for &#163;1.8
billion. <BR>
<BR>
And that's not all. To add an almost surreal touch of complexity, the Roscos
do not actually own the maintenance yards where their rolling stock is stored
and repaired. These are owned by the maintenance yard companies, which were
also recently sold. <BR>
<BR>
Curiously, this complicated structure does nothing to promote competition.
The TOCs, the key point at which money enters the system from ticket sales
and government subsidies, will effectively be mini-monopolies, having exclusive
access to their own franchised routes. As a consequence, the new system
will be heavily regulated. Roughly speaking, the franchise director regulates
the TOCs and the Office of the Rail Regulator regulates Railtrack. Most
observers agree that the structure finally adopted (which was always opposed
by British Rail's management) is a bureaucratic nightmare. Every train movement
requires a series of bargains to be struck between the train operator and
separate entities owning track, stations and rolling stock. The &quot;rent
book&quot; for the use of the Paddington terminus in London, for instance,
established as a consequence of the 1993 Railway Act, is reputedly the size
of a telephone directory. <BR>
<BR>
Potential investors are unimpressed. &quot;Looking at the way they've done
it,&quot; says one fund manager, &quot;with this split between trains and
track and Roscos and whatnot, you have to ask whether any structure this
complicated can be the right one. And all the problems it causes with consumers
- can they get through-tickets from one operator to another? You have to
say it just looks a God-damned mess. My reaction is to say: 'Why don't I
just buy GEC?' I don't have to buy Railtrack just because it's there.&quot;
Another potential investor - the head of UK institutional investment at
a major US investment bank - is more succinct. &quot;Personally, I wouldn't
touch it with a bargepole,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Aside from the arcane industry structure, investors advance several specific
reasons for steering clear of Railtrack which point to why the City of London
is wearying of privatization as a whole. The main one is the heavy level
of regulation. &quot;Investors don't really like regulated companies,&quot;
says one fund manager. &quot;Basically, we think that they're rather dull
investments, like they are in the US.&quot; He adds that, given the particular
nature of the railways (regarded by the public more as a social service
than a commercial entity), the rail regulators will be subject to strong
political pressure from consumers to squeeze investors' returns. &quot;There
probably isn't going to be any growth, because this privatization won't
change the economic case for railways versus roads as a method of transport.
And the companies are unlikely to have any flexibility in raising margins,
because there will be such a public hue and cry if prices go up. So the
only way profits can be increased is through efficiency gains, and those
are really one-off gains which should be achieved pretty quickly.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Another turn-off is Railtrack's heavy investment programme. In December,
the company announced that it intended to spend &#163;10 billion over the
next 10 years upgrading the network, a substantial increase on the &#163;6.2
billion investment plan it had previously been talking about. Investors
saw this as a politically motivated gesture - an attempt to persuade the
public of the benefits of privatization - rather than one driven by commercial
considerations. But the main worry is that, because Railtrack will be a
highly leveraged investment with limited growth potential and regulated
profits, in effect, shareholders will be getting bond-style returns but
equity risk. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Railtrack, like the electricity and water privatizations, can be viewed
almost as an infrastructure project,&quot; says one fund manager. &quot;The
government wants to privatize it so it can get all this infrastructure spending
off its balance sheet. That's the driving force behind privatization in
the UK these days.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The combination of regulated returns and infrastructure-project risk makes
Railtrack a particularly unattractive investment, this fund manager believes.
&quot;The experience of Eurotunnel has made investors very wary of these
sorts of companies,&quot; he says. &quot;Long-term projects are very sensitive
to the economic and market assumptions you have to make in order to value
them in the first place. If the assumptions change, even by small amounts,
the value of the company can be radically altered - generally downwards.&quot;
He recalls the series of prospectuses put out by Eurotunnel. &quot;Every
time Eurotunnel came to the market for more money, there was a great deal
of detailed valuation analysis put together by highly reputable investment
bankers. But each time - as things ultimately turned out - they were later
shown to have got it completely wrong.&quot; Having consumed &#163;2.5 billion
of equity holders' money over eight years, Eurotunnel is now technically
bust. The shareholders have effectively lost everything. <BR>
<BR>
Says a transport analyst with a major London-based brokerage: &quot;The
more government-controlled an investment is, the more shareholders view
it almost like a gilt-edged stock [a government security]. If you look at
it, Railtrack is going to be highly controlled by the government, both through
regulation and because of the high level of subsidy it will receive as a
proportion of its turnover. In the best case, you are getting a stream of
returns not that dissimilar to an investor in gilts. But clearly, you don't
have the security. Therefore, the problem is in pricing that risk correctly.
And it's not clear yet that the government has really perceived the risks
the private sector sees in these companies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen how the government and its advisers will deal with
these criticisms. Railtrack's capital structure is still being argued over,
particularly the question of how much of its &#163;1.7 billion of debt should
be written off by the government before flotation. The government has thus
far hinted that the maximum it is prepared to forgive is &#163;1 billion,
but investors believe there are practical reasons why it will probably end
up going further. <BR>
<BR>
In particular, these centre on the importance of Railtrack having a sufficiently
large market capitalization to enter the FT-SE 100 index (the index of the
largest stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange). &quot;The main institutional
buyers for this paper will be index-tracking funds. If Railtrack is included
in the FT-SE 100 Index, they will have to have a weighting in the stock
- so there's a clear incentive for the government to make sure it gets in,&quot;
says one analyst. <BR>
<BR>
For Railtrack to qualify, it would need to have a market capitalization
of around &#163;1.9 billion at flotation. And although the financial information
available on the company remains opaque, analysts believe that if it were
left with &#163;700 million of debt, this would give it a market capitalization
of only around &#163;1.5 billion, given the need to price it sufficiently
attractively for investors. No-one doubts that investors are going to demand
a pretty unexacting valuation. &quot;Utilities tend to be yield stocks,&quot;
says the investment head of a leading British insurance company, who notes
that given the risks involved, &quot;we will be looking for a significant
premium to the rest of the market&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Energy boost</B> <BR>
<BR>
All the signs are that this year's other major disposal candidate, nuclear
power generator British Energy, will prove no easier to sell. In order to
prepare it for flotation, the government has been forced to strip out all
the UK's older Magnox technology nuclear power stations which are at the
end of their working lives. These will be left in the hands of a new state-owned
entity, Magnox Electric, and will be decommissioned at the public expense.
British Energy will take charge of the UK's most modern nuclear plants -
seven advanced gas-cooled reactors which are mostly authorized to operate
until after 2010, and the Sizewell B pressurized water reactor opened last
year, which is due to operate until 2034. <BR>
<BR>
The estimated total &#163;6 billion cost of ultimately decommissioning British
Energy's stations - one of the major institutional bugbears - has been partly
neutralized as an issue by the establishment of a separate decommissioning
fund into which the company will make payments but which will be underwritten
by the state. No final decision has been taken, however, on the estimated
&#163;3 billion cost of processing spent fuel (half the overall &#163;6
billion figure) which is at present not covered by the fund. In recent evidence
to a select committee of parliament, John Reynolds, electricity analyst
at James Capel, warned that the financial risk relating to these waste-disposal
costs could seriously deter investors if they were to remain uncapped. And
a recent study, commissioned admittedly by confirmed opponents of nuclear
power, has warned that unless the state at least partly assumes them, British
Energy's equity could be valued at less than &#163;800 million rather than
the &#163;2.5 billion the government expects. <BR>
<BR>
Given that part of the government's case for selling British Energy in the
first place was to earmark the proceeds for the capitalization of the decommissioning
fund, clearly the financial logic behind its privatization is breaking down.
But because the driving force is to shift future infrastructure spending
into the private sector, everyone expects the government to cave in, largely
in order to ease British Energy's transition from state enterprise to listed
company. One could argue that as the government reaches the end of its privatization
programme, it is getting perilously close to paying private investors to
take businesses off its hands. <BR>
<BR>
Assuming the cave-in occurs, investors will be buying &quot;a punt on the
electricity pool price and the operating efficiency of the stations&quot;,
says Dieter Helm of Oxford-based economic consultancy Oxera. &quot;The nearest
equivalent to British Energy's situation,&quot; he argues, &quot;is the
contracts which have been let for managing prisons - it is an operating
vehicle with a cash stream.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although the efficiency of British Energy's stations is widely admired in
the nuclear industry, the economics of atomic power still militate against
its being a money-spinner for investors. Falling world gas prices mean that
competitors in the UK energy market can generate power profitably at 2p
per unit, while British Energy only goes into the black at 2.7p. Consequently,
it is liable to be the swing producer in the UK energy pool, called upon
to supply only at peak demand periods. Profitable base-load contracts will
be hard for the company to win, even though it is to be one of the UK's
three main power producers. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Little enthusiasm</B> <BR>
<BR>
Thus far, investors have shown little more enthusiasm for British Energy
than they have for Railtrack. They are perplexed by the evident artificiality
of the structure being privatized. For instance, because of the arbitrary
way in which the old nuclear power operators - Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear - were broken up, in certain cases there are older Magnox stations
on the same sites as those owned by British Energy, posing safety and decommissioning
risks. It is indicative of investors' lack of interest that since the announcement
of privatization the news that has been best received has been the company's
decision to abandon any further plans to build nuclear power stations in
the UK. &quot;It's good news because no-one wanted to buy into a company
investing &#163;10 billion-odd in nuclear technology,&quot; says an analyst,
&quot;but it does pose the question, who the hell is going to want to buy
a company with nil-growth prospects?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The company insists that its growth prospects are rather better than this
suggests. It is talking about building gas-powered stations and has also
raised the possibility of acquiring a regional electricity distribution
company. Neither of these ideas has met with an enthusiastic response from
potential investors. According to one electricity analyst: &quot;The first
job of [British Energy's] financial advisers will be to curtail expensive
talk of expansion into areas it knows little about. British Energy's first
task will be to sort out what it has got and cut costs to generate cash.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, given all the unanswered questions - British Energy's capital structure
has yet to be settled, as has the crucial issue of waste-disposal liabilities
- the company remains almost impossible to value. Most of the figures quoted
thus far have effectively been plucked out of the air. But even when the
financial structure is finally settled, analysts agree that it will be difficult
to place a price on what will be the world's sole pure nuclear energy play.
<BR>
<BR>
The main concerns expressed by institutional investors include safety and
regulatory risk. What happens if either the regulator or subsequent legislation
pushes up safety costs so as to make an already marginally profitable business
into a loss-maker? Accident risk, such as a disaster like that at Three
Mile Island, is seen as less of a worry, largely because most investors
consider the possibility pretty remote, and also because British Energy
plants are well insured against such eventualities. <BR>
<BR>
But there are more mundane worries about the underlying financial case for
nuclear power. Not only are the stations more expensive to run than conventionally-powered
ones, but a nuclear operator's cost of capital is also likely to be higher.
According to Mo Ying Seto, who covers nuclear utilities for Moody's Investor
Services in New York, nuclear utilities have lower credit ratings than non-nuclear
utilities - because of the higher risk factors such as safety - so they
suffer a financial handicap because this drives up funding costs. Potential
investors take such news stoically, but they warn that it will have an impact
on pricing when British Energy is sold. &quot;It's a very unusual industry,&quot;
says one. &quot;One of the biggest drawbacks to the nuclear sale is that
the business is difficult to understand. I don't like investing in an industry
where I don't understand how it works.&quot; For this reason, what may be
the UK's last major privatization is, by the most optimistic estimates,
likely to go for &#163;2.5 billion, only marginally more than the cost of
building its newest asset, the &#163;2.3 billion Sizewell B station. <BR>
<BR>
Whether it will be the last privatization is at least partly a political
question. Although the government insists that it has further plans, before
April 1997, at the latest, there will have to be a general election. If,
as many investors expect, this returns a Labour government, it is likely
to spell the end of the disposal programme. While investors probably won't
mourn its passing, feeling that there's nothing attractive left to sell,
many right-wing economists feel that if the Labour party takes power and
calls a halt to privatization, the revolution started by the Thatcher government
in 1979 will be abandoned unfinished. <BR>
<BR>
Madsden Pirie, president of economic think-tank the Adam Smith Institute
and one of the architects of the privatization pro-gramme, argues that further
work remains to be done: &quot;Privatization in this country has been an
evolutionary process. It's because of the experience built up over the past
15 years that we're now able to contemplate selling off the more difficult
sectors of the economy which were avoided in the early years.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>The road ahead</B> <BR>
<BR>
One bit of unfinished business he identifies is the privatization of the
road network. This, he suggests, would provide the UK with a &quot;unified
transport policy&quot;, something 50 years of state planning has failed
to deliver, and thus level the economic playing field between the use of
roads and railways as transport systems. &quot;The current situation doesn't
work,&quot; he says. &quot;At the moment the economic case is slanted towards
roads, because a railway user pays directly both for his journey and the
infrastructure, whereas a road user pays only for the cost of his journey.
All this means is that everyone uses a car and the roads get congested.
The government tried to solve the problem by building more roads, but this
didn't work and just added hugely to the infrastructure bill. The case for
roads privatization, with tolls being charged by private-sector operators,
is unanswerable.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But such arguments, despite their apparent logic, leave investors cold.
&quot;Who'd want to own the roads?&quot; asks one fund manager. &quot;You
would never be allowed to make more than a minimal return by the government,
and you would be crucified by the public every time you had to dig one of
them up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Investors are equally unimpressed by the visionary schemes of Robinson at
the IEA. He argues that the key objective for future privatization is for
the government to transfer its infrastructure budget to the private sector.
&quot;Why does the state need to own the assets it uses?&quot; he asks.
&quot;Why does the state need to own roads or hospitals?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Investors tend to think, however, that privatization has reached its limits.
&quot;The best privatizations the government did were in the early years,
when they were selling companies like Jaguar and Cable &amp; Wireless,&quot;
says one fund manager. &quot;In those days, no-one really knew how to price
privatizations, so there was always something to go for. And everyone understood
what these companies did and how they would work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This, he feels, is no longer the case. &quot;You could say that the government
has tried to push privatization too far into new areas without having the
right structure. The regulatory system hasn't really worked. And anyway,
there's only a limited appetite for regulated stocks in this country - and
I think that limit has now been reached.&quot; <BR><BR><BR>
<H3>Lucrative franchises </H3>
The structure of British rail privatization is horrendously complicated.
Even bidders for franchises frequently fail to understand its intricacies.
But the rewards for successful franchisees look set to be enormous. <BR>
<BR>
British Rail (BR) has always needed government subsidy and always will.
After privatization, however, BR as it is known today won't exist. The subsidy
which used to go to BR now goes to the franchising director, Roger Salmon.
He then distributes it among the 25 private-sector train operating companies
(TOCs) which run different sections of the passenger rail network. The TOCs
have two major sources of revenue - the subsidy and ticket sales. Most of
this revenue then goes on their two fixed costs: the cost of leasing the
trains and Railtrack access charges. <BR>
<BR>
Franchisees take over the TOCs from public ownership for periods of seven,
10 or 15 years. The franchise agreements set out the minimum service levels
they must provide, the maximum prices they can charge on certain fares and
the amount of money they will need to pay the Roscos and Railtrack. Their
room for manoeuvre is thus limited. The only ways they can increase profits
are by increasing uncapped fares, decreasing operating expenses (staff and
station costs) and increasing the number of passengers. These costs, too,
are to a great extent fixed. So passenger rail franchising looks rather
more like subcontracting than classical privatization. <BR>
<BR>
Either way, it is set to be very lucrative for franchisees. Profits are
very highly geared. The TOCs are sold, with no equity and no debt, for &#163;1
each. The franchising director sets a minimum capital requirement for each
franchise of about 15% of revenues. Half of this is in the form of a performance
bond, guaranteed by a bank, in favour of the franchise director. The other
half has to be available to be paid in by the franchise winner, should the
need arise. The amount of this capital which is called at the beginning
of the franchise ranges from zero to about one third. <BR>
<BR>
It is not entirely a free lunch for franchisees. The bidding process is
highly competitive and there are some risks. Much of the revenue to franchisees
depends on circumstances outside their control - local employment levels
and national GDP growth. It is even likely that one or two of the franchisees
will find that they cannot survive on the level of subsidy for which they
have bid. In that situation, they forfeit their guarantees. The franchise
director then has to decide whether to give them more subsidy or give the
higher subsidy to a rival company. It is very unlikely that the guarantees
will cover the extra amount of subsidy needed. So why are the franchise
winners not asked to put in more capital? <BR>
<BR>
The answer lies not in the economics but in the vexed politics of rail privatization.
In order to get the rail privatization bill through parliament, the government
had to promise to instruct the franchise director to give preference to
management buy-outs (MBOs). The TOCs have no assets to place against bank
guarantees. Capital for the MBOs' guarantees is mezzanine at best and very
expensive. &quot;The bond is the killer,&quot; says one bidder from a company
with a rather lower credit rating than Stagecoach, the first franchise winner.
MBOs have to find their money from venture-capital companies, and venture-capital
companies want venture-capital returns - in the order of 40%. If the bond
were set much higher than it is, no MBOs could afford to bid. <BR>
<BR>
Bus company Stagecoach won the franchise for South West Trains. Stagecoach
is a rich company and got its bank guarantee from the Royal Bank of Scotland
without too much difficulty. The company itself provided the rest of the
guarantee. Paid-in capital in the new company, Stagecoach South West Trains,
remains very low. It is set to receive steady passenger revenues and subsidy.
As soon as it makes any profit, both return on capital and return on investment
are going to be enormous. Any efficiency savings it makes are very highly
geared. Its forecasts for the first three years of the franchise show a
pre-tax profit, after restructuring costs, of &#163;1 million or 0.2% of
revenue in year one, rising to &#163;12 million (4.1%) in year two and &#163;23
million (7.4%) in year three. And all achievable without any investment.
<BR>
<BR>
Richard Hannah, an analyst at UBS who advised Stagecoach on its bid, points
out that &quot;the franchises are massive cash producers&quot;. There is
very little incentive to reinvest any of the profits in the franchise: it's
generating more than enough itself. What's more, Stagecoach's downside is
strictly limited to the &#163;42 million of guarantees it has provided.
<BR>
<BR>
A secondary market in awarded rail franchises may well spring up. Potential
bidders, attempting to value a franchise, will find that its equity behaves
more like a volatile bond than conventional share capital. Eventually, the
TOC has to be handed back to the government in much the same state as it
was sold - with no debt and no share capital. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, a franchise's price derives from the net present value of the
dividend stream, plus any remaining paid-in capital due to be returned to
the franchise winner at the end of the franchise period. Chances are that
neither the franchise director nor the rail regulator will block acquisitions,
unless they clearly decrease competition on a given route. That would be
rare as most are being privatized as monopolies and share very little track
with another TOC. <BR>
<BR>
For most franchise operators, the future looks rosy. Expect headlines in
the next few years screaming about the huge sums former managers are making
out of privatization. <B>Mark Piper </B>

<H3>THAILAND</H3>



<H2> <B>Foul play on the fairway</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Self-taught M&amp;A expert
Rakesh Saxena teed off a glittering career on Bangkok's exclusive Navatanee golf
course. But he eventually helped drive Bangkok Bank of Commerce into the rough
with a bunch of allegedly dubious deals. Five of Saxena's Thai associates are due
to be tried for embezzlement and the Bank of Thailand is now trying to rescue
BBC. Saxena made it away to Vancouver, where he awaits extradition proceedings.
Meanwhile, he protests his innocence and hones his golf skills. Gill Maitland
reports</B> </H4> 

<P> The diminutive Indian whacked the ball hard and watched it
disappear into the rough. After four months stuck in Vancouver his handicap was
down to 18 and the course was getting a little too familiar. His hands were cold
and he yearned to be back with his businessman and financier friends on the
Navatanee course in Bangkok. Alas, the Canadian authorities had seized his
passport &#173; and they weren't planning to give it back in a hurry. Reflecting
on happier days, Rakesh Saxena sat at the 19th hole and dreamed of the days when
a round of golf with the right people could mean the start of another lucrative
takeover deal for him to get his teeth into.

<P> It was at just such a game eight years ago that he first met Krirkkiat
Jalichandra, then a cut-and-thrust financier who promised to fix up Saxena with a
job at his bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC). The name reverberated around
Saxena's head. It was the lucky break that had given him the chance to put
together deals that would make him a household name in Thailand, as familiar to
stock-watching taxi drivers as to the prime minister.

<P> His current notoriety was not quite what he had in mind. He languishes in
Vancouver on C$1.25 million bail pending extradition proceedings on charges of
embezzling Bt1.6 billion ($63.3 million). He whiles away his time playing golf
and the foreign exchange markets, watched over by bodyguards &#173; you can't be
too careful when everyone in Thailand knows someone, who knows someone, who can
hire a gunman on a motorbike for a few thousand baht.

<P> Back in 1985, Krirkkiat was sent into the ailing BBC by the Bank of Thailand
(BOT) with a brief to sort it out after it had run into problems with bad debts
following an economic crisis that forced the government to devalue the baht and
restrict growth in bank lending to 18% a year. BBC had a reputation for
conservatism, but Krirkkiat took a more aggressive approach. His appointment was
doubly pertinent as he was already at the central bank, working his way up to be
chief of the financial institutions supervision and examination department. His
family were major shareholders in BBC, which was then chaired by his uncle, the
late Mom Rachawongse Kukrit Pramoj &#173; one of Thailand's most respected elder
statesmen.

<P> Building a business relationship with Saxena was to enable Krirkkiat to put
his bank at the forefront of Thailand's mergers and acquisitions scene and pull
it back from the brink of obscurity. Unfortunately, things got out of hand.
Saxena had come to Thailand a few years before, having married a Thai-Chinese
woman he had met while in Hong Kong. He began offering his treasury services to
Bangkok financial institutions &#173; among the takers were Chase Manhattan,
Citibank, Thai Farmers Bank and Thai Financial Syndicate, where he is reputed to
have first met Ekachai Athikomnanda, later to become senior executive
vice-president of BBC. Saxena also wrote a personal finance column for the
<I>Bangkok Post</I>. He was soon moving in influential circles, playing golf at
the prestigious Navatanee club. which was frequented by the country's top bankers
as well as senior military officers.

<P> Saxena's talent for cutting a deal, even on the golf course, meant he was
soon a well-known figure about town and his persuasive manner helped him put
together a series of M&amp;A deals. "He was a born deal-maker," recalls a close
friend. "Money was secondary. Doing the deal was what counted &#173; much more
the honour." He had apparently no formal training in finance, having been
educated in Delhi before taking a master's degree in literature at Cambridge.
"The finance was picked up along the way. He's got a fantastic memory and he's
very good with figures," said the friend.

<P> Within a few years BBC, spurred on by the Saxena deal-making machine, was
making innovative acquisitions accounting for around half the takeovers in the
country by number. Doing the deals had a certain attraction of its own, which,
some would argue, masked more realistic assessments of their viability. There was
big money, big names &#173; Saudi arms dealer and businessman Adnan Khashoggi
invested in many of Saxena's deals &#173; and there was also the novelty factor
in a country where M&amp;A was not that common.

<P> How Khashoggi came to be involved with Saxena is shrouded in mystery and
could not be explained even by those who knew him well in Thailand. It appears,
however, that BBC lent Khashoggi money to make the takeovers. In January the
Saudi tycoon bought 10% of Jalaprathan Cement, a company listed on the Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET), while Saxena bought 12.2% and other companies 17%.
Khashoggi originally took a 22% interest in that company in 1994 as part of a Bt4
billion spending spree on three listed Thai companies, masterminded by Saxena. On
that occasion Khashoggi roped in Prince Nawaf, the brother of Saudi's King
Faisal, as an equal partner in the Jalaprathan investment. The identity of the
investors was all the more remarkable in the light of the simmering unease
between Thailand and Saudi Arabia over the theft of $20 million worth of jewels
from a royal palace in Riyadh by a Thai worker five years earlier.

<P> Parallel with the unveiling of the initial Jalaprathan Cement deal came the
announcement of Khashoggi's acquisition of a 47% stake in listed palm-oil
producer Morakot, followed in March by a full bid for the company as a "strategic
move into the food industry in India and the region".

<P> The three-company package was completed by circuit-board manufacturer
Semiconductor Ventures International (SVI), some 94.5% of which was acquired in a
tender offer by a group led by Khashoggi that included Saxena's sister-in-law
Sunanta Hanworakiart. Having reported accumulated losses of Bt419.1 million as of
December 31 1995, SVI now faces delisting from the exchange, as does Asian
Footwear, a former BBC borrower. In 1993 BBC took an 18% holding in the
sports-shoe manufacturer through KMB International, a canned-pineapple joint
venture in which the bank had a stake.

<P> Consideration has also been given to the delisting of Morakot and of Earth
Industrial, a company in which Ekachai Athikomnanda now holds a stake and which
raised Bt300 million in new shares in April 1995 to repay bank debts, including
Bt68.6 million owed to BBC. Earth Industrial changed its name from The Kader
Company after a fire at its toy factory in 1993 killed 188 workers and injured
469 &#173; Thailand's worst industrial disaster. By May this year, due diligence
on another of Saxena's takeover deals, Phuket Island plc, had been deferred after
the breakdown of negotiations between Saxena and a mysterious potential buyer
&#173; Prince Sourab, about whom no details can be traced.

<P> <B>Grey and dubious deals</B>

<P> In June, the stock exchange gave eight listed companies &#173; including
Morakot and Asian Footwear &#173; one month in which to fire directors linked
with BBC. The other companies, apart from BBC itself, were United Flour Mill,
MDX, Bangkok Steel Industry, Thai Central Chemical and Thai Durable Textile.
Almost from the beginning other players in the market had suspected all was not
well. BBC had a reputation for doing "grey" and "dubious" M&amp;A deals, says
Kongkiat Opaswongkarn, president and CEO of corporate advisory boutique Asset
Plus and a former managing director of Barings in Thailand. By that he meant that
the viability and management of some of the businesses taken over by BBC was
questionable and prices were too high, sometimes, he reckons, by as much as three
times.

<P> Saxena's deals for BBC went outside Thailand. In January the bank announced
it was paying Bt1.25 billion for major stakes in six  unnamed finance companies
&#173; a Moscow bank, a Prague investment bank, a Kazakh bank, an Indian finance
company, a New York brokerage and a Canadian financial consultancy. Saxena
personally was taking a 50% stake in Russian bank and broker Effect Credit Joint
Stock Commercial Bank with a view to extending his corporate advisory work in the
Russian Federation. By March, BBC had unveiled a share swap in which National
Credit Bank of Moscow would take between 5% and 10% of BBC's shares in exchange
for a share in the Russian bank, based on valuation.

<P> Despite his reservations about some of BBC's M&amp;A deals, Kongkiat was
surprised when the full extent of the bank's problems emerged in May during a
bloody no-confidence debate in the Thai parliament. Not only were there massive
bad debts, mismanagement, cover-ups and questionable lending practices, but the
whole scandal threatened to bring down the government. The opposition party
flourished leaked documents from the BOT revealing that BBC was effectively
bankrupt. The debate sparked a two-day run on the bank by nervous depositors to
the tune of around Bt10 billion, wiping out some of its provincial branches' cash
deposits.

<P> The government and central bank were accused of mishandling the whole affair.
The "politically motivated" central bank had been aware BBC was in trouble since
early 1995 but had not acted in earnest until it was almost too late, it was
claimed. BBC's loan portfolio by the end of last year was not a pretty picture.
Some Bt78 billion of loans were considered high-risk or problem liabilities. Bad
debts totalled Bt19 million, doubtful debts Bt19.73 billion and sub-standard
debts Bt25.53 billion. The bad and doubtful debts, without provisions, whittled
the bank's assets down to Bt165.4 billion, against liabilities of Bt169.5
billion. Despite a BOT requirement that there be full provision for bad and
doubtful debts, BBC had made provisions for just Bt3.25 billion.

<P> Next the opposition report turned to Saxena's M&amp;A masterpieces. A further
Bt32.7 billion in BBC's books was lent for various takeovers, and was considered
a high-risk liability. Loan extensions had in fact risen in 1994 and 1995. "Most
of the increased credits were extended by the headquarters to businesses in which
the bank's directors or executives or their nominees were directly and indirectly
involved, as well as loans for takeover purposes," said the <I>Bangkok Post</I>'s
translation of the leaked Bank of Thailand report. Almost Bt40 billion had been
extended to directors, executives and their nominees at the time of inspection,
of which Bt24.65 billion was categorized as "low quality" debt.

<P> There was worse to come in the opposition report. When the BOT inspected
BBC's books at the end of 1995, it found credit and contingent liabilities of
Bt38 billion had been extended for taking over 22 companies. BBC had been the
sole source of funds for the takeovers, some linked with politicians, and prices
of securities placed as collateral for takeover loans were often below the tender
offer price, claimed the opposition; provincial real estate collateral had been
bought with overdrafts, and was apparently overvalued anyway. Loans were extended
to BBC executives to buy the bank's own shares in a series of previous capital
increases, latterly in February 1995, when a total of Bt2 billion was raised and
in July 1995 when Bt3 billion was raised.

<P> <B>Crackdown on loans</B>

<P> Such loans for share purchases were contrary to BOT policy and BBC had
already been told to stop such lending. After the defiance of the second
rights-issue loans, the central bank asked for explanations and gave BBC 90 days
to recall them. Unsecured loans of $217 million had been extended to companies in
Russia's National Credit Bank group, some $55 million of which were apparently
used by the Russian bank to buy BBC shares, and further money was lent to the
group to meet interest payments. After defiance of another order from the BOT to
stop lending to the Russian group, which included Essex Corporation Holding,
Arcadia Capital Partners and the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation, the
central bank ordered that any loans of more than Bt30 million had to be approved
by the BBC credit extension board or executive board and reported to the BOT
within 15 days. But a year earlier BBC's board had empowered its president,
Krirkkiat, and senior executive vice-president, Ekachai Athikomnanda, to approve
unlimited loans, said the opposition report.

<P> In Thailand, the worlds of business and politics are inextricably entwined,
linked by a web of family connections, money and, of course, golf club
friendships. Saxena says he made donations, put at Bt250 million by some, to the
controlling Chart Thai party's election coffers, via nominees and a web of
companies, allegedly to buy votes in the last general election. He denies,
however, any direct contributions to former prime minister Banharn Silpa-archa,
who was forced to resign after a second no-confidence debate at the end of
September. An election has now been called for November 17. Undoubtedly the BBC
scandal, along with the country's economic woes, contributed to the government's
demise.

<P> Saxena's message to the party now: "I supported you in the election campaign
... just ensure me a free trial." He is pragmatic about the political hand-outs.
"You never know what's going to happen when the government changes &#173; what
you need, what you don't need, whether you want to buy land, do business or get a
licence. That's part of the gamble." Meanwhile, senior politicians who were
members of "the group of 16" &#173; one of Chart's many small factions &#173; are
believed to have taken BBC loans. Saxena claims the loans were made before the
members of parliament joined the government and stemmed from his wife's family
connections. He also points out that loans are a matter of public record.
Nevertheless, they provided additional fire power for opposition leaders who say
loans to the politicians were secured on "practically worthless" plots of land in
the provinces, often with dubious title rights, and the money then used to buy
stocks, including those in Saxena's takeover targets.

<P> With the bank's problems now out in the open, the Bank of Thailand was forced
to act. It formed a five-member control committee chaired by former commerce
ministry permanent secretary Bajr Isarasena and formally took over the running of
the bank. Arrest warrants were issued in June for Krirkkiat, Saxena, Ekachai
Athikomnanda, Ekachai's secretary Pojanee Cholampee, Saxena's Thai sister-in-law
and a shareholder in many of the takeover companies Sunanta Hanworakiart, and
Piset Panichsombat, former asset valuation chief of Colliers Jardine (Thailand).
Before this happened, though, Saxena had faxed a last-ditch proposal to
"restructure" BBC's debt to the Bank of Thailand &#173; from Zurich, where he was
on a regular business trip. "I am waiting for in-principle approval from the
control committee and the Bank of Thailand so the whole issue can be cleared up
before the weekend," Saxena was quoted as saying in a local newspaper shortly
before the arrest warrants were issued.

<P> Krirkkiat was also in Switzerland at the time the warrants were issued,
saying he was visiting his sick mother, but was arrested at the airport on his
return. He has denied the allegations. The five in Thailand were charged with
embezzling Bt1.6 billion and abusing their authority to the detriment of the
bank, and are now on bail pending court hearings.

<P> With the others already arrested, the Thai police were threatening to call in
Interpol to track down Saxena, having apparently searched for him in Switzerland,
London and Canada. Saxena, meanwhile, flew to Vancouver, from where he denied he
was on the run and taunted: "If they really want to they can come and find me.
I'm not running away." Saxena has an office and apartment in Vancouver as well as
business interests, which include Vancouver-listed Asean Holdings and Quadrant
Financial Corporation. Holding company Asean Holdings, bought as a shell company
by Saxena and Krirkkiat in 1992 and formerly known as Algonquin Minerals,
reported net profit of C$2.4 million for the year to July 31 1995 on revenue of
C$44.68 million, with its success being attributed to the acquisition of Doppler
computer stores in Canada.

<P> The police finally did catch up with Saxena in Vancouver, where he was
arrested and remains on bail, having hired top Canadian lawyers to fight
extradition proceedings. "If I had the kind of money they say I have, I could
leave Vancouver and go to Brazil or Argentina and they would never find me,"
reasoned Saxena from his Whistler ski-resort base, from where he has masterminded
a barrage of interviews with the Thai press, in between reporting to the local
police every day. He now spends his time playing the markets in New York, Europe
and Chicago, along with an occasional round of golf. He protests his innocence
vigorously, but maintains he is unlikely to get a fair trial in Thailand.

<P> Whatever the outcome of the court cases, Saxena looks certain to drag some
senior Thai figures through the mud as he goes, amid sorry tales of political
vendettas, ministerial buck-passing and regulatory bungling. The BOT has taken
its share of the flak for the BBC debacle, prompting the resignation of governor
Vijit Supinit, at the request of both the prime minister and finance minister
Bodi Chunnananda &#173; there had been allegations of foot-dragging and that
Vijit had turned a blind eye to the BBC fiasco. The central bank's independence
in the BBC affair was called into question, as was Vijit's political
partisanship. So were his ethics, particularly in regard to his acquisition of
shares in an unrelated finance company, Siam City Credit Finance and Securities
(SCCF).

<P> In 1990 Vijit had acquired 40,000 shares in SCCF at par at a time when the
company was planning to float. Vijit was a member of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) which approved the listing, but later argued there were no
specific Bank of Thailand rules forbidding an SEC official to make such share
acquisitions. After six years with Vijit in charge, a new Bank of Thailand
governor, London School of Economics graduate Rerngchai Marakanond, was appointed
in July.

<P> The opposition party also alleged the prime minister had interfered in
central bank operations over BBC, particularly with regard to the loans to
politicians, and attacked the use of public funds to rescue the bank. Vijit is
still embroiled in a court case with Ekamol Khiriwat, former SEC
secretary-general, who was fired from the central bank in December and resigned
from his associated SEC post the following day. There were "personal conflicts"
between the two men which culminated in accusations that Ekamol had leaked
confidential information. Ekamol has denied the charge and is suing Vijit and
National Intelligence Agency director Pumarat Taksadipong for defamation.
Meanwhile public prosecutors had still to decide whether Ekamol would be charged
with abuse of authority. Ekamol maintained in court that the accusations of
leaking information had been circulating since the time of former finance
minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, who had decided there was insufficient evidence
to act on the claims. They were only acted upon &#173; wrongly according to
Ekamol &#173; when Tarrin was succeeded as finance minister by Surakiart
Sathirathai, with whom he had also had conflicts. Although not entirely clear, it
appears that details about the financial health of four commercial banks,
including BBC, were the subject of Ekamol's alleged leaks.

<P> <B>Picking up the pieces</B>

<P> Surakiart himself resigned as finance minister in May during a political
reshuffle, to be replaced by Bodi Chunnananda. Surakiart was also berated over
delays in government intervention in BBC. The court cases look set to drag on for
years but attention is now turning to the rehabilitation of BBC. Saxena has
strong views on that too. "Unless every effort is made to rehabilitate BBC in a
proper business-like manner and not on a political basis and day-to-day ad hoc
basis, this situation of suits, counter-suits and criminal charges is going to
get worse and worse," he says.

<P> The central bank proposals to bail out BBC and get it back on its feet
involve a Bt22.5 million increase in share capital. The same amount again is
being raised from an issue of debentures, convertible into the new shares, most
of which look set to be taken up by the Bank of Thailand's financial institutions
rehabilitation and development fund. The Thai Bankers' Association has agreed to
take 10% of the shares and debentures, which will be allocated among members in
proportion to their deposit size. As a sweetener, the association has been told
its members can offset their debenture and share acquisitions against future
contributions to the rehabilitation and development fund.

<P> The central bank is also looking for new shareholders for BBC and has been
negotiating with the Tantipipatpong family, which currently owns around 15%, to
try to persuade it to raise its stake. Foreign investors are also being courted.
The central bank fund is itself kept afloat by contributions from relatively
healthy banks, which are now starting to complain about the unfairness of having
to use their straitened profits to bail out less prudent institutions.

<P> "This is not a good time. Banks are facing their own difficulties," says Thai
Bankers' Association general secretary Twatchai Yongkittikul. Association members
have been reluctant participants in the refinancing. They feel this should be the
last time," he says. "Law enforcement should be stronger, otherwise getting
efficient banks to help inefficient and fraudulent banks is not fair."

<P> Despite the protests, credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's said
recently it believed the Thai central bank would continue to support troubled
banks if necessary, although it said most Thai banks considered BBC an isolated
case. Rating agency Moody's foresaw potential problems back in January 1995 when
a report on the Thai banking industry said: "Close intercompany links are
rumoured to be the cause of non-performing assets at two of the sector's weaker
banks (Bangkok Metropolitan Bank and Bangkok Bank of Commerce). It is very
difficult to quantify the degree of related-company transactions."

<P> There may be more skeletons in the Thai banking cupboard. Just as the lawyers
were settling in for a long hard fight on BBC, up sprang another international
image problem for the banks. Bangkok Metropolitan Bank was fined $3.5 million by
the US authorities in July and ordered to close its two branches there after an
investigation uncovered "serious malfeasance".

<P> Regulators said the bank and its officials engaged in a pattern of "serious
unsafe and unsound banking practices and violations of the law". The bank was
accused of making loans knowing the stated purposes were false, and diverting
proceeds for the benefit of bank "insiders" and falsifying records.

<P> Meanwhile, the BBC saga is set to run and run, parallel to campaigning for a
general election, which was announced on the day that BBC reported a Bt970.9
million loss for the first half of this year. "The worst is not over until the
BBC problem is settled. There is more to come of all this," Saxena warned
recently in a satellite-linked TV interview on Thailand's Channel 11 &#173; a
government-owned station.

<P> And one further opposition party question remains unanswered. Why was one of
the police officers sent to arrest Saxena one of his former golfing pals?

<H2>JAPAN: 
THE MYTH BEHIND A CRISIS</H2> <H4>Western reports that Japan's powerful finance ministry
is now under nationalist control are wide of the mark, writes Kevin Rafferty.
But the problem is simpler: arrogant officials with a woeful lack of vision</H4>
At first sight it looks like a rather spartan British private school that
has fallen on hard times, with a forbidding stone exterior and stygian,
echoing corridors built round a quadrangle. The floors are made of wooden
blocks, some worked loose over the years, so you have to watch your step.
The scent of fresh polish cannot quite conquer generations of less pleasant
odours. Off the corridors are large cluttered rooms with heads in rows,
hunched over paper-littered desks. There are a few clues that this is not
an exclusive school, like the cigarette machines dotted at the end of corridors
and the posters and girlie calendars stuck to cupboards. By now it is apparent
it is no school, though few would guess this curious, august establishment
is the Kasumigaseki headquarters of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in Tokyo.
<BR>
<BR>
For all the gloom and atmosphere of foreboding, the occupants of this building
are among the brightest brains, the real planners and overseers of the Japanese
economic miracle. One pundit claims, apparently deadly seriously, that anyone
who wins entry to the ministry has a Nobel prize-winning brain. Defenders
of this group argue that they are rightfully rulers of Japan, who transcend
the clumsiness of politicians prone to putting their hands in the till and
businessmen who place company profits before any consideration of the country's
needs. It is said that Japan is ruled by an iron triangle of businessmen,
politicians and bureaucrats. But bureaucrats have always been regarded as
the most powerful of the three, organisers of the miracle, the guardians
of Japan's integrity. And of all the bureaucrats, the MoF mandarins are
the elite of the elite. <BR>
<BR>
This notion of MoF supremacy has spread far and wide, to the point where
it is now causing problems. Foreign observers who understand the ministry's
power sat up this summer when Eisuke Sakakibara was appointed to the pivotal
post of director-general of the ministry's international finance bureau.
The appointment of a man described by David Hale of Kemper Financial Services
as an &quot;intellectual maverick&quot;, and by <I>The Economist </I>as
&quot;outspoken&quot;, was hailed as marking the defining moment when Japan's
new nationalists had scaled the commanding heights of Japan's most important
ministry. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sakakibara and the capital strike </B><BR>
<BR>
Sakakibara, then in a less exalted MoF post, attracted attention worldwide
last year by threatening that if the US continued to make unacceptable trade
demands, Japanese institutional investors might react by selling their large
stock of US treasury bonds. One western newspaper went so far as to describe
this statement as a &quot;threatened capital strike against the US&quot;.
Coming on top of his defence of Japan's economic development as non-capitalistic
and superior to the American way, it seemed to foreshadow a tougher international
climate for westerners dealing with Japan. <BR>
<BR>
The new director-general certainly has a deserved reputation as an aggressive
defender of Japanese ways. In his book <I>Beyond Capitalism</I> (a 1993
translation of a book originally published in Japanese in 1990), Sakakibara
was uncompromising in his claim that Japan's method of economic development
was superior. &quot;Even though Japan did not introduce capitalistic concepts
in any significant way, its market mechanisms and competition have functioned
extremely efficiently. Its economic efficiency may even be greater than
that of a more purely capitalist country such as the United States, and
there would seem to be precious little merit in capitalising now,&quot;
he wrote. &quot;In fact, such an attempt might only succeed in bringing
in the disadvantages of the capitalist system, such as a wider gap in income
distribution, rampant money-worship and the vulgarisation of culture, thereby
accelerating the corruption or demise of the system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Emotion replaced by caution </B><BR>
<BR>
Exactly what Sakakibara thinks now is hard to divine: he was refusing all
requests for interviews and his first public appearance as bureau chief
this August suggested a man chastened by Japan's current economic inadequacies.
He also made a pronouncement sharply at odds with the threatened capital
strike of last year, encouraging Japanese investors to buy US securities
as a way of bringing down the soaring yen that has done so much to crimp
the country's growth, squeeze corporate profits and threaten its cherished
lifetime employment system. Sakakibara smiled when he was asked whether
a lower yen and higher dollar might erode US competitiveness and widen the
trade gap. He replied that Americans will remain great competitors. Then
he smiled and said: &quot;I sound like an American, don't I?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In fact, western commentators who lionised Sakakibara and spoke of a new
era for the MoF on his appointment were making a common mistake by imagining
that Tokyo works like Washington, or even London. The point was made by
former vice-minister Tomomitsu Oba, who said that the Japanese bureaucracy
has an institutional rather than personal memory. A single individual has
to work within constraints, especially when, like Sakakibara, he is serving
a one-year term. In retrospect, the earlier public outburst and its accompanying
threat carried far more emotional force than economic logic. With the yen
already headed for an exchange rate of 100 to the dollar and stronger, any
pullout from dollars now would come too late. It would only strengthen the
yen and increase the losses Japanese institutions made by their earlier
forays into the US, which Hale puts at $500 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Sakakibara later admitted that the government no longer had the power to
force private companies to do anything, as the MoF is painfully finding
out with the once-compliant big banks, which these days sometimes refuse
to do its bidding. Indeed, many badly burned big Japanese institutions had
already pulled out of US markets. Without another global reserve currency
- in August Sakakibara specially ruled out making the yen an international
currency - room for hurting the US and avoiding an unpleasant backlash is
limited. <BR>
<BR>
The Sakakibara issue is in some ways indicative of the way myth-making and
misconceptions colour outsider views of the ministry. Indeed, the entire
bureaucratic system is based on a pervasive myth. This is not based on the
ministry's power, which is real enough, nor the ability of its mandarins,
who are clever men able to manipulate the system, but the idea that vast
power should be given to a bunch of bureaucrats who wield it successfully
for the benefit of all. This myth was exploded when policies pursued by
the ministry first created the so-called bubble economy in the late '80s
and then pricked it, with appalling consequences for both Japan and the
world. The reality is not that the MoF is an overbearing monolith turned
nationalist, but a potentially dangerous anachronism navigating the economy
on an outdated and inaccurate map. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stories of insularity </B><BR>
<BR>
Toyoo Gyohten, now chairman of Bank of Tokyo, but before that a career MoF
official who became &quot;Mr International&quot; or vice-minister for international
affairs, tells the story of a trip abroad with a colleague whose whole life
had been spent within the gloomy Kasumigaseki headquarters. &quot;When we
got in the air and out over the sea, away from Japan, he called the stewardess
over and said to her: 'It's rather stuffy in here; can you please open a
window?' He never even travelled outside Japan and knew nothing of aircraft
pressurisation.&quot; Gyohten laughs at this evidence of insularity, adding
that it now belongs to the past. <BR>
<BR>
Even if MoF men (and they are mostly men) have become more worldly, critics
have more than enough alternative ammunition. Any formal indictment would
concentrate on the following allegations: that its officials are too arrogant;
that they operate from behind narrow bureau walls; that they are trying
to direct a rich, complicated and international economy as if it were a
third world country and that they have no conception of the country's international
role, rights or responsibilities. This blindness has helped Japan into its
present mess in which low growth and a high yen have crippled industry,
leaving it sitting on a huge $550 billion pile of non-performing loans,
prompting <I>The New York Times</I> to speculate on the dangers of &quot;financial
meltdown&quot; in Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
Last year, Japan was experiencing its longest recession since World War
II. In classical economic theory it could have used fiscal weapons to combat
falling growth. As early as 1993 confidence had disappeared, while grumbles
from the Clinton administration set the yen rising from a 125-120 level
against the dollar. If the MoF had acted decisively, cut taxes and pushed
the Bank of Japan to lower the discount rate ahead of market expectations
instead of belatedly following the market, it might have restored confidence
and raised growth. If it had backed these measures by pushing widespread
deregulation it would have encouraged competition, provided opportunities
to importers, silenced foreign criticism, kept the yen steady and protected
its manufacturers. A wise MoF would also have prepared for the bad loan
crisis and realised that its carefully structured and highly regulated layers
of banks - long-term credit banks, regional banks, credit unions, credit
associations and brokerages providing a range of <I>amakudari</I> or &quot;descent
from heaven&quot; posts which allow top officials to take private sector
jobs after a decent interval - were part of the problem. Instead, senior
ministry officials put up a spirited defence, refusing to cut taxes on the
medium-term assumption that with a rapidly ageing society, Japan will be
the first industrialised country with more than 25% of its people over retirement
age by 2020. <BR>
<BR>
Kasumigaseki's mandarins showed much less concern than alarmed businessmen
about the continuing rise in the value of the yen, along with the high levels
of Japanese trade and current account surpluses. By some accounts, up to
a third of the value of Japanese dollar-based pension investments were lost
as the yen appreciated. When belatedly they learned their lesson, refrained
from investing abroad and kept their money at home, that exacerbated the
supply-demand balance with dollars and pushed the yen still higher. Some
dealers put the combined losses at $500-600 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Add the 10% of GDP lost through slow growth, $500 billion, and another $75-100
billion which economists reckon burdens the consumer every year because
of the cost of reg- ulations and red tape and you have a huge bill. Much
of it is attributable, directly or indirectly, to the MoF and its inability
to catch up with a changed world. <BR>
<BR>
Equally important is the arrogance of MoF men in believing that they have
only to speak to command. In a simpler postwar world that was cleaning up
the ashes of defeat as fast as possible, the officials got their way. But
in a mature economy the path is not so clear, and wise officials would not
pretend to know everything. Japan also seems determined to resist IMF and
World Bank advice to let go and simply regulate the market, rather than
try to direct every nook and cranny of the economy. An aspiring power like
Japan with great ambitions but without - as former prime minister Kiichi
Miyazawa puts it - &quot;military might to back up the yen&quot; must take
international factors into consideration. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The budget bureau or nowhere </B><BR>
<BR>
Let us get this into some sort of perspective. It would be churlish to deny
the intelligence or importance of the ministry mandarins. Top- level Japanese
civil servants are chosen by stiff and open competitive examination and
the best opt for the MoF. The ministry is split into nine bureaux which
vary in importance - the power of the budget bureau is paramount. <BR>
<BR>
Budget bureaucrats have some slightly old-fashioned sayings which underline
their importance, including &quot;<I>Shukei-kyoku atte sho nashi&quot; -</I>
&quot;There is only a budget bureau, no ministry&quot; - and &quot;<I>Shukei
ni arazunba&quot;</I> - &quot;If you are not in the budget bureau, you are
nowhere.&quot; The tax bureau might be regarded as second-best. The international
finance bureau and indeed the international vice-minister occupy ambivalent
positions. <BR>
<BR>
Any foreigner would think that these are the key people with their responsibility
for how Japan is seen in the outside world. But in Kasumigaseki the international
vice-ministers, not only of MoF but also of Miti, have often been described
as &quot;barbarian tamers&quot;, possessors of specialist skills undoubtedly,
but viewed with suspicion and somehow tainted on the domestic career ladder.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>A long-term approach </B><BR>
<BR>
Japan's finance officials are more dedicated than most foreign counterparts.
Isao Kubota, director-general of the customs and tariffs bureau of the MoF,
says: &quot;Finance ministry bureaucrats tend not to put their family first.
That sort of person would not choose to become a bureaucrat in the first
place. The job comes first and private life is left behind.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There are benefits to this arrangement. Former vice-minister Gyohten recalls:
&quot;One of the attractions of being a finance ministry official rather
than going to business or industry was that responsibilities and power to
take important decisions came early, within a few years of joining.&quot;
Deputy directors, men in their 30s, are the backbone of the ministry since
this is where most policy formulation is done. Even so, the career escalator
of a young ministry official moves slowly if surely: unless he gets a foreign
posting or secondment to the office of a minister he will be close to 50
before he escapes from the crowd and clutter of communal work areas into
a private office. <BR>
<BR>
With quiet satisfaction, Kubota recounts the lessons of his years as a deputy
director at the tax bureau in the '70s and the knowledge and understanding
it gave him of the internal workings of the MoF corridors of power. &quot;When
things develop into turmoil it is very interesting. When things are quiet
and the war has not started, the opinions of the senior officials prevail.
But when the negotiations start and everyone is quarrelling, then if your
choice is right and your judgement is correct, you can push your ideas through...
When I was in the tax bureau, with a really excellent director, I was the
first person to negotiate with the different bureaux to reduce substantially
special taxation concessions. I had to fight with 13 different ministries
and agencies of this government. In another year I succeeded in doubling
the motor vehicle tax and increasing by 20% the gasoline tax at the same
time. I think this was a great achievement.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There was nothing special about his technique apart from hard work in studying
the facts and tough negotiating, he adds: &quot;You have to listen to them
very carefully and try to understand what they mean. Then you have to study
what they said very deeply, enough to know more than your counterparts.
And then you start to negotiate. Being with the tax bureau doesn't give
you any advantage or power. The budget bureau is different because it controls
the purse-strings and unless the budget official says yes, they are powerless;
but in the tax bureau you have no such easy weapon and have to negotiate
and to cut favours.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Institute with a memory </B><BR>
<BR>
Former vice-minister Tomomitsu Oba explains the practice of rapidly moving
career posts by saying, &quot;The American bureaucratic system relies on
personal memory, but ours is an institutional memory. Policy does not change
as the new incumbent gets into power, there is continuity.&quot; Defenders
of the Japanese system assert that this continuity means they can avoid
the American mistake of having to re-think everything and repeat the same
old errors when a new administration comes into power. There are position
papers ready on every possible policy and a well-researched and argued finance
ministry point of view for every eventuality. <BR>
<BR>
The MoF's control over the rest of the government machine is exercised most
powerfully through the budget process, when officials from other ministries
go to the MoF with their requests. You only have to see the long queue of
petitioners outside the budget bureau, waiting like nervous schoolchildren
clutching their test papers outside the headmaster's room, to realise just
how almighty the ministry is. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, each year about 2,000 officials from Japan's 47 prefectures
descend on the capital to lobby for their projects, many of them bearing
gifts such as mandarins, persimmon- leaf sushi, rice gruel, trout, sweet
dough crackers, wine, specialities from their region or coupons to buy beer.
<BR>
<BR>
Officials certainly work hard. When preparing the annual budget, it is common
for budget bureau executives to clock 200 hours of overtime a month. For
most officials, retirement comes no later than their mid 50s. When a new
administrative vice-minister is appointed, all those who entered in the
same year must retire, an almost symbolic nod to his seniority. The crucial
factor is not age but year of entry to the ministry. Not that MoF bureaucrats
have to worry about eking out a living on a meagre pension. The ministry
will look after them and even provide them with a more lucrative retirement
job. Certain posts, such as chief executive of the Export-Import Bank of
Japan, the Japan Development Bank, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are ministry <I>amakudari</I> perks. Ex-vice-ministers
can expect a whole <I>amakudari</I> career and will not normally retire
until they are in their late '70s. <BR>
<BR>
Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, for example, retired as administrative vice-minister
in June 1986, went on to become president of OECF that year, then skipped
over nimbly to become head of the Ex-Im Bank in May 1990. After four years
there he moved on to become president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yasuo
Matsushita, another administrative vice-minister, crossed over to the private
sector in 1986 to the probably even better-paid job of director of Taiyo
Kobe Bank. He became president the following year and then took over in
1990 as chairman of the merged Taiyo Kobe Mitsui Bank, renamed Sakura Bank
in 1992. He retired as chairman in the middle of last year, but was not
out of a job. He remained director of the bank until December when he took
over as governor of the Bank of Japan, just two weeks from his 69th birthday
and with a five-year term ahead. <BR>
<BR>
Last year the top jobs at a large number of Japanese banks including Bank
of Tokyo, Yokohama Bank, Hyogo Bank, Tomato Bank, Tokuyo City Bank and Nippon
Credit Bank were held by MoF &quot;migratory birds&quot;, as the leading
Japanese magazine <I>Shukan Gendai</I> called them. It counted up to 100
companies, including brokerage houses and insurance concerns, where ministry
&quot;birds&quot; were currently perched in comfort. <BR>
<BR>
The magazine said waspishly: &quot;On the surface it is said that the MoF
sent its old boys in response to requests from the banks, but this is not
correct... Although it seems the MoF is sending its people to help reconstruction
of the troubled banks, if you look at it from the other side, it seems that
the ministry is taking advantage of the management crisis of banks in difficulties
to keep seats warm for its <I>amakudari</I>... It sends its former officials
by using a sweetener of financial support to banks whose managements are
weak and a whip, the threat of investigating the bank's management, to grab
the initiative of management.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Acting above sordid money matters </B><BR>
<BR>
Few critics suggest that this creation of comfortable retirement jobs is
corruption, although it is unhealthy arrogance to believe that the ministry
always knows best. An official confirms this when he says rather smugly:
&quot;The reason the number of <I>amakudari</I> from the ministry of finance
is large is just that we have capable persons.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On the whole, ministry officials give the impression of being above such
sordid money matters. There is a finance <I>zoku</I> or tribe of legislators
dedicated to finance ministry matters, but they are quite subservient to
the bureaucrats. This is very much the reverse of what happened when former
prime minister Kakuei Tanaka built his political base from the control he
wielded at the construction ministry. &quot;MoF officials go to great lengths
to try to keep the politicians out of budget-making, a prime political preserve
in other countries,&quot; says a respected British economist. &quot;To let
the politicians decide the budget would be - to the MoF - like letting the
rats into the granary.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>How to change the ministry </B><BR>
<BR>
It is an indictment of the bureaucracy that its officials serve faithfully,
but then leave well before the age of 60 to make their real money outside.
Other reforms should also be considered. The ministry should think about
giving longer terms in office to its top men, say four or five years instead
of one or two, so that they have an opportunity to give serious consideration
to those modern inputs and adjustments which should be made to the accumulated
institutional memory. <BR>
<BR>
It should scrap the current distinction made between the often-derided internationalists
within the MoF and domestic men so that all bureaucrats have to consider
the outside world, not the barbarian tamers alone. It should scrap or at
least revamp the bureau system: at present it is the bureaux chiefs, not
the vice-ministers, who are considering responsible in law. It would also
invest in a good economics department and assemble a council of wise men
to give regular advice on what is going on outside the MoF schoolroom. <BR>
<BR>
The alternative to a reformed system is a continuation of the present mess.
If this were to happen, the costs would fall on a world deprived of the
benefits of a strong Japan. They would fall even harder on the Japanese
people, who continue to suffer the world's most expensive cost of living.<BR>

<H3>RUSSIAN BANK ACCOUNTING </H3>



<H2> <B>The figures behind the figures </B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The accounting standards still used by most Russian
banks are a hangover from the old Soviet system, revealing little about their
health and bandaging up their infirmities. International investors want
international standards. Banks and regulators are responding but full reform will
take years. <BR> Antony Currie reports</B> </H4> 

<P> If your idea of purgatory is
submitting accounts, you'll sympathize with Russian banks. The central bank
requires them to submit reports daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly.
Quantity doesn't necessarily equate with quality: western investors aren't
particularly impressed with what they see and the Russians know it. "In the
international market," says Igor Komarov, chief accountant at Inkombank, "our
balance sheets are as incomprehensible as Chinese grammar."

<P> At face value there appear to be few problems: all the necessary figures,
such as assets, liabilities, shareholder equity and profits, are reported. But
the accounts make no attempt to evaluate a bank's financial situation. Everything
is presented in bookkeeping form and follows, with some modifications, the Soviet
system of preparing figures as a basis for calculating the tax bill.

<P> International institutional investors, rating agencies and analysts need more
information than this. They have been pressing banks to produce additional annual
reports prepared according to international accounting standards (IAS).

<P> Revalued figures produced on this basis show lower equity, asset and profit
figures throughout the balance sheet. In the case of Inkombank, for example, its
1995 accounts under Russian accounting standards (RAS) report $308 million of
shareholders equity; using IAS the figure is $100 million lower. Tokobank's IAS
equity is $110 million lower than its RAS equity of $309 million.

<P> Publishing IAS reports is not a popular option: so far no more than 30 or 40
banks out of some 2,300 do so. Most would rather spend a few million on an
impressive building and publish inflated figures rather than commission one of
the expensive big-six international accounting firms to reveal their real
financial situation. But for those that have extensive foreign dealings, want to
open representative offices abroad or get access to international capital
markets, IAS accounts are crucial.

<P> But getting hold of IAS accounts isn't the end of the matter. Finding
consolidated accounts is virtually impossible. The few institutions that do
present consolidated IAS accounts, such as Mezhcombank, Tokobank and Most Bank,
are something of an anomaly in Russia. Consolidation is another concept that's
new to Russian accounting, so those institutions that don't publish consolidated
accounts are not necessarily deliberately avoiding doing so. At present only
banking subsidiaries have to be consolidated. But banks such as Imperial, Unexim
and ICFI (International Company for Finance and Investments) own or part-own
industrial and business concerns that often dwarf their banking operations.
Promradtekhbank even owns a hospital and a radio station. In fact some of
Russia's major banks are little more than glorified corporate and state
treasuries that bankroll business, industry and government. So they would appear
as just single cogs in larger machines if consolidated accounts were presented.

<P> Moves towards greater transparency in Russian accounting are at best
described as gradual, and there are more important priorities than producing
consolidated accounts. It's therefore likely to be several years before they are
common practice. At present, banks and auditors have more than enough to do
preparing IAS accounts for bank business alone.

<P> <B>Onwards and downwards</B>

<P> Where do Russian and international accounting practices differ most? For many
banks, adjustments to the role of Taiga bonds in their balance sheets have the
most effect on the value of their equity. Taiga bonds worth $8 billion were
issued by the finance ministry from 1993 onwards to creditors of the collapsed
state-run Vnesheconombank. Those who bought them had to do so at face value and
would have incurred further losses had they sold them in the market, where their
real value was much lower. So the bonds, which were dollar-denominated, were
allowed to be classed as a form of equity, either as part of a bank's charter
fund or to raise additional capital.

<P> The central bank now recognizes that the bonds artificially increase banks'
equity and in February 1995 forbade any new tranches from being used in this way.
It also told the banks that they must gradually eliminate the bonds from their
equity figures.

<P> Under IAS, bond holdings cannot be registered as equity, and so are
eliminated. This is a source of conflict between the banks and the big-six
auditing firms since the banks believe the accountants exaggerate the figures
relating to the bonds when revaluing equity. "Although we and the auditing firm
finally reached a compromise last year," says one Russian banker, "we know we're
going to have to go through the whole process again."

<P> Another reason why IAS accounts tend to cut Russian banks down to size
springs from the fact that they are calculated on an accrual basis, whereas RAS
is based on cash accounts. So RAS figures don't register a bank's incoming or
outgoing interest payments until they are received or paid out. IAS, by contrast,
will add and subtract them as necessary according to the length of the loan. In
simple terms of interest owed, the accrual system knocked $2 million off equity
and $9 million off profit at Mezhcombank last year.

<P> But by far the largest cut resulting from use of the accrual system is due to
loan-loss provisions. According to IAS, provisioning forms part of a bank's
capital but not of its shareholder equity. In RAS there is no notion at all of
loan-loss provisions &#173; cash-based accounting does not require loans to be
declared as lost until they are overdue, and most banks have been in the habit of
simply rescheduling loans to avoid this. Recently, however, the central bank has
introduced a system for provisioning consisting of five graded categories.
According to this, funds of between 2% and 100% of the value of a loan have to be
set aside as a loan-loss provision, depending on how risky the loan is.

<P> The banks complain of one major problem with this system: provisioning for
the more risky loans (the bottom three tiers) is done before tax whereas for safe
loans, provisioned at between 2% and 5% of their value, the funds are not set
aside until after tax. This artificially increases a bank's tax liability and so
dents its dividends and profits.

<P> Compared with the western IAS system, the new Russian provisioning system
sets aside much less capital, making more available for equity. Taking
Mezhcombank as an example, adapting figures to IAS for 1995 required providing
for Rb117 billion ($25.23 million) more than its IAS equity total of Rb113
billion.

<P> Loan-loss provisions also mean that IAS-calculated profits are lower than
those derived from RAS. At Mezhcombank, a further Rb58.6 billion ($12.6 million)
had to be set aside on top of the RAS figures. Profits at the larger Most Bank
were hit even harder, with provisioning taking off Rb144 billion.

<P> Despite this the banks that have applied IAS seem to appreciate the
importance of provisioning. As Inkombank's Komarov puts it: "By creating reserves
it seems as though we're missing out on profit, but if this is not done then net
profit is unrealistically high. Whereas if the bank has a correct reserve
strategy it's prepared for every eventuality."

<P> IAS rules on accounting for tax tend to make a further dent in banks' profit
accounts. Under RAS the profit-and-loss account does not include tax payments.
Instead all profits are included on the shareholders' equity account as profit to
be distributed &#173; Russian legislation, in a hangover from the Soviet era,
does not allow for retained earnings; all profits must be distributed, whether
through taxes, dividends or by being placed in a reserve fund. Also, expenses
such as staff bonuses and salaries are not included in the P&amp;L but are
treated as flows of funds and often contribute to shareholder equity figures.

<P> Worst hit in 1995 by the IAS approach to tax was Tokobank, whose RAS-derived
profits of Rb114 billion were wiped out under IAS, forcing the bank to report a
loss of $11 million.

<P> Asset figures also come out differently in the two accounting systems.
Interbranch lending accounts and loans to affiliated companies and individuals
(usually shareholders) are included in RAS and so inflate banks' assets. These
flows are said to be used by banks as window-dressing. For example, they may lend
money to their own branches or affiliates at the end of a quarter or a year to
boost their figures, then have the loan paid back shortly afterwards. Moscow
newspaper <I>Isvestia</I> recently published an article accusing Unexim Bank and
its sister company ICFI of this. Auditing firms say the practice is widespread.
"It happens here just like it happens in the West," says an accountant. "Only
here it's not done in quite as subtle a manner."

<P> <B>Increasing authority</B>

<P> The non-specific nature of Russian accounts means that proceeds from some
foreign exchange and derivative deals are hidden. Some proceeds are listed in the
P&amp;L, but a large amount are subsumed in account number 076, "settlements on
other foreign operations", and found in assets and liabilities. One analyst
estimates that between a fifth and a quarter of some banks' balance-sheets are
included in this one account.

<P> The institution responsible for bringing the old Soviet-style Russian
accounts up to date is the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Formed out of
the old state-run Gosbank, the central bank has slowly been introducing changes,
such as loan-loss provisioning, since 1993. But bankers and consultants reckon it
is only in the past 18 months that it has taken on much of a supervisory role. In
part this was a result of lack of experience, and the fact that many of the
central bank's best staff left to take up better-paid jobs in the commercial
sector. One analyst says the lack of experience at the central bank worsened the
interbank loans crisis of August 1995 &#173; another rumour, though, has it that
the central bank's approach was a deliberate ploy aimed at weeding out some of
the weakest banks.

<P> There is a widespread feeling that the authorities now have more control over
the regulatory environment, although there is still room for improvement. As Mike
Wharton, banking partner in consultant KPMG's Moscow office, puts it: "The
trouble is that if the Central Bank doesn't prohibit it, you can do anything. But
it is changing, and most of what they've done over the last year is very good."

<P> These changes include the introduction of capital adequacy ratios along BIS
lines; 13 norms for banking practice, ranging from minimum start-up funds of Ecu5
million ($4 million) to limiting loans to one borrower to 25% of total loans; and
a gradual shift towards improved accountancy standards. In addition to the
changes brought in over the past three years there is to be one final push
towards internationally accepted accounting standards at the beginning of 1997.
How long this will take to effect is unclear.

<P> The Association of Russian Banks believes RAS could be transformed to an
internationally acceptable standard within a year but that three to five years
would be safer. With scant provisioning and an overreliance on Taiga bonds, too
swift a change might bankrupt many of the smaller, weakly capitalized banks.

<P> And whereas some analysts expect Russian standards to change gradually to
meet western expectations, others feel that it will be more a question simply of
adopting IAS. "Why reinvent the wheel?" says James Kilzer, partner in consultant
Price Waterhouse's Moscow offices. "The Russians have gone straight from cash to
electronic banking, bypassing the chequebook, and I expect they'll do the same
with accounting standards."

<P> If the system is to work well, changes will have to be made to improve
consultation and implementation processes. The central bank is often attacked for
introducing changes without consulting banks or auditing firms, much to the
consternation of those at the receiving end: "If the central bank issues new
directives they usually don't consult us, and so end up having to issue a new
directive on how to implement the first one, or suspend the changes altogether,"
says a spokesman at the Association of Russian Banks, a view echoed by banks and
consultants alike.

<P> Turf warfare is also a problem, particularly where the tax authorities are
involved. They still hold great sway in Russia and can block or change new
legislation in order to increase revenues. The problem with loan-loss
provisioning, for example, has been laid at their door. And when between 50 and
90 often conflicting documents from different government departments turn up at
banks every day, it's time to cut the bureaucracy.

<P> The Russian authorities are not working alone. The big-six accountancy firms,
which have been in Moscow since the early 1990s, act as consultants, introducing
their clients to what international investors expect of them. Helpful as this is,
it doesn't always have the desired effect. "We've started to send bank staff on
three-day courses covering the basics of IAS," said a partner at one of the
firms. "The problem is that some of them then think they're experts, and we have
a hard time convincing them otherwise."

<P> Longer-term advice and support is provided by the World Bank and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Their Financial Institutions
Development Programme (FIDP) aims to improve Russian banks' understanding of, and
ability to compete in, the international arena by setting up a system of grants
and long-term soft loans to be invested in IT and twinning arrangements with
western banks (see box).

<P> With 31 banks now on the FIDP programme and establishing relationships with
foreign firms and investors, it is only a matter of time before transparent,
fully audited accounts become available for most of the top banks &#173; although
some which do have them, such as Unexim Bank, are wary of releasing them
publicly. For the vast majority of banks it will take much longer. With little or
no incentive to spend money on IAS accounts, they are likely to stick to whatever
the central bank requires at any particular time.

<P>
Sources: Euromoney, in cooperation with bank data firm Eurastar, contacted Russian banks by fax. We also used data from western correspondent banks, 
auditing firms and the rating agency Bank Watch-Bree. Most figures are unconsolidated. Annual data for banks are published in the Russian press,
but these are unaudited and unreliable. Where 1995 figures are unavailable we have used 1994 figures. Banks with only 1993 data have been excluded.  






 <H3>
<B>Twinning, training and technology</B> </H3> <P> With over 2,000 banks in
Russia and only 30-40 places on the Financial Institutions Development Programme
(FIDP) it was inevitable that most would miss out. But there are surprises in the
list of banks chosen to join the scheme, run jointly by the World Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to improve IT and
training, and promote links with western banks. Among them are Fes Bank and
Dalrybank, which don't appear on any list of the top 50 banks in Russia. Others,
including Conversbank and Petrovsky, have much smaller capital and assets than
more obvious candidates such as East-West Investment Bank.

<P> There is, however, a distinct strategy underlying the programme: "Our aim is
to strengthen the Russian banking sector as a whole," says Stephanie Crossley,
project administrator at the EBRD's head office in London. "So we want to support
those banks which have the potential for growth and stability, not just those
which are large or based in Moscow."

<P> Some banks are too important to leave out; Unexim and Imperial, with their
strong political and business links, fall into this category. Three of the 10
largest banks as measured by Russian accounting standards &#173; Sberbank,
Vneshtgorbank and Agroprombank &#173; are deliberately excluded because they are
state-run banks.

<P> The World Bank and the EBRD developed FIDP in 1993 and 1994, setting aside
$200 million and $100 million respectively, and retain overall strategic
responsibility for the programme. Any bank wanting to join must have minimum
shareholder equity of Ecu5 million ($6.2 million) and publish an audit according
to international standards before it can be considered. In addition, banks that
have not been reviewed before must undergo diagnostic audits, usually lasting a
month.

<P> The day-to-day running of the programme rests with the government task force,
made up of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Russian central bank and the
Ministry for Economic Affairs. They have the final say on which banks are
admitted to the programme, and the MoF is in charge of distributing the $300
million loan.

<P> It was not until May 1995 that the first six banks were admitted to the
scheme, with a further seven joining at the end of the year. All 13 were granted
full accreditation, which gained them access to both the twinning and IT aspects
of the programme. But the government task force decided that this summer's 18 new
recruits should at first set up coherent twinning arrangements with western banks
before receiving loans for IT and training.

<P> The amount distributed to the banks varies, but on average each gets $3
million to help cover the costs of twinning arrangements, of which up to half
comes in the form of a grant. Any funds over $1.5 million for twinning, and all
funds given out for IT and training, are loans, and can total up to $12 million.

<P> On that basis, the 31 banks accepted onto FIDP have accounted for a large
proportion of the initial $300 million. It is unlikely that any more money will
be given, and there are no plans for new accreditations to the programme in the
near future.

<P> FIDP generally meets with approval. Western firms and consultants praise the
two institutions involved for their patience, knowledge and avoidance of
bureaucracy, and see it as an essential step towards developing the banking
industry as a whole: "The twinning aspect of the World Bank-EBRD programme is
easily the best thing for all our clients," says KPMG's Mike Wharton.
"There's only so much that consultants can do."

<H3>CS FIRST BOSTON</H3> 
<H2>Wheat and the chaff </H2>
<H4>Since taking charge of CS First Boston in 1993, Allen Wheat has done
much to improve the firm's profitability. The payoff for employees was supposed
to be a fairer allocation of bonuses. Many bond traders felt it didn't work
that way this year and some left in disgust, making odious comparisons between
their own thinner pay checks and those of supposedly key employees. Peter
Lee reports </H4>
Allen Wheat, president of CS First Boston, took home an excellent pay packet
last year: $9 million. Some would say he deserved it. In 1995, though not
the firm's best-ever year, CS First Boston recorded net income of $207 million,
33% better than the $156 million it made in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
With an annual salary of that magnitude, Wheat must have built up enough
personal wealth to keep him in comfort if he ever grew sick of his present
job and decided to walk away from it. It would be more than enough to start
up his own derivatives trading boutique. Why might Wheat entertain such
thoughts just two and a half years after becoming president and why do CS
First Boston staff gossip about the possibility? <BR>
<BR>
Wheat is now striving to stabilize the firm following its first big crisis
since his tenure began. This March, dozens of senior bond dealers left CS
First Boston in New York, outraged by poor bonuses. Although most parts
of the bond business had been profitable in 1995, a weak performance in
mortgage-backed securities - that business lost around $70 million
- lowered profits for the fixed-income group as a whole. Many traders
and bankers in areas associated with mortgages judged it unfair that their
bonuses should be cut, and headed for competitors. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;With the asset-backed people we didn't get it right,&quot; Wheat now
concedes. &quot;We didn't pay them enough and I take full responsibility
for that.&quot; He adds that many bond traders gained the false impression
that their bonus cheques were insulated against the mortgage problem. In
fact, a large proportion of traders' pay was linked to the performance of
wider groups within fixed income and to bond trading as a whole. &quot;Last
year, all people heard was: 'We're doing great, we're knocking the ball
out of the park,'&quot; Wheat says. &quot;One or two of them asked about
mortgages and were told: 'Don't worry, it's not your problem.' Not surprisingly,
the traders' response was: 'I like that music.'&quot; But the firm's shareholders
could not turn a blind eye to that mortgage loss. &quot;We should have addressed
it sooner and discussed it more openly,&quot; says Wheat. <BR>
<BR>
It was hoped that such spats over pay, once a regular occurrence at First
Boston, had been consigned to the past when Wheat took over as chief operating
officer in 1993. Wheat brought a new approach and more up-to-date management
disciplines. He began tracking the allocation of the firm's capital to its
different businesses and returns made on it, so as to measure more accurately
the profitability of each business. Supposedly, that helped to make the
firm's compensation system fairer and more transparent. For the first time,
staff would have a clear idea of the basis on which their bonuses were being
calculated. <BR>
<BR>
But the system failed spectacularly this year. Some departing bond traders
complain that their aggregate pay for 1995 was 15% down on 1994's, even
though most bond businesses made more profit in 1995 than in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
The firm's overall after-tax return on equity, excluding special items,
was 15.5% for 1995, compared with 11.1% in 1994. Within fixed income, global
government bond trading and the foreign exchange and emerging market businesses
enjoyed record years. The traders didn't mind slim pay packets in 1994,
when many desks made losses as interest rates rose, but they refused to
accept disappointing rewards after a much better performance in 1995. Many
traders left within days of receiving their 1995 bonus cheques early in
March. <BR>
<BR>
The firm's bonus pool for 1995 was $455 million, compared with $350 million
in 1994, but it didn't spread far enough. Traders say that there were three
big problems. The firm lost money in its mortgage bond business. Partly
this resulted from one bad trading position, the liquidation of which cost
the firm dear. Annoyingly for the firm's remaining mortgage traders, the
individuals responsible for this had already left the firm long before February
and March, when bonuses for 1995 were paid. <BR>
<BR>
The second problem relates to CS First Boston's rebuilding of its mortgage
business. Costs had fallen over 40% from their peak, but even though revenues
were returning, profits were still not flowing. Oddly, mortgage traders
were among the most bitter about low pay for 1995. Some thought it unfair
that their pay should suffer during this restructuring and add that the
likelihood it would suffer was not explained to them. Other traders, for
example in the asset-backed securities division, felt they suffered unfairly
by being associated with a loosely defined mortgage bond group. Their own
areas had been highly profitable. &quot;Over-all CS First Boston's fixed
income area had a record year, with the exception of one department,&quot;
says Marc Hotimsky, new head of the bond division. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Strategic mistake</B> <BR>
<BR>
In the first quarter of 1995, CS First Boston also took an $88.4 million
charge arising from lay-offs made in 1994. The firm says this explains the
high component of deferred stock in this year's bonuses: another cause of
resentment among managing directors. <BR>
<BR>
The third problem, which caused the most resentment, was the amount of money
sucked out of the fixed-income bonus pool and paid to a few senior individuals:
Wheat; Robert Diamond, former head of fixed income; John Costas, head of
government bond trading; and Mark Patterson, head of high-yield bonds. Patterson,
for example, was hired early in 1994, on what was rumoured to be a contract
guaranteeing him an annual $5 million for three years. Costas would hardly
take less. Money also had to be allocated to other senior figures at CS
First Boston, such as vice-chairman David Mulford. <BR>
<BR>
Critics say that a number of other more junior traders were hired on high
guaranteed contracts last year. These further raised the firm's fixed costs
and reduced the amount of money that could be paid out to longer-serving
staff. <BR>
<BR>
One departing managing director complains: &quot;The firm made a strategic
mistake in 1994 by focusing too much on controlling costs and not on improving
the quality of its professionals. Contrast that with Morgan Stanley which
continued to hire people even in difficult market conditions. The result
was that in 1995, when markets improved, we didn't make as much profit as
we should have done. We just didn't have enough warm bodies to put in front
of the clients,&quot; says the trader. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of 1995, CS First Boston employed 5,033 people, down 23% from
6,555 at the end of 1994. The firm closed offices in Miami, Washington and
Dallas, and exited businesses, including asset management, municipal bonds
and Japanese domestic equity. These expense-reduction efforts allowed senior
managers to claim $50.3 million in pay deferred from 1994. <BR>
<BR>
What these broad figures don't show, departing bond traders say, is how,
as 1995 wore on, the firm's hiring strategy lurched to the opposite extreme
from 1994. In an effort to catch up, the firm began recruiting bond traders
and salesmen. For example, in the autumn, the firm announced it had lured
from semi-retirement Andrew Stone, a high-profile, ex-Salomon, ex-Daiwa
mortgage-bond whiz. Stone quickly brought a group of his old assistants
to help run mortgage and asset-backed trading. By reputation, Stone is one
of the smartest mortgage-bond traders in the business. But his arrival could
not save the division from a poor performance for 1995. <BR>
<BR>
There were 3,321 people in the firm's bonus pool in 1994, yet despite the
overall fall in staff numbers in 1995, there were still 3,309 then. The
firm is still hiring. It hopes to build staff levels by between 7% and 8%
in fixed income in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
In a generally strong bond market, the firm met fierce competition for good
staff, and CS First Boston had to offer two-year guarantees of $1 million
and $2 million even to average-quality recruits. &quot;I would argue that
some of the guys we hired last year would have struggled to get jobs at
any but a foreign-owned firm,&quot; says one source. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's probably a grain of truth in all that,&quot; says Wheat. Again
he traces the problem to the mortgage area, which lost money in 1994 and
1995. &quot;A lot of people including myself were asking: 'Can we afford
this?'&quot; Following a detailed management review, the firm decided it
could, and began a major revamp. Heavy investment began in July, before
Andy Stone arrived. <BR>
<BR>
Former senior executives also suggest that profits made in the bond division
were used to subsidize other parts of the firm, such as the equities division,
which was restructured during 1995, under a new head, Brady Dougan. &quot;We
had to carry the firm,&quot; complains one senior bond executive who suggests
that other divisions may have paid their people close to 100% of the profits
they generated, while bond traders kept a smaller proportion, closer to
50% to 60%. Wheat denies this: &quot;That's nonsense. Fixed income had one
of their highest pay-outs percentage-wise.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some veterans who had remained loyal through previous bouts of turmoil in
1990 (when Credit Suisse tightened its grip on First Boston following its
losses on bridge loans) and 1993 finally rebelled. One senior trader says:
&quot;In 1993, I toed the party line to keep my employees in place because
I believed Wheat knew how to manage the business. But I was mistaken.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
So serious was the affair that CS First Boston's head of fixed income, Robert
Diamond, a vice-chairman of the firm, was forced out. Diamond was blamed
for failing to manage his traders' expectations for their 1995 bonuses.
Several departing staff say this was unfair. One departed trader recalls:
&quot;Wheat was saying Diamond miscalculated the bonus pool, which is mind-boggling.
He didn't miscalculate anything. From the start of the year, Wheat decided
what percentage pay-out fixed-income traders would take. Wheat used Diamond
as a scapegoat to protect his skin.&quot; Wheat himself only says: &quot;Bob
did a good job building things up here. He left for personal reasons.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, Wheat himself, as president, would have spent many hours deciding
with Diamond what proportion of their 1995 profits the bond traders would
be receiving as bonuses. Such decisions are made at the very top of the
firm. Wheat would have been closely involved in detailed decisions on the
amount and form of compensation. The form, as much as the amount, caused
dispute. <BR>
<BR>
In 1993, the firm's managing directors were told to expect between 15% and
20% of their future pay in the form of deferred awards of the company's
stock. The laudable intention was to promote a wider feeling of ownership
among senior employees. Sadly, it appears, they prefer being paid in hard
cash. Some managing directors in fixed income found that deferred stock
made up closer to 50% of their total compensation for 1995. Even more controversial
than this high proportion of deferred stock was that it vests, or pays out,
over five years - not three, as many traders had been led to believe.
<BR>
<BR>
Some executives say that amid the uproar, the departures, sackings and politicking,
the poverty of 1995 pay awards at CS First Boston has been considerably
exaggerated. One says: &quot;I think we were underpaid, but not badly. A
bonus pool 10% higher might have seen us through.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Part of the problem was that strong bond markets in the latter part of 1995
and the willingness of other firms, including commercial banks, to recruit
people on high salaries raised traders' hopes for their cash pay. Senior
management underestimated this factor. Meanwhile many traders simply forgot
about the loss in mortgages and the first-quarter restructuring charge.
&quot;Last year, we didn't talk about compensation until the end of January
[1996]. That was a big mistake,&quot; says Hotimsky. <BR>
<BR>
The message from Wheat's office was that the firm, for which read Diamond,
had failed to manage its bond traders' pay expectations. It is not as apologetic
about the actual levels of pay. In a memo dated April 3, John Hennessy,
chief executive, and Wheat argued that the fixed-income bonus pool increased
25% from 1994 to 1995. Meanwhile its contribution to profit was 42.9% lower
than the banner year of 1993. It was not a memo to heal wounds. The implication
was that bond traders had no grounds for complaint. Traders say it is clearly
unfair and misleading to introduce a comparison of profits made in 1993,
the vintage year for the entire industry. &quot;The whole firm laughed at
that memo. It was despicable,&quot; says one. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Wild rumours</B> <BR>
<BR>
In the same memo, the firm denied that it had paid out excessively or unfairly
to executive board members. They took an average of 57% of their bonus in
deferred compensation and stock, a high proportion. Their average increase
of total pay from 1994 to 1995 was 18%, whereas the firm's overall bonus
pool was up 32%. <BR>
<BR>
Wheat himself scoffs at wild rumours that he took home $35 million -
&quot;I wish&quot; - and says his own pay was up 10% on 1994. He also
adds that in 1994, a poor year for most divisions, the firm took the largest
percentage cut in bonus pool for any group and applied it to the pay of
the executive board. <BR>
<BR>
That's still not likely to soothe traders who have seen their pay fall by
15%. <BR>
<BR>
The truth is that at CS First Boston, as at other firms, the disparity in
pay, between a few individuals and the herd, is growing. &quot;The backbone
of the business is a small number of people who you must pay as much as
possible, because you need them to protect the franchise,&quot; says Hotimsky.
&quot;Maybe some people thought they were part of that group, when they
were not.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bitterness tends to spread quickly at CS First Boston, partly because it
lacks the long-established culture and stronger sense of loyalty of a firm
like Morgan Stanley. Until 1993, the firm was deeply divided, with competing
groups in New York and Europe spitting poison at each other. <BR>
<BR>
Those rivalries have not entirely disappeared, nor has a strong new ethic
superseded them. Perhaps none ever will. &quot;There is a conflict within
CS First Boston between those who want to build a team and those who care
just about their own contribution and their own pay,&quot; says one departed
source. It sounds as if the latter group is dominant. It's also still a
firm prone to infighting. <BR>
<BR>
There is speculation that Diamond may have told Wheat that he was thinking
of leaving the firm. So when the pay dispute erupted, Wheat decided that
Diamond would make a useful scapegoat, even though 70% of the bond division's
profits in 1995 came from businesses such as Asian bonds and emerging markets
which had been built up under Diamond since 1993. <BR>
<BR>
When it became obvious inside the firm that Diamond was taking the blame
for widespread dissatisfaction over bonuses, competition between senior
fixed-income executives, fighting for position, quickly came to the surface.
For some time, there had been tension between Diamond and Patterson. Wheat
made no obvious attempt to resolve this. One former employee says: &quot;I
think Wheat would happily have locked the two of them in a room and then
worked with whoever walked out alive.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Diamond's position was already uncomfortable when Costas, the physically
big, rough-around-the-edges head government bond trader, made his bid for
power. &quot;Costas was going to Wheat and saying 'it's Diamond or me',&quot;
claims one departing managing director. &quot;Diamond became the scapegoat,
even though there was a limited amount he could do. The bonus pool could
only stretch so far.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
His was a spectacular fall. Diamond was regarded by many as <I>de facto</I>
second-in-command to Wheat. Diamond arrived at CS First Boston in 1992 from
Morgan Stanley, where he had headed European and Asian bond operations.
He did not come into the firm as one of Wheat's old lieutenants from his
days at Bankers Trust and later at CSFP. Nevertheless, the two potential
rivals seemed to think and work in similar ways. In 1992, when Wheat was
running bonds in Europe and Diamond headed the firm's Asian operations,
the two men informally agreed to increase integration and cooperation between
their regions - something previously unheard of at a firm notorious
for internal warfare. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Diamond was a Wheat friend,&quot; says one former CS First Boston
managing director. &quot;When this blew up, Wheat put business above friendship,
which was the right thing to do.&quot; Others are more sceptical. &quot;Wheat
has few professional friends,&quot; says one. &quot;He has a few lieutenants
like Brady Dougan, head of equities, Chris Goekjian, head of CSFP, and Marc
Hotimsky [now promoted to head of global fixed income]. But everyone else
is an outsider.&quot; Now departing veterans of First Boston in New York
say that Wheat has overdone his promotion of these. <BR>
<BR>
They joke that the firm is to be renamed Wheat First. Meanwhile, rumours
inside the firm are circulating once again that John Hennessy, chief executive
of CS First Boston and nominally Wheat's boss, is preparing to stand down.
<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, when Wheat became president of the firm, he and Diamond talked
often about what they called &quot;the soft issues&quot;, how to retain
people's loyalty by offering them the prospect of career development, of
equity-linked compensation and not just fat annual bonus cheques. But the
two men come from different cultures. Diamond is a veteran of the high-volume,
low-margin bond business; Wheat of the high-margin, transaction-based and
marketing-heavy derivatives business. <BR>
<BR>
Behind the scenes, relations between top executives became strained. According
to insiders, long before the bonus problem blew up, Diamond was growing
disillusioned at the direction in which Wheat was leading the firm: while
Diamond's vision was of a fixed-income division operating within a broad,
fully-integrated investment-banking business, Wheat's instinct is to manage
CS First Boston as a group of profitable niche businesses. <BR>
<BR>
This last is a charge which the firm's senior executives regularly deny
but never quite shake off. The firm has for example, taken the strategic
decision to build market share in corporate bond underwriting and this will
require some subsidies from elsewhere in the fixed-income division. But
the firm is limiting such subsidies between units. It also prides itself
on its ability to redeploy capital where it sees the best opportunities
for return on equity. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's the nature of investment banking that regularly you have to shrink
one group and build another,&quot; says Hotimsky. For example, he is thinking
of allocating capital for an expanded proprietary trading group to take
market risk and is developing appropriate risk limits and ROE goals. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the firm's financial performance compares reasonably well with
its peers'. Morgan Stanley's return on equity for the 12 months ending November
30 1995 was 13.6% compared with 15.5% for 1995 at CS First Boston, excluding
one-time items. Merrill's was 20%, Lehman's 7%. Staff worry more about the
firm's comparative size. Morgan Stanley's equity capital is $5.2 billion
and its net income last year was $609 million, compared with CS First Boston's
$1.8 billion of equity capital and $207 million of net income. &quot;We
cannot afford to be any smaller,&quot; says one manager. <BR>
<BR>
Some departing sources suggest that the management style and structure of
CS First Boston is dictated by its relationship with Credit Suisse and its
chairman, Rainer Gut. and that this ultimately limits its size. &quot;In
parts of the world, like Russia, and certain businesses, such as foreign
exchange, CS First Boston and Credit Suisse still compete,&quot; says one.
&quot;It's not like Barclays, which has even put corporate lending into
BZW. Gut likes separate little businesses, under CS Holding, each with their
own boards.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Confusion and mistrust</B> <BR>
<BR>
Following Diamond's departure, attempts to reorganize the fixed-income division
became rather messy. First, a committee was formed to run the bond business.
It included Costas, Hotimsky (then the firm's head of global emerging markets
and foreign exchange), Craig Foster and Tony Iliya (co-heads of fixed income
for Europe and Asia). <BR>
<BR>
Then Costas dropped his bombshell. Throughout the rumpus, he had been negotiating
a move to UBS, a firm keen enough to continue building up its bond business
to offer Costas a lucrative three-year contract. <BR>
<BR>
On March 21, the firm announced that Hotimsky had been appointed head of
fixed income and a member of the executive board of CS First Boston. The
business will be organized into three product groups, or clusters, as CS
First Boston calls them. Hotimsky will continue to run emerging markets
and foreign exchange, Patterson and Iliya will run corporates and capital
markets, including high-yield and investment-grade bonds and asset-backed
securities. Foster will run government bonds and futures and mortgage bonds.
<BR>
<BR>
At least Hotimsky's promotion is on the back of a good track record. The
firm made decent profits last year in his emerging markets and foreign exchange
businesses, though cynics point out those were generally strongly performing
markets. Hotimsky hopes to expand this business, for example adding research
and distribution in emerging market bonds. He is generally well respected
even by the firm's bitter departed. <BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen whether the firm's bond traders will now calm down
and pull together. On April 2, Wheat and Hennessy circulated a memo to staff
reporting preliminary first-quarter net income of $108 million, the highest
in the firm's history. If it keeps running at this pace, the firm will hit
an ROE of 23% for 1996. The memo pointedly remarks that this above-budget
performance has brought &quot;a corresponding increase in the bonus pool
accrual.&quot; A senior source adds: &quot;We've had a great four months
- way off the charts, even compared to 1993.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The firm's senior management has also been making guarantees for 1996 pay
awards to certain key staff. &quot;For some key positions, we've set a floor
under people's pay,&quot; says Hotimsky. &quot;This has been for staff who
had offers elsewhere and who we need to be comfortable with us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The firm has rehired some of the asset-backed traders who decided to quit.
&quot;You hear that the firm's in turmoil, but the problem has been in two
specific areas, fixed income in New York, and there have been some issues
in the equity department,&quot; says Wheat. &quot;We have gotten it cleaned
up. In asset-backed we've replaced research, kept all the financing people
and a couple of top traders have rejoined. Equity has had a great quarter.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In reorganizing the bond division, Hotimsky intends that in future a poor
performance in one area, such as mortgages, will not drag down pay for all
other bond traders. The business is being split into more sharply defined
units, each of which will have its bonuses more closely tied to its performance.
Each has been set goals, either for pure return on equity or for return
plus building market share as, for example, with corporate bond underwriting.
Each unit's performance against these targets and budgets will be reviewed
quarterly. <BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen, however, whether this will be enough to keep people
happy and make them feel they are working at a successful firm. <BR><BR>
 <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H2>That sinking feeling </H2>
Although it is upheavals in the bond division that have hit the headlines
recently, the cracks are showing elsewhere at CS First Boston. There have
been departures in the equities division, which performed less well than
bonds or investment banking last year. Xavier Rolet, whose highly publicized
arrival from Goldman Sachs in 1994 was supposed to herald the building of
a solid secondary European equity business, suddenly left the firm in April.
So too did top-ranked US bank analyst Tom Hanley, who took a six-strong
team to UBS in New York. One source at the firm says: &quot;Wheat has let
it be known that he is not a research person.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hanley left for different reasons to the disaffected bond dealers who left
<I>en masse</I> in March: money had nothing to do with it. His pay will
be the same at UBS as it was at CS First Boston. Nor is he publicly bitter
about his former bosses. Hanley says: &quot;I know Wheat has been raked
over the coals because of this $9 million pay cheque but I think he's worth
every cent. Picture where that firm would be now without him. He put in
the re-organization, better management disciplines, proper capital allocation.
He has done an excellent job.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But the loss of Hanley, Rolet and others aggravates a concern among many
staff at CS First Boston that their firm is falling behind the top global
investment banks and sinking into the second tier. <BR>
<BR>
For example, when Hanley arrived at First Boston early in 1992, it boasted
one of the strongest teams of investment bankers covering banks and other
financial institutions. Richard Thornburgh led this team which included
Jack McSpadden, Kenneth McPhail, Mark Monaco, and Michael Martin. Although
Martin remains, Thornburgh has moved jobs and other senior bankers have
separately left in the last year. That leaves the financial institutions
group much weakened at a time when the mergers and acquisitions frenzy in
the US banking industry shows no sign of abating. The danger for Hanley
and his team was of being left on the sidelines. <BR>
<BR>
At UBS, Hanley renews his acquaintance with former investment banking colleagues
from Salomon Brothers. This group is led by Richard Barret, and includes
Gerry Smith, Robert Nau and Alan Ginsberg. This team had already shown its
worth to UBS by winning the mandate to advise Fleet Financial Group on its
purchase of National Westminster's retail banking business in the US. <BR>
<BR>
Hanley considered the move for almost a year, while talking it over with
his former Salomon colleagues: &quot;I thought it would be great to put
together top-notch investment bankers and top-notch research.&quot; He adds:
&quot;It's uplifting to come to a group which is being built, from my previous
firm where things were getting difficult in the last year or two.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It seems CS First Boston is struggling to maintain the critical mass and
to achieve the profitability required to compete as a leading global investment
bank. <p>

<H3>STOCK EXCHANGES</H3> 

<H3> <B>Survival of the fittest</B><BR></H3>
<H4><B>Stock exchanges all over
Europe are junking floor trading for electronic trading. Power is being handed to
the intermediaries, while bourses battle over price, efficiency and liquidity.
Laura Covill considers which exchanges are likely to survive beyond 2000</B>
</H4> 

<P> "Being the president of a stock exchange isn't the most secure of
jobs," says Bengt Ryd&eacute;n with a chuckle. He should know. He has been in
charge of the Swedish bourse for over 10 years, but has had to put his job on the
line several times to force change on members.

<P> The Stockholm bourse has become surprisingly well known. It was the first in
Europe to introduce remote access, which gives intermediaries without a local
office the opportunity to trade on the Stockholm Stock Exchange via an electronic
link.

<P> Other stock exchange chiefs &#173; who still have a few rounds to go in the
fight over electronic trading, remote access, the local brokers' monopoly and
other sensitive issues &#173; listen with respect as Ryd&eacute;n explains his
three-stage strategy.

<P> First, in 1989 Stockholm abandoned floor trading and went electronic. Second,
by 1993 it had become a private company which gives issuers and investors an
equal say with the brokers. The third stage, which began in 1993, was to go
international by introducing remote membership.

<P> Ryd&eacute;n persuaded the Swedish parliament to approve the scheme in 1992
so it was ready long before Sweden joined the EU at the beginning of 1995. Thanks
to its head start, this medium-sized exchange now has more remote members than
any other bourse in Europe.

<P> In one country after another, intermediaries are taking up the opportunities
offered under the EU's investment services directive (ISD) by gaining remote
access to more of Europe's bourses.

<P> Since 1994 Frankfurt's Deutsche B&ouml;rse has set up remote access points in
London, Amsterdam, Paris and Zurich, and has attracted 44 remote members. Another
14 brokers have opted for a direct link. Frank Mattern, a specialist consultant
at McKinsey, who advised Deutsche B&ouml;rse on its Zeus remote access strategy,
expects the number of remote members to swell to at least 100 within three to
five years.

<P> Thanks to the ISD it now makes sense for large intermediaries to concentrate
much of their trading, together with risk management, in a single centre.
Bayerische Vereinsbank has opted for its home town of Munich on the grounds that
location gives no particular advantage, while Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's more
conventional choice is its vast new trading floor in London.

<P> The balance of power has passed to the intermediaries, and away from the
stock exchanges and the state regulators who control them.

<P> <B>Electronic natural selection</B>

<P> Over the next five years, Europe's stock exchanges will have to get used to
competing with each other. Stockholm has been the first to introduce remote
access, but electronic trading, price, efficiency, investment in improved
technology and the struggle to maintain liquidity will also determine which
bourses will come out on top.

<P> "No legal monopoly prevails any more, so issuers and investors are free to
leave us for greener pastures if they find our services below par or our prices
uncompetitive," says Ryd&eacute;n.

<P> Deutsche B&ouml;rse's chairman Rolf Breuer believes that a process of natural
selection among bourses is inevitable, since Europe has 32 spot and 23 futures
exchanges "with more or less the same structure and products". He argues that
their numbers are bound to decline.

<P> "The US market is vastly more competitive, expert and creative than anything
we can offer on this side of the Atlantic," says Breuer, his choice of words
indicating that this includes London, not just continental European bourses.

<P> What's more, entirely new competitors will spring up to challenge the
existing stock exchanges. Werner Seifert, chief executive of Deutsche B&ouml;rse,
warns that the number of competitors is increasing more quickly than he had
expected. "The threat is less from the traditional competitors we know well," he
says. Instead, unregulated electronic exchanges will make the running.

<P> At present all Europe's stock exchanges benefit from regulations that
essentially give them a legal monopoly in their home markets, but that is
expected to disappear in most countries within 10 years.

<P> Deutsche B&ouml;rse's strategy is therefore to offer "the full range of
securities-related services" &#173; not just trading &#173; in an attempt to
distinguish itself from emerging competitors such as Tradepoint.

<P> Market participants are divided on whether Internet trading is a threat. Jean
Fran&ccedil;ois Th&eacute;odore, chairman of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des
Bourses Fran&ccedil;aises (SBF), is confident that the Internet cannot offer the
mechanisms for clearing and settlement; others insist it's merely a matter of
improved security before retail investors can buy and sell securities on-line.

<P> What's certain is that the traditional stock exchanges will have to make the
most of their track records. "The [established] stock exchanges have the goodwill
of integrity and of institutional authority," says Stockholm's Ryd&eacute;n. "We
must now capitalize on this."

<P> Bourses will also need to be efficient low-cost operations in order to fend
off these new trading networks. "Bourses are really just systems houses," says
Mattern at McKinsey.

<P> For a start, competition will force down trading fees. Stockholm's charges
have been reduced to $2 per trade, one-third of the level five years ago, and the
brokers are passing that reduction on to customers.

<P> In turn, Swedish brokers have recently begun to cut their prices almost
daily: one local member charges institutional investors just half a basis point
in commission, while Enskilda lowered commission, at a stroke, by 30% in June.
Likewise, Amsterdam charges no trading fee for deals channelled through its new
electronic IBIS system. As a result, IBIS now handles 10% of Amsterdam's volume.

<P> Giles Vardey, market development director at the London Stock Exchange,
boasts that his costs have been reduced to just one basis point or 0.01% of
volume. That is still 10 times higher than Stockholm. Other bourses would rather
not mention their cost ratios.

<P> Mattern is not concerned that bourses will expire because they cost too much
to run. "You have to ask yourself what is the minimum efficiency for a stock
exchange. In fact, much of the cost is variable, so the minimum efficiency is
quite low."

<P> The biggest expense facing bourses is the introduction of electronic trading.
For example, Deutsche B&ouml;rse's new EHS system is costing Dm150 million($101
million).

<P> Some smaller stock exchanges are further ahead than the larger ones, such as
the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B&ouml;rse, largely because their
electronic trading systems were simpler and easier to install. But their cousins
are catching up fast.

<P> Increasingly, the small bourses will rely on larger or more advanced
competitors for parts of their trading, clearing and settlement systems. The
Paris Bourse has already sold its New Trading System in modified form to Madrid,
Luxembourg and Bilbao. Likewise Deutsche B&ouml;rse is hoping to resell EHS after
its launch in 1998.

<P> More collaboration of this kind should avoid today's wastefulness, where each
bourse is investing tens of millions of dollars in new electronic trading
systems. It will also allow even small exchanges to afford a sophisticated,
up-to-date electronic trading system. No-one need be priced out of the market
altogether.

<P> Despite the spread of electronic trading, brokers will stay in business,
believes Boudewijn van Ittersum, chairman of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange,
because major investors will remain reluctant to trade in the open. Brokers will
be required as market-makers to prevent liquidity going to bigger centres such as
London.

<P> What will happen, argues Ittersum, is that the number of brokers will be
reduced. Already, Amsterdam's 30 securities brokers have been reduced to seven,
and their numbers could eventually be cut to about four, he says.

<P> The definition of a broker will change, too, as large fund managers decide to
conduct trading themselves rather than rely on brokers. Mattern at McKinsey
points out that all Germany's big fund managers are, in legal status, banks so
they are perfectly entitled to trade on the stock exchange. So far, their parent
banks have presumably barred them from doing so in order to reserve the business
for themselves.

<P> At the same time, investors and issuers will get more powerful as the
Internet makes real-time market information accessible to the whole world, not
just to members of the exchange or to banks. In Stockholm, unusually, investors
already have access to the electronic order book, although only members of the
exchange see the brokers' names involved in each trade.

<P> So investors and issuers will have more say in the ultimate question of where
liquidity will be in five years' time.

<P> Even though a single European currency will not be fully introduced by 2000,
it will almost certainly be widely used by large listed companies and thus by the
capital markets. Once the euro is introduced Breuer expects portfolio managers to
alter their approach overnight and to plan their investments by sector, and not
by geographical lines.

<P> "It has become obsolete for a portfolio manager to focus on the little
kingdom of his domestic market. In future, currencies will be obsolescent and the
sector will be the focus of attention," says Breuer.

<P> <B>Guarding home-grown liquidity</B>

<P> So it seems old-fashioned for Amsterdam, for instance, to claim to be the
home of Dutch equities when several of those stocks are truly global. "Swiss
stocks should not be able to find a way to bypass the Zurich bourse" is the aim
of Otto N&auml;geli, one of the managing directors. Each of Europe's stock
exchanges aims to retain most of the liquidity in its own national blue chips.

<P> They are favoured by the fact that once liquidity is established it is very
hard to shift. Germany's futures exchange, DTB, managed to establish liquidity in
Bund futures trading only when the big German banks made a concerted effort to
withdraw their business from London's Liffe and transfer it to Frankfurt.
Nevertheless, DTB's share of the market is still only about 30%.

<P> More intermediaries will soon spring up as investors start trading on their
own behalf, but as newcomers to the trading community they will inevitably use
the liquidity in the biggest centre, rather than trying to start a new pool of
liquidity elsewhere. Moreover, remote access will allow brokers to do business in
the largest pool of liquidity &#173; usually a stock's home market &#173; rather
than having to rely on the second-biggest pool, usually London.

<P> "The investment services directive has created a return to home markets,"
says Ryd&eacute;n of Stockholm. "In the late 1980s many people thought that the
mega-markets would take the lion's share of global trading. Small exchanges that
could not wage a fight based on service and trading costs would dry up and
literally disappear. That hasn't been the case."

<P> Ryd&eacute;n believes that around 90% of Swedish share trading is still done
in Stockholm, arguing that London claims the same lead only because it is
counting double. Moreover, trading in German blue chips has largely
desertedLondon's Seaq and returned to Frankfurt ever since Deutsche B&ouml;rse
introduced IBIS, its first electronic trading system.

<P> Only when the bourses are completely deregulated, argues Vardey of the London
Stock Exchange, will liquidity became mobile. "Then Daimler-Benz's liquidity
might come to London."

<P> The nightmare of vanishing liquidity explains the sudden enthusiasm at
several European bourses for promoting small- and mid-caps as attractive new
market segments. Indeed, Deutsche B&ouml;rse regards the development of these
markets as its most important objective.

<P> Small- and mid-caps will always be dominated by domestic, not international
investors. Therefore they are less likely than multi-nationals like Daimler-Benz
to be driven away from their original bourses by powerful capital.

<P> The Nouveau March&eacute; in Paris has already had seven initial public
offerings since its launch in February and expects the number to grow to 30 by
the end of the year. Frankfurt and Brussels are eagerly following suit,
persuading domestic companies to list for the first time and inducing brokers to
become active market-makers.

<P> While the multinationals will list in several centres, the small-caps will
choose just one market: their own backyard. The exception will be technology
firms, which are now regarded as natural candidates for Nasdaq and its planned
European counterpart, Easdaq.

<P> <B>Survival for all</B>

<P> So the bourses will rely more on smaller issuers and also on retail
investors. "Many banks can do without us tomorrow. We have to provide services
for all investors," says Vardey. A consoling thought: brokers' margins are best
in the medium-sized sector, too.

<P> So as long as each of Europe's bourses can retain liquidity in a few stocks
and operate efficiently enough to charge market prices, all should survive in
some form. Strategists at Europe's main stock exchanges now believe that
"cooperation" will define their activities in five years' time.

<P> Mattern at McKinsey believes that within five to seven years an oligopoly of
three or four "clusters" will emerge, each centred on a European bourse. At the
centre of each cluster will be the bourse that has the most liquidity and the
most important stocks in a region. It will also have become a leader in
developing trading, clearing and settlement systems, and selling them on to less
innovative stock competitors.

<P> Because of the size and investor reach of its largest stocks, Frankfurt is
bound to be at the centre of one cluster. Deutsche B&ouml;rse has responded well
by positioning itself as a pan-European service provider. It operates as a German
institution and part of Finanzplatz &#173; the fact that it is in Frankfurt is
now of secondary importance.

<P> Frankfurt's potential satellites are the centres dominated by German issuers
and investors: Vienna, Zurich and all the stock exchanges in eastern Europe.
Potentially, Frankfurt could dominate the largest cluster of all and thus become
the predominant stock exchange in Europe.

<P> The particular strengths of Paris are the electronic trading technology
already sold to others and the lead it has taken by setting up the Nouveau
March&eacute;. The liquidity of France's international stocks is also important.

<P> Stockholm has a good chance of becoming the centre of what Mattern calls the
"Nordic cluster". Remote membership has already attracted several brokers from
Norway, Denmark and Finland: in April, foreign investors accounted for a record
44% of equity trading volume.

<P> The real unknown is the London Stock Exchange, which operates a liquid market
in almost every important European stock but will not be able to offer remote
access until its electronic trading system for the FTSE-100 is in place next
year.

<P> Furthermore, as Vardey admits, prejudices against the LSE as a restrictive
club which is insensitive to costs and stuck in the 19th century, still run deep.
Which smaller European bourses will become satellites of London depends on the
success of the electronic trading system. "The end game is access to European
investors and issuers," says Vardey.

<P> Although each national bourse will always have the bulk of liquidity in
individual securities from its own country, Vardey points out that trading
pan-European baskets of securities tends to happen in London already. The London
Stock Exchange likes to compare itself with New York and Tokyo, not with European
exchanges at all.

<P> The national stock exchanges on the edge of each cluster will turn into
regional centres, like the seven illiquid regional markets found in Germany, and
the two provincial exchanges in Switzerland and Italy.

<P> Cooperation will increase even between clusters, as the collaboration between
Paris and Frankfurt shows. The much-hyped cooperation between these two cities
may have withered to a scheme for producing a common front end for two separate
trading systems, but it should be enough to make the two bourses a powerful force
in Europe 2000.

<P> Although the two bourses decided that a single trading system would prove too
expensive, they nevertheless hope to create a single front end, so that brokers
can see Frankfurt and Paris on a single screen. Th&eacute;odore of the  SBF hopes
that London's Sequence electronic trading system, which is due to come on stream
in May 1997, will allow a similar link with the London Stock Exchange.

<P> "We will keep in touch and have some kind of strategic committee," says
Th&eacute;odore. "Most important is politics and the idea of cooperation," he
says hinting at the political considerations that dog the development of all
European stock exchanges.

<P> Europe's stock exchanges remain highly political organizations. Now that the
threat to their continued existence has been acknowledged, politicians will be
even more reluctant to see them disappear.

<P> But the future for Europe's stock exchanges is not all bad. "Closing the
local stock exchange is not something I see politicians doing," says Mattern.
"The bourse will continue to exist, even if it is only a window or a web site on
a system."

<H3>MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS</H3>



 <H2><B>Boutiques for sale</B> </H2> 
 
 <H4> <B>Within the past year two of the most
respected investment banking boutiques have been sold &#173; Gleacher to NatWest
and Wolfensohn to Bankers Trust.  Do those deals mark the beginning of a trend
and, if so, which targets are left? Stephen Neish talks to the main players</B>
</H4> 

<P> "Sorry, we're not selling it this month, maybe next," quips John
Herrmann, head of investment banking boutique The Bridgeford Group, as he comes
to the telephone, aware only that <I>Euromoney</I> is calling to discuss
boutiques.

<P> His reaction typifies the current excitement surrounding investment banking
boutiques in New York. What used to be dismissed as vanity shops for dealmakers
who disliked being accountable to management committees have acquired respect.
Two of the better-known firms, Gleacher &amp; Co and Wolfensohn Inc, sold
themselves within the last year for sums which woke the investment banking world
with a jolt. NatWest Markets North America, part of the UK-based National
Westminster Bank, paid $135 million to have Eric Gleacher and a dozen of his
associates join the company in October 1995, while Bankers Trust announced in May
that it was paying $210 million for the 55 professionals at Wolfensohn.

<P> The excitement is over who will be next. Foreign banks are circling. Boutique
owners are acting coy. The dining room of the Four Seasons hotel on New York's
57<SUP>th</SUP> Street is a prandial casting couch. Everybody is having lunch.

<P> Herrmann is a step removed from the courtship. He founded his boutique with
$50 million of capital from the Industrial Bank of Japan in 1990, giving the
Japanese concern ownership of Bridgeford. That has not stopped four or five
institutions approaching him about a business combination. But does the loss of
independence for some of the leading boutiques mean the concept is waning? Not at
all says Herrmann: "It just shows how valuable these things are."

<P> Boutiques thrive because advisory mandates are won on the back of
relationships, not products. That they have become a more visible part of the
investment banking landscape over the last five or six years is mainly due to the
M&amp;A cycle. Dealmakers at bulge bracket firms were able to build up enough
transaction experience and personal credibility during the last merger wave to
leave their employers and take their clients with them. That left chief
executives with a choice between institutions with analytical firepower or
individuals they knew and whose judgement they trusted. Says Peter Solomon, who
set up the firm which bears his name in 1989: "It's hard for a CEO to call up
even the best 40-year-old partner at Morgan Stanley and say I want to approach
this company. He doesn't know that CEO. He doesn't have the access."

<P> A common misconception is that the boutiques serve middle-market companies
which cannot afford the services of the bulge-bracket banks. While that may be
true for regional firms, the New York boutiques boast impressive Fortune 100
names in their client lists. "It's like retailing," says Bruce Wasserstein, who
co-founded what has become the largest of these operations, Wasserstein Perella
&amp; Co: "There is always a spot for premium-level attention." Solomon puts it
differently: "We walk the dogs, we wash the windows and we do weekends. We
provide old-fashioned investment banking."

<P> That dedication may lead to mandates, but larger firms are rarely excluded.
Most of the companies hiring boutiques as idea shops will also be in search of
underwriting strength or spreadsheet processing power. "We're not displacing
someone, we're adding another dimension," claims David Offensend, a partner at
Evercore Partners in New York, the firm founded by former US deputy treasury
secretary Roger Altman. Three of Evercore's clients employ JP Morgan, Goldman
Sachs and Lehman Brothers on Evercore assignments.

<P> Whether sharing fee income or not, the economics of boutiques is compelling.
A firm earning $50 million in revenue would probably have employee, occupancy and
communications costs of around $10 million. If, as could typically be the case,
the firm had five partners, they are left with $8 million each at the end of the
year.

<P> But if the numbers are so attractive, why would boutiques trade their
independence?

<P> First, because the numbers offered by acquirers are even more attractive. On
the day last October that NatWest announced it was paying $135 million for
Gleacher &amp; Co &#173; over $4 million for every partner, secretary and junior
analyst in the building &#173; <I>Euromoney</I> happened to be interviewing
dealmakers at some of the other boutiques, all of whom found it difficult to
contain their excitement about the valuations the deal implied for their own
firms. Peter Hall, chief executive of NatWest Markets North America, has drawn a
lot of criticism over the price: "People who speculate that we've paid too much
for the business simply don't know how profitable it is," he responds.

<P> Other reasons to sell, according to those at boutiques, include the
frustrations that are the downside of life at a small firm. According to Paul
Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank who served as chairman of
Wolfensohn Inc: "There is a natural tension. A boutique implies a certain limited
size. That puts constraints on growth. There's no doubt that tension existed at
our firm." Around 40% of the deals Wolfensohn worked on had a non-US element, but
a boutique trying to expand into Europe and Asia needs capital, both human and
financial.

<P> The focus that boutiques brag about is also a handicap, in that having
advised a firm to raise capital, most boutiques are not in a position to assist.
Solomon, for example, claims he is a net recommender of business to other Wall
Street firms. To rainmakers it is galling to see fee income disappear because
their boutiques cannot handle underwritings or bridging loans. Says Solomon: "I
estimate for every dollar of business I generate I am unable to take advantage of
another dollar of business. I just gave a $2 million fee to First Boston to do a
bridge financing."

<P> Dealmakers who are worth the large sums being paid are unlikely to surrender
independence lightly. In the wake of Bankers Trust's acquisition of Wolfensohn,
nine of the boutique's partners are joining the bank's partnership, an entity for
the top managing directors, while Volcker will serve on the main board. Of the
nine partners, three will join Bankers Trust's management committee. Says one of
those three, Glen Lewy: "I don't think it would have appealed to us to have been
a box in the lower left-hand corner of somebody's organizational chart." In the
Gleacher transaction, Eric Gleacher became chairman of NatWest Markets North
America, serving alongside CEO Peter Hall.

<P> Some commentators warn against trying to extrapolate a trend from the two
deals seen to date. "There are idiosyncratic phenomena involved in each of
those," says one boutique founder, who prefers not to be identified. "The first
is that Jim left and, though Wolfensohn is an excellent firm, Jim's involvement
in it was extremely important. He was the dominant rainmaker." James Wolfensohn
left the firm he founded to take on the presidency of the World Bank in 1995. The
implication that the boutique had to seek a combination because Wolfensohn had
left is flatly rejected by partners at the firm. "We were not shopping the
company," says Volcker. "But I'm not saying we were never approached by other
companies."

<P> The second phenomenon the source notes is that the Gleacher boutique had by
far its best year immediately prior to the sale, increasing the valuation range a
potential acquirer would have to pay. "If you were ever going to do anything like
that, doing it in a hot M&amp;A market off a high [earnings figure] is a good
time to do it and Eric is a smart guy," he says. Gleacher counters: "In the first
six months that we were together with NatWest we did more business than we did in
any year of our independent existence." He cites the addition of a financing
capability as the reason.

<P> <B>A need for relationships</B>

<P> More important than any desire on the part of owners to sell has been the
interest shown by acquirers. But why are the deals happening now? "The banks
haven't solved the M&amp;A problem well," says Solomon. "The foreign underwriters
haven't done it at all." Non-US institutions have long recognized that for talk
of a global presence to be meaningful they need to have a US investment banking
capability. A lack of credibility in merger and advisory services can often hand
not only the merger mandate but also underwriting and other fees to a rival
institution. And in an era when banks are trying to cement long-term
relationships with companies, advisory links to the CEO are worth more than links
a commercial bank's relationship manager has to the CFO or treasurer.

<P> While the theory has been understood for some time, the means of achieving
such relationships has remained illusory. Some European institutions, including
the former SG Warburg, spent millions in the US trying to build a presence
piecemeal. When the M&amp;A market was quiet, it was not clear whether such a
tactic was working. With the boom of the last three years, it is clear that it
has failed. The US firms have broken into Europe in a way that European firms
have failed to do in New York.

<P> In the US itself, moves towards relaxation of the regulatory separation of
commercial and investment banking activities &#173; first in the form of the
Leach Bill, which attempted to repeal many provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act,
and more lately the Federal Reserve Bank's proposal to increase the revenue
limits imposed on commercial banks' securities subsidiaries &#173; have led to an
environment where banks are considering how they should best move toward being
full-service financial institutions. Even if boutiques themselves have no
underwriting or high-yield bond capabilities, which in some cases they do, there
is, in one banker's words, "nothing like the M&amp;A business for leads to the
underwriting business".

<P> Finally, the strength of the deal business over the past three years has
attracted new players. "We have not seen the last of these NatWest-type
investments," says Martin Wade, managing director at Salomon Brothers in New
York. "The big guys have the cashflow that they want to deploy into a
higher-margin or faster-growing business. Plus they get the added benefit of
instant visibility."

<P> In the case of Bankers Trust, the need was clear. Says CEO Frank Newman: "We
had some M&amp;A, but it wasn't world class." In a presentation to the board at
the beginning of the year, Newman set forth his strategic objectives for the
firm. They included having a credible M&amp;A capability.

<P> One senior Wall Street figure points out that Bankers Trust bought more than
advisory relationships. Citing the difficulties the firm has had with law suits
over derivative products and a recent scandal involving tape recordings of its
bankers, the source argues that the most valuable part of the deal was the
addition of Volcker to the bank's board. Says the source: "Paul Volcker spends
time at the bank, he meets with corporate clients and says, 'I don't know what
they were doing here before, but I can tell you from having been the most
prestigious central banker in the world, this place is absolutely fine.' What is
that worth? How much money can be generated if the corporate community comes back
to Bankers Trust?"

<P> Newman, a former CFO of BankAmerica who replaced Charles Sanford as chief
executive of Bankers Trust at the beginning of the year and as chairman on April
16, recognizes there were problems: "Clearly at Bankers Trust we were in a
stabilization and rebuilding mode for various reasons," he says. "We went through
very difficult years in 1994 and 1995. I could see the potential for the company,
and I had a vision of rebuilding and demonstrating publicly &#173; and to our own
people &#173; that the company was once again turning out respectable performance
and building from that to the point where it would be easier to do a combination
with somebody." Conversations with Newman's long-time acquaintance Volcker led to
that combination earlier than he had envisaged.

<P> Bankers Trust will not be the last of the buyers. Gleacher claims to have
been approached by a handful of institutions before siding with NatWest. Herrmann
talks of a similar number of approaches. Chase Manhattan Bank is known to have
discussed possible combinations with two boutiques. Observers say Union Bank of
Switzerland, Citicorp, Swiss Bank Corporation and Barclays Bank are all looking
to increase their US presence. JP Morgan is also rumoured to be a buyer &#173;
but of a larger organization. Says one banker at a possible target: "What will
Dresdner do here? Maybe they are satisfied with a European presence. I doubt it.
They'll find it will be hard to compete by the year 2000 just having a European
merchant bank."

<P> There may be interest, but many buyers may already be late to the trough. The
problem with boutiques, according to Eric Gleacher, is that "there aren't very
many of them &#173; you're hard pressed to put a list together. Then, at the next
level, which ones have the capacity to amalgamate with a large financial
organization and create a successful more diverse business?"

<P> The idea that talent should be acquired as part of a firm, and not by hiring
individuals, has led some analysts to question whether an acquisition premium
should be paid for human capital. For some banks, according to Steve Schwarzman,
chief executive of The Blackstone Group, there is no other choice: "It's the
ability to attract people where they couldn't be attracted at all before," he
says. The dearth of rainmakers confounds the problem. Says Herrmann: "For the
experienced production talent, there's not a price at which you can hire them, so
you buy their firms."

<P> One bank which has turned away from buying a boutique is Deutsche Bank North
America, which inherited, through its acquisition of Morgan Grenfell in 1990, a
fee-sharing relationship with Gleacher &amp; Co. That the bank did not acquire
Gleacher surprised many. A source at Deutsche Bank however describes NatWest's
acquisition of Gleacher as "very rich". He adds: "Reporters like to play it as if
we are splashing money around left right and centre, but this is still a very
conservative bank." Without acquiring a boutique, the bank has had difficulty
making its presence felt in the US merger market, advising on only two deals of
note &#173; chemical company Mearl's acquisition of Engelhardt and Pure
Software's acquisition of Atria. Says one observer: "They may be trading a lot of
bonds, but they're not making any inroads into this business."

<P> For those banks torn between buying a boutique at a premium and cherry
picking bankers from different organizations, Schwarzman has some advice:
"There's a huge difference in the value that <I>really</I> first-rate people,
first-rate people and second-rate people can bring to an organization," he says.
"I'm not surprised to see the amounts being paid." Newman at Bankers Trust,
having spent $210 million of his shareholders' money on a firm with 10
partner-level dealmakers, is adamant that hiring individuals would have been a
false economy. "There's tremendous value," he says, "in the smooth functioning of
an existing firm. Hence the premium."

<P> For those banks still interested in paying that premium, here is
<I>Euromoney</I>'s guide to the boutiques that just might still be for sale.

<P> <B>PETER J SOLOMON CO</B>

<H1> <B>Just how much could one man  be worth?</B> </H1> <P> "When you start
a business as I did, people think you're a one-act play," says Peter Solomon, the
former chairman of Shearson Lehman's merchant banking division who now heads
boutique Peter J Solomon Company. "Eric, Jim and Johnny have demonstrated that we
are serious business guys, here for the long term with people under us." The
references to boutique owners Gleacher, Wolfensohn and Herrmann, who have sold to
larger institutions, is a sign to many that Solomon is keen to sell the firm he
founded seven years ago, while interest in boutiques is high. The boss himself
does not want to look too keen. "The only reason to do it is to institutionalize
your business. Everyone says you'd do it for money; well, it's true, but you'd
have to see real advantages," he says.

<P> One disadvantage Solomon faces is the firm's high degree of specialization.
Solomon's father was an executive with the Federated Department Store chain. When
he was growing up, Solomon got to know Federated's management trainees, who went
on to run some of the largest retailers in the US, hence his first-rate contacts
within the retailing sector. Says a colleague from his Lehman Brothers days:
"He's very specialized, but he does real business in his area."

<P> Despite Solomon's 30-plus years of experience, buying Peter J Solomon Co does
not solve the corporate advisory equation for a would-be full-service bank.
According to Solomon, that has not stopped people approaching him. But despite
his protests that his partners handle an increasing amount of the business,
Solomon is still considered by those who know him well to be the sole provider of
business at his firm. Says another former colleague from Lehman: "Peter is as
good a banker as there is on the face of the earth. But there's a difference
between building a firm and having a one-man presence who is the best at
something. How do you capitalize one human being when he's almost 60 years old?"

<P> <B>GREENHILL &amp; CO</B>

<H1> <B>Speculation surrounds nascent boutique </B> </H1> <P> The most recent
investment banking boutique to be formed &#173; at least until his former Morgan
Stanley colleague Steve Waters sets up shop &#173; is Bob Greenhill's Greenhill
&amp; Co. Already rumours abound that Greenhill is planning a combination with
Deutsche Bank North America, in whose building Greenhill has taken offices.

<P> Early infusions of capital are the norm rather than the exception in the
early days of boutiques, allowing founders to hire talent while waiting for the
fees to role in. Eric Gleacher sold a 25% share of his firm's fee income to
Morgan Grenfell on founding Gleacher &amp; Co in 1990, while in its first year
Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co sold 20% of itself to Nomura for $100 million. For
the moment, however, Deutsche Bank is playing down a possible combination. Says a
spokeswoman: "Bob Greenhill is leasing space in our building. He has friends in
the bank, he needed space. There's no business connection, it's a friendly
connection." Greenhill declined requests for an interview for this article.

<P> Whereas most investment bankers have launched their boutiques to a fanfare of
publicity after a number of good years at a bulge-bracket firm, Greenhill is
starting his after failing to move up the management ranks at Morgan Stanley and
a troubled time running brokerage house Smith Barney. But most senior dealmakers
rate Greenhill's chances of success as high. Says one seasoned boutique owner:
"Bob is an absolutely first-class major-league M&amp;A talent. He will get
business. But Bob couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag. The fact that he
couldn't run a wire house with 10,000 people, why would he be able to do that?
The deal business is a different business." Adds another: "Let's assume Bob
Greenhill works on five transactions a year at $5 million a pop, which he'll get
if he's lucky, and a bunch of smaller ones which he'll have junior people do.
He'll be very successful."

<P> <B>EVERCORE PARTNERS</B>

<H1> <B>Small and young, but with some powerful friends</B> </H1> <P> The wave of
interest in boutiques has come too soon for newcomer Evercore Partners. Founded
last autumn by former deputy US Treasury secretary Roger Altman and three
partners, the boutique is already beginning to resemble a baby Blackstone, which
is perhaps not surprising given that Altman and co-founder Austin Beutner served
as partners at the Schwarzman and Peterson firm. The partners plan to divide
their efforts between the advisory and private equity businesses, and are in the
process of raising a $300 million fund. But with the firm only just approaching
its first anniversary, few potential acquirers are going to see Evercore as a
ready-made entr&eacute;e into the advisory world.

<P> Those that can wait should note that Evercore has had a promising start.
Co-founders Altman, Beutner, David Offensend and Walter Dec have been joined by
five professional staff and a four-man advisory board comprising Edwin Artzt,
former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble; Michael Jordan, CEO of
Westinghouse Electric; Gerald Greenwald, CEO of United Airlines; and Robert M
Bass, the Texan investor who heads Keystone. Those relationships have already
paid dividends. The firm had barely opened its doors when Altman's friendship
with Jordan, dating back to the Westinghouse head's days at PepsiCo, had landed
the firm advisory roles in Jordan's $5.4 billion media gamble, the acquisition of
CBS; and Westinghouse's $3.6 billion divestiture of its defence electronics group
to Northrop Grumman.

<P> The firm currently has four clients paying a retainer, but will only confirm
Westinghouse as one. Two of the other three, according to Offensend, were
referrals, with which none of the Evercore partners had a prior relationship. "We
thought there was a real niche opportunity there but I don't think we thought we
would have four Fortune 50 clients within six to nine months," he says. Is the
firm listening to potential suitors? "We're strictly focused on building our
franchise and have no thoughts about selling it. That's so far off into the
future," says Offensend, interrupting his vacation in the San Juan islands to
talk to <I>Euromoney</I>. Altman himself was out of contact, on a western-style
horse trek in Wyoming.

<P> <B>WASSERSTEIN PERELLA</B>

<H1> <B>Would Wasserstein work for you?</B> </H1> <P> By far the biggest name to
remain independent is Bruce Wasserstein, chairman of super-boutique Wasserstein
Perella, the firm he and fellow First Boston managing director Joe Perella set up
in February 1988.

<P> The boutique's founders distinguished themselves as two of the few dealmakers
to advise on larger and more visible transactions in a boutique setting than they
did as part of a large investment banking firm. The young Wasserstein Perella
&amp; Co collected fees for advising Kohlberg Kravis Roberts on its $29 billion
takeover of RJR Nabisco; Beecham Group in its $17 billion merger with SmithKline
Beckman; Philip Morris on its $13 billion purchase of Kraft; and on the $16
billion Time-Warner merger. As the epitome of 1980s' dealmakers, the duo were
lionized by the press until some of the less well known deals the firm advised on
failed, at which point press coverage turned sour. Says one of the managing
directors of the firm: "We either sought, encouraged or welcomed a relatively
high profile early on. That's a dangerous line to walk. The value of that when
you start up is that you get immediate attention; people tend to focus on you.
The disadvantage is when you stumble, it is exaggerated."

<P> The firm's fortunes sank to their nadir in the summer of 1993 when Perella
left to join Morgan Stanley. But according to senior M&amp;A lawyer Marty Lipton,
partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen and Katz, the impact on the firm's reputation of
various high-level departures has been overstated: "There's no question that the
firm went through wrenching changes in the 1990s. But if you look at the M&amp;A
departments of all of the investment banks, except for Lazard, they all went
through the same changes." Wasserstein, described variously as "brilliant", "a
genius" and "radioactive", is philosophical about the period: "In this business,
one season M&amp;A is in, the next it is out. People throw pies when it's out and
flowers when it's in."

<P> In the past 12 months they have begun throwing flowers again. The firm has
begun to reappear on deal lists, representing Softbank Corporation in its $2.1
billion acquisition of Ziff-Davis publishing; Maybelline, which was owned by an
investment fund controlled by Wasserstein Perella, in its $611 sale to
L'Or&eacute;al; and Kirk Kerkorian in his dealings with Chrysler subsequent to
his misjudged hostile takeover attempt. While the mega deals are not yet back,
banks thinking of acquiring large-scale instant credibility in mergers and
acquisitions might prefer to strike before large influxes of fee income have
pushed up the firm's valuation.

<P> The firm's 90 corporate finance professionals, out of a total of 180
professionals and 190 support staff, would create a plug-and-play department for
an acquirer. Wasserstein himself counts 14 suitors in need of investment banking
skills. Have any of them approached him? "As a smart observer, you've got to
assume that we'd be pretty high on people's interest list," he says. "That
doesn't make them necessarily high on ours." Is he seeking a buyer? "We really
haven't thought about [selling the firm]. We've thought from time to time about
specific alliances for specific things, like high yield. What is the advantage
for us? We're fortunate enough that economics aren't the driving force. Unless
you wanted to retire, there's no compelling reason."

<P> <B>BLACKSTONE GROUP</B>

<H1> <B>Sweetest pill hardest to swallow</B> </H1> <P> When bankers assess the
boutiques still available in the wake of the Gleacher and Wolfensohn sales, the
name most often mentioned is the Blackstone Group, the firm founded by Steve
Schwarzman and Pete Peterson in October 1985. "We've seen what's happened in each
of those situations," notes Schwarzman, adding: "We would be quite desirable to
some of these outside people, because of our scale and the fact that there's a
scarcity value to these boutiques."

<P> The reputation of the two founders is such that even if the 70 or so
professionals at Blackstone were not enough to fill an acquirer's corporate
finance department, additions could be readily hired. The difficulty which has
potential buyers calling their lawyers is that roughly half of Blackstone's
business is private equity investing.

<P> The current fund has $1.3 billion to invest. Schwarzman claims that the
presence of the fund does not preclude an outside acquirer purchasing the firm.
However, current regulations, which date from the Glass-Steagall Act, prevent
banks from holding more than 5% of the voting stock or 25% of the equity of a
company. Even investments up to those limits must be passive. Controlling a
boutique which operated and advised an investment fund could therefore breach
securities legislation.

<P> Observers note that Gleacher &amp; Co had to dissolve its merchant banking
fund before winning approval from the Federal Reserve Board for its deal with
NatWest Markets North America. According to Frank Puleo, partner in the banking
and institutional investments group at law firm Milbank Tweed Hadley &amp;
McCloy: "If the boutique and or its principals own a substantial interest in the
fund, life becomes considerably more complicated on the bank regulatory side.
It's not impossible, but a good deal of structuring has to be done."

<P> There is a good deal of speculation that regulatory concerns prevented Chase
Manhattan Bank from buying Blackstone. Group head of global investment banking at
Chase, Jimmy Lee, and vice-chairman Bill Harrison spoke to both Gleacher and
Schwarzman before embarking on a team-building exercise for the M&amp;A
department, beginning with the hiring of Mark Davis from Salomon Brothers. There
were also question marks about where senior figures such as Peterson would fit
into the senior management structure at Chase, already overcrowded in the wake of
the merger with Chemical Bank.

<P> For those with friends at the Fed though, Blackstone is still for
hire.

<H2>Reed reshuffles the pack </H2>
<H4>Chairman John Reed's successor could be any one of half a dozen managers
running the new streamlined Citicorp - Reed is giving nothing away about
his favoured choice. But this group is fast changing the culture of the
&quot;largest small bank in the world&quot; as it retools its approach to
branded products and global coverage. Peter Lee reports </H4>
After five years of crisis management and recovery from its near-fatal brush
with commercial real-estate lending, Citicorp is implementing its plans
for the next century. It intends to be a very different bank from the leviathan
that lurched from one crisis to the next in the 1980s. That bank was decentralized,
thinly capitalized, poorly managed and diverse. <BR>
<BR>
This one will be the opposite. It will be dominated by just two strong divisions:
consumer banking worldwide, and emerging market wholesale banking. A third
and lesser division, commercial banking in the developed world, will concentrate
on a handful of profitable products, dealing with an exclusive customer
list. One of its main tasks will be to track these customers as they expand
across borders, especially into emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
There will be no sudden lurch into insurance, information technology or
global investment banking. <BR>
<BR>
If the bank can stick to its plans, its opportunities are considerable.
&quot;People tend to think of Citicorp as some huge behemoth,&quot; says
Robert Albertson, director of US bank research at Goldman Sachs. &quot;It's
not. In some ways, it's the largest small bank in the world. Except in US
credit cards, in no product or market is its market share significant.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Citibank has room to grow. Supporting that growth is an unrivalled network
of banks in 100 countries, including 75 emerging markets. No other bank
comes close. &quot;That network is the only true competitive advantage we
have,&quot; admits one senior executive. <BR>
<BR>
A change of structure is linked to a change in culture. The bank is turning
away from what it calls the old silos: independently run groups in different
countries or product areas, chasing exclusively their own revenues, spending
furiously on their own people and systems, monitoring their own risks. <BR>
<BR>
A bank whose managers once competed as strongly against each other as against
other banks will be forced to cooperate more. Pay is changing to encourage
this. The bank's senior managers will be more obsessed with the nitty-gritty
details of consolidating back offices and improving productivity than with
pursuing grandiose new designs in their own fiefdoms. <BR>
<BR>
A new generation of senior managers is emerging at Citicorp to lead the
bank into the next century. Most of them are in their early 50s, with a
score of years at the bank. Many won their spurs in far-flung corners of
its big emerging-country network. One will eventually take over from John
Reed, possibly the most fascinating and controversial bank chairman in the
world. Within a few years, America's leading bank could be headed by a chairman
called Menezes, Aziz, de Souza or Talwar. <BR>
<BR>
Reed is 57. He might run Citicorp for another eight years. It's too early
to predict who will succeed him. And he's not giving anything away. Paradoxically,
those who once seemed closest to the crown have tended to get blown away.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Shock wave</B> <BR>
<BR>
When Citicorp announced its latest management changes in January, a shock
wave passed through the bank, its customers and shareholders. While a new
generation was pushed forward, others had to make way. Most surprising was
the fate of Pei-yuan Chia, head of Citicorp's global consumer businesses
and widely regarded as the most important executive after Reed. Chia, born
in Hong Kong, raised in China and Taiwan, joined Citicorp 22 years ago from
General Foods. After running the bank's largest and most profitable business
for four years, he appeared something of a bank stalwart. &quot;It will
be very strange dealing with Citicorp without having Pei Chia to talk to,&quot;
says one American fund manager. &quot;He was a friend.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Chia is also 57. He was too old ever to take over from Reed. And Reed
didn't want to make him an official number two by filling the post of president.
That has lain vacant since the sudden departure of Richard Braddock in 1992.
Braddock had also run the consumer business, until Chia replaced him in
1992. Braddock became president, and apparent number two to Reed, with responsibility
for cost-cutting as part of the bank's five-point recovery plan. He left
in October 1992 in circumstances never fully explained. <BR>
<BR>
Braddock's departure foreshadowed that of Christopher Steffen, who joined
the bank late in 1992, following his high-profile restructuring efforts
at Kodak. He too was charged with controlling costs and introducing new
management disciplines, such as benchmarking. In January 1995 he was promoted
to vice chairman and came to be talked of as a possible future CEO. His
resignation came suddenly in December 1995. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;These changes have been on the cards for well over a year,&quot; says
one Citicorp insider. &quot;But John [Reed] often holds his cards close
to his chest. He appears to be abrupt.&quot; Abrupt and autocratic. <BR>
<BR>
Chia will at least stay on for a few months. That is interpreted as a gesture
of goodwill designed to calm nerves within the organization and silence
any talk that there has been a palace revolution, or that the veterans of
the bank's emerging markets business, who have supplied so much of its profits
during the tough years, are flexing their muscles. <BR>
<BR>
Chia's retirement clears the way for the bank's other vice-chairmen: Onno
Ruding (56), William Rhodes (60) and Paul Collins (60). But their ages make
it unlikely that any of these, the bank's most senior remaining officers,
would take over from Reed. If any nursed such an ambition, it was probably
killed in January when Reed announced that the three vice-chairmen &quot;will
continue to provide a senior policy overview&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The clue to the most likely candidates lies in a select ginger group once
dubbed the G-15. Almost four years ago, at the height of the bank's real-estate
loan crisis, Reed created this committee of the bank's top-15 business managers,
who all reported directly to him. He required them all to fly into New York
once a month for meetings that lasted an entire day and sometimes two. It
set a punishing schedule. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was a killer,&quot; says one member of the group. &quot;Reed would
call us all together - from Asia, Europe or wherever - once a month and
basically beat us up. We've had nearly 50 of those meetings.&quot; It was
a management structure designed to help the bank through the worst crisis
of its modern history. And it worked. <BR>
<BR>
From 1993 onwards Reed knew that the bank had survived the worst. But he
persisted with the G-15 while the bank repaired its balance sheet, rebuilt
its tier-one capital and restored its rating. Of the original members of
the G-15, 12 remain in key operating jobs. Last year after some joint consultation
they told Reed that the G-15 structure, which had worked well during the
crisis and recovery, wasn't suited to the present strategy. Reed responded
by nearly halving the number of line executives who report directly to him.
<BR>
<BR>
The survivors are: from the consumer side, William Campbell, who runs the
Citicorp branch network; Roberta Arena, who runs credit cards in Europe
and North America; Shaukat Aziz, at present working with Arena to organize
credit cards as one global business; Alvaro de Souza running private banking.
On the wholesale side are Robert McCormack, who runs Citi's global relationship
bank (GRB) for selected corporate customers; Paul Collins and Dennis Martin,
who run emerging markets. Also reporting directly to Reed is Victor Menezes,
newly appointed chief financial officer. <BR>
<BR>
If these men and one woman feel they are starting a contest to succeed Reed,
they are wise enough not to admit it. Reed could run the bank for another
eight years. &quot;Will I be the next chairman? No, I don't think so,&quot;
says one executive who reports to him. &quot;For all I know, the next chairman
of Citicorp is running a sub-division of the credit card business right
now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Victor Menezes is a clear candidate one day to head the bank which he joined
as a management trainee in his native India. He has wide experience of all
sides of the bank, having worked in Latin America and Asia as well as in
developed markets. He worked most recently in consumer banking and also
spent some time in strategic planning in the 1980s. '&quot;It's his name
that you hear more and more,&quot; says one Citibanker. Menezes is said
to be liked by Reed. A clue to Menezes's standing is that, while he presently
fills the slot of chief financial officer, he seems to have taken on responsibilities
that range well beyond managing the bank's balance sheet, funding and liquidity.
<BR>
<BR>
Says a colleague: &quot;He's not going to be a numbers-obsessed CFO. His
value is that, unlike Steffen, he has worked all over the bank and knows
which buttons to press to make things happen.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Menezes describes his own job more in terms of a bank's number two than
a CFO: &quot;Trying to drive the fundamental performance of the bank; making
sure we're implementing the strategy in a controlled way; making sure we
have a balance between growth and control and taking responsibility for
costs and productivity.&quot; He explains this proactive approach: &quot;If
I just sit back and wait for numbers to come in, I'll be in trouble, because
numbers are a lagging indicator.&quot; The deployment of such an experienced
banker away from management to a corporate position underlines the move
to a more process-driven structure. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Branded goods</B> <BR>
<BR>
William Campbell, aged 52, is a rare outsider and something of an unknown
quantity. He is a former CEO of Philip Morris USA, a company of which Reed
is a director. Philip Morris is one of the bank's role-models in its quest
to give its Citibanking branch network a powerful brand identity, so that
it doesn't have to compete on price. Campbell has been a consultant at the
bank for over a year. His official appointment in January was over-shadowed
by a fuss over his testimony to congress denying that Philip Morris manipulated
the nicotine content of its cigarettes to make them more addictive. <BR>
<BR>
Partly because of that, partly because of Steffen's fate, there is some
scepticism about his prospects. &quot;We'll see,&quot; says one Citibanker.
&quot;He comes with great experience in marketing branded consumer goods,
but he is not a banker. It will be years before he understands fully how
this place works.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Joining Campbell is Roberta Arena, 48, who started at Citicorp 23 years
ago and now runs the credit card business in the US. She had the difficult
task of taking over from the highly regarded James Bailey, long-time head
of that division. Analysts say her strength is marketing and that she has
a strong staff running the card business. Shaukat Aziz, born in Pakistan,
aged 46, joined Citicorp in 1969 and has worked in corporate planning and
for the wholesale side of the bank covering the Middle East, Africa and
Asia Pacific. Bankers who worked with him in Asia regard him as highly competent
and likeable. &quot;It will probably be a short-term assignment for him,&quot;
says one bank insider. &quot;He doesn't work for Roberta and she doesn't
work for him.&quot; The card business will be reorganized as one global
business later this year. <BR>
<BR>
Alvaro de Souza, 48, made a success of the bank's new cross-border finance
group and, before that, was country corporate officer in Brazil. His appointment
to run the private bank, shows one of the drawbacks of moving senior managers
around the organization. It robs the cross-border finance group of continuity
of leadership after only a year of operation, insiders say. The group will
be run by Dipak Rastogi, fresh from pulling the bank's derivatives units
into one global business. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers say de Souza has a reasonable chance of success in this part of
the consumer bank. As a former country credit officer in Brazil he will
have worked closely with the private bank staff there. The company CEOs
and CFOs he would have courted for commercial banking business would also
be clients of the private bank. <BR>
<BR>
Another less well known figure to watch for is Rana Talwar, 48, an Indian
who joined Citicorp 27 years ago, spent his early career in operations and
corporate banking in India, and now runs the bank's consumer branch business
in Europe and America, one of the bank's biggest divisions. <BR>
<BR>
Dennis Martin, 53, joined Citicorp 28 years ago in his native Argentina.
He now runs the emerging market business and bridles at any suggestion that
its emerging market network exposes Citicorp to excessive risk. He points
out in tones of mock horror that in a single day in early March the Dow
Jones index fluctuated from a 171 point fall to a 100 point gain. That's
real volatility. Unusually for a Latin native, he spent a large chunk of
his career, seven years, in Asia. <BR>
<BR>
Asked why emerging markets is a good training ground for Citicorp senior
managers, he replies: &quot;If you work in emerging markets as a country
head, you run a whole business. The first person who comes to see you in
the morning may want to talk about a credit matter, the next may come with
a regulatory issue, the next with a staffing problem, the next will haul
you off to meet one of his customers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Of Martin's emergence, one colleague wryly notes: &quot;We seem to have
a lot of Argentinians at the top of this bank.&quot; Reed spend much of
his boyhood and youth in Argentina and some close to him say that he is
culturally more Argentine than American. <BR>
<BR>
Robert McCormack runs global relationship banking (GRB) which aims to provide
banking services to 1,400 large corporations with big international businesses.
McCormack served with the US Peace Corps from 1968 to 1972. He spent much
of his early career running the bank's operations in central America. He
was later put in charge of working out the bank's real-estate portfolio.
That meant he usually led off the monthly meetings of the G-15 by reporting
how big a hole the bank was in. <BR>
<BR>
At a meeting of senior bank managers one asked whether he wasn't scared
of taking charge of this huge problem that threatened the bank's solvency.
He replied, so the story goes: &quot;Scared? No. I was scared when my branch
in Nicaragua was bombed for the sixth time.&quot; He regarded real estate
as a problem that the bank could work its way out of, if the top people
put their minds to it. McCormack earned much kudos for his handling of the
real-estate problem and would almost certainly be a candidate to run the
bank if Reed decided to retire early. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A new culture</B> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank, like all global banks, is becoming more obsessed with systems
and operations than with lending money. At management meetings the talk
is of &quot;strategic cost management&quot;, &quot;enterprise-wide technology
platforms&quot;, &quot;mass-customization&quot;, &quot;standardizing products&quot;.
But you don't often hear are the words &quot;entrepreneurial&quot;, &quot;creative&quot;,
&quot;independent&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Citicorp managers are happy to be shifting this way. They want the bank's
earnings to more stable and predictable, because stable earnings attract
higher share-price multiples and they are all paid partly in stock and stock
options. It's also the best way they can see to throw off the bank's reputation
for being accident-prone which it gained with a string of credit problems
and failed investments in the 1980s. <BR>
<BR>
McCormack says: &quot;In the past this bank was full of artists, solo-product
guys who would say 'give us a lot of the shareholders' capital and we'll
make a ton of money by going off on our own and doing something clever'.
Well, the commercial real estate problem came from a bunch of artists trying
to be clever.&quot; There's no room for artists in today's Citicorp. <BR>
<BR>
The bank has decided that, instead of relying on such artists, it will build
its performance on three sturdy businesses. The single most important source
of profits will be the consumer banking business which Reed himself established
at Citicorp over 20 years ago and which last year supplied over 60% of its
earnings. It is the largest and fastest growing part of the bank. The bank's
role models in building this business are not other banks but consumer product
leaders, such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Philip Morris. The plan is to
give the bank a brand identity as powerful as Levi's jeans or Marlboro cigarettes.
<BR>
<BR>
Citibank is striving to ensure that its branches are exactly the same around
the world so that a customer arriving with his ATM card will find the same
kinds of machines, services and corporate style in Belgium, New York or
Colombia. But, as only 5% to 6% of its customers travel regularly from country
to country, why bother? Partly because it makes it easier for the bank when
it is opening new branches to have a standard design. Previously, when the
bank sent executives overseas it left them to install whatever technology
they preferred. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When the customer touches the bank,&quot; says Menezes, &quot;he has
a set of experiences which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Obviously we want
them to be pleasant, but also consistent. Remember, people don't go to McDonald's
for the hamburgers, they go for the convenience, because they know the bathrooms
will be clean and that they will be able to sit down with their kids and
have a meal for not too much money.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Crossroads</B> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank still has to decide which of several technologies to embrace. Most
bankers agree fewer customers will need a branch. It is not clear whether
the future of consumer banking lies with home computers or telephone banking,
and it is even less clear whether talking to a representative over the phone
about mutual funds can become a branded consumer experience. To find out,
Citibank, like others, will have to invest in several areas of technology
at once. <BR>
<BR>
The bank's wholesale business, which includes foreign exchange, global relationship
banking and emerging markets, provides 40% of earnings. Some time this year,
Citicorp will probably open in its 100th country. Some 75 of these are emerging
markets, with generally high rates of economic growth and wide margins on
banking business compared with OECD countries, albeit with greater political
risk. Its nearest rival to the title of most international bank is HSBC
which is present in just 45 emerging countries. For the last four years
Citicorp has produced an ROE of over 30% from its emerging markets business
(see box above). <BR>
<BR>
Citicorp's commercial and investment banking business in the developed markets
was once the mainstay of the bank. But this business now looks like a poor
relation of the consumer and emerging market divisions. Its earnings have
been volatile, partly because they encompass the bank's trading businesses.
Its ROE was 12% last year, 10% in 1994 and 20% in 1993. This part of the
bank has been reorganized into the GRB run by McCormack. <BR>
<BR>
Here more than anywhere else Citicorp is defining itself as much by what
it will <I>not</I> do as by what it will. It will not enter into mergers
or acquisitions with other large commercial banks, nor buy an investment
bank. It does not wish to be a leading trader and underwriter of equities.
It is not keen on lending large amounts of money and will not seek earnings
growth through balance-sheet growth. The GRB actually reduced assets from
$96 billion in 1994 to $90 billion last year. <BR>
<BR>
McCormack says: &quot;The banking business in OECD countries is over-capitalized,
very competitive and the pricing is horrible.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In recent years many international commercial and investment banks have
struggled with the question of whether to organize themselves as collections
of global businesses, or to be organized as complete banks in different
time zones and countries. Many have plumped to replace country heads with
product heads. The top executives don't run Europe, Asia and America, they
run bonds, equities, foreign exchange all round the world. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Relationship structure</B> <BR>
<BR>
Citicorp has come up with a new idea. It has decided that it will place
geographic reporting with customer reporting. The idea of the GRB is to
organize the bank into customer groups. Their aim is to serve 1,400 customers,
many already large and growing across borders. They will provide customers
with certain wholesale banking services which multinationals value in many
countries: transaction services such as funds transfer, custody and cash
management; foreign exchange and securities trading; corporate finance;
and some lending. The bank is clearly trying to concentrate on businesses
it is already good at and which are profitable. An organization chart puts
relationship managers and industry heads at the top, supported by key businesses
which are also run by global product heads. These are all in turn supported
by operations and technology. <BR>
<BR>
For any bank to proclaim that it is customer-driven is usually an empty
clich&eacute;. But Citicorp seems to be making it an organizing principle.
Its model is the bank's own world corporation group, a team of relationship
managers and product specialists which for more than 20 years has developed
the art of winning large amounts of revenue from 217 of the world's biggest
firms. It has always been an elite group within the bank, earning a disproportionately
large amount of revenue. Now the bank wants to extend this model to cover
most of its activity in wholesale banking in the developed world. The ultimate
aim is for many of the bank's key people to define themselves as working
at Citicorp in the Sony, GrandMet or GM group, instead of saying that they
work for Citicorp Japan or for Citicorp in foreign exchange. <BR>
<BR>
In the world corporation group, the most important people were the parent
account managers and the subsidiary account managers. A brilliant parent
account manager could report to his boss monthly, leading off with contact
details for each person within Citicorp that worked on his customer's account,
and adding details of revenue generated and prospects. As with everything
else, Citicorp maps this out. It analyzes the balance between effort and
revenue from the moment it starts working on a target account to the take-off
point when it becomes a key relationship bank and beyond. <BR>
<BR>
It is not altruistic. Citicorp analyzes its customers in terms of their
wallet - the amount they spend on banking services - of its own share of
their wallet, and what may be the changing characteristics of the different
wallets the customer has in its home market, in international markets and
in emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
Citicorp would seem to be at a disadvantage in competing in the developed
world for business from large companies. It has no equities business, it
is not a leading bond underwriter, it is not a leading mergers and acquisitions
adviser. It is not even keen to lend money. Take the large credit arranged
last year by the Kingdom of Spain carrying a drawn margin of 4bp. When it
was drawn, some of the Japanese participants found it costing them 25bp
just to lend money. Citicorp shareholders don't want the bank chasing too
much of that business. <BR>
<BR>
So what does Citicorp offer the corporate CFO who expects his lead bank
to lend him money and will reward him for doing so with bond and even equity
mandates? McCormack replies: &quot;Those bond and equity deals may have
a large share of his mind, but they aren't necessarily a large share of
his wallet. Ask him how much he spends each year on transactions and cash
management and how much his subsidiaries pay to raise money in Timbuktu.
It will be very much more than the fees for bond and equity deals.&quot;
He adds: &quot;Even if you're a big firm in bonds and equities, even in
a good year you don't make an ROE much above 15% and your stock doesn't
get a high multiple.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
McCormack argues - hopes perhaps - that what the biggest companies in the
world want from Citicorp are not things that consume a lot of capital, like
loans, but apparently boring things such as cash management and transaction
services. Even more important, they want these banking services all round
the world. Citicorp has offices in more countries than any other bank. &quot;They
actually take it for granted we have the products,&quot; says McCormack.
&quot;What they really want is the network, the fact that we can deliver
a service which is basically the same for them to use in Russia or Malaysia
as it is in Chicago. They also of course want it efficient and low-cost.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ruthless pull-out</B> <BR>
<BR>
McCormack stresses that these are not like middle-market customers. By dealing
mainly with the 1,400 biggest customers in the world, Citibank is concentrating
on less risky customers. The bank has been ruthless in weeding out businesses
it no longer wants to be in. The bank used to have many large mall operators
around the US as customers but they wanted the bank only to lend them money.
When Citicorp managers talked about doing securitization deals, they found
the operators preferred to deal with investment banks. Citicorp has just
pulled out of the sector. <BR>
<BR>
Reed has said that the GRB faces a tough year. It has to do more with less.
It has a complicated reorganization to absorb. There is bound to be some
infighting, either between customer people and product people, or between
customer people and the old geographical heads. As well as customer groups,
the GRB is organized into product groups which will also be run as single
global businesses, such as foreign exchange under Julian Simmonds and transaction
services under James Bailey, former head of the bank's US credit-card business.
These product groups exist to serve the 1,400 customers. But to be big enough
to do that, they have to deal with counterparts outside the 1,400. The transaction
services group has its own sales force to deal with such single-product
customers, as does foreign exchange. <BR>
<BR>
An obvious source of tension will be the price at which relationship managers
want the bank to deal with their customers, versus the product groups' desire
to be seen to run profitable businesses. It will be tough for Citicorp to
report earnings broken down by customers, very easy to report numbers for
three or four product groups. Ruding, who oversees customer relationships
for the GRB, hopes the product groups won't feel they have been subordinated
to the customer people. &quot;Because the product heads now run global businesses,
their power has been widely expanded,&quot; says Ruding. &quot;Someone like
Julian Simmonds, running forex, is stronger than before. The product heads
are all heavy-weights.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Ruding admits there may be some concern among the bank's former country
heads. These used to enjoy a high degree of autonomy because Citicorp has
decentralized decision making. <BR>
<BR>
Now Citicorp has merged its businesses in North America, Japan and Europe.
The bank hopes to centralize certain operations to cut expenses and make
its businesses more efficient. It has already done this in Europe. Five
years ago Citicorp ran its operations there as 18 different banks in 18
countries. When it began to centralize processing, accounting, credit management
and foreign exchange market-making, mainly to the UK, it found itself able
to reduce staff and still deal with higher volumes of foreign exchange and
cash management business. <BR>
<BR>
Now, the bank has the chance to pull off the same trick on a grander scale.
It needs to get all its businesses running on the same systems. In the 1970s
and 1980s, country heads installed technology that was customized to automate
particular processes. But the bank won't spend wildly to do this. &quot;We
have to self-fund this,&quot; says McCormack. &quot;We have no reserves
for this. Our attitude is we have to find a way to fund the investments
we need to improve.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Citicorp must avoid any more big accidents. &quot;You have to
do two things says Rhodes, &quot;first spot what's coming down the line,
second do something about it quickly before it hits you.&quot; Citicorp
is heavily exposed to financial institutions. Three years ago, it became
worried about the Japanese financial system and cut its exposure to second-tier
banks, ahead of many of its peers. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sceptical foot soldiers</B> <BR>
<BR>
It will take several years for Citicorp's latest plans to take hold. The
bank's senior executives and its chairman have always been great ones for
coming up with plans and strategies, management matrices, performance grids
and the rest. They have not always been so good at executing their plans.
Bankers on the ground are used to change, but they have probably had their
fill of change and new strategies. True, senior management devised the five-point
plan to rescue the bank in 1991 and 1992, and delivered on it. Then they
delivered on a second three-year plan to recapitalize the bank and win back
its AA ratings. Still, the troops will be sceptical. <BR>
<BR>
One senior executive recalls a recent meeting with managers in Europe. They
told him they were unsure who was now responsible for taking certain credit
decisions. His rather unsympathetic reply: &quot;You're all in this room.
Figure it out.&quot; There are also hints of politicking and in-fighting.
Bankers inside the GRB are keen to point out that though the ROE of their
business (12% to 14%) looks poor next to emerging markets (with a consistent
ROE of 30%), nearly a third of the earnings credited to the emerging markets
business come from OECD-headquartered customers that are covered by the
GRB. <BR>
<BR>
There is some enthusiasm for the new strategy. A good aspect of the reorganization
is that people have a clearer idea of how they are being judged and paid.
Truett Tate, one of six customer executives to whom industry heads report,
says: &quot;In the past anybody could build appraisal forms for their business.
I could focus on net new revenue, another manager might judge his reports
on how well they built a new product area. At the end of the year, managers
would sit down and evaluate their best people. I might ask how did so-and-so
do at bringing in net new revenue and the reply would come: 'I didn't measure
that. I measured something else.' The result was that we had almost no chance
of getting everyone pulling in the same direction.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For the first time in his 25 years at the bank, Tate finds he is not being
measured purely on numbers. The six customer executives are judged partly
on their combined financial performance, but they no longer receive monthly
reports with an individual P&amp;L. Over time that should change behaviour.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are being judged on collective performance, not individual performance,&quot;
says Tate. &quot;So when we explain to a manager why he should do something
for a product he's not responsible for, we can say it's because a large
portion of his variable compensation doesn't depend just on his own P&amp;L;
it relates to the performance of the bank as a whole. This is the first
time the bank has done this at a level below senior management.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He adds: &quot;There's a whole group of people at the bank in their 20s
and 30s who don't identify with the parochial, narrowly, selfishly defined
culture of the past 20 years.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<HR> 
<H3>Climbing the emerging country grid </H3>
Some investors still worry about Citicorp's dependence on earnings from
emerging markets. Doubters might draw some comfort from how the bank's risk
management systems coped with the January 1995 Mexican crisis. When the
peso devaluation hit, Citicorp's stock was hammered, as investors assumed
it would suffer because such a large amount of its business is in emerging
markets. But it didn't lose a cent in Mexico. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;From the Colossio assassination onwards, we closed our price risk
and our interest-rate gap risk and increased our liquidity,&quot; recalls
Dennis Martin who, with Paul Collins, runs emerging markets. In fact, the
bank had one of its best-ever years in Mexico because, with international
flows of capital disrupted, local companies pay higher margins for simple
local-currency loans. Similarly, the bank had a great year in Venezuela,
another country out of favour with international investors. <BR>
<BR>
Martin can obtain a measure of earnings at risk for each country, updated
daily. Recently he has been talking regularly to his country head in one
emerging market suffering from a recession and from conflict among leading
politicians. He has decided that the bank's operation in that country must
increase its liquidity - which will hurt margins in the short term. He will
review the decision in 60 days. <BR>
<BR>
The emerging market group's reward for supplying strong profits to Citicorp
and avoiding losses through the hard times is that it will continue to benefit
from investment. Even while managing its way through the tail end of the
real estate crisis, the bank invested in emerging markets at a rate of $100
million a year during the last two-and-a-half years - all this from capital
the business generated itself. This year it will invest slightly more, opening
up in new countries, expanding in certain existing ones and standardizing
certain products, so that, as far as possible they look the same to customers
everywhere. The theory is that it will make life easier for large companies
if the process for obtaining a letter of credit from Citicorp is the same
in Hong Kong, Argentina or South Africa. <BR>
<BR>
Typically for Citicorp's process-obsessed managers they have come up with
a grid to map this. The grid splits countries into five phases of development:
early, growing, rapid development, maturing, mature. Onto this grid it adds
the types of services appropriate to each stage. Citicorp typically follows
its huge multinational customers into more obscure markets and they want
basic cash-management and foreign-exchange services. These produce local-currency
deposits which in turn fund short-term local-currency lending. During the
second phase of development a country might require project finance and
might develop some local bond or treasury bill market. Rapid development
brings demand for more sophisticated services such as derivatives, and securities
custody and, eventually, for asset-based securitization and American depositary
receipt services as international investors seek to buy into it. <BR>
<BR>
Using this grid, as well as projections for GDP growth and the pace of deregulation,
Citicorp has chosen nine pilot countries as offering the greatest opportunities
for profits and is mapping out the investments required to capture some
of the wholesale banking revenues which will become available in those countries
in the next five years. It will begin funding those investments this year.
Martin says: &quot;In a country like Taiwan, the central bank has told us
what individuals and consumers will be able to do with their money for the
next 10 years. If you can imagine the future, you can own that future.&quot;
In other countries it's a matter of interpreting signals. &quot;If a government
says it wants to fund itself with something more than loans, it's a good
bet there will eventually be a domestic bond market. But often bankers simply
don't see that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In some countries, Citicorp is building local brokerages, it may consider
buying some small to medium-size banks or, in more mature markets, asset
finance companies. But it has no plans for very large acquisitions. Unlike
the rest of Citicorp, where country heads are becoming less important and
businesses are being run as single global entities with their own P&amp;L,
in emerging markets Citicorp still has to build up sizeable banks in each
country. But it can reduce its costs by centralizing some back-office functions.
It has just centralized its Indian cash-collection system in Delhi; previously
this was done in several cities. The bank has cut its unit costs by 30%
or more. Most of the computers which process business for it in Latin America
are in Springfield, Maryland. In Asia those computers are all in Singapore.<p>

<H3>INTERSEC 250</H3>
<P>
<P>

<H3><A HREF="em.96.08.4a.html">INTERSEC 250 TABLE</A></H3>


<H3> <B>Have giants had their day? </B> </H3>
<BR> <H4> <B>The trend towards
consolidation and globalization is continuing, according to InterSec's ranking of
the top 250 asset management firms outside the US. However, it also indicates
that this will slow in the future as the difficulties of implementing economies
of scale become more and more apparent. Jim Sirius reports</B> </H3> <P>
Globalization is high on the agenda at international summits, in the boardroom,
and at the sharp end where companies and individuals feel the pain. In investment
management it has meant another furious round of mergers, acquisitions and
reorganizations as companies continue to equate size and diversification with
survival in competing for fickle and increasingly mobile international capital.

<P> At first sight there appears to have been a remarkable amount of movement at
the top of the table, but closer inspection reveals that the main reason is the
reduction in the figures for assets managed of the largest Japanese institutions.
Kampo remains unchallenged for the number one spot but the trust banks' 1995
figures are some 25% to 40% lower than last year (<I>Euromoney, </I>August 1995,
page 71). Comparability between Japan and the rest of the world is always a
problem &#173; discounting the movement of the Japanese institutions immediately
shifts the focus to the sector's biggest mergers and acquisitions of the year.

<P> Two of the largest transactions affecting the ranking were purchases of US
institutions: BZW's (ranked 3) purchase of Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisers
and Zurich Insurance's (20) of Kemper. The US has experienced a feeding frenzy in
the financial sector, with hundreds of banks changing hands, some including large
fund management operations, such as the merger of Chemical and Chase.

<P> The City of London continues to defy the pessimists, attracting a fresh wave
of foreign interest, including ING's (24) purchase of Barings. The German banks
have been particularly visible &#173; Commerzbank (46) has been credited with
starting off the latest round of UK fund manager M&amp;A with its purchase of
Jupiter Tyndall. Dresdner Bank (16) followed suit with Kleinwort Benson: the
group's total assets under management rose by 59% to $178.5 billion, including
the partnership interest in RCM Capital Management in the US, bought from
Travelers Group. Deutsche Bank located its global investment banking operation at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and has been aggressively targeting personnel rather
than companies.

<P> <B>Accessing new markets by mergers</B>

<P> Recent consolidation within the City includes the combination of Lloyds Bank
and the TSB Group, including Hill Samuel (77). The combined group does not show
up on this ranking but will manage at least $70 billion, lifting it into the top
50. SBC's (5) purchase of SG Warburg did not include Mercury (25), creating a
large independent player in the European market &#173; cynics might say another
large takeover target. Mercury is adamant that it can grow and prosper as a
specialist fund management group &#173; its 21% rise in assets under management
certainly cannot harm client confidence.

<P> It looked for a while as if two of the Swiss "big three" might combine but,
even within Switzerland, the cultural differences were too great. However,
despite the size of their private banking operations, UBS (4) and Credit Suisse
(10) clearly do not feel secure. The sight of BZW, SBC and others merging and
acquiring on a grand scale may have prompted discussions that, in the end, only
served to increase that insecurity. Meanwhile other banks such as Pictet (74),
Julius Baer (79) and Darier Hentsch (158) are showing substantial rises in assets
under management, with firm strategies in place to target niches in international
retail and institutional markets.

<P> Europe has still seen few mergers on the scale of the Chase deal or
Mitsubishi/Bank of Tokyo in Japan. Looser cross-border alliances have generally
foundered on cultural differences and differing market structures: for example,
the ill-fated cooperation of BNP (48) and DresdnerBank (16). However, European
companies are better at diversification across sectors, with banking and
insurance groups (for instance) successfully muscling in on each others' markets.

<P> This has its dangers for all parties. Companies have burnt their fingers
launching ill-prepared into markets. Retail clients find themselves pressured to
purchase cross-sold products in confusing deals that may not offer benefits in
terms of price, returns or service. Even large institutional clients are not
immune to a brand-led hard sell on combined packages. Regulatory authorities
struggle with remits too narrow to cover the web of operations of the industry's
big players &#173; mergers between such authorities may be unavoidable.

<P> During 1995 the FT/S&amp;P Actuaries index of continental European equities
rose a respectable 9%, but with a fair amount of variation between countries. The
Swiss market benefited from general uncertainty to climb 23%, probably also
helped by the increasing equity holdings of domestic investors. The Swiss franc
also gained from the nation's "safe haven" status, strengthening the position of
Swiss institutions on the ranking, though not helping the Swiss economy much.

<P> Unlike other major European currencies, sterling fell slightly against the
dollar, giving UK managers some catching up to do. Traditionally highly
equity-oriented, they were helped by an 18% rise in UK shares. Schroders (30)
posted a 27% increase in assets under management, picking up awards based on
successful teamwork rather than particular star performers. Hermes Pensions
Management (72), managing the assets of the Post Office and British Telecom
pension funds, showed a 29% increase during 1995. However, a number of big UK
names showed only modest growth. NatWest's (113) assets under management fell by
6% to $25.7 billion but this excludes Gartmore, purchased from Indosuez (59)
since the year-end. The sale puzzled many observers, since the fund manager has
been one of a very few bright spots on an otherwise fairly gloomy picture for
French banks in recent years.

<P> <B>Big isn't all good  </B>

<P> The key to growth will undoubtedly be participation in solving the pensions
crisis, but this will be a slow and painful process. Vital issues regarding
accountability, equity across generations and income brackets, and the
interdependence of retirement provision with other key social, fiscal and
political problems will make legislative change tortuous and frustrating. But
hasty fixes followed by endless tinkering, let alone solutions without political
consensus, will benefit no-one.

<P> Within the industry, many of the arguments put forward to justify the
creation of ever-larger groups are coming under attack. Merged operations find
that the economies of scale predicted by consultants are difficult and painful to
realize. Neither does the sector gain stability &#173; larger companies operate
on a larger scale, struggle with effective systems of control and make a bigger
hole in the system if they fall. As trading scandals multiply, calls for
international supervision and formal cooperative safety-nets will undoubtedly
increase.

<P> <I><b>Note:</b></I>
This listing is not intended to be comprehensive. It shows major fund
management subsidiaries operating outside the domicile of their parent companies
that have relatively autonomous specialist asset management operations of a size that would
have put them in the rankings had they been independent. The rank column shows
the approximate position they would have occupied in the main listing.


<H4> <B>Definitions and methodology</B> </H4> <P> <I>This list of the top 250
institutional investors outside the us is ranked by assets under discretionary
management. It therefore excludes assets over which investment managers do not
have full discretion, such as advisory or custodial relationships. The categories
of institution ranked are banks (bk), internally managed pension funds (pf),
insurance companies (in), investment managers and independent unit trust/mutual
fund companies (ut), all with their headquarters outside the us. Other
institutional investors, such as venture capitalists, stockbrokers and central
banks, are not included.</I>

<P> <I>In order to compile this and other databases, InterSec Research
Corporation monitors over 3,500 institutions each year. A few of the figures are
necessarily estimated by InterSec and have not been confirmed by the institution
concerned. Information about this database or InterSec's other in-depth research

<H3>RUSSIA</H3>

<H3> <B>The White Russians from Long Island</B> </H3> 

<BR><H4> <B>They are the sons
and daughters of aristocrats and capitalists who fled the Bolsheviks in 1917.
They all know each other because they're from the same small town in America. But
they've returned to Russia to work in its capital markets. For some it's a
homecoming; for others it's simply an opportunity to exploit a language skill.
Steven Irvine reports </B> </H4> <P> There were collective sighs of relief in
Moscow's banks and securities houses when Boris Yeltsin won a convincing 14%
victory over communist rival Gennady Zyuganov in the presidential elections in
July. But none were louder, or longer, than those of a small group of US passport
holders &#173; all of whom were mindful of an incident 79 years earlier when
their aristocratic and capitalist grandparents were forced to flee the country
after the communists bypassed elections and won the subsequent civil war.

<P> They are the White Russians, a group of young professionals who returned to
their homeland and whose public face outside Russia has been Boris Jordan, the
30-year-old banker entrepreneur who reputedly made $100 million for CS First
Boston in one year, before setting up his own firm, Renaissance Capital. They all
come from in or around the same town, Sea Cliff, Long Island &#173; a suburb of
New York. Some were former school friends, some were tent mates at summer camps,
but they all have flawless Russian language skills.

<P> The drift back to Russia began in 1992 when the then minister for foreign
affairs, Andre Kozyrev, called a meeting in the New York Plaza hotel, where the
turnout of 100 young professionals came mostly from the financial sector. He
apologized for what had happened to their grandparents and emphasized they would
no longer face political danger should they go back. His hope was that they would
return &#173; with their skills. His charm offensive was successful.

<P> The first to go back, and probably still the most influential, was Peter
Derby, president of DialogBank, one of the few commercial banks in Moscow where
the experience of cashing traveller's cheques is a relatively pleasant one. "We
are foreigners who are treated with the opportunity to be part of the domestic
scene," comments Derby.

<P> Derby's Russian credentials are hardly in question. So much so that prime
minister Viktor Chernomyrdin once introduced Derby to a friend as "a Russian kid
that grew up in America". His first visit to Moscow was in 1987 with US rock star
Billy Joel, whose Russian concerts he organized. But when he returned for good in
1990 it was still a sensitive issue to admit to banker as an occupation. To this
day his passport states that he is a financial engineer.

<P> He says not all the Sea Cliff crowd responded well when he announced his
intention to return. Many were sceptical of Gorbachev's reforms. "I told my
grandfather," says Derby, "and the next day he died of a heart attack."

<P> But being there at the beginning gives him a claim to credibility that is
unique among Russian Americans &#173; most of whom arrived only after the hammer
and sickle was abandoned. He still vividly recalls an early visit to the finance
ministry when he asked about the finance law. "You see that pad and paper over
there?" he was told, only half in jest; "Why don't you go over there and write
it?"

<P> In the event he contributed to both Russia's finance law and company law.
"I'm in Russia to contribute my knowledge," says the former Chase and NatWest
banker. "Our main principle here [at DialogBank] is not to maximize profits but
to do what's right. I have supported anyone who has come here with the right
long-term honest ideals." Derby takes ethics very seriously. "He really believes
in all that stuff," says a rival.

<P> A fresh-faced 35-year-old in a dapper flannel suit, Derby nevertheless
represents the older generation of Russian Americans working in Moscow. In 1992,
a Washington lawyer phoned him to ask if he knew a young man called Boris Jordan
and if he could give him a reference. Derby readily did so; he had spent many
summers at camp with Boris's older brother Nick, whom he'd met at age 10. Jordan
got the job at CS First Boston.

<P> Commenting on Boris's subsequent success, Derby hedges his reply: "Boris is
young and a very strong marketer. But he is more financially driven than I am. I
am more paced." He points around the sturdy office, recently constructed by an
American friend, as he explains that all Russian Americans have a duty to be role
models. "When people try to poach my staff," he adds, "I feel personally
violated. You spend so much time training them. You should add value as a
foreigner, not reallocate it." One recent loss was George Schivlovsky, another of
the Sea Cliff Russian Americans, who left Dialog to join Renaissance. Schivlovsky
is married to Jordan's sister.

<P> The other Jordan in Moscow, Nick, 37, heads capital markets at Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell. "I don't have the same entrepreneurial desires as Boris," he
says. "I'm a banker. I like working for a large corporation." He trained at Bank
of New York but quickly moved to Manufacturers Hanover where he remained through
its merger with Chemical Bank. He eventually switched to trading and rose to head
the emerging market bond desk in London. His direct boss at that time was Alexis
Radzianko, now head of United City Bank, the Russian arm of MC Securities
(recently taken over by Banque Bruxelles Lambert). In contrast to many of the
younger generation of Russian Americans, both did their time "making the coffee
on Wall Street".

<P> Nick Jordan's contract is for three years, and in July he relocated his
family from London. But of his move to Russia he is careful to say: "I'm not
coming home. I consider the United States my country and I'm very proud of it.
It's the passport my family and I carry."

<P> Ironically enough, Nick Jordan was hired, like his younger brother Boris, to
build a trading business from scratch. He readily admits, "we are in acquisition
mode" &#173; but then so is most of the Deutsche group.

<P> His wife, a Russian Frenchwoman who does not speak Russian, will also set up
a business: the new Moscow office for headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles.
However, both husband and wife's task will be a walk in the park compared with
their four-month effort to find real estate in Moscow. After abortive efforts to
find a house &#173; landlords have taken to asking tenants to refurbish their
property for them &#173; they have settled on an apartment inside Moscow's Garden
Ring road which passes close to Red Square. They chose to live on the west side
where the air quality is considered better &#173; most of Moscow's factories are
in the city's east.

<P> Is it coincidence that three out of four of the Jordan family have finished
up in Moscow? The fourth, Michael (or Misha), occasionally visits from London in
his capacity as head of Bank of America's emerging market flow-trading desk.

<P> The temptation is to draw some sort of genetic conclusion, although it is
probably best not to. But the Jordan family history is interesting. On the
maternal side, the family name is Shishkoff, a prestigious name which features in
the <I>Velvet Book</I> that determines the most ancient Russian nobility. The
name Jordan came through a pre-revolution marriage into the German nobility.

<P> In common with many other families that ended up in the US, the Jordans
settled first in Yugoslavia, only to flee Marshall Tito's regime after World War
II. They ended up in Sea Cliff, Long Island, where, in common with their
compatriots, they established roots. The initial lure of this town is not known.
For those who arrived later, it was the existence of two Russian orthodox
churches.

<P> In Sea Cliff, a close-knit community developed in which the children had to
speak Russian at home. "I used to hate it at the time," points out one young
trader now making prices in Lukoil each day, "but I'm glad now my parents made me
do it."

<P> The children all went to normal American high schools, but their parents made
every effort to make their extracurricular activities as Russian as possible, and
to keep alive the Russia they had known and still held out hope of returning to.
In the winter they would arrange balls and put on plays, and certain traditions
would be upheld, such as adhering to the Julian calendar. This meant that unlike
their American school mates they celebrated Christmas on January 7. Two summer
camps were established, both about an hour and a half's drive out of New York:
Arur and Nor. They were not exclusively for Russian Americans, although in
practice this proved the case, since one of the requirements was that children
spoke Russian at all times.

<P> Of those in Moscow today, many were neighbours or school friends. For
example, DialogBank's treasurer and head of foreign exchange, Sanya (Alexandra)
Zezulin, has known Nick Jordan since she was old enough to talk. She remembers
starting kindergarten with him in the Russophobic days when the slogan "better
dead than red" was on the lips of every American. "At first I didn't have an
accent," she says, commenting on her language ability. "I just didn't speak any
English at all." Zezulin recalls Jordan's spectacles being smashed by the other
boys on a regular basis and being teased because of their tsarist names: Nikolai
and Alexandra. She speculates that since Russian American children had to
struggle, a high percentage became over-achievers and a disproportionate number
moved into banking.

<P> <B>Strangers in a homeland</B>

<P> All of the Russian Americans admit that the Russian they speak differs
significantly from the street Russian spoken in Moscow, which they all find
abrasive and often rude. Theirs is a more mannered and traditional language
passed down by their aristocratic grandparents. Their accents are mostly neutral,
although a couple of traders were told they spoke Russian with an accent like
that of the Baltic states.

<P> On the trading side, there are a whole slew of Russian Americans in their
mid-20s who drink together, reminisce about camp, address each other by their
schoolyard nicknames and are constantly in touch during trading hours in a market
where price moves can be as opaque as they are sudden.

<P> For example, the two Pataleff brothers, Alex (who works at
Creditanstalt-Grant) and Victor (at Renaissance), share an apartment with Nick
Mokhoff of Alliance Menatep. Peter Kizenko, who was headhunted by ING Barings
(and was at Alliance Menatep), used to live there too, and still drives down in
his Volvo to the dacha they collectively rent at weekends. Their apartment has a
basketball net.

<P> The younger generation of Russian Americans are following in the footsteps of
Boris Jordan, who arrived in Moscow when he was 25. Whenever Boris walks into a
bar, a cluster of the younger traders are sure to gather round to hang on his
every word.

<P> But there hasn't been much of that lately. It was with shock that the Russian
Americans learned that Boris Jordan's entry visa was revoked in June, albeit
temporarily, it appears. Some took this as a sign to be wary of some of the more
reactionary elements in Russia. Another sign reinforced this: a couple of days
before the second round of the presidential election, Yeltsin's "running mate",
Alexander Lebed &#173; who is admittedly a little prone to the unpredictable
&#173; commented it would be a good thing to rid Russia of "foreign thieves".

<P> However, the Russian Americans, in spite of their language and ancestry, will
always be regarded as foreigners by Muscovites. "These guys will never be
Russians," is the comment of one American trader. And some Russian Americans are
equally aware of this. "Not everybody is here for genetic reasons," says Nick
Jordan. "Some are here just because they have a language skill."&#009;

<H2>Four legs good, two legs bad </H2>
<H4>The professionals who left Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch last year
compare it with George Orwell's <I>Animal Farm</I>. It's a pretty successful
farm, and more human than most. But have the guys at the top pushed their
teamwork ethos and those catchy slogans a little too far? Michelle Celarier
reports </H4>
At Merrill Lynch, there was no doubt about it: Edson Mitchell was a star.
Largely under his direction, the investment bank's fixed-income division
leapt from nowhere in the 1980s to become the number one global player.
Using swaps and derivatives talent hired from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley,
Merrill surprised its competitors by becoming one of the most creative and
innovative players on Wall Street. By 1995, the charismatic Mitchell was
said to be in command of a $1 billion revenue stream - the driving force
behind Merrill's international expansion in recent years. <BR>
<BR>
But last January, Merrill embarked on a strategic reorganization, and the
future of Mitchell's star status seemed to be thrown into question. He was
asked to head equities, a move his superiors said was designed to broaden
his management capabilities. But outsiders interpreted the reassignment
as a way of breaking down Mitchell's power base, as part of an attempt to
rid Merrill of the fiefdoms they say had plagued it for years. After weeks
of negotiations, Mitchell turned down the new assignment and defected in
May to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London. He was the most senior person
to leave Merrill in more than a decade. <BR>
<BR>
Mitchell's departure, followed by more than a dozen of his most gifted subordinates,
dismayed many senior Merrill executives, including president David Komansky
(on the left in the cartoon, with chairman Daniel Tully). &quot;He was the
most creative person in fixed income,&quot; sighs Komansky. &quot;Believe
me, I wish he hadn't gone.&quot; Over the next few months, such highly-regarded
Merrill executives as Grant Kvalheim, who had headed capital markets, and
Henry Yordan, a managing director, joined Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New
York. Top-flight debt salesman Michael Phillips went to work with his former
boss in London. Admits Komansky: &quot;I regret losing many of them.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It seems obvious now that Mitchell inspired deep loyalty in his division,
where former employees say he fostered an incredible team spirit. For years,
Merrill's inferiority complex in investment banking was what propelled his
drive. But it may also have inhibited Mitchell from extending his team spirit
to many other parts of the institutional side of the firm, which former
fixed-income professionals admit they viewed as mediocre and inferior. Under
Mitchell, says one individual close to Merrill: &quot;Fixed income was much
less cooperative with other parts of the firm. They thought investment bankers
didn't add value. They wanted to do their own deals, and print their own
tickets.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To Komansky, and no doubt to many others on the Merrill executive team,
that meant one thing. &quot;Edson's myopic drive to build his businesses&quot;
resulted in a &quot;perception of a lack of what we call teamwork&quot;
explains the president. But, as even Komansky acknowledges, Mitchell's defection
points to one of the most difficult issues facing Wall Street in general
and Merrill in particular. And that is the inevitable tension between the
creative entrepreneurial spirit - with its accompanying egos - that drives
the best of Wall Street, and the organizational structure needed to keep
a colossus like Merrill from imploding. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cold comfort</B> <BR>
<BR>
The record of star-based cultures in recent years does not inspire imitation.
Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and First Boston are a few that
come to mind. But the flipside is not so attractive either. Merrill, which
has struggled so long to become a top global investment bank, may be at
a watershed. Those who've left fear that the firm is heading for a period
of conformity and mediocrity, uttering with distaste the word &quot;technocracy&quot;.
&quot;The fact that they are losing so many people means something is not
quite right,&quot; adds a competitor in the derivatives area. &quot;We see
them as being less competitive, less aggressive.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Komansky acknowledges that he spends a lot of time these days thinking about
the tension between entrepreneurialism and management, and says there has
to be room at Merrill for creative people &quot;who don't walk down the
middle of the road. But they have to be on the reservation.&quot; At Merrill,
that means abiding by the firm's five hallowed &quot;principles&quot; which
are plastered all over the bank's walls. They even flash by, item-by-item,
on secretaries' computer screen-savers: &quot;Client focus. Respect for
the individual. Teamwork. Responsible citizenship. Integrity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The principles are simplistic and hokey. But employees seem to take them
to heart. Even an avowed cynic at Merrill says defensively: &quot;People
need a value system to subscribe to. At the end of the day, integrity and
reputation are everything.&quot; The principles, first given this capsule
form in 1992, are considered a distillation of Merrill's culture. They are
what many see as one of the firm's greatest achievements and the legacy
of chairman Daniel Tully. &quot;The culture Merrill's been able to build
is one of the firm's unpublicized successes,&quot; says Brian Barefoot,
a senior vice-president in merchant banking who left Merrill in 1992 after
25 years. (Last year, he joined PaineWebber as an executive vice-president.)
<BR>
<BR>
In the eyes of Wall Street, Merrill Lynch is a blue-collar firm that has
climbed the lofty pinnacle of high finance through hard work, playing by
the rules and a little luck. A self-made firm, it is the embodiment of the
American dream. Not only did Merrill bring Wall Street to Main Street, it
has taken it to the rest of the world. &quot;Street smarts [street wisdom]
and common sense&quot; are the characteristics one former executive attributes
to chairman Tully and president Komansky, the men who run the firm. Both
were raised in the working-class boroughs of New York City. Tully says this
taught him to get along with other cultures. Komansky keeps a photograph
on his office wall of the Brooklyn tenement where he grew up - a constant
reminder of his humble roots. <BR>
<BR>
There is ample contrast between that tenement the other side of the East
River and the World Financial Center - the heart of Merrill's 35-country
empire - on the west side of Manhattan. The ultra-chic complex of financial
institutions, shops and restaurants forms a cluster of glass-clad postmodern
architecture overlooking the Hudson River. Merrill's 1987 move into its
grand 34-storey home was a sure sign of its ambitions, which were tested
immediately by that year's crash in the world equity markets. Today, it
is the biggest Wall Street firm, with $5.8 billion in capital and an estimated
$20 billion in revenues last year. It is often compared with larger, more
highly-capitalized commercial banks in the US and abroad because of its
size and the breadth of its business. Analysts are expecting net income
to top $1 billion for 1995. In international securities business, it beats
all the competition. Merrill has held the record for cross-border financings
for seven years. The recent purchase of London-based market-maker Smith
New Court also makes it the world's largest equities house in terms of people.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Culture problems</B> <BR>
<BR>
So far Merrill's stature in the markets hasn't suffered from its recent
talent drain. Many former executives, noting the strength of the franchise
Merrill has built, say the depth of its talent means departures have little
lasting impact. After weathering 1994 far better than its competitors, it
is still the most profitable among them. Merrill remains number one in global
debt and US corporate debt underwriting, with its market share virtually
unchanged this year. In the international area, executives say, morale has
never been higher. The firm has been climbing the rankings for M&amp;A,
the most lucrative and most prestigious of corporate business. <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, those who recently quit suggest there is a culture problem
which they predict will hurt the firm in years to come. At least in the
fixed-income area, where the departures occurred, they argue that Merrill's
five principles have become a &quot;mantra&quot; that is used to stifle
creative debate. &quot;Teamwork&quot; has come to mean falling in line and
they add that &quot;politicians&quot; are replacing the stars. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The political correctness that has developed at Merrill is a fairly
recent phenomenon,&quot; says a former executive. These Merrill refugees
have a vision of utmost horror: could Merrill Lynch's employees become versions
of the very creatures they detest most - the &quot;moonies&quot; of Goldman
Sachs? This epithet for Goldman's drone-like culture was reputedly coined
by Merrill's own John McNiven, managing director of European capital markets
in London. There's &quot;no chance&quot; of such a transmogrification at
Merrill, says one Merrill executive. &quot;We've got a sense of humour.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The ability not to take themselves too seriously is a positive trait and
one characteristic that separates Merrill bankers from many of their competitors.
But that doesn't mean they are good humoured about the criticisms of their
beloved principles. Bellows chairman Tully: &quot;To say the principles
stifle creativity - it's BS [bullshit].&quot; And Herbert Allison, the executive
vice-president who oversees investment banking and equity and debt markets
(see left-hand cartoon), also rejects the idea that a straitjacket is being
put on Merrill Lynch. &quot;The opposite is true,&quot; he says. &quot;We're
trying to promote more candour and encourage and reward creativity.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Creativity, or the lack of it, is a touchy subject at Merrill, for good
reason. In the past, the investment bank has often been viewed as a lumbering
giant, forcing its way into markets by brawn not intellect. Many of its
most creative ideas - from the retail division's much-copied cash management
account, to its state-of-the-art risk management system, to its derivatives
expertise - came from hiring outsiders, whether they were consultants or
Wall Street veterans from other institutions. But Merrill wants the institution
itself to be viewed as a trendsetter. &quot;If we allow conformity, we will
not succeed,&quot; says Jerome Kenney, the executive vice-president in charge
of strategy (see right-hand cartoon). He is another top executive unhappy
about the recent defections: &quot;No-one is ever better off by losing more
than a few good people.&quot; Adds Komansky: &quot;I don't want us to become
the men and women in grey flannel suits. There has to be room in this organization
for people who think differently.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>World-class ambition</B> <BR>
<BR>
Merrill has largely built its investment banking business by buying talent.
The purchase of the investment banking firm White Weld in 1978, followed
by its purchase of some AG Becker operations in 1984, were significant steps
to overcome what Merrill viewed as its deficiencies in that area. Merrill
continued to upgrade its institutional image in the late 1980s and early
1990s - generally by hiring professionals from the more prestigious firms
of Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. (Mitchell, interestingly, spent almost
his entire career at Merrill and was one of its few home-grown investment
banking success stories.) <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, Merrill built on the strengths of its highly successful
retail business. The success of its two-pronged approach has been unmatched
by any other financial institution. This is perhaps partly because a strong
and common identity - one that can bridge asset management, investment banking
and private client bases - is hard to fashion. It's also critical that the
sense of identity is maintained among its 44,000 employees in 35 countries.
One way Merrill tries to do so is through the simplicity of its principles.
<BR>
<BR>
Now that Merrill has emerged as the premier US financial institution by
a number of measures, Komansky's ambition is to see it become his perception
of a &quot;world-class company&quot;. By that, he doesn't mean another Morgan
Stanley or Goldman Sachs. Komansky is looking at non-bank corporations.
League tables aren't enough he notes: other criteria are client satisfaction,
shareholder value and financial performance. &quot;It's an ambience, an
aura,&quot; says Komansky. &quot;It's difficult to quantify.&quot; But he
knows it when he sees it, as he did for example when visiting brewer Anheuser
Busch last year. &quot;From the moment the car pulled to the front of the
building,&quot; he says, &quot;you knew it was a world-class company.&quot;
When he called on another company, which he refuses to name, and he found
the receptionist eating pizza at her desk, &quot;you knew it was not a world-class
company&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill's obsession with such matters is based on its own research on the
topic of excellence. Its culture, its principles, are not unique, comments
Kenney. &quot;All successful companies have to sustain values and work together.&quot;
One critical method by which Merrill has tried to encourage teamwork on
a firm-wide basis is to institute a pay system that links bonuses through
stock ownership to the firm's overall profitability. Merrill executives
talk about how much they love to come to work and about their sense of family
pride in the institution. &quot;Cut my wrists and little bulls run out,&quot;
jokes Edward Goldberg who came up through the ranks with Tully and is now
executive vice-president of operations, systems and telecommunications.
<BR>
<BR>
Some former executives and Merrill clients say that the tone of teamwork
and cooperation is set at the most senior levels of the firm, in the executive
management committee, and that it is Tully himself who is responsible for
a collegial atmosphere. &quot;I don't allow backbiting,&quot; Tully says.
&quot;If one of the executive vice-presidents comes to complain about someone,
I say: 'Let's get them in here.' I'll create a situation where they have
to speak with the other person. Then I'll be the arbitrator. Therefore,
little [backbiting] occurs.&quot; Some former executives praise this technique.
They say it has gone a long way towards ridding Merrill of the &quot;brutal
political&quot; atmosphere prevalent during the late 1980s and early 1990s,
before Komansky was sent from retail to head the institutional side. On
the other hand, one complaint is that Tully &quot;only likes to hear another
success story. It works fine when things are going well.&quot; (To the criticism
that he doesn't like to hear bad news, Tully retorts that he doesn't want
to hear any news like that in 1987, when rogue trader Howard Rubin lost
the firm more than $300 million on mortgage-backed securities.) <BR>
<BR>
In Merrill's not so distant past, as the firm was growing beyond its wire
house roots to become a global power-house, teamwork was more difficult
to achieve. &quot;Life is not a honeymoon, and we've certainly had our share
of internal squabbling and bickering over the years,&quot; acknowledges
Komansky. Describing the political atmosphere of earlier years, former employees
talk about the &quot;battle after battle&quot; for fee splits between the
institutional and retail side for transactions that involved both. An issue
known as &quot;transfer pricing&quot;, it involves the booking of both revenues
and costs, affecting the internally calculated return on equity for the
two areas. The animosity between the institutional and retail sides was
common and predictable: institutional employees felt that retail ran the
firm (all chairmen and presidents have had a retail background), while retail
resented having institutional products pushed down its throat. <BR>
<BR>
Former employees say that Komansky, who spent most of his career at Merrill
on the retail side and is renowned for his people skills, was transferred
to the institutional side in part to smooth things over. (In 1990 he became
head of equities.) Downplaying the matter, Komansky says that while acrimony
had developed about 10 years ago, by the time he arrived there was only
one area of dispute left to resolve. &quot;I didn't think it was worth the
time to be bothered about that last 5%, and that attitude began to permeate
the rest of the organization.&quot; Komansky was the director of both equity
and debt markets from 1993 until he became president last year. <BR>
<BR>
John Steffens, the executive vice-president who heads the powerful retail
side of the business, acknowledges that there used to be some concern about
products that &quot;appealed to the institutional side but not retail&quot;.
But he says he now has veto power over any product designed by investment
banking that he believes is unsuitable for his private client base. It is
further evidence of the cooperative climate, says president and CEO of Merrill
Lynch Asset Management, Arthur Zeikel, who is also a Merrill executive vice-president,
that Steffens' salesmen also work closely with Merrill Lynch Asset Management.
Merrill Lynch Asset Management, with $180 billion in assets under management,
has no marketing people, only portfolio managers. &quot;Mutual fund sales
people don't work for me,&quot; says Zeikel. &quot;They work for Lonnie
[Steffens]. They don't report to me. By definition, that means we have to
have strong teamwork.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Allison's game plan</B> <BR>
<BR>
The recent reorganization of the corporate and institutional client group,
which Allison now heads, was also designed to promote cooperation between
debt, equity and investment banking. &quot;We have to have unparalleled
teamwork&quot; in order to &quot;seize the high ground of relations of clients&quot;,
says Allison. His &quot;game plan&quot;, as observers call it, involves,
for example, reorganizing the investment bank along global industry lines,
which puts M&amp;A bankers to work side-by-side with corporate finance specialists
and analysts. Allison says that in order to move from low-level corporate
finance to a lead-manager role and the high-end advisory business, Merrill
is changing the way it pays investment bankers. Compensation will now be
based on three-year performance in generating revenues and building a presence
as measured by market share. Some of these changes have been in the works
for a while. Already, Merrill's M&amp;A business has made significant strides.
In cross-border M&amp;A, Allison says, the firm jumped from outside the
top 25 to ninth in 1994 and fourth during the first half of 1995. In addition,
debt, capital markets, equity and municipal bonds have all been realigned
under &quot;global client products&quot; reporting directly to Allison.
&quot;To increase coordination, we need to break down walls in the organization,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
But those who left the firm after Allison gained more authority during the
recent reorganization, complain that when Komansky held a similar position
(before becoming president), fewer areas reported directly to him, and heads
of divisions such as debt and capital markets had more autonomy. There's
no doubt that Allison's star has risen under the reorganization, though
a Merrill spokesperson says that it was a decision made by Tully and Komansky.
With institutional business riding high, Allison seems well positioned to
become the next president of Merrill, which could occur when Tully retires
in 1997. Allison did the requisite stint in retail. A big plus these days
is that, unlike either Tully or Komansky, he also has international experience
(in Paris and the Middle East). <BR>
<BR>
Having served as treasurer and chief financial officer of the firm, Allison
is credited with a big role during the 1989 restructuring that cut costs
and boosted Merrill's profitability. While designing the firm-wide compensation
systems calculated to foster teamwork, he came up with a stock plan known
as &quot;herbies&quot; that has enriched almost everyone at Merrill. He
is better educated than his superiors, having gone to Yale and Stanford.
(Tully graduated from New York's St John's University, and Komansky attended
the University of Miami. After becoming high level executives, they both
went through Harvard Business School's advanced management programme.) <BR>
<BR>
Allison is also driven. &quot;He's an extremely hard worker,&quot; says
a former executive. &quot;He is really pushing the envelope in a lot of
ways, putting a lot of pressure on individuals to perform better to get
more with less.&quot; But even those who say they have a positive impression
of him also say he can be hard to get on with. &quot;He can be a very difficult
guy,&quot; says one. It's a sharp contrast to the two men at the top of
Merrill today, which is one reason his rise to power was viewed somewhat
ominously by those who departed. <BR>
<BR>
Allison's style seems to rankle many of the independent-minded traders and
the so-called intellectuals brought over in the late 1980s to the derivatives
and swaps areas. One former Merrill trader, who left a few years ago, says:
&quot;It strikes me that the place is being run by technocrats reading McKinsey
reports.&quot; One former employee who left recently speaks of an &quot;<I>Animal
Farm</I>&quot; atmosphere where the principles are trotted out to &quot;cut
off discussion and intimidate people&quot;. &quot;You'll be talking about
doing a transaction - whether or not you should do something for a client,&quot;
he says. &quot;This should be about making money after all. If I said 'I
don't think you should do that deal', somebody would say 'you're not client-focused'.
They tar you with saying you're not client focused.&quot; <BR>
Merrill senior executives deny this is the case. Kenney agrees that there's
a constant debate on the subject of client focus. &quot;You can easily go
broke offering client service,&quot; he says, only half in jest, but adds
that building relationships sometimes necessitates foregoing adequate returns.
A former Merrill executive, however, insists that a lot of derivatives products
that were profitable for firms like Merrill weren't in the best interests
of its clients. &quot;Generally speaking, the battle to make money wins
out over the desire to make sure the client gets the best possible deal.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Komansky insists that is not the Merrill mind-set. As for the stifling of
debate, he suggests: &quot;There's a difference between debate and acquiescence.
If a decision is made contrary to yours, then that's stifling - well, maybe
it is.&quot; In reality, he believes today's environment has changed the
types of transactions that can be done. There are fewer &quot;bells and
whistles&quot;, he says, hinting at the derivatives creativity Merrill became
known for. <BR>
<BR>
In his defence, Allison insists he's not trying to create a &quot;rigid
bureaucracy&quot; but rather to foster creativity by bringing people from
diverse areas to work together. &quot;In the past, there wasn't much candour
around here,&quot; he says. Referring to Mitchell and his team, he adds:
&quot;Individuals, through their own willpower, could impose their own views.&quot;
Even Mitchell's admirers admit that, as one put it, &quot;he had no small
ego&quot;. And many agree that the changes Allison has engineered were necessary.
<BR>
<BR>
Although Mitchell was the head of fixed income, it was his predecessor,
Roger Vasey (moved aside when Komansky was brought in to head the division),
who started developing the division's power base. Both men &quot;eliminated
barriers&quot; within fixed income, say former colleagues. &quot;They created
a culture in which teamwork <I>did</I> thrive,&quot; says a former trader.
&quot;Those two guys were the glue who transformed Merrill from literally
a bucket shop to the top fixed-income player on the street.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He says that it was Mitchell and Vasey who brought investment banking business
to Merrill by way of its new issues desk and risk management execution.
Such blue-chip names as Kodak and PepsiCo became clients this way. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Shooting stars</B> <BR>
<BR>
One colleague says of Mitchell: &quot;Within the framework of his responsibility,
nobody was able to build a stronger team orientation.&quot; Mitchell reputedly
knew each one of the 700 people in his division by name. He was also capable
of bending the rules to suit his needs, say colleagues. As an example of
his fiefdom-building, one former associate reminisces how Mitchell would
take over an obscure department with 100 people when a headcount freeze
was instituted, then fire those working there and rehire the type of people
he wanted. &quot;It was not pernicious. He just believed he could do better.
He may have known better.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Those close to Mitchell say that asking him to head equities, an area weaker
than fixed income, was forcing him sideways, if not downwards. His seniors
were asking him &quot;to throw away his street equity [his market value
as a professional] and bet on Merrill 100%&quot;, explains one former colleague.
&quot;If you're not comfortable with those at the top - meaning Allison
- it's not a decision you want to make.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some say they had seen the end of the star system coming, when Vasey left
the debt division in 1992. Traders' bonuses began to decline, as part of
Merrill's policy of linking compensation to the firm's overall results.
After the bond market rout of 1994, it was no doubt an easier time to limit
fixed income's influence. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;They don't want anybody who rocks the boat,&quot; says a colleague
of Mitchell who followed him out of the door.&quot; To become a star, to
become successful, at the end of the day you have to go out on a limb. It
ruffles feathers. In the past, what was important was building the business.
Now it came back to bite you.&quot; Under the reorganization, he says, &quot;anyone
who was a star was looked at with a different view. The politicians, who
were generally not the stars, were the ones who came out on top.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With Merrill so firmly placed near the top of the heap, it may not need
stars any more. At least, that's the gamble Merrill is taking. No one individual
can be bigger than the firm, says Daniel Napoli, the senior vice-president
who heads risk management. That lesson, he says, was learned in the Rubin
trading debacle in 1987. Napoli, who interviews traders before they are
hired, says he always resists the &quot;cocky person who always tells you
his or her P&amp;L&quot;. At Merrill, he notes, most of the P&amp;L &quot;comes
from the bull&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
<H3>The principles </H3>
Merrill Lynch chairman Dan Tully, a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent,
considers Merrill's five guiding principles - client focus, respect for
the individual, teamwork, responsible citizenship, integrity - to be part
of an inviolate moral code. &quot;Who can argue with them?&quot; he asks
rhetorically. <BR>
<BR>
Although these buzzwords were first turned into a slogan in 1992, they weren't
entirely new. Merrill already had precepts that Tully says &quot;had helped
guide me in my career&quot;. Under him, he says, the principles were &quot;reworded,
reformatted and given a more physical profile&quot;, in an effort to &quot;maintain
and enhance&quot; the corporate culture. Though some have suggested that
the principles, and the culture they stand for, are his legacy, he is impatient
with the idea. &quot;I don't have a legacy,&quot; he scoffs. (The whole
idea seems a bit highbrow for Tully, who is beloved at Merrill for his warmth
and empathy. Once in Bermuda he stayed out till 6 am drinking beers and
singing karaoke with the Merrill troops.) <BR>
<BR>
The revamping of Merrill's principles wasn't a matter of chance timing.
Wall Street's reputation was at an all-time low after the scandals and excesses
of the 1980s. The company's earnings had been lacklustre and the firm was
riven with internal bickering. While Merrill prides itself on being one
of the firms no-one wrote a book about during the 1980s (or during the 1920s
for that matter), it was the first to suffer a major trading scandal. In
1987, Merrill lost almost $400 million in a single day through the antics
of rogue trader Howard Rubin. That event is still talked about today by
executive management, serving as a constant reminder of the need for vigilance.
Subsequently, Merrill hired former World Bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to
help devise a risk management system, and became the first Wall Street firm
to have a risk-management executive, Daniel Napoli, report directly to the
president and sit on the executive committee. And Merrill is one of the
few Wall Street firms to make its chief counsel vice-chairman - an indication
of the importance it places on its reputation. <BR>
<BR>
Charles Merrill, who started the firm in 1914, is credited with developing
the firm's high ethical standards. According to Winthrop Smith, a Merrill
executive vice-president whose father was one of the early founders of the
firm, Charles Merrill withdrew from the business just before the crash of
1929. At that time, he encouraged the partners to sell their stock holdings.
Because of his foresight, says Smith, &quot;the firm and the clients didn't
suffer, because they were unleveraged&quot;. Merrill, who specialized in
merchant banking for retailers like the nascent Safeway Stores and JC Penney,
turned over much of his business and employees to EA Pierce, already the
nation's largest wire house, as brokerage firms with branch networks connected
by telegraph were known. When he left Wall Street, Merrill, already an investor
in Safeway, became active in the grocery store chain's management. This
taught him the mass-merchandizing techniques that would eventually turn
Merrill Lynch into a national retail powerhouse. <BR>
<BR>
Smith says that his father, who had gone to work with Pierce, tried to convince
Charles Merrill to re-enter the brokerage business in 1940. It was a tough
sell. After the 1929 crash, and the ensuing Great Depression, Merrill came
to believe that &quot;the average retail investor didn't understand or trust
Wall Street&quot;, says Smith. The only way to win them back, Merrill felt,
was to do business differently, and that was the condition under which he
returned to Wall Street: &quot;You had to believe that the customer comes
first.&quot; Merrill started offering customer seminars, and focused on
research - both innovative approaches then. It was the beginning of Merrill's
first principle: client focus. <B><I>- MC<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><BR> 
<H3>The culture </H3>
&quot;Culture is a very soft concept. It's very atmospheric,&quot; says
Arthur Zeikel, the Merrill executive vice-president who is also president
and chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch Asset Management. He jokes
that he's still an outsider because he didn't start his career at Merrill.
<BR>
<BR>
To help define the Merrill culture, Zeikel looks for a clue in the profiles
of past and current chief executives. Most have had either a military or
an athletic background. Indeed, after World War II, Merrill sought out returning
veterans to be trained to build up a nationwide firm. It was looking for
individuals with characteristics in common - according to Zeikel, these
included a will to win, discipline, teamwork and the willingness to play
by the rules - and the military provided that. Such attributes, he says,
breed loyalty and leadership. <BR>
<BR>
Chairman Dan Tully doesn't like the military allusion, however. To him,
it sounds &quot;more dictatorial&quot; and &quot;authoritarian&quot; than
the way business is conducted at Merrill. Other executives say Tully views
himself as a &quot;custodian&quot; of the firm for future generations. When
he leaves, he says, he will be proud not of adding to the bottom line but
of building on the firm's culture: &quot;That's what makes great financial
institutions, not the latest new product or extra zeros.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The athletic influence may be part of the reason why Merrill's employees
are regarded in the market as fair-minded good sports. Competitors rave
about the way the bank treats others in the industry - in sharp contrast
to other high-flying firms. &quot;If we have a piece of business we can't
do, we're more likely to go to someone like Merrill, who has treated us
well,&quot; says a banker at a competing firm. In comparing the firm with
Goldman Sachs, he attributes Merrill's attitude to a &quot;higher level
of corporate maturity. They're slightly more long-term in their thinking&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
But a former Merrill executive notes that the type of culture Merrill has
been trying to achieve doesn't come easily. He's not quite sure Merrill
has made the cut. &quot;It takes years, if not decades, to really ingrain
in a place,&quot; says this executive, who previously worked at Morgan Stanley.
At that upper-crust firm, he continues, &quot;if you weren't working for
the common good, you were a dead man&quot;. He tells a story which explains
what the culture is about: &quot;I can remember when I was at Morgan Stanley,
they had an insider-trading thing, and Lewis Bernard [a former partner]
literally cried during a department meeting. The concern for the firm and
its integrity and reputation was so ingrained at the firm that it influenced
everyone's behaviour.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For a retail-based firm, Merrill's record is enviable. Vice-chairman Steven
Hammerman, Merrill's long-standing counsel, notes that the firm has consistently
surpassed others in protecting clients' interests, as measured by standards
such as arbitration cases, customer compliance and the Securities &amp;
Exchange Commission's &quot;rogue broker&quot; report. Hammerman points
to two books written about retail competitors, <I>Burning Down the House</I>,
concerning the now-defunct EF Hutton, and <I>Serpent on the Rock</I>, detailing
Prudential Bache Securities' limited partnership scandal. &quot;Those firms
had a philosophy that the clients' interests came last,&quot; says Hammerman.
To some extent, Merrill's perspective is a measure of its instinct for self-preservation.
&quot;Any firm that thinks they can lower the standard of ethics and stay
in business - they just cannot,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>And ethics</B> <BR>
<BR>
The creation of a strong culture that doesn't tolerate rule-breaking is
a potent obstacle to illegal and unethical behaviour. So is a hefty budget
for compliance, in terms of both technological support and high salaries
- areas in which Merrill leads the industry. But in a business where thousands
of employees are entrusted with huge sums of other people's money, the temptations
are there. Merrill, like any other financial institution, has had its brushes
with scandal. The firm's reputation has largely remained unscathed because
of the way it has handled these. &quot;You have to confront it. It's a little
hard to swallow but if you bury it and it surfaces, then it becomes indigestible,&quot;
says Hammerman. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, for example, the SEC announced that Merrill had paid it $12 million
to settle a dispute over a contract with Lazard Fr&egrave;res that had not
been disclosed to Lazard's municipal clients, four Massachusetts public
agencies, who were being referred to Merrill as underwriting clients. It
appeared, at least, that Merrill had paid Lazard a fee to steer clients
its way - when the clients thought they were getting independent advice.
Merrill says that as soon as it discovered that Lazard was not disclosing
their relationship, it informed the SEC and cancelled the contracts, leading
to the recent settlement. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill's involvement in a more notorious case, the huge default by Orange
County, California, in 1994, has so far resulted in virtually no public
censure or attribution of legal responsibility. Merrill was Orange County's
underwriter and an adviser on some of the leveraged transactions undertaken
by the county's treasurer, Robert Citron. Competitors back Merrill, saying
that its risk management chief Daniel Napoli was &quot;all over Citron&quot;
because of his concern about the county's leverage. As Hammerman notes:
&quot;We have a right to tell clients what we see their exposure is. And
the client has a right to reject it. We're not in a position to substitute
our own judgement for Citron's.&quot; Merrill is still facing law suits,
including some from investors who claim it should not have sold them the
bonds it underwrote for the county if it was so concerned about the county's
leverage. Merrill's response is that the risks were fully disclosed in the
official statements accompanying the note offering in question, a July 1994
$600 million taxable note. A Merrill spokesman points out that only sophisticated
investors were purchasers of these securities, adding that the disclosure
statement indicated that Orange County was engaged in risky derivatives
strategies that could backfire. <BR>
<BR>
The firm may not be culpable of any wrongdoing. But as Komansky says of
the Lazard case: &quot;It looked bad. We can't afford for more of these
kinds of things to happen.&quot; That's the kind of thinking Merrill executives
try to instill in their employees. &quot;Do the right thing,&quot; counsels
Zeikel. &quot;If you don't want your kids to read about you in the newspaper&quot;,
then don't do it. Tully says he doesn't need an ethics class to tell him
what's wrong, and gives a piece of advice for those trying to figure it
out. &quot;If I have a pain in my stomach, I don't do it,&quot; he explains.
&quot;That is ethics.&quot; <B><I>- MC </I></B><p>

GOLD
</H3>
<p>
<H2>Not why, but when </H2>
<p>
<H4>When the price of gold rose past $400 an ounce last month, most commentators
professed puzzlement. But a close analysis of how the market works suggests
that the price rise was inevitable. And so now is its retreat. Peter Lee
examines the technicalities of this arcane market </H4>
<font size=3>
<p>
Gold-bullion dealers would love 1996 to be a pay-back year for them, so
that they can make up for two lean years when almost nothing happened in
their market. For a few weeks in January and February, it seemed that their
wishes might be realized. Hot money threatened to drive the gold price up
beyond its narrow two-year trading range of between $370 and $395 per ounce.
It hit $417 and dealers spoke bravely of $425 - and even perhaps $485. Dissenters
were silenced. One analyst at a leading bullion market-maker, known for
his bearish views on gold, was warned not to air these figures too publicly.
Other analysts were hauled off to make presentations to fund managers in
Boston, New York and Asia, to explain the jump in the price. <BR>
<BR>
But any investor contemplating buying gold should ask not, &quot;Why did
the gold price rise so quickly this year?&quot; but rather, &quot;Why didn't
it move sooner?&quot;. The answer gets closer to the forces that drive the
gold price. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tension beneath the surface</B> <BR>
<BR>
At the end of last year, the three large groups of traditional gold-market
players were all running flat or short positions. These players are speculators
- including leveraged hedge funds; call-option writers - including some
central banks and many banks' bullion-trading desks; and gold producers
- including large South African and Canadian mining companies. These short
positions held the price of gold in a narrow range despite an apparent gap
between strengthening physical demand for gold and falling mine production.
According to estimates from Gold Fields Mineral Services, a London-based
commodity research company, a 16% surge in demand from jewellery fabricators
in India and the Middle East helped raise physical demand for gold to 3,550
tonnes last year. Meanwhile a 10% fall in South African mine production
dampened new supply down to 2,268 tonnes. <BR>
<BR>
Superficially, nothing appeared to be happening. Alan Baker, head of bullion
at Deutsche Bank Sharps Pixley, says: &quot;After April 1993 [when George
Soros bought 12% of Newmont Mining from Sir James Goldsmith who, in turn,
invested some of the $340 million proceeds in call options on gold, thus
sparking a short-lived rally] the gold market entered a period of apparent
inactivity, if only the movement in prices was considered.&quot; But beneath
the surface the tension between short positions and the growing physical
demand for gold became apparent in the lease rate (the interest rate charged
by central banks on short-term loans of gold to dealers or producers who
need to cover short positions). <BR>
<BR>
Historically this rate has been low, around 1% to 1.5%. It has often paid
mining companies to sell gold ahead of production. That requires them to
borrow gold for delivery today, typically at between 1% and 1.5% for three
or six months, and receive dollars in return. Producers can invest this
cash for a risk-free return higher than the lease rate - say 4% or 5%. They
eventually return the borrowed gold from their own production. Such hedging,
or accelerated selling, provides mining companies with certainty of price
on gold sales and more easily managed cashflow. <BR>
<BR>
Late last year, South Africa's two largest producers, JCI and Gencor, as
well as Canadian company Barrick and other American and Australian miners,
were all running large hedging programmes. &quot;The amount of producer
selling was unprecedented,&quot; recalls Martin Frankel, managing director
at Chase Manhattan. It involved sales of at least 300 tonnes above normal
producer hedging in the second half of last year. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile central banks were slow to approve additional short-term loans
from their reserves. Following the collapse of Barings, many central banks
became more cautious about lending gold and cut down the number of bullion
dealers to which they would lend, although they increased their exposure
limits to remaining acceptable counterparties. Their caution coincided with
unprecedented de-mand to cover producer hedging. That drove up the cost
of short-term gold borrowing to 6%, higher than money-market interest rates.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;With the supply of gold tight, and lease rates rising, suppliers are
tempted to hold back for an even better rate,&quot; says Chris Harris, director
at Barclays Metals Group. The gold market briefly went into backwardation
on November 28 and 29 last year, with the spot price higher than three-month
forwards. As with other markets, spot gold is usually lower than the forward
price. Normally, this contango (premium for future delivery) encourages
forward sales. But in November and December, high lease rates reduced the
contango and encouraged buy-backs. Producers who had previously sold forward
at a high premium were able to buy forward at a low premium. The conditions
discouraged further forward sales. That put other groups on the alert. Quickest
to move were US commodity funds and investment funds which began accumulating
long positions in December and January. These speculators favoured dealing
in futures and options on New York's Comex. It did not need much money to
get the price motoring. &quot;Because it is often a thin market, there are
times when a 100-lot order on Comex, which is not a lot of money, can move
the gold price by $1,&quot; says Peter Fava, head of precious metals at
Midland Bank. <BR>
<BR>
On January 3, open interest in gold on Comex rose by 29,000 contracts -
the largest ever one-day rise. At the same time, central banks and interbank
dealers were reviewing their own options positions. <BR>
<BR>
Gold is an asset which exerts an unusual allure. Even with the spot price
stuck in a narrow range for two years, many players fancied their chances.
When daily market-making volumes were low and prices static, dealers saw
a chance to generate premium income by writing call options at well above
market rates. &quot;A lot of banks saw this as a way to milk the market,&quot;
says one dealer. &quot;A lot of counterparties sold calls and then had to
cover when the price moved. They found themselves buying into strength.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
A perennial gold market mystery is what central banks, which sit on 34,000
tonnes of gold, might be doing at any given time. Canada's has been running
down reserves gradually, replacing them with conventional interest-bearing
assets. The Dutch sold 300 tonnes in January 1993, depressing the gold price
until Soros and Goldsmith intervened. Belgium sold 175 tonnes in the first
half of last year. Others, such as the US, Switzerland, Germany, Japan,
France, Italy, the IMF and the European Monetary Institute, do nothing.
<BR>
<BR>
Central bank activity lends some unpredictability to the market. One dealer
says: &quot;More than 54 central banks are active in gold, a small number
aggressively so. I suspect that many central banks view their gold reserves
as a legacy which they don't really know what to do with. Very few seem
to have clear policy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many central banks lend to dealers to receive some income through the lease
rate. They may also engage in gold swaps, selling now to raise cash and
buying gold forward. And some take short trading positions, knowing they
can cover these from reserves. Bullion dealers say that the central banks
of China, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa are occasionally
very active, along with others from gold-producing countries. But central
banks which are happy to trade actively in currency and other financial
markets may be cautious in deploying their gold reserves. Similarly, central
banks seldom seen in the currency and other conventional markets may be
unusually aggressive gold dealers. One London trader says: &quot;We deal
with a four-man metals trading group at one central bank which is quite
sophisticated. They began dealing in forward forwards, rather than conventional
spot versus forwards. Then a new governor arrived and curtailed their activities.&quot;
A small but growing number of central banks are also active in options trading.
Terry Smeeton, gold specialist at the Bank of England, suggests that business
conducted &quot;has increased very considerably&quot; in the past year or
so, with OTC options volume greatly exceeding even the booming exchange-traded
market. Traders estimate that annual combined OTC and exchange-traded option
volume totals 19,000 tonnes, or almost 10 years' new supply from mines.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Indestructible reserves</B> <BR>
<BR>
The gold market lays great store by confidentiality - hence it is full of
rumour. One favourite was that the central bank of Brazil was running a
huge short options position which it needed to hedge. This excited speculators
who thought that the Brazilian bank traders, in covering this position,
would force up the price. But in January, the bank said it had no outstanding
unhedged options positions. <BR>
<BR>
But gold producers certainly did have short positions to hedge and quickly
did so, reducing their accelerated sales and in some cases buying back hedges
as the spot price rose. Barrick Gold Corp, one of the largest, and smartest
producers, reduced its hedging by one-third, or 100 tonnes, between December
and January. By reducing accelerated sales, Barrick, and other gold producers
that followed suit, removed one of the great restraints on the gold price.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether gold continues its run-up in price or settles into a steady range
now depends on whether or not more mainstream financial investors, which
own no gold, will be attracted. According to one analyst: &quot;They are
the last great short. In fact, they are the mother of all shorts.&quot;
So far, the theory that financial investors will allocate a percentage of
their portfolios to gold as a hedge against inflation appears to be no more
than wishful thinking on the part of gold speculators. They hope that these
mainstream investors will drive up the price. Vague fears about a resurgence
of inflation are not new. They failed to move the gold price last year.
In Japan - where interest rates are near zero, the banking system is burdened
with bad debts, and institutions have previously shown an affinity with
gold - imports of gold are actually falling. <BR>
<BR>
Edwin Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, says: &quot;I would be
the biggest bull in London if funds were locking gold away. But it's all
paper trading and a lot of investors which went long in January and February
have already taken profits.&quot; Turnover on Comex in January was equivalent
to an underlying amount of 4,300 tonnes or nearly two years' new supply
from mines - a mind-boggling number. Arnold adds: &quot;If a fraction of
that represented real physical demand, the price would be breaking through
$500 an ounce, $600, even higher. But scarcely an ounce of gold has been
put away in the vaults as a long-term investment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Novices were drawn in during January and February. Sylvia Williams, assistant
director, precious metals, at Barclays Bank, says: &quot;We received a huge
number of calls from individuals through the bank's branch network. Even
when we set a minimum investment amount of &#163;10,000, individuals still
came back with buy orders.&quot; Some technically oriented managed funds
and commodity traders in the US were also drawn back into gold after a long
absence. Meanwhile the speculators are, according to one analyst, &quot;as
long as they have ever been&quot;. But it's hard to see who might be the
new buyers to take the gold price higher. <BR>
<BR>
Mainstream investors are more likely to buy mining company shares than to
buy gold itself. There is a leverage effect here. If the gold price moves
up, gold mining companies shares soar. But there is no reverse effect. Share
buying won't drive up the price of gold. <BR>
<BR>
Much also hinges on the balance between the gold supply and demand from
jewellery manufacturers and other users. Gold bulls and bears are divided
over their analysis of the gap between physical demand and new supply. Bulls
agree with the February report of the World Gold Council that the gap provides
&quot;a strong fundamental base to the gold market&quot;. Bears dismiss
this as propaganda. One analyst says: &quot;A lot of what you hear about
this so-called gap is rubbish. Gold miners denote this gap as a straight
line. That is like Soviet economics. It ignores the fact that demand is
price-sensitive.&quot; Bears argue that as gold prices rose towards $390
at the end of last year, imports into such key markets as Singapore, Hong
Kong, Dubai, Japan, Taiwan and Turkey began falling. Manufacturers will
stop buying as prices rise. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile gold's indestructibility inherently weakens its price. Most of
the gold which has ever been mined still exists. It can be recycled. &quot;The
higher and quicker you drive prices, the more you kill physical demand,&quot;
says Arnold. By mid-February, gold prices had settled back into a range
of between $402 and $407 an ounce. Market participants were playing trading
games again. Dealers noted a lot of buying just before the close of trading
each day. Behind this may have been a few investors keen to make sure the
charts look good for a few weeks before trying to push the price higher
and gather momentum for a sustained rally. If speculative investors can
keep gold in a range of between $400 and $405 for several months, physical
buyers might begin to accept this as a new base price and underpin the market
at that level. Then the market might look for an excuse - an interruption
in supply in South Africa - to push the spot price up. <BR>
<BR>
Chartists say a recurrence of the pattern that followed Soros and Goldsmith's
1993 market coup could take the price to $485 this year. But Soros has already
sent out a bear signal by announcing his disposal of a 2% stake in Newmont
between January 22 and February 5. Many investment funds bought gold on
margin - often borrowing in yen at negligible interest rates, expecting
the yen to be weak to flat against the dollar - and cannot hold on too long.
Following the furious activity of January and February, many traders are
said to have unwanted long positions which they will cut quickly if the
price rallies again. <BR>
<BR>
However, no new medium-term buyers are appearing. To generate the returns
of 20% and more that they promise wealthy private investors in the US, these
investment funds tend to move swiftly in and out of markets looking for
a quick turn in a low-rate world. Last year they dabbled in silver, next
year it could be copper. One dealer says: &quot;If gold runs and stalls
again, the price might break and the speculators might position themselves
to push it on the down-side.&quot; On February 20, gold hit $400 after a
busy trading session in New York. The next day it opened in London at $398
and rallied to $399. Many new investors in January and February came into
the market at around $390 to $395. Their nerves will continue to be strained.

<H3>CORRUPTION</H3> 
<H2>Stealing the family silver </H2>
<H4>From mafia ties and drug trafficking to bribery and insider dealing,
allegations of corruption have tainted numerous privatizations around the
world. As governments, bankers and investors are learning, to create stable
market economies it is necessary to do more than shift assets out of governments'
hands. The process also needs transparent procedures to monitor into whose
hands they fall - and to determine who reaps the benefits. Michelle Celarier
reports </H4>
When Enrique Molina Sobrino, one of Mexico's wealthiest businessmen, tried
to expand his empire by buying the state-owned Sugar Corp which Puerto Rico
was hoping to privatize last year, charges of drug trafficking against him
finally brought the sweet deal to a screeching halt. The accusations against
Molina Sobrino, chairman of Consorcio Azucarero Escorpion and the Gemex
(Grupo Embotellador de M&eacute;xico) soft-drink-bottling company (Mexico's
biggest distributor for Pepsi-Cola), were made by Eduardo Valle, an intelligence
officer in the Mexican justice department during the administration of Carlos
Salinas de Gortari. <BR>
<BR>
In May 1994, Valle says he fled to the US after he began to realize that
drug traffickers had permeated the top levels of the Salinas government,
which had undertaken an ambitious privatization programme. Valle took copies
of over 100 files of ongoing investigations with him. Included among them
was a warrant for the arrest of Molina Sobrino, whom Valle claims is a businessman
for Mexico's drug kingpins, the Gulf Cartel. &quot;He's a bad guy,&quot;
says Valle. &quot;In Mexico, Molina Sobrino was widely known as the only
<I>Pepsi</I> bottler who distributes 'coke'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The highly respected former investigator, who wrote a best-selling book
in Mexico called <I>Segundo Disparo</I> (Second Shot) about the corruption
of the Salinas government leading to the murder of presidential candidate
Luis Donaldo Colosio, is now in hiding in the US. He claims that the Gulf
Cartel has placed a half-million-dollar contract on his life. <BR>
<BR>
Molina Sobrino had other questionable business ties. He had been a business
partner of Mexico's fugitive banker, Carlos Cabal Peniche, who built up
Grupo Financiero Cremi-Union during the financial industry's privatization
and tried to take over US canned-fruit company Del Monte Foods. After Cabal
Peniche allegedly looted Banco Cremi-Union and fled the country with $700
million, the loss-ridden bank had to be bailed out by the government in
1994. Investigators allege that Cremi-Union was set up for the purpose of
laundering the Gulf Cartel's cash. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Enough suspicion</B> <BR>
<BR>
Escorpion's chairman was also part owner of Banpais - another rogue bank
born of Mexico's privatization spree. It too was placed into government
hands after it collapsed last year. The devaluation of the peso battered
Molina Sobrino's business empire in 1995 and he sold a 25% stake in Gemex
to Pepsico. The Mexican industrialist has denied the criminal allegations
and the Mexican government says he is no longer under investigation. The
original files, whose copies Valle carries with him, have since disappeared.
<BR>
<BR>
But for Puerto Rico, which had favoured Escorpion (over several other bidders)
as a buyer for its Sugar Corp, suspicion itself was enough to derail the
deal. The privatization efforts of the government were already under attack.
The most controversial had been the sale of its shipping line, Navieras,
last March to a group with ties to the Gambino and Genovese mafia families
in New York, where their control of the docks has been legendary. Even after
a state-financed investigation by US investigative firm Fairfax Group uncovered
the mob ties, and financing by CS First Boston fell through, the state sold
Navieras to the group anyway. Puerto Rican senator Nicolas Nogueras railed
against the government's decision. &quot;You don't need absolute proof that
these guys are connected with organized crime when you know that ships are
a way to carry a lot of illicit cargo,&quot; he argues. <BR>
<BR>
The $132.4 million deal was eventually completed, with financing arranged
by BT Investment Partners, the parent of the shell company set up to take
over Navieras. But last August, only a few months after the sale, Navieras'
new executive vice-president Robert Murphy, whom Fairfax had reported was
&quot;a possible front for organized crime&quot;, was forced to resign to
face fraud and money-laundering charges in the US. The incident cast a further
shadow across the Puerto Rican government which senator Nogueras suggests
was on the take. The senator, who has found himself under investigation
for tax evasion in what seems like a counter-charge following his criticism
of the government, says the deal was primarily financed by mortgaging the
shipping company's assets, which consequently bled Navieras. The shipping
line is now on the verge of closing and the senator believes it will soon
be requesting financial aid from the state to stay afloat. <BR>
<BR>
Mafia ties, drug trafficking and money laundering may be some of the most
sinister examples of corruption surrounding government privatization efforts
but bribes, kickbacks, insider dealing and fraud are also prevalent. While
much of the most outlandish illicit activity appears to focus on local players
and deals, even some global privatizations have been tainted. In the case
of the planned privatization of India's telecommunications company VSNL
(Vdesh Sanchar Ngam Limited), the deal was scuttled after the lead managers,
investment bankers Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson, refused to give
bribes, according to individuals close to the negotiations. <BR>
<BR>
From Moscow to Mexico City to New Delhi, corruption is a problem that threatens
to undermine the very market economics privatization is meant to ensure.
The end of the Cold War and enthusiasm for market economics has made privatization
of state assets a top priority. But the eagerness of the state has led to
a variety of misdeeds which have often been exacerbated by the ideological
zeal that accompanies privatization fervour. &quot;A greater focus has been
placed on shifting assets out of governments' hands than on seeing into
whose hands they would fall,&quot; says Frank Vogl, who heads the Washington
DC-based Vogl Communications and is also vice-chairman of Transparency International,
a coalition that promotes ethical business practices around the globe. Vogl
argues that corruption is one of the greatest threats to the development
of the emerging economies. Not only does it create the risk of political
backlash but corruption can end up creating even more financial problems
for governments. <BR>
<BR>
Most countries in the throes of privatization have not had the regulatory
or judicial framework in place to ferret out corruption, much less the democratic
process that draws attention to it. On top of that, many of these companies
were state-owned monopolies whose accounting systems bore little resemblance
to that of a profit-oriented business. All of the above create an &quot;inherent
vulnerability of privatization to corruption&quot;, says Peter Eigen, chairman
of Transparency International and a former World Bank official. &quot;The
valuation of an enterprise itself is an incredibly difficult thing,&quot;
he says. &quot;If a country decides to privatize a big electricity plant
or a hospital or whatever, you will find very quickly that people who have
a lot of political power will use this to enrich themselves. They may spin
off assets, and what is left over is a shell with lots of liabilities and
a few assets.&quot; He notes that one argument made against privatization
in many countries is its tendency for corruption. &quot;There's some truth
to that. If you don't watch privatization, you can do a lot of damage.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, multilateral agencies mostly ignored the potential for corruption,
investor enthusiasm glossed over such problems and competition for the business
was so keen that investment bankers may have even skirted the law to win
mandates. But over the past six months, the privatization mood has shifted
dramatically. A number of highly publicized global privatizations have either
encountered difficulties getting off the ground or have bombed after their
offering. As the business cools and the political environment shifts, there
is some hope that abuses will be less acceptable. As Eigen points out, many
dictatorial regimes were tolerated &quot;as long as they were on the right
side of the Cold War&quot; and their corruption was &quot;supported and
kept in power by either the West or East. This is gone.&quot; He says he
was particularly encouraged by World Bank chairman James Wolfensohn's maiden
speech at last year's IMF/World Bank annual meeting, in which he mentioned
the problem of corruption. &quot;Before, people at the bank never used that
word,&quot; says Eigen. &quot;It was a dirty word.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Learning curve</B> <BR>
<BR>
The World Bank's vice-president in charge of Latin American privatizations,
Shahid Burki, admits: &quot;We're learning from experience.&quot; In retrospect,
for example, the agency's encouragement of Panamanian privatization under
general Manuel Noriega, now imprisoned in the US for drug trafficking, was
not so wise, adds another World Bank official. After Noriega was arrested,
it was revealed that insider dealing in the Panamanian privatization programme
was rife, with many companies ending up in the hands of Noriega's cronies.
<BR>
<BR>
Yet not everyone is so confident that corruption is any less tolerated in
the new world order. Unfortunately, there are other political objectives
that tend to promote privatization at any cost. US Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) officials, among others, have said privately that the corruption of
the Salinas government in Mexico and the growing influence of drug traffickers
in its economy was well known in Washington but ignored by both the Bush
and Clinton administrations because of their commitment to pass the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Lobbying for last year's multi-billion
dollar Mexican bailout kept a lid on the true dimensions of Mexican crime
and the Salinas scandal, even as the corruption began to come to light.
(Former president Carlos Salinas fled Mexico after his brother Raul was
arrested for his alleged role in the murder of a leader of the ruling party.
Suspected of receiving illicit money from drug traffickers and others, Raul
Salinas holds some $100 million in Swiss banks.) Law enforcement officials
argue that the next politically sensitive country to erupt on a massive
scandal could be Russia where the central role of the powerful Russian mafia
in the newly privatized economy is likewise underplayed by US officials
for strategic reasons. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, even some bankers fear that corruption could become more acceptable
in the financial industry because of the heightened competition among investment
banks for privatization business as the visible margins are squeezed. &quot;Everybody
is bleeding money, particularly the US banks,&quot; says an Asia analyst
based in Hong Kong. &quot;I would think the temptation is greater.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Insider dealing</B> <BR>
<BR>
The seamy side of privatization is indisputable, though not always illegal
in the countries where it has occurred. From the beginning of privatization
in the former communist world, insider dealing was the norm as the <I>nomenklatura</I>
routinely became capitalists, securing big stakes in most of the newly privatized
companies. Perhaps nowhere has corruption been any more pervasive than in
the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) where a former Treuhandanstalt
director says that as many as 500 scandals plagued the agency's rapid privatization
of the country's industry. &quot;Often we had very major problems in establishing
the honesty of investors or of the existing management,&quot; says Oltmann
Siemens, who now works for the World Bank's IFC in Washington. Many critics
have argued that the speed with which the Treuhand undertook its mission
increased the likelihood of crime. Siemens doesn't take issue with that.
&quot;From the moment Treuhand opened its doors and said these companies
are for sale, the whole country was up for grabs. We had an average of 8,000
deals pending.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The east German experience offers a microcosm of privatization's many abuses.
At first, unscrupulous lawyers and accountants who were not allowed to practise
in the west took advantage of the neophyte east German capitalists, engaging
in fraudulent contracts and overcharging for advice. Then investors came
to the Treuhand and asked for working capital loans in exchange for small
investments and fled with the money. &quot;Hundreds of millions are believed
to have been siphoned out of companies by various methods and the money
ended up not only in Swiss banks but also in Norwegian banks or the Cayman
Islands,&quot; says Siemens. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We could not avoid that sometimes there were real criminals who were
entering our offices - people experienced at dealing with the communists.
After the Berlin Wall came down they knew with whom they could make a deal,&quot;
says Siemens. Although westerners tended to be responsible for &quot;the
sophistication of the crime&quot;, he says, the east Germans weren't always
innocent lambs. In one case, Communist Party money, totalling Dm550 million,
that was supposed to be turned over to the Treuhand, was illegally disbursed
in loans made to Communist Party trustees, leading to numerous prosecutions
and law suits against banks. Siemens regrets that the Treuhand didn't have
the human resources to go after all suspected cases. But one reason many
of its scandals have come to light - in contrast to other countries - is
because the former GDR was incorporated into Germany and became answerable
to its legal system. <BR>
<BR>
Since government officials are in charge of privatizing assets, bribes,
payoffs and kickbacks are other crimes routinely suspected in privatization,
particularly in countries where governments are known to be corrupt, where
bribery is a well-known business practice or where dictatorships exist.
<BR>
<BR>
The fate of India's thwarted VSNL telecommunications privatization is one
stunning example. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson were delighted towards
the end of 1993 when they snared the hotly contested mandate to place 35
million VSNL shares worldwide. But the delays that inevitably accompany
such highly politicized dealings put the launch off until April when the
bankers suggested the price range be reduced by approximately 15% to take
account of the emerging markets blowout in early 1994. The bankers knew
the lower price would be difficult for the Indian government to accept but
went ahead building the book in the hope that &quot;once it was built, they'd
agree on a price reduction&quot;, says one banker close to the deal. Then
things got confusing. &quot;First they said 'yes' to the new price range
but then they said 'no',&quot; says this banker. &quot;Not only that, but
it came back very quickly that if we wanted to go ahead, then a certain
amount of money would have to be transferred to a bank in Switzerland. We
were basically told that we would have to pay off people if the deal were
to go ahead, and we said 'no'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Last laugh</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Indian government blamed the investment bankers for the deal's collapse,
creating a flurry of bad local press for Salomon and Kleinwort. &quot;We
couldn't make a statement saying that someone wanted a bribe in order to
get the deal,&quot; says this banker. &quot;You can't say that in public.
At least nobody wants to be the first to say it.&quot; The bankers may have
had the last laugh. Scandals have shaken the government and a few ministers
have already resigned. <BR>
<BR>
While some bankers say that corruption is a way of life and unavoidable
in certain countries, most are horrified by the very idea of bribe-seeking.
&quot;We would be unwilling to consider such a thing,&quot; says David Mulford,
CS First Boston's vice-chairman who is active in the firm's privatization
business. &quot;I don't have any direct experience with any efforts to seek
bribes or kickbacks from us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
US companies are forbidden by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
to bribe foreign companies or governments. Since the US outlaws the bribing
of foreigners while in most other countries such payments are not only legal
but tax-deductible, the act is widely viewed by US businessmen as disadvantaging
them in global competition. Some may seek to find ways around the prohibitions,
often by paying consulting or attorney fees to locals. Indeed, most bribes
are made through middlemen. &quot;Where corruption comes in is the use of
locals to joint venture with you or represent your interests,&quot; says
Michael Hershman, president of the Fairfax Group. &quot;It's pretty fierce
bidding. Bankers want to do everything they can to get a foot up. They look
for a well-connected local guy to assist in putting in their bid and in
marketing their bids.&quot; As a result, he notes, bankers may not even
know about bribes that are paid. <BR>
<BR>
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act's prohibitions are fairly strict however.
If a fee is judged to be excessive, or if a foreign partner ends up using
the money to make bribes, the US firm is liable. Penalties are severe and
individuals in a company can be prosecuted. At the same time, bribes paid
by a local partner are often &quot;very hard to prove&quot;, says one attorney
familiar with the act. <BR>
<BR>
During Mexico's Salinas administration, lawyers were commonly used to funnel
bribes, according to US law enforcement officials. &quot;You're probably
going to see the Salinas case spin off into the legal community,&quot; predicts
one. Originally investigators believed that drug traffickers were the only
source of Raul Salinas' wealth but now there are indications that some of
the money came from payoffs made by foreign companies in order to do business
in Mexico. <BR>
<BR>
Details surrounding the $1.2 billion global privatization of Indonesian
telecommunications company Indosat have also raised eyebrows. Some bankers
looked askance at the disclosure in Merrill Lynch's Indosat prospectus that
20% of its fees would be paid to a group of local businessmen with close
government ties. Merrill has since formed a joint venture with this group,
PT Persada Kian Pastilestari, in order to receive a licence for a securities
operation in Indonesia. &quot;Some bankers believed Merrill should obtain
a letter from the company saying they are not paying bribes&quot; to protect
itself legally, says one senior banker at another firm. In general, he notes,
&quot;the resources are there, so if people want to take the money to pay
bribes, you can't stop them&quot;. Merrill Lynch declined to comment. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, local contacts are essential for all investment banks working
abroad. To avoid any appearance of impropriety, CS First Boston's Mulford
says that the bank does not normally make payments on a deal-by-deal basis
but does have arrangements with some local affiliates and advisers that
are paid a retainer and given a bonus &quot;depending on how useful they
are&quot;. &quot;If you make an arrangement for an individual on a deal
with big connections, you run the risk [because] it's more difficult to
control, it's more open to interpretation,&quot; he explains. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Unwritten rules</B> <BR>
<BR>
The World Bank has spelled out a number of procedures that countries are
advised to follow to avoid any undue influence-peddling, insider dealing
and other charges of corruption. In other words, they are designed to make
the process as transparent as possible. These unwritten rules include an
open, competitive bidding process, where the evaluation of the bids is done
by reputable institutions, local or otherwise. The World Bank's Burki says
that countries should specify what types of buyers will be qualified to
bid. &quot;They should have experience in that sector or in that industry
or should have the ability to bring in capital.&quot; Countries are further
encouraged to make all documentation public and ensure as wide as possible
ownership of the shares. Typically a big privatization will involve strategic
partners as well as institutional share ownership. &quot;There's no point
in creating private monopolies instead of public sector ones. We know that
public sector monopolies can be inefficient, but private ones can be perverse,&quot;
he adds. <BR>
<BR>
The World Bank and the IFC have promoted these standards and occasionally
get involved in privatizations in countries &quot;not renowned for financial
probity&quot;, says one official. &quot;We are the assurance that the procedures
will be fairly transparent.&quot; However, former World Bank officials are
not so confident. &quot;There is wishful thinking on the part of many of
us to think once you apply our rules, you've done the best you can and therefore
most likely nothing will happen,&quot; says Eigen. &quot;Since I've left
the World Bank, I'm convinced this is a delusion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In reality, the multilateral agency's leverage is limited, since the financing
it provides is usually minimal and generally relegated to helping pay for
advisers or providing technical assistance. But the World Bank has been
known to use what little weight it has. When Argentina sought the advice
of Spain's Iberia Airlines to value its airline Aerolineas Argentinas, the
World Bank &quot;took a walk&quot;, says a bank official in reference to
its refusal to pay the consulting fees. &quot;We wouldn't allow [the involvement
of] one airline that will possibly be in the bidding, for fear it would
scare away any other airlines.&quot; As the bank suspected, Iberia ended
up buying a controlling interest in the Argentine airline. The IFC, which
has increasingly taken on the role of a merchant bank, could potentially
have more influence but some think it has abdicated any such responsibilities
by its profit-making imperative. &quot;The IFC views itself as a competitor
to the investment banking community with its main goal to get the deal done
and earn as much in fees as possible,&quot; charges Vogl, a former World
Bank spokesman. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, these rules are not as simple as they sound. &quot;It becomes
very difficult to have all bids open,&quot; adds Vogl. &quot;They are often
very complicated. When you're talking about the transfer of a nation's telecommunications
system, it's not a question of day one, all bids will be opened and the
person with the highest figure wins.&quot; And what about choosing banking
advisers? When it comes to global deals, if countries use price as the main
guide in choosing their lead manager, they may not always get the best advice
- even though the process seems transparent. Bankers are so keen to get
the business that they may overstate the value of the assets to be privatized.
Typically, developing countries value their assets much higher than an investment
bank does, in part because the assessed value also includes a discount for
the country risk. &quot;And if you give the government too low a price because
you foresee problems, you'll lose the bid right then,&quot; says one banker.
Even in the best of times, the evaluation of the assets leaves room for
confusion. Industries that are technologically complicated such as telecommunications
&quot;lend themselves to mystification&quot; and possible fraud as a result,
says a World Bank official. Interestingly, telecommunications have been
the most sought-after privatization deals and most popular with investors.
Stock performances have been mixed, however. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Keeping in the dark</B> <BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, the rules are only as good as the political environment
in which they exist. Notes Hershman of Fairfax: &quot;You could have open
bidding, closed or competitive bidding. It doesn't matter if you don't have
an independent party to examine the process.&quot; Investment banks may
be hired to evaluate bids, &quot;but they are not usually the decision makers.
The real power lies in the hands of an individual minister.&quot; If he
should act contrary to the bank's advice, it is doubtful whether it would
come to light, since the bankers have signed a confidentiality agreement,
he adds. <BR>
<BR>
A refusal to open the process to public scrutiny often leads to charges
of foul play. Puerto Rican senator Nogueras complains that the clique which
runs the island's government (which he calls <I>Los Honorables</I>, or the
honorable ones, in a book of the same name) conspire to keep the public
in the dark about their business dealings. As he puts it: &quot;Nothing
is ever done in a public square.&quot; When he tried to protest against
the Navieras deal, pointing out the group's possible link to organized crime:
&quot;I was told by my own people in the party and the government to stay
away from this,&quot; he says. Even though the group did not have any real
capital to invest, he was told: &quot;If we don't sell to them, who will
buy it?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the case of the Sugar Corp, the Puerto Rican government appeared to favour
Escorpion despite the presence of other bidders. &quot;All the statements
that there were going to be auctions so that the government would pick the
best only covered the government's prior decision to sell to Escorpion,&quot;
says senator Nogueras. Since bidders had to sign confidentiality agreements
with the government, his charges cannot be proved. <BR>
<BR>
However, when the local newspaper the <I>San Juan Star</I> began reporting
about Molina Sobrino's alleged drug trafficking, the government was forced
to undertake its own investigation of the Mexican entrepreneur. Although
the Puerto Rican government claimed its investigation found no evidence
of charges against Molina Sobrino, it never made its findings public. Nor
did those in charge of the probe ever contact Eduardo Valle, the former
Mexican official who made the original charges, according to Valle. <BR>
<BR>
In Mexico, similar refusals to open the privatization process to full public
view have raised the ire of the opposition party, the Perredists (PRD).
Critics have argued that leading industrialist Carlos Slim, a close associate
of former president Salinas, was given preferential treatment when he purchased
a controlling interest in Tel&eacute;fonos de M&eacute;xico (Telmex), the
country's closest approximation to a blue- chip company. Telmex stock is
widely held by foreign investors. Leading the PRD charge, senator Porfirio
Munoz Lado has called for an investigation of the Telmex privatization which
he says the government has been able to avoid by listing the sale as &quot;not
final&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
A former US intelligence officer who has investigated corruption, drug trafficking
and money laundering in Mexico says that many of Mexico's industrialists
were given &quot;sweetheart deals&quot; during privatization. As for Telmex,
he says, there are some &quot;unexplained aspects&quot; of the deal but
no &quot;smoking gun&quot; to prove any illegal actions. &quot;Carlos Slim
paid a remarkably low price for the company and was lent almost all the
money to buy it,&quot; he explains. He claims it was common practice in
privatizations for money to be lent by Nafinsa, Mexico's national development
bank. Some of these monies have not been repaid. He adds: &quot;The reason
individuals or groups got special deals was because they gave kickbacks
to the politicians.&quot; Such monies are alleged to be part of the illicit
fortune of Raul Salinas. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Banks are &quot;some of the worst&quot;</B> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not every privatization was corrupt but a lot of them were and they
involved hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; the officer notes. &quot;All
of the banking system was privatized and that was some of the worst. The
corruption in the privatization of the banking system was gigantic, which
is one of the reasons the banks are in such bad shape now.&quot; In its
1995 annual report on drug trafficking and money laundering, the US state
department appears to confirm his allegations. It says: &quot;US concerns
have been intensified by reports that drug traffickers have been buying
bank stocks and seeking election to bank boards, after which they open numerous
accounts through which they funnel drug money, often into real estate or
other assets in Mexico.&quot; Another US investigator adds: &quot;A number
of big Mexican banks are involved with money laundering now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Few Mexican cases were as outrageous as the rapid rise and fall of the aforementioned
Carlos Cabal Peniche, now wanted on fraud charges. According to the former
US intelligence officer who is now a consultant specializing in money laundering,
Cabal Peniche was a &quot;creation&quot; of the Gulf cartel, who had close
ties to Raul Salinas. &quot;His [Cabal Peniche's] own rise was meteoric.
He was a lower middle class young man who all of a sudden became extremely
wealthy. He had access to huge resources.&quot; Helped by loans from the
infamous Bank of Credit and Commercial International (BCCI), Banco Cremi-Union
was set up precisely for the purpose of laundering the cartel's cash, claims
the consultant. US officials estimate the Mexican cartel launders about
$4 billion to $5 billion a year. Before fleeing, Cabal Peniche's most brazen
act was a failed $1 billion takeover bid for Del Monte Foods. He had already
purchased Fresh Del Monte Produce, whose banana export business was allegedly
used to transport cocaine. <BR>
<BR>
Drug traffickers have invested with otherwise legitimate Mexican businessmen
who often had little choice, according to investigators. And druglords from
Colombia, the Cali Cartel, who work closely with the Mexicans involved in
the transport of cocaine, have also invested heavily in Mexican privatized
companies, according to reports in the Mexican financial publication, <I>El
Financiero</I>. <BR>
<BR>
Money laundering of drug proceeds has become a huge problem for business,
and is no longer confined to the banking system. Mexico's new government
is now tightening up its money-laundering laws to include in its definition
the purchase of legitimate companies with illicit cash. With technical assistance
from the World Bank, it is also helping to establish the banking regulations
it lacked during the wild privatization spree. A second wave of privatizations
of state assets, such as railways and power plants, is planned and they
are expected to be clean. &quot;The corruption level is much lower now,&quot;
says the former US intelligence officer. &quot;There isn't much left to
steal.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sadly, the privatization of Russia's economy, which is still in its infancy,
promises to offer similar scope for dirty dealings and the same kid-glove
treatment by western governments that has been afforded Mexico. As yet,
there are still actual shares in Russian companies and no statute outlawing
money-laundering. Organized crime is so pervasive that it is seen as an
inevitable, if not natural, player in the process. For example, reports
have been rampant that managers forced workers to turn over their privatization
vouchers. &quot;Who knows what's going on in these deals?&quot; asks one
World Bank official. &quot;If you know, you might not be living tomorrow.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fiduciary responsibility</B> <BR>
<BR>
CS First Boston's Moscow office, under the initial direction of Boris Jordan
and Steven Jennings, was one of the big winners in the first wave of privatization.
The investment bank amassed huge stakes in Russian companies by scooping
up vouchers in procedures that are now viewed as questionable. The two left
CS First Boston last year to set up their own shop. Sources close to the
investment bank say their departure was partly due to their insistence on
operating in a way that was unacceptable to an international investment
bank required to follow western securities law to meet its fiduciary responsibilities.
Mulford, head of CS First Boston Europe, says: &quot;We're glad they're
no longer there. We might have run into a problem.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The current wave of Russian privatization may end up being even more troublesome
however. In the first place, the trend in Russia is to effectively exclude
foreigners from buying a substantial interest in the natural resources companies
being privatized - in part a reaction to the economic power CS First Boston
garnered previously. Yet such a nationalistic response &quot;essentially
excludes those who could exert a watchful eye&quot;, worries the World Bank
official. <BR>
<BR>
Already the latest privatization scheme, which allows Russian banks which
lent the government money last year a chance to bid for enterprise shares
in an exchange for the debt, has been controversial. &quot;Insider dealing
has been fairly blatant,&quot; notes Mulford. Tactics are primitive. For
example, Norilsk Nickel, a major producer of nickel and platinum, apparently
wanted to cut its deal with Unexim Bank. To thwart rival bidders (including
Rossiyskiy Kredit, which offered to pay twice as much), the company insisted
that those making an offer do so at the company's offices in Russia's hinterland.
The company then proceeded to close the local airport so that no other bidders
could meet the requirements - hardly a model of transparency. <BR>
<BR>
The blatant favouritism has created political heat for president Boris Yeltsin,
and is believed to have been the impetus behind his recent sacking of Anatoly
Chubais, the last reformer in Yeltsin's government and an unfortunate supporter
of the loans-for-shares plan. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps even more ominous than the political shake-up is the transfer of
ownership in the making. If the programme continues, Russia's banks - 40%
of which are estimated by the interior ministry to be controlled by the
Russian mafia - could end up owning many of Russia's enterprises, along
with much of its vast natural resources. <p>

<H3>LUXEMBOURG</H3> 
<H2>Facing up to harder times </H2>
<H4>Luxembourg was in at the start of European unity and is as committed
to it as ever. But the things that have made the Grand Duchy great -
tax advantages, strict banking secrecy, the Luxfranc bond market and the
absence of minimum bank reserve requirements - look likely to be swept
away by the tide of EU harmonization. Philip Eade reports on Luxembourgeois
bankers' bullishness in the face of adversity </H4>
The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, strategically placed at the conjunction of
the most prosperous parts of Belgium, France and Germany, has long benefited
from this culturally neutral niche. It is also proud of its role as one
of the six founders of the EU. But as Luxembourg and the other qualifying
EU member states prepare for monetary union, there are undercurrents of
concern in the Grand Duchy about the threat to its thriving financial centre
from a single currency and other harmonization proposals. <BR>
<BR>
Over the years, Luxembourg's <I>place financi&egrave;re</I> has prospered
as a result of comparative advantages such as free cross-border capital
flows, the absence of monetary policy instruments such as minimum reserve
requirements, and a favourable tax environment. The fear is that further
European integration may level the playing-field and threaten the competitiveness
of the Grand Duchy's financial sector. <BR>
<BR>
Financial services account for an estimated 20% of Luxembourg's GDP, four
times the proportion in most other EU countries. It hosts 220 banks, almost
twice as many as a decade ago. The Grand Duchy is the fourth-largest centre
for investment funds, private banking and syndicated loans. Euromarket activities
are increasingly big business there, especially among large German banks
such as Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. The Luxembourg franc
bond market has almost tripled in size over the past three years. Anything
which appears to endanger these industries is viewed with concern. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourgeois say they will still be able to compete in the new environment,
given the widely acclaimed financial expertise and efficient technical-logistical
support they have developed over the years. But with operating costs rising
all the time and corporate taxes higher than anywhere in Europe apart from
Germany, there is a danger that the country may find its remaining assets
priced out of the market. Unless it is able to curb the escalating costs
of banking activities, entry into European monetary union (Emu) is likely
to inflict a serious blow to its financial services industry. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever Emu brings, though, this tiny country of 400,000 souls and 1,000
square miles cannot do without its status as an EU member state. Unlike
Switzerland, for example, it could not hope to maintain a viable exchange
rate outside the EU. It is hardly surprising that Luxembourg has expressed
no qualms about a single currency or a European central bank, in view of
the fact that it signed up to monetary union with Belgium in the inter-war
period; and it was only too happy in 1990 when the Benelux countries (Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg) decided to peg their currencies more tightly
to the Deutschmark than was required by the rules of the EU's exchange rate
mechanism. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg is now closer than any other nation to fulfilling the criteria
in the EU's Maastricht Treaty for entry into Emu, needing only to establish
its own independent central bank as part of the European system of central
banks: &quot;We are the only country which is actually gaining sovereignty
as a result of all this,&quot; jokes Paul Meyers, president of the Luxembourg
Bankers Association (ABBL). <BR>
<BR>
However, harmonization reforms suggested for later implementation, such
as the imposition of European-wide minimum reserve requirements on banks
and the universal application of withholding tax, are making Luxembourg's
bankers uneasy. The absence of minimum reserve requirements has long been
one of the factors encouraging foreign banks to set up in Luxembourg, particularly
those intent on arranging syndicated loans. When Germany imposed minimum
reserve requirements in the 1960s, many German banks established Luxembourg
affiliates to enable them to bypass the requirements. Large German banks
such as Deutsche and Dresdner arrange almost all of their international
syndicated loans from the Grand Duchy. Now Germany is among those EU member
states pushing for the universal application of minimum reserves. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Threat to tax-haven status</B> <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourgeois make no secret of their opposition to any change. &quot;We
are against minimum reserves,&quot; says Serge Kolb, head of monetary policy
at the Institut Mon&eacute;taire Luxembourgeois (IML). &quot;Their function
can easily be performed in more market-conforming ways, such as buying and
selling securities on the market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This stance is the more understandable given Luxembourg's failure to maintain
its share - compared with those of its three principal competitors,
the UK, Ireland and Switzerland - of the increase in international
loan volumes recorded in the past three years. Foreign bankers based in
Luxembourg argue that this is at least partly a result of high operating
costs (currently the second-highest in Europe after Switzerland) and a 40%
corp-orate tax burden. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg's high costs owe much to its salary-indexation mechanism, which
increases what has been low structural inflation in recent years. Another
problem is the long-standing system of incremental seniority-based (as opposed
to performance-related) salary increases. The ABBL's attempts to give greater
weight to performance have been strongly resisted by the trade unions. Their
demands for general pay increases, automatic rises for seniority and a reduction
in the working week from 40 to 35 hours would, according to the ABBL, raise
costs by 40% over the next two years. The unions' position, though, is strengthened
by fears that although its unemployment rate (under 3%) is low by EU standards,
Luxembourg may soon import unemployment, as EU regulations demand free movement
of labour across borders. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg's opposition to minimum reserves is weakened by the fact that
its main ally on this issue, the UK, is for the moment a peripheral EU player
when it comes to the single currency and harmonization. &quot;The Bank of
England is arguing against minimum reserves,&quot; says the ABBL's Meyers,
&quot;but as they are not really in the game it is difficult for them to
be convincing.&quot; The negative impact of minimum reserves will be less
dramatic if interest is paid on them. This is likely because the proposed
European central bank will be obliged to operate according to market principles.
Whatever the precise impact, says Meyers, &quot;we lose our competitive
advantage&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Another of Luxembourg's advantages threatened by closer European integration
is its tax-haven status. No matter how much Luxembourg's bankers play down
the fact, it is clear that the absence of withholding tax on investment
is a principal attraction for foreign investors. The imposition of a 30%
withholding tax in Germany in 1992, for example, resulted in an estimated
capital outflow of Dm100 billion ($71 billion) to Luxembourg. In 1990 there
were 38 German banks in Luxembourg. There are now 72. Luxembourgeois wince
when they see German bank advertisements extolling the tax advantages of
Luxembourg. They know how much this infuriates the German authorities. <BR>
<BR>
Tax harmonization has long been on the EU's agenda and is likely to remain
a priority for a long time. &quot;It's one of the biggest challenges facing
the union,&quot; says the ABBL's Meyers. But the issue is complex and has
led to lengthy negotiations since the EU was established. The measures approved
generally include compromises in the form of options and derogations that
can be taken up by specific member states. The EU's voting rules require
unanimity of the Council of Ministers for tax measures to be adopted. &quot;In
other words,&quot; says Meyers, &quot;it's unlikely that the commission
will propose radical and controversial new measures.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Such confidence seems to be for public consumption. In fact, the withholding-tax
issue is of sufficient concern for the ABBL to have commissioned academic
studies on the subject. In a 1994 report - marked &quot;confidential&quot;,
but now widely disseminated as anti-harmonization propaganda - London
Business School economist Andrew Sentance concluded that an EU-wide withholding
tax would raise the cost of capital by 0.3%, discouraging investment at
the margin and reducing European GDP. It would, Sentance argued, discourage
cross-border flows, impede the efficient working of the capital markets
and encourage substantial capital flight from the EU. And it would reduce
the competitiveness of an important European business sector. Sentance wrote:
&quot;The experience of the growth of the Euromarkets in the 1960s and 1970s,
following the imposition of the Interest Equalisation Tax and capital controls
in the United States, suggests that such a shift could develop considerable
momentum.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sentance concluded: &quot;Many of the problems associated with the tax stem
from the fact that capital is not only mobile within the EU but can also
move to non-European financial centres. Unless these centres can be persuaded
to cooperate with the European authorities, by reporting payments to EU
residents or even imposing a similar tax themselves, a withholding tax will
not be successful in reducing the tax evasion that European governments
fear. Instead, it will simply lead to a transfer of investments outside
the EU, to the detriment of its financial industries and the European economy
as a whole.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Emboldened by this report, the Luxembourg government's firm stance is that
it will accept a uniform withholding tax only if it applies to all OECD
countries. &quot;Taking measures which would drive capital outside Europe
only to enter at a higher cost doesn't make sense,&quot; says treasury minister
Ive Mersch. &quot;A lot of capital has flown to Switzerland just to hide
from the threat. If we are going to harmonize withholding tax, we have to
do it on a broader basis.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mersch makes a similar point about banking secrecy, on which Luxembourg's
private banking business is heavily reliant. &quot;I've never seen private
banking in the absence of confidentiality agreements,&quot; he says. &quot;Why
should we leave this business to non-European countries?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Private banking has an important place in Luxembourg's strategy. Two months
ago, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Trust Bank (Sogenal) became
the latest in a long line of foreign banks that have transferred their private
banking business to the Grand Duchy. &quot;Private banking is the future
of financial business here,&quot; says a local banker. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws prevent foreign tax authorities from inspecting
bank records, except in a limited range of judicial actions. Although tax
fraud is a criminal offence in Luxembourg, tax evasion is not. Like Swiss
banks, those in Luxembourg do not see why they should act as policemen for
the tax authorities. The knowledge that tax authorities can't snoop is a
powerful attraction. Should banking secrecy be compromised, say Luxembourg
bankers, many customers would scurry for cover to Switzerland or offshore
centres. <BR>
<BR>
The Grand Duchy has periodically come under pressure from other EU member
states to fight tax evasion by loosening the limits on banking secrecy.
This reached a height in the early 1990s following the collapse of the Bank
for Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which was registered in Luxembourg
but conducted most of its business from London. <BR>
<BR>
Having weathered the BCCI storm, though, local bankers appear confident
that Luxembourg's secrecy legislation is no longer in jeopardy. &quot;We
should always stress that banking secrecy is not a means for protecting
tax evasion and laundering,&quot; says Meyers. &quot;It is a means for protecting
the privacy of citizens, for whom financial dealings are a very private
matter. If European citizens are to take advantage of cross-border investment
opportunities as allowed under the law, they must not be for that very fact
open to challenge and suspicion. A banker who offers his customers the usual
services is not aiding or abetting tax evasion.&quot; Adds Mersch: &quot;Banking
secrecy does not apply vis-&agrave;-vis the judge, only vis-&agrave;-vis
the executive.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Keeping fund managers happy</B> <BR>
<BR>
It's arguable that whatever the secrecy regime, Luxembourg's cross-border
asset management operations are here to stay, given the expertise developed
over the years and the reputation bankers here have for offering high-quality
advice without being biased towards any type of domestic instrument. &quot;We've
reached critical mass with Lfr10,000 billion [$324 billlion] under management,&quot;
says Meyers. In 1990 it was Lfr2,900 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg took the opportunity to encourage fund management groups to market
their funds in the EU by early implementation of the community's directive
on Ucits (undertakings for collective investments). These pooled, open-ended
investments, similar to unit trusts (mutual funds), enable small investors
to put money into a range of shares or bonds. They can be marketed across
the EU - for example, a German or UK fund manager is free to sell its
products to French or Belgian investors. <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg's favourable tax environment (there is no stamp duty on securities
transactions, no withholding tax on distributions and no income tax on the
fund) has made it a relatively cheap place to set up Ucits. Many of the
large fund management groups, such as Fidelity and Fleming, have their administrative
offices in Luxembourg. There are now 1,325 funds officially based there,
even though in many cases the day-to-day fund management transactions are
carried out in such financial centres as London, New York or Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
Other centres are now competing for this fund management business. Low-tax
Dublin is one such, its particular advantage being a corporate tax rate
of 10% in the docklands zone and labour that is around 20% cheaper than
Luxembourg's. What Ireland lacks is a private banking infrastructure and
client base and, perhaps, the expertise. &quot;There is no doubt that Dublin
is becoming a competitor on the investment-fund map,&quot; says a Luxembourg
banker, &quot;but if you talk to clients they complain about the quality
of service.&quot; Adds the IML's Kolb: &quot;People come here for other
reasons: the know-how, the sophistication of products, and the good advice.
We have a more sophisticated clientele.&quot; But as centres such as Dublin
hone their skills, such arguments may become tenuous, and competitive advantage
will again come down to cost. <BR>
<BR>
<B>More to bonds than Belgium</B> <BR>
<BR>
The precise effects of the changes to EU regulations discussed above are
open to speculation, but other measures are bound to cause losses to Luxembourg's
<I>place financi&egrave;re</I>. Its foreign exchange trading business, for
example, will take a hit from the implementation of a single currency. The
ABBL, though, says it is heartened by a recent Bank for International Settlements
survey indicating that 74% of spot forex transactions and 83% of OTC derivatives
contracts carried out in Luxembourg are against the US dollar rather than
EU currencies. More significantly, the burgeoning Luxembourg franc bond
market will soon be a thing of the past. <BR>
<BR>
Over the past three years, the Luxfranc bond market has almost tripled in
size. Last year a record Lfr450 billion was placed, much of it in Belgium
to retail investors. This was despite fears, reported this time last year
in <I>Euromoney</I>, that fiscal changes in Belgium would remove the comparative
advantage of the Luxfranc market. Bankers in Luxembourg argue that competition
from Belgium is unlikely to materialize. &quot;It won't make sense two years
ahead of the euro [the likely name of the new single currency],&quot; says
one. <BR>
<BR>
The disappearance of the Luxfranc market will hurt Luxembourg's 15 domestic
banks, which stand to lose their niche business as lead managers. The replacement
single-currency bond market is likely to be dominated by between 15 and
25 global players, with Luxembourg's banks only getting a look in as co-lead
managers. <BR>
<BR>
The Grand Duchy's bankers are doing their best to sound bullish on the opportunities
that spring from operating in the single market. One factor in their favour
is their active role as co-lead managers in other markets - Banque
Internationale &agrave; Luxembourg (BIL), for example, is active in 20 bond
markets. &quot;We consider ourselves to be excellent at distribution,&quot;
says BIL's head of capital markets, Gilles Reiter. &quot;We have a strong
investor base, particularly in the Benelux countries. A lot of borrowers
will also have smaller financing needs which we could serve well. Some of
the larger banks cannot really do small issues because of the size and liquidity
requirements of their institutional clients.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
BIL's core clientele demands portfolios with a good balance between high-
and low-yielding instruments. &quot;The euro will be a strong currency and
investors will be looking for alternatives,&quot; says Reiter. &quot;There,
BIL could play a role even as a lead manager. We've been lead managing Canadian
dollar- and Ecu-denominated deals since the early days.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another institution that will be affected by the demise of the Luxfranc
market is the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, half of whose turnover is in Luxembourg
franc bonds. But the exchange, which began automated trading in January
and is now looking to introduce remote membership, expresses confidence
that past activity has created a relationship between Luxembourg banks and
their clients that can be exploited when the single currency is introduced.
&quot;The greater variety in maturities within the single currency will
offset the loss of different currency options,&quot; says the stock market's
managing director, Michel Maquil. &quot;Issuers have been using the Luxembourg
stock market for the past 30 years. I see no reason why they shouldn't go
on doing so.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg's bankers are rather weary of predictions of its downfall as
a financial centre. &quot;They've been doing that for 30 years,&quot; says
one, &quot;but Luxembourg has survived in the past and will survive in the
future, come what may, thanks to the skills and expertise of its financial
staff.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Emu will have an impact on our banks,&quot; adds Mersch. &quot;But
it might be less than in those countries where banks have a huge captive
market. Banks here have always been under pressure from international competition,
especially European.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Other bankers question why, if they were not intent on staying here, foreign
banks should be spending so much money erecting new buildings on the Kirchberg
plateau (home to the European Court of Justice and now a thriving out-of-town
financial centre). &quot;If a bank invests Dm100 million in bricks and mortar,
it suggests they believe in the future,&quot; says Swiss-born Rico Barundun,
managing director of Credit Suisse (Luxembourg) and chairman of the committee
for the promotion of the financial centre. <BR>
<BR>
Well-established foreign banks show few signs of shifting their operations.
&quot;We could do what we do here in London,&quot; says Peter Kaul, director
of Dresdner Bank Luxembourg, &quot;but it's easier here given the language
and the proximity to Germany. Besides, it would be expensive to move -
there would have to be a massive amount of added value to be gained. To
be characterized as a financial centre you need the tradition, a clear-cut
regulatory environment and capable people in the banks. I think Luxembourg
fulfils all those criteria and I don't see any reason for this to change.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But looking beyond those whose interest it is to extol Luxembourg's attractions,
there are signs that the best is over. The change in mood is especially
noticeable among Italian banks, whose number has grown steadily over the
past few years, but some of which, such as the Banca Popolare di Novara
and Banco di Napoli, have recently trimmed their operations in the Grand
Duchy because of declining returns on equity. Other Italian banks that were
expected to establish themselves in Luxembourg, such as CRT (Cassa di Risparmio
di Torino) and the Verona and Firenze savings banks, have held back on a
decision. <BR>
<BR>
Flexibility and an ability to adapt effectively to change are among Luxembourg's
acknowledged hallmarks. But the country is going to need these qualities
in abundance over the next few years. Because if the <I>place financi&egrave;re</I>
is going to maintain its swagger, it seems, it will have to find some new
selling points. <BR>

<H3> <b>SYNDICATED LOANS</b></H3>
<H3> <B>Jumps in the cycle</B> </H3> 
<H4> <B>Wafer-thin margins and favourable conditions have tempted many borrowers to refinance in the syndicated loan
market. But the cycle may now be shifting a gear. Much of the refinancing is done
and lenders are venturing lower down the credit rankings. They may get stung.
Christopher Spink reports  </H4></B> 

<P> Loan syndication departments have been
working at fever pitch since last year. But they continue to suffer dangerous
pressure on margins, while maturities are stretched and covenants become
sketchier. The competition is tempting them to take higher risks for less reward.
That will continue until a shock kicks on the cycle.

<P> In 1995 volumes hit their highest-ever levels &#173; $374.2 billion &#173;
compared with $178.2 billion in 1994, tailing slightly to $180 billion in the
first six months of this year. Yet at the beginning of the 1990s the market was
bleak, for both borrowers and lenders, before it warmed up. The syndicated loan
market tends to follow a cycle.

<P> Many larger corporates have taken advantage of the recent ludicrously low
pricing to refinance their medium-term debt, and lock it in for five years or
more. Refinancings, via revolving facilities, have dominated the scene for the
past 18 months. Some lenders are now wondering where profit-making deals will
come from after 1995's record refinancing-fuelled boom.

<P> The pace hardly slackened this year. Grant Johnson, head of loan syndication
at NatWest Markets, comments: "The market remains strong &#173; an endless stream
of banks still seem ready to participate in the right deals." But as margins thin
under competitive pressure from investment banks, some banks have taken on wider
risks with lower credits. Johnson notes that "with competition so intense to win
mandates at the arranger level, pricing for investment grade credits has been
driven down dramatically. But nobody likes booking loans at the current level:
banks are therefore migrating to other areas where the returns are greater."

<P> Despite the drop in volume since last January, one arranger says that banks
are looking hard at the risks and even turning down a few deals which they regard
as too finely priced for the credit. Sean Boylan, director in syndications and
loan distribution at BZW, agrees that these are "times when banks must be very
careful in their lending policies".

<P> Alarm bells began to ring in mid-1995. Bankers once regarded a 10 basis point
(bp)  margin and 5bp commitment fee as the absolute lowest limit of pricing for a
top-quality corporate name. Last August BTR almost breached these levels &#173;
coming to the market with an 11.5bp margin and 6bp commitment fee for a &#163;700
million ($1.2 billion) five-year revolving credit. Since then banks have thought
more carefully about what precise "ancillary business" they gain from these
loss-leading "relationships".

<P> One arranger, closely connected with the BTR transaction, commented: "If you
are going to gain ancillary business at such low rates you have to ask how
profitable is that business? Relationship banking seems largely to be a thing of
the past." Arrangers say that syndicate members are now insisting that borrowers
outline what further business can be expected from a harshly-priced or less
profitable deal.

<P> This caution is not applied universally, because bankers admit that the
climate still favours borrowers. "Prices are at or bumping along the bottom" is a
common complaint. And volumes have steadily decreased this year. Chris Scott,
head of loan syndication and placement at Sumitomo Bank, says it could be worse.
"There is still downward pressure on margins and pricing," he says. "We have not
reached the levels of the late 1980s. We are close to 1989, but not quite there
yet." At that time, when British Steel came to the market it achieved a margin of
5bp. Electricidade de Portugal commanded a 15bp margin for a 10-year loan and
Merrill Lynch, ridiculously, arranged a 21-year loan for the same company, with
Japanese life assurance firms participating, at 55bp below Libor.

<P> Now for higher-quality borrowers NatWest Markets' Johnson echoes many when he
says: "I don't see any further reduction in price for investment-grade credits."
But not all market participants share his view. Leonard Seelig, managing director
of loan syndications at NationsBank in London, not only admits that pricing is
fundamentally at the lowest levels, but also warns that "the market is not
impenetrable &#173; the right name would probably get a cheaper price".

<P> Brenda Mills, first vice-president at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS),
agrees: "The major companies are still able to squeeze the last cent out of the
market."

<P> <B>Where prices will still drop</B>

<P> Seelig believes there will be a continuing squeeze on prices for
lesser-quality credits as banks covet their more attractive returns and offer to
refinance their credit facilities. Andrew Swinburne, managing director global
syndicated finance at Chase in London, sees prices flattening out at the
higher-quality end of the spectrum, but he agrees with Seelig that lower-quality
credits are taking the opportunity to refinance at lower prices. For example, the
Hellenic Republic recently came to the market with a term loan, priced for the
first three years at 45bp over Libor and increasing to 50bp for its last two
years (an average margin of 47.5bp over Libor). No commitment fees were offered,
although generous participation fees accompany different-sized portions of the
debt. Last year the margin was 80bp.

<P> Few other countries have utilized the bank market this year. Spain has not
returned to the market after its successful Ecu5 billion ($6.35 billion)
five-year revolving credit of last July. It could be that most countries' loan
refinancing needs are satisfied: Spain would find it hard to improve on last
year's cheap 4bp margin and larger countries, such as Sweden, can find cheaper
funding in the capital markets.

<P> Most sovereign activity has come from emerging lesser credits, principally in
the Middle East, where banks are letting margins fall and tenors increase. In
March, for example, the State of Qatar improved its pricing to 50bp over Libor
for a $250 million seven-year term loan; last October it achieved only 60bp for a
five-year term loan. Last April the Sultanate of Oman gained even slimmer prices
for its seven-year loan, although it has to pay more than Qatar in participation
fees. Both still await signing.

<P> <B>Looking to the east</B>

<P> Emerging market credits elsewhere, particularly in eastern Europe, have
proved popular with lenders looking for greater returns for their money. In June
the National Bank of Hungary took advantage of increased bank competition by
refinancing (through Deutsche and other arrangers) its $200 million five-year
loan of last year. The original loan was coordinated by NatWest Markets, which
had a margin of 150bp and a participation fee of 85bp for $10 million. Hungary's
rapidly improving credit quality, and the banks' increasing willingness to lend
and soak up assets, meant the loan was refinanced at a heavily-reduced margin of
50bp. The amount was increased to $250 million and the participation fee reduced
to 30bp for $10 million.

<P> Summing up the pricing situation, Bruce Roe, a director at CS First Boston,
says that the market has "got to a level where pricing is not going to go much
lower until the credit environment changes".

<P> That change could be under way. Banks are now looking for more structured
corporate deals and it is these that are starting to drive the market in a
significant way. This is partly because most refinancings have already been
serviced. Fritz Kropatscheck, head of syndicated loans at Deutsche Bank in
Frankfurt, estimates refinancings have dropped to around 30% of transactions this
year; while Swinburne at Chase believes volumes have been sustained this year by
leveraged buy-outs (LBOs), structured deals and project finance transactions.

<P> "Most of the new money borrowed has been related to acquisitions," says David
Roberts, head of the newly-established syndications team at Den Danske Bank in
London.

<P> This is a new development for many banks. They are keener to arrange lending
rather than to be just one of the participants: arranging also means greater fees
as it involves both corporate finance departments and lending desks. And banks
are also driven by the competitive atmosphere.

<P> But, again, caution doesn't go amiss. Tim Ritchie, head of syndications and
loan distribution at BZW, warns: "You can't cherry-pick when dealing with
sophisticated clients. Most successful banks are not just arrangers but lenders
too."

<P> Perhaps his words follow BZW's recent need to reoffer the &#163;2.35 billion
loan it arranged for UK company Railtrack in a secondary sell-down. Since
privatization in May, Railtrack's ratings have improved to A+ with Standard &amp;
Poor's and A2 with Moody's. Rival banks did not complain about the pricing so
much as the political uncertainties accompanying the deal. Some, however, stated
that perhaps the pricing was just too slim. Railtrack, like National Grid before
it (whose BZW-led loan also had to be sold-down a second time), were both new
borrowers: they attracted keenly competitive bids from banks looking for
lucrative long-term relationships.

<P> It could also be that Ritchie's comments &#173; along with those of other top
arrangers &#173; are directed at investment banks which, driven by their
corporate finance teams' requirements for their clients, have tried to establish
a presence in an already overcrowded market. This was highlighted last September
when Goldman Sachs was an arranger and underwrote a significant amount of
PowerGen's &#163;800 million five-year revolving credit. Terence Hughes,
executive director of the European loan group at Goldman Sachs, insists that this
merely reflects Goldman's client-based approach. Investment banks claim that
loans are another product that they, as providers of all the financial services
their clients need under one roof, can offer.

<P> NatWest Markets' Johnson warns that investment banks "will find it hard to
compete in a market driven by capital base". But a number of banks are following
their investment banking colleagues down the "one-stop shopping" route. Mills of
UBS says: "We work very closely with the corporate finance desk. Right from the
origination phase we find no need to go outside the bank for advice. Our job is
to deliver to our customer the best possible solutions."

<P> <B>Towards universality</B>

<P> Products ranging from MTN programmes, bond underwriting and senior debt
facilities, to equity offerings and acquisition advice might be offered by these
new universal banks. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, managing director at JP Morgan, which
has long claimed this universal approach, says: "These markets overlap far more
than they did 10 years ago." When CS First Boston links with Credit Suisse's
capital base from next January, as Credit Suisse First Boston, the new structure
might well challenge Chase's dominance in cross-border transactions.

<P> Carnegie-Brown cautions that banks should "never be complacent in this
business". The market was refuelled in 1995 by refinancing and in 1996, so far,
by acquisitions and restructuring the utility, telecommunication and media
sectors in the UK and Scandinavia. But many lenders are pondering where the deals
will come from next year after the UK general election when acquisitions activity
is expected to decline. Many cite continental European acquisition-based
transactions and emerging market project financing.

<P> But perhaps UBS has the right approach by developing project bonds. Mills
thinks this could be an exciting innovation, one which not only utilizes UBS's
capital base and capital market bond underwriting teams, but also produces
improved yields and, of course, security by combining the bank's credit skills
and distribution capabilities.

<P> This sounds remarkably like the project bonds of the 19th century which
financed American railroads. But, as mentioned before, this market is cyclical
&#173; perhaps this will help banks break the ice with new borrowers.

<H2>CHINA: WHO'S IN CHARGE?</H2>
<H4>Beijing's looser grip on power is good for growth and good for Asia,
writes Gerald Segal </H4>
It is a common problem in an emerging market: the foreign visitor comes
to strike a deal or get some information, only to meet an opaque process
and the nagging thought that decision-making is not what it seems. In a
country under iron single-party rule like China, the experience is particularly
unsettling. <BR>
<BR>
But China has become one of the fastest-growing countries in the world.
It has partly relaxed its communist-style grip and allowed economic power
to trickle away to ministries, provinces, individuals and even foreigners.
While this looser entity is not likely to break apart, it seems increasingly
likely that China's leaders and the foreigners who deal with them will have
to get used to a many-splendoured thing. The challenge is to know where
power lies and how to develop a more sophisticated policy towards a more
complex country. <BR>
<BR>
When foreign investors first showed interest in China in the early '80s,
the hard-headed ones argued that there was a real benefit in dealing with
an authoritarian state that understood the virtues of controlled capitalism.
The same line was taken when Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms went awry in the
Soviet Union: the problem, they argued, was that Gorbachev had got his strategy
backwards and China was right to put perestroika or economic change ahead
of political glasnost. But it is now clear that both Gorbachev and China's
Deng Xiaoping got it wrong - you could not have one sort of reform
without the other. <BR>
<BR>
In China's case, the decision was taken to privatise large sections of the
state-owned economy and stimulate a new private sector, leaving bloated
state-owned heavy industries to rust. In 1994 these companies accounted
for a shrinking 43% of national economic output, although the fact there
were about 1,000 more state-owned firms than in 1993 suggests the state
was finding it hard to shed the old system. All the same, because market
reforms gave power to individuals and markets to make key economic decisions,
the state sector had less economic power and the communist government had
less clout. So where has power gone? <BR>
<BR>
To say that the Communist Party is in power is not to say very much in this
post-ideological age. The party, much like an elite class in many other
countries, is little more than a label for a pragmatic ruling elite: nearly
all senior officials are party members, but this tells you nothing about
their interests or inclinations. It is common to encounter a party official
who hands you a card listing his business rather than party job title. <BR>
<BR>
What is useful to know is the official's institutional interests. In the
old more ideological era, even powerful ministries had limited scope and
were subject to sharp swings of policy. Power has now been diffused to lower
levels giving officials more freedom to negotiate deals, often in competition
with rival bureaucrats from other government offices. <BR>
<BR>
Opening a factory in Beijing requires agreements with a complex web of people
from the relevant ministries, local government and local party. As some
much-publicised scandals about the city administration have made clear,
this meant that as money changed hands some of it stuck in a few pockets.
As a result, more people developed a vested interest in keeping power decentralised
and became better able to resist orders to change their behaviour. <BR>
<BR>
It is not surprising, then, that the flow of hot money from China is reckoned
to be between $10-15 billion per year. Last year more money was invested
in the US from China than the other way around. Since 1993 more money has
been invested in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese than the other way around,
most of it of dubious provenance. These flows are impossible to track with
any accuracy, if only because part of the money invested from Hong Kong
into China is merely money that individuals in China wish to protect by
laundering it through the more reliable Hong Kong legal system. <BR>
<BR>
One reason why power and wealth has flowed so far away from central party
and ministerial control is that central officials are often in competition
with their regional counterparts, leaving central government unable to reach
an enforceable agreement with the provinces on tax or fiscal reform. Coupled
with the failure of the central government to privatise large state-owned
industries effectively, the result is large central deficits and inflation
that hit record levels of 27% last year. Some 70% of investment in China
is in state industry, up from 61% in 1989, although its share of GDP shrank
to 43% last year. It is clear that investment is being wasted and inflation
fuelled. <BR>
<BR>
In a country the size of China there has always been a degree of decentralisation,
but the process has gone much further in recent years. The most obvious
trend has been the creation of more powerful and wealthy centres of power
in the coastal provinces such as Zhejiang, whose forecast growth rate this
year is 23%, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu and Guangdong with a projected 15% growth
rate. Remote provinces in China's western reaches are growing at just over
half that rate. <BR>
<BR>
The discrepancy arises because coastal areas were granted the best terms
to attract FDI and foreigners were most keen to invest there. In turn, the
inflow of foreign capital created prosperity and therefore funds for local
authorities to resist pressures from Beijing, along with more difficult
trends such as a wave of migrant country labour seeking coastal jobs. <BR>
<BR>
But it is too simplistic to characterise the power shift as one between
the centre and coast, at the expense of hinterland China. Xinjiang province,
bordering on central Asia, had been one of the fastest growing parts of
China in the '80s and is still growing at close to 10%. Most other hinterland
provinces are growing at a healthy 8-9%, because decentralisation meant
that they too could strike lucrative deals with new neighbours to the west.
Some, such as distant Qinghai, have encouraged gold rush-style activity
to exploit its natural resources and the country's more mobile population.
<BR>
<BR>
As provinces gained prosperity, Beijing could feel sanguine about letting
power seep down to local levels. And as power trickled down beyond provincial
authorities to township and village enterprises, Beijing could feel that
the process was creating a diffused system that would allow the centre to
divide and rule. <BR>
<BR>
This sanguine attitude, however, made it slow to see the risks. When Beijing
found tax revenues stagnating and the money supply harder to control, it
tried to take back some power, but by then vast power bases had been created
which were reluctant to surrender power and taxes. It was the same all the
way down the line: township and village enterprises resisted surrender either
to Beijing or provincial diktat, especially in these uncertain days before
the death of Deng Xiaoping when no one knows who will take his place. <BR>
<BR>
Senior party officials such as Zhu Rongji toured the country this year and
last demanding compliance and even sacking provincial governors, as in Heilongjiang.
But in the end the central authorities had to settle for much less control,
a point proved when inflation and national growth rates remained stubbornly
outside government targets. <BR>
<BR>
Central authorities have promised foreign businesses they can control crime,
but China's crime rate has increased at over 20% in each of the past three
years. In the first half of this year more than 70 Hong Kong and Taiwanese
businessmen were kidnapped in China, often with the connivance of public
security officials. <BR>
<BR>
One reason for local resistance to Beijing was that within each layer of
power there were even more complex decentralising pressures at work. The
most notable feature was the rise of the so-called Red Princes and Princesses
- the children of senior officials, whose longstanding political influence
now extends into the economic sphere. Vice-Premier Zhou Jiahua, for example,
is the son-in-law of the late Marshal Ye Jainying and Premier Li Peng is
the adopted son of the late Premier Zhou Enlai. Deng Xiaoping's daughter
Deng Nan is vice-minister for the State Science and Technology Commission
and Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, is the son
of senior leader Chen Yun. <BR>
<BR>
The list goes on. The younger princeling offspring of current leaders are
often the ones first able to strike deals with foreigners and mobilise local
resources to set up factories. Chen Weili, the daughter of Chen Yun, is
deputy chairwoman of China Venturetech and Wu Jianchang, chairman of the
China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, is the son-in-law
of Deng Xiaoping. It is far harder to close down a factory making pirate
CDs, as Washington recently demanded, when it belongs to powerful people.
<BR>
<BR>
It is even harder to close it down if it is owned by parts of powerful institutions
such as the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which has emerged as a major
player in the Chinese economy and perhaps its largest single so-called company.
Roughly half the people said to be on the army's order of battle are engaged
in non-military activities. <BR>
<BR>
One of the PLA's corporate arms is the country's largest pharmaceutical
distributor. PLA-backed companies are among the most adven- turous players
of local and Hong Kong stock markets and the stock exchange building under
construction in Shanghai is a joint venture between a PLA-owned corporation
under the control of Poly Corporation in Hong Kong and another offshoot
of Poly Corporation in Shanghai. The strategic rocket forces have a stake
in a joint venture with US ice cream company Baskin-Robbins. The list goes
on. <BR>
<BR>
Various local naval units - showing enterprise in a less orthodox fashion
- are believed to be responsible for raids on foreign ships and for
sending gunboats into foreign harbours demanding television sets or luxury
cars. A Singapore-based shipping company had its ship, the <I>Hye Mieko</I>,
diverted from the Gulf of Thailand to the southern Chinese port of Shanwei
in June by vessels of China's People's Armed Police. Some 68 out of 87 worldwide
cases of piracy last year took place in east Asian waters - most of
them the freelance activity of officials of Chinese organisations. <BR>
<BR>
It would be wrong to see the PLA or any other institution as a single enterprise.
Just as power has been decentralised throughout the country, so it has been
diffused within the PLA itself. The princelings also operate in military
uniform - for example Ye Xuanming, general manager of the military-owned
Kaili Corporation - an arm of the General Political Department of the
armed forces - is the son of the late Marshal Ye Jianying. <BR>
<BR>
In an environment where ideology is devalued and a premium is placed on
pragmatic deal-making, it is not surprising if most foreigners conclude
that power lies with individuals. Chinese history supports the notion that
knowledge of the preferences and connections held by senior leaders is a
key to power. But China was also the country that invented bureaucracy,
and it is the uneasy relationships between coalitions that makes Chinese
affairs so difficult to judge. Another obvious risk in betting on the power
of individuals is that right now, many are elderly or tied to the coat-tails
of the elderly. In factionalised politics, power rarely reaches beyond the
grave. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Power to do what? </B><BR>
<BR>
When power is so decentralised, you can only identify the right contact
when you know precisely what you want to achieve. If China is attractive
as a place to build large car factories whose products are to be distributed
around the country, then deals have to be done with a wide range of authorities
at central and local level. If you want a place to set up a small shoe factory
with cheap labour, you need do little more than come to terms with a township
enterprise or a Taiwanese entrepreneur with good local contacts. <BR>
<BR>
The decentralisation of power has encouraged China's neighbours to focus
their trade on those parts of China closest to them. Thus Taiwan and Hong
Kong deal mostly with southern coastal China, where people speak the same
dialects and have similar customs. Japan and South Korea do business mostly
with the north eastern coastal region, just as Russians focus on Heilongjiang
province. The result is the creation of economic zones akin to the regionalism
linking Singapore with neighbouring parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. <BR>
<BR>
This growing regionalism ensures that China's neighbours see the value of
developing expertise on local leaders, at the expense of Beijing. As this
process continues, Chinese coastal provinces are discovering that they have
a diminishing interest in trade with other parts of China and a vested interest
in greater trade with the outside world. The relative amount (and in some
cases even absolute amount) of trade with other Chinese provinces is declining
to 22.1%, in a country whose rate of internal trade is already the lowest
of any large country. As the World Bank puts it, &quot;individual provinces
are tending to behave like independent countries&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Provinces even engage in trade wars with each other, using force to protect
convoys or block shipments at provincial boundaries. For example Hunan and
Jiangxi have blocked grain shipments to Guangdong. Richer provinces try
to block the arrival of surplus labour from poorer provinces, local banks
in most provinces charge higher rates when dealing with outsiders and many
provinces have printed their own <I>de facto </I>currencies to stop richer
neighbours like Guangdong exercising their greater purchasing power. Hubei,
Jilin and Liaoning have all obstructed imports of food and light industrial
goods from other regions and along with Honan have regulations permitting
only the sale of native beers, wine, laundry detergent and televisions.
The chairman of the central State Planning Commission called this &quot;chaos&quot;
and &quot;regional protectionism&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hard to control pirate CDs </B><BR>
<BR>
This causes problems on the international level, as we have seen in the
recent China-US agreement on intellectual property rights. Despite promises
by Beijing officials to honour it, in practice they were unable to control
local factories and it was only a matter of weeks before factories turning
out illegal software were back in operation. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are some issues that are still best dealt with at the central
level. If a foreign government wants to win the release of a dissident,
then the odds are that Beijing can set the person free. If one wants to
know how China will vote in the UN Security Council on changing the rules
of engagement for UN troops in Bosnia, the foreign ministry can sort that
out. <BR>
<BR>
Matters become more murky when one wants China to stop selling missiles
to Pakistan, for here there are competing interests of different ministries,
PLA corporations and the Red Princes. But as we know from China's adherence
to the UN arms embargo against Iraq, it can comply with agreements when
it wants to: there are clearly times when it suits Beijing to argue that
it cannot control the operations of its arms merchants. <BR>
<BR>
The problems of smuggling, drug trafficking and illegal migration have caused
concern for China's neighbours and further afield. China is now a major
part of the global drug trade and the source of 100,000 illegal immigrants
into the US each year. Whether it is Motorola's portable phones or Matsushita's
video recorder - both produced in China - foreign manufacturers
are finding it harder to sell in China because they are undercut by their
own products, made elsewhere in east Asia and smuggled through China's increasingly
porous external frontiers. Even if the central government in Beijing wishes
to control these activities, it is certainly unable to do so for any length
of time. <BR>
<BR>
The decentralisation of power is often described as a step towards the breakup
of China, a thought which only heightens the nervousness of the already
touchy Beijing au- thorities on the issue. But such an apocalyptic outcome
is unlikely. Scaremongering also obscures the fact, recognised by many Chinese
officials, that decentralisation could be good for China and its partners,
and may be the only way to ensure sustained growth. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the supposed risks of decentralisation have more to do with outdated
perceptions of China. Everyone knows that doing business in a market economy
means paying less attention to central government, and the international
trend is clearly towards the breakdown of national sovereignty. Why should
a China increasingly integrated with the global economy be any different?
<BR>
<BR>
Far too many people prefer to deal with a simple entity called China. Beijing
officials especially see any attempt to engage with their country in a more
decentralised way as an attempt to break it apart. A foreigner who just
wants to get down to business at the local level will get a cool response
from Beijing. <BR>
<BR>
It is not surprising to find so much resistance. Some of the country's neighbours
worry about the rise of a Chinese superpower and see a more fragmented country
as less of a threat. But no one has a real interest in the breakup of China,
although many people have an interest in a working form of decentralisation.
<BR>
<BR>
A China that has more vested local economic interests will be less likely
to throw its weight around in the international trading system. A China
that seeks more political pluralism, or even federalism, will be less willing
to assume dangerous nationalist positions regarding the South China Sea
or Taiwan. A Chinese leadership that learns the virtues of internal negotiations
and regional interdependence may also be more willing to accept the strictures
of international interdependence. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The challenge of pluralism </B><BR>
<BR>
How do we get there from here? A useful starting point is the knowledge
that in a modern interdependent world, no large state can be held together
for long without an extensive amount of political pluralism and federalism
- the Soviet Union, for example, collapsed because of its lack of pluralism.
In addition, federal entities require the rule of law to settle disputes
and thus the real and long-term challenge for China is to develop a civil
society to provide the basis for the rule of law. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, it makes sense to take China as we find it, with only an
occasional glance forward to how we might wish it to be. Realism argues
for a more decentralised strategy. An essential component is insisting China
abide by the rules of the international system. If that means WTO membership
can only be ensured through greater dialogue with provincial officials,
then so be it. If trade sanctions have to be imposed at the local level
because that is where intellectual property right violations are taking
place, then the policy could be made attractive to officials in Beijing.
The risk of pretending that decentralisation is not a reality is that Deng's
successors might have the illusion that they can re-impose central control,
thereby stimulating fissiparous tendencies. <BR>
<BR>
The worst mistake we can make is to take China as it pretends to be. If
we do that we will end up being surprised when, as in the case of eastern
Europe, reality slaps us in the face.<HR><BR>

<H3>EUROPEAN BROKERS SURVEY</H3>





<H2> <B>How to survive in European broking</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Stockbroking is now
concentrated in a very few hands. Fund managers are much more sophisticated, with
dedicated dealing desks and in-house analysts. Andrew Capon looks at what's been
going on behind the results of this year's ninth annual
<I>Euromoney</I>/<I>Global Investor</I> European brokers poll  </B> </H4>

 <P>
European stockbroking is facing further consolidation in the next few years. For
those firms not in the top half of the tables for pan-European research and
execution and for those that fail to make the top three slots in the individual
country tables, survival will not be easy.

<P> That is the stark conclusion of this year's European brokers' survey. Asked
whether the number of brokers they use in European markets is rising, falling or
stable, over two-thirds of responding fund managers replied that the number was
falling or stable. Although in the past 18 months there has been a flurry of
acquisitions among brokers jostling to cope with these new competitive realities
&#173; ABN Amro's acquisition of Alfred Berg, Merrill Lynch's acquisition of the
UK's Smith New Court, Spain's FG Inversiones and Carnegie's Italian business, and
Dresdner Bank's acquisition of Kleinwort Benson &#173; it is clear that
consolidation is far from over.

<P> As fund managers choose to deal with fewer brokers, so commission is
concentrating in fewer hands: the rich are getting richer. The rest will go the
wall, be acquired, or develop a strategy that will allow them to survive on a
lower percentage of a commission pot that is still, overall, expanding.

<P> The degree of commission concentration varies from fund manager to fund
manager, but it is now fairly typical for a hard core of 10 brokers to receive
approximately 70% of all commissions in Europe. That is the number at Fidelity,
reports Simon Roberts, head of the firm's UK and European equity research. The
head of dealing at a big UK fund manager reports a similar figure. Ian Carstairs,
head of UK equities at Invesco, says the firm's top eight UK brokers get 75% of
their business.

<P> The key question facing brokers is how to be picked out by fund managers as
part of the elite. Choosing a broker is now a rigorous process of evaluation for
most of the larger investment managers. A quantitative analysis of a broker's
services is carried out on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.

<P> At its most rigorous this process of evaluation is very exacting. The main
emphasis for fund managers is still fundamental research. "We do a quantitative
review of our brokers and mark them," says Invesco's Carstairs. "The largest
element in deciding where the commission goes is still fundamental research. That
gets over 50% of the marks, the rest is decided by strategy, economics research
(we are a top-down firm) and smaller companies research." The evaluation takes
place semi-annually.

<P> <B>Tough review procedures</B>

<P> Threadneedle Asset Management, which has $46 billion under management,
reviews the brokers it deals with annually. The process aggregates the views of
fund managers, analysts and dealers on particular firms. "Broadly we apply an
equal weighting to three areas of a broker's service: research, execution and
corporate finance," says Simon Davies, Threadneedle's chief investment officer.

<P> Fidelity employs perhaps the most rigorous voting procedures of all. The firm
manages $499 billion globally and so is almost certainly the biggest payer of
brokerage commissions in the world. Its investment teams are regionally
organized. For Europe, Fidelity's London-based analysts and fund managers all
have a vote quarterly. The results are broken down and explained before being
relayed to the brokers.

<P> "Each vote represents an explicit dollar-amount of commission," says
Fidelity's Roberts. "Everyone's vote is worth the same, though naturally a senior
fund manager will be allocated more votes than a junior analyst. We hope the
process incentivizes everyone. If our utilities analyst thinks he is getting a
particularly good service from an analyst at a broker he can show that
appreciation by his votes. Hopefully, that [broker's] analyst will get a pat on
the back from his bosses as our commission flows in. The same is true for the
sales contact. If a firm's voting rating slips then management at a broker should
ask questions. It is not the case that Fidelity can tell a broker how to run its
business. But it is our job to tell them how we view them."

<P> It seems brokers do value this feedback. "If you are managing a research
business the feedback from the clients is very valuable," says Tim Orchard, SBC
Warburg's head of European research.

<P> Both brokers and fund managers recognize that their relationship is now on a
highly professional footing. The patronage a large, active, equity fund manager
can offer brokers via commissions is considerable. Though naturally shy to talk
numbers, fund managers say that despite the downward pressure on commissions and
the rise of net trading, it is still the single biggest cost in their businesses.
A firm with, say, $75 billion in assets under management might expect to pay $70
million or more in commissions annually.

<P> "The formalizing of the broker and fund management relationship is a two-way
process. Just as commissions are being concentrated among fewer brokers, so the
clients tend to be bigger, more sophisticated and have more complex needs. It is
now essential to deal with clients on a coordinated, institutional basis. The
days when a firm was the personal property of a particular salesman are long
gone," says Charles Stonehill, head of European equities at joint top-ranked firm
for pan-European research, Morgan Stanley.

<P> The rapid expansion of institutional assets has meant the largest fund
management firms, with which buying power is concentrated, now employ hundreds of
people. The formalized voting systems that allocate commissions span the views of
the broadest range of staff at fund management companies, not just a handful of
senior fund managers. Brokers must respond by appealing to the broadest possible
constituency.

<P> One key constituency is the dealer. Most UK fund management companies now
have centralized dealing, whereas even five years ago this was not the case. This
trend is another reflection of the growing size and complexity of fund management
companies.

<P> "When Threadneedle was established three years ago [by the merger of the fund
management businesses of Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar] we decided to establish a
central dealing desk. It was a decision no-one would reverse. Dealing is a
separate skill. Fund managers should be finding good stocks not haggling over a
penny here or there with a market-maker," says Threadneedle's Davies.

<P> It is a message reinforced by Fidelity's Roberts. "Dealing is viewed very,
very seriously," he says. "We rely on the professionalism of our dealers to
ensure the interest of the client is properly looked after. This requires
dedicated staff, not fund managers who dabble in dealing. We aim to recruit the
best dealers we can."

<P> Part of the rationale for centralized dealing is the regulatory
responsibility that fund managers have to deal for their clients at best
execution. Best execution is a rather ill-defined concept to which lip-service
was paid in the past. However, the burden of regulation and competition has
increased, particularly for those firms doing institutional business in the US.
"The rules are complicated and centralized dealing allows you to manage the
dealing process," says Invesco's Carstairs.

<P> "I think the pressures on the largest fund management companies have
developed in a trans-Atlantic context. There consultants pore over details of how
you trade. That is coming here as well, though I hope we never go as far as some
US fund management firms where the dealers are actually in a separate building,"
says the chief operating officer at a major London firm with a large US business.

<P> <B>Playing to the dealers</B>

<P> The insistence that a firm must trade at best execution means that even when
commission allocation targets are set, it is the dealer who has the final say.
Says Fidelity's Roberts: "If we allocate $10 million, between $6 million and $7
million may be accounted for by the voting system, the rest will be for softing
arrangements [where the fund manager pays for other products instead of paying
commission] or at the discretion of the dealer. The commission targets that are
set are just that, targets. The final decision of who to trade with is always
tempered by the responsibility of the dealer to get best execution."

<P> Adds Invesco's Carstairs: "It's the general shape of commission that counts.
Best execution is more important than exactly hitting commission targets."

<P> The results of the survey demonstrate this increasing level of sophistication
when fund managers evaluate execution. Although the names are the same in both
tables for the top-tier brokers for pan-European research and execution, the
places are very different. Execution is no longer regarded as the inevitable
by-product of highly rated research. Rather, it is appreciated as a separate
discipline.

<P> The US houses seem to be showing their European rivals how it is done &#173;
with Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch once more taking the top two spots. Chris
Garsten, head of European equities at Credit Suisse Investment Management, says:
"The US houses are building market share because their dealing service is
fantastic, especially for large, liquid stocks."

<P> Morgan Stanley's Stonehill says that the firm has dedicated resources to
trading in recognition of its growing importance to fund managers. "More and more
discretion is being given to centralized dealing desks and fund managers are
increasingly aware of the obligation they have to obtain best execution for their
clients. There are several examples of fund managers who have told us that we win
a disproportionate amount of business because of our execution ability."

<P> The increasing use of programme trading, where many stocks are traded at
once, is also playing to the strengths of the US firms. Programme trading began
in the US as a tool for passive index followers, but is gaining acceptance among
active managers in Europe. "Shifting asset allocation is an important element of
how we manage money. When we move money like this we will typically use a
programme trade. A rough estimate would be that a third of our turnover derives
from asset allocation shifts," says Threadneedle's Davies.

<P> But fund managers' dealers are far from being the only new constituency to
which brokers need to appeal. The fundamental change in the relationship between
brokers and fund managers has nothing to do with centralized dealing. Rather, as
a senior fund manager at a leading UK institution explains: "Ten years ago we
used to rely on brokers for really basic stuff, simple facts really. Since then
all the big fund management companies have spent a lot of money developing their
own research capabilities. The pendulum has swung. Brokers are no longer a focal
point of information but a secondary one."

<P> <B>In-house analysts</B>

<P> Again, this is a reflection of how fast institutionally managed assets have
grown. The top dozen UK fund management companies will typically own between 1%
and 5% of a FT-SE 100 stock. They can expect direct access to a company's
management and don't need an intermediary. They also have the resources to
dedicate research staff. But that does not mean broker research is of no use.
Rather, its use has evolved.

<P> Most UK fund management firms have not gone down the route of their US peers
and appointed full-time career analysts. Analysts are still typically junior or
aspirant fund managers, feeding information to senior colleagues who are making
the big buying decisions. The sell-side analyst to buy-side analyst relationship
is emerging as crucial.

<P> One senior UK fund manager says: "I don't want a sausage-machine approach to
the presentation of research ideas where they are squeezed from an analyst, fed
into a salesman and regurgitated to me. I employ junior staff to listen to ideas
and I expect them to come to me with the best of them. I want the specialists
from the brokers to speak to my specialists. That's the contact I value most. The
best analysts from the brokers can offer my people their experience. It's almost
like free training."

<P> Morgan Stanley's Stonehill recognizes the importance of this new
relationship. "Research is clearly important. No-one likes to work in isolation,
so the relationships our analysts can develop with their counterparts at the
institutions can lead to a better understanding for both of parties of the
fundamentals of an industry or company."

<P> Analysts, too, have a say in where the commission goes. At Fidelity, Roberts
says that of 163 votes for their top-ranked UK broker, 122 came from the
analysts. "Good analyst to analyst contact is key," says Roberts. "If properly
managed on both sides the information loop should work well. A fund manager might
say to an analyst here that he had a salesman on the telephone from a broker to
tell him it was upgrading Glaxo to a 'buy'. Our analyst had hopefully been given
an explanation for this view from their pharmaceuticals analyst. There is now a
much broader range of contacts. It's no longer simply the fund manager to
salesman relationship that's important."

<P> <B>Talking to the right people</B>

<P> How research will evolve to reflect this new relationship is unclear. Some
fund managers, like Invesco's Carstairs, would like to see more strategic
research "with a longer-term horizon, looking at the strengths and weaknesses of
a business more from a management's standpoint." How this fits with the demands
of an analyst or a chief investment officer and where the biggest rewards are for
a broker looking to develop a relationship with an institution are unclear.

<P> As well as presenting a product development challenge, this broader level of
contact, from chief investment officer, to senior fund manager, to junior analyst
and dealer, requires careful management. Morgan Stanley's Stonehill says:
"Relationships need to be complementary. If a fund manager has responsibility for
investment across Europe, then the last thing he wants is 10 calls from
individual country salesmen. The contact should match his brief. The ideal
relationship minimizes the number of individuals talking to a fund manager or
analyst, but maximizes the effectiveness of the contact."

<P> The extent to which brokers are achieving this is uncertain. Nothing
irritates senior fund managers more than having to field irrelevant or
unnecessary telephone calls. "Some houses seem to measure a relationship by the
number of telephone calls that are made. I give thanks daily for the invention of
voice mail," says a European fund manager at an Edinburgh-based fund management
company.

<P> The chairman of the asset allocation committee at a London-based fund manager
echoes this. "Asset allocation is all I do. I don't want to hear about the
valuation of Russian oil companies. I often get the distinct feeling that brokers
don't understand the basics of who does what at fund management companies. There
ought to be someone who can look at a major institution like ours and devise a
proper relationship management structure."

<P> <B>The move to execution-only</B>

<P> Brokers may decide that serving such a difficult and fickle client base is
not worth the effort. Commissions remain under pressure. At the time of Big Bang,
commissions for UK equity trades were 35 basis points. Today, they are 18bp. This
commission pressure is beginning to be seen elsewhere in Europe.

<P> The head of dealing at one major UK fund manager says: "I have just completed
a round of commission cuts in Europe. It was very easy to do, which told me two
things: it should have been done earlier and have been a good deal harsher. In
major markets like Sweden and Germany between 30 and 40 basis points was the
norm. Now it's between 20 and 25 basis points."

<P> With this sort of commission pressure it remains a possibility that a major
broker may chose to differentiate itself by providing an execution-only service.
The benchmark for execution-only business in the UK is Instinet, where there is a
13bp charge. How long will it be before a broker decides that their analysts are
a waste of money for 5bp?

<P> Likewise, how long will it be before fund managers who are committing more
and more resources to research conclude the value-added of brokers' opinions is
less than 5bp? PDFM and Mercury Asset Management already make great play of not
paying commission in the UK, although their order-flow is, of course, valuable to
market-makers.

<P> The decision to become an execution-only broker will inevitably have a
knock-on effect for other parts of a business, notably primary markets and
corporate finance, which often cross-subsidize an analyst's salary. For a firm
that lacks the resources or credibility to become a full-service investment bank,
becoming an execution-only stockbroker may be a route to survival.&#009;

</H3> <P> "There's a group of brokers I call the 'A' list," says the chief
investment officer at a leading London fund manager. "They are my insurance
policy. Supposing I came into work tomorrow to find the chief executive had his
hand in the till and we were sacked by half our clients. This business would
still need to trade globally with a lower amount of commission available for
brokers. The 'A' list are the top-tier global firms whose friendship we want to
keep and they get a disproportionate amount of business because of this."

<P> For whatever reason, most fund managers have an A list. This list is somewhat
insulated from the hurly-burly of voting. The A list is that small number of
firms that can deal on a pan-European or global basis where the value of the
overall relationship may be greater than the sum of its parts.

<P> This is resulting in a tiering of broker relationships in Europe. "Our
brokers fall into one of two camps," says Simon Davies, Threadneedle's chief
investment officer. "There are a number of large firms with which we have a
global relationship. They have the trading capability and capital to support
global portfolio trades and can also provide us with global or regional research
on an industry or global strategy. These firms win a significant amount of
business. The other camp is the local firms that offer a specialist, fundamental
research service."

<P> Davies also values the primary markets deal-flow that the bulge-bracket
investment banks bring. "New issues are important. If a bank is in a position to
give us access to good new issues then there is a value to that for us and a
benefit for our clients."

<P> The two-tier approach to ranking European brokers is revealed in the results
of the survey. Most often the firms that feature prominently in the pan-European
tables do not feature in the tables for individual European markets, where local
firms dominate. There are notable exceptions. SBC Warburg has always prided
itself on the depth of its European network and it takes top-three positions for
research in nine of the 16 markets covered. Merrill Lynch's purchase of FG last
year wins it top spot in Spain.

<P> Whether the better business strategy is to focus on covering Europe from
London or whether troops are required on the ground is unclear. SBC Warburg has
clearly chosen to have strength in depth, both in London and on the ground in the
major European markets.

<P> "The reason for our business being set up this way is straightforward: we
think it is the best way to maximize the generation of good research ideas. I
think we can and do fulfil the needs of fund managers who need a pan-European
perspective and those looking for good fundamental research, which still tends to
be based on local market knowledge. The research is complementary," says Tim
Orchard, SBC Warburg's head of European research. By being part of the A list and
highly ranked in the individual markets, SBC Warburg should win a commensurately
higher amount of commission.

<P> Merrill Lynch is taking a flexible line. Its European network is growing
organically and by acquisition. In the last 12 months it has acquired FG in Spain
and Carnegie's Italian business. Charles Lambert, head of UK equity research,
explains: "I don't think there is any point being doctrinal about this. We want
to provide research that meets client needs. We are gravitating towards global
sectoral research, but input at a country level is also important. There has to
be a blend because the global economy and industries are in a transition stage."

<P> Morgan Stanley has chosen the sector-based pan-European approach, which the
survey shows is reaping rewards in the pan-European tables, where the firm is
joint first for pan-European research, first for pan-European execution and
sectoral research and third for pan-European economic research.

<P> Theresa Bohl, European research director at Morgan Stanley, believes the
improved showing is a reflection of the rising popularity of pan-European sector
research versus country-based analysis. "We used to call it the Coke versus Pepsi
debate because everyone else had country analysts and we never believed in that
approach. Many fund managers are now becoming sector-oriented in Europe."

<P> The next step for sector-based research, says Bohl, is global. Some
investment managers, including Templeton, already manage money this way so an
audience already exists. But the move to global sectoral research would further
emphasize the gulf opening between the A list and the rest.

<P> Should local brokers despair? Probably not. The highest proportion of
commission is still awarded for good fundamental research. The way active
managers beat indices is with good stock ideas, especially among potentially
high-performing small and medium caps.

<P> Fidelity may give 70% of its business to 10 key European brokers, but, says
Simon Roberts, Fidelity's head of UK and European research, "the 30% left is
still a lot of money. We deal with over 100 firms. We want to be seen as
accessible to ideas. I think there is enough money around for a firm in a local
market with a few talented staff generating good ideas to be able to survive."

<P> The other factor that should encourage local brokers is that fund managers
increasingly want to deal as close as possible to the local market. London
international equity market Seaq International is dead. "The only reason Seaq
ever had volumes was because it was more transparent than the European markets.
That is no longer the case. Europe is now a much better place to trade," says
Threadneedle's Davies. The trend toward local dealing may also put London-based
brokers that lack a local infrastructure under pressure, though the remote
membership of local bourses via the single passport offered by the EU's
investment services directive is a low-cost alternative firms such as UBS are
already taking advantage of.

<H3> <B>The best and the rest, country by country</B> </H3> <P> <B>Austria</B>

<P> A triumvirate of London houses topples Bank Austria and Creditanstalt from
the top two research slots in Austria. SBC Warburg returns to the top position
and Kleinwort Benson to second place, their respective positions in 1994. SBC
Warburg's Chuck Mentcher is singled out for praise. "It's a small market where
in-depth knowledge counts," says one fund manager.

<P> <B>Belgium</B>

<P> There is also a return to past form in Belgium. Dillon Read retakes the top
slot it lost to Petercam in 1995. Petercam takes second position from Merrill
Lynch which slips to fourth behind Kleinwort Benson. "Petercam's research is just
as detailed, but Dillon Read produce better money-making ideas," says one fund
manager.

<P> <B>Denmark</B>

<P> Alfred Berg remains fund managers' favourite Danish broker by some margin. It
is a pattern repeated throughout the Nordic region. The firm sweeps the board for
both research and execution as it did in 1995. The acquisition by ABN Amro last
year appears to have been painless. "I think ABN Amro has been very sensible and
left a highly successful firm alone," says one fund manager. Another adds:
"Alfred Berg has adopted a very coherent regional approach. The research is
excellent, but what really impresses me and means Berg wins a lot of business is
the firm's trading ability. It has all the aggression of a US broker. Alfred Berg
is the only non-US or UK firm in our top 10 of European commission earners."

<P> <B>Finland</B>

<P> Alfred Berg again takes the top slot ahead of regional rival Enskilda. Says
one survey respondent: "Finland is never going to be a market that is going to be
at the top of your agenda. But when it performs, it's well worth being there [the
market is up 20% in the last six months]. Firms like Berg and Enskilda which work
regionally can be very useful at signalling a change in sentiment." Fiba Nordic's
strong showing in Finland is recognition of the strong reputation the firm has
been building for coverage of relatively under-researched stocks. How this will
be affected by the negative publicity surrounding the firm's dealings with Morgan
Grenfell Asset Management's Peter Young remains to be seen.

<P> <B>France</B>

<P> Cheuvreux de Virieu has made the top slot for French equity research its own.
"Their coverage is the key. I know that's a pat answer but depth of coverage is
important in France. The top stocks by size tend to be poor performers, so to
outperform there's a need to look beyond the large caps." But Cheuvreux face
competition on several fronts. Paribas has eclipsed Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale as the main local competitor. Dynabourse also continues
its progress up the rankings, from fifth last year to third this year.
"Dynabourse's Bertrand Michel has the unrivalled contacts in French industry,"
says one fund manager. Of the London houses, SBC Warburg returns to the top
flight having been pushed out last year. Flemings makes its only top-five
appearance. "I like the effort Fleming is making in Europe, particularly Paul
Brunker's strategy team. But France is the only individual market in which it
currently stands out," says one UK fund manager.

<P> <B>Germany</B>

<P> The level of dissatisfaction with German research shows little sign of
abating. "All German research is useless," says one UK fund manager. "I know
companies tend not to be very forthcoming, but even so some of the stuff is
really pathetic." Deutsche Morgan Grenfell takes the top position, the only
market in which the aspirant global investment bank features. BZW takes second
place, Germany being the only market other than the UK in which it takes a
top-five position. As is so often the case, the reason cited for Deutsche's top
position is depth of coverage. "The research has a low 'hit' rate in terms of
useable ideas, but there's a lot of it," says an Edinburgh fund manager. Two
local firms, Schr&ouml;der Munchmeyer Hengst and Metzler Seel Sohn, take third
and fourth positions, evidence that local broking specialists are performing
better than their universal bank rivals, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.

<P> <B>Greece</B>

<P> Local broker Sigma Securities takes the top position by a comfortable margin
from last year's winner, Schroder Securities. One fund manager says: "Sigma is
conspicuous in the professionalism of its approach. That separates it from its
Greek competitors. The depth of the coverage separates Sigma from its foreign
competition."

<P> <B>Ireland</B>

<P> Davy Stockbrokers confirms its position as Ireland's favourite broker.
"Ireland is a market dominated by a handful of stocks &#173; the banks, CRH and
Jefferson Smurfit. The market has been one of the strongest performers in Europe,
with a two-year bull run returning over 40%. Davy has timed the stock shifts very
well," says a UK fund manager.

<P> <B>Italy</B>

<P> SBC Warburg will be pleased to return to the top of the rankings in Italy,
after slipping behind Euromobiliare last year. Intermobiliare, barely two years
old, has beaten Euromobiliare into third place. Carnegie, recently acquired by
Merrill Lynch, has slipped out of the top tier. SBC Warburg is praised for its
economic work and execution ability as well as research coverage.

<P> <B>Netherlands</B>

<P> MeesPierson climbs to the top, just eclipsing ABN Amro Hoare Govett. Merrill
Lynch takes third spot. "What's good about MeesPierson is that it can offer an
independent view," says one London fund manager. "For example, earlier this year
Vendex International and Van Leer Pack Worldwide came to market. ABN Amro Hoare
Govett was the bookrunner for both issues."

<P> <B>Norway</B>

<P> Alfred Berg retains the top position in Norway, as it does for all the Nordic
markets. "I particularly value the work Berg does on the banks," says a fund
manager.

<P> <B>Portugal</B>

<P> SBC Warburg ties with UBS for the top spot in Portugal. Both firms have been
active in the primary market and were joint bookrunners (with Merrill Lynch) for
the $944 million privatization of Portugal Telecom in June.

<P> <B>Spain</B>

<P> Merrill Lynch is the top choice for Spain. Merrill acquired FG Inversiones
earlier this year and FG has been a consistent winner of the survey. One New York
fund manager says: "FG is a good, independently minded broker that stands out a
mile from the local bank subsidiaries. I hope Merrill will let the business run
the way it has been and add the capital to ensure the best people stay. Jacobo
Pascual [Merrill's head of research in Spain] has a great top-down grasp of how
the Spanish market operates."

<P> <B>Switzerland</B>

<P> SBC Warburg takes the top position from last year's top-placed UBS, pushing
long-time favourite Pictet into third. "I think SBC Warburg have the edge in
quality, whereas UBS seem to push out a lot of fairly unadventurous stuff. The
smaller firms like Pictet and Vontobel are often more valuable because they are
prepared to be different &#173; and put 'sell' notices on the big three banks."

<P> <B>UK</B>

<P> Although SBC Warburg takes a top-three position in nine markets, perhaps the
most gratifying placing of all is number one in the UK. The UK is still the most
important European market in terms of market capitalization, turnover and
concentration of institutional clients. For the biggest institutions SBC Warburg
remains the firm of choice. "Warburg lost some good people, but so has every
other broker. For our money it is still a firm that attracts the best and the
brightest and their research product proves it," says the head of UK equities at
a leading London fund management firm.

<H3>JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET</H3> 
<H2>&quot;We are not a Bangladesh&quot; </H2>
<H4>The Japanese government bond market is laughably old-fashioned and inefficient.
Settlement, for example, takes place only on dates ending in five or zero
- a practice derived from the 19th-century rice market. At last, the Ministry
of Finance is looking at wide-ranging reforms. With combined new bond issues
for FY1995 and 1996 expected to reach almost &#165;100 trillion, it has
little choice. Andrew Horvat reports </H4>
Early last month a masked man wearing a lam&eacute; cloak and a silver turban,
decorated with half-moons and stars, sat down outside the Japanese Ministry
of Finance (MoF). He announced that he would set himself on fire to protest
the use of &#165;685 billion ($6.5 billion) in taxpayers' money to bail
out insolvent housing loan corporations (<I>jusen</I>). <BR>
<BR>
The man's bizarre suicide threat is just the most dramatic example of the
widespread protests in Japan - including a protracted sit-in by opposition
MPs in parliament - over the government's rescue of the <I>jusen</I>. <BR>
<BR>
But such protests miss the bigger picture: Japan's public finances are in
general disarray. The one-off bail-out of the <I>jusen</I> represents only
a tiny part of the problem. Far more worrying is the total size of Japan's
growing public debt. The government will spend &#165;16.4 trillion in 1996
alone to service this debt. Because of falling tax revenues and a politically
motivated tax cut in 1994, the proportion of revenues raised through bond
issues will leap from 17.7% in fiscal year 1995 (ending March 31 1996) to
28% in FY1996. <BR>
<BR>
Economists see disaster looming in the Japanese government bond (JGB) market
unless new sources of tax revenue are found. &quot;Japan is not far from
where Italy, Canada and Sweden were a few years ago in terms of its public
finances,&quot; says Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Tokyo.
&quot;The Japanese bond market is an accident waiting to happen - in fact,
the accident is already taking place.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Jones points to a rise in the coupon rate on the 10-year benchmark JGB from
2.5% in July 1995 to 3.265% in March 1996. He also raises questions about
the enormous volume of bonds coming on stream and the ability of the domestic
market to absorb new government and corporate issues. In the draft budget
alone, the government has called for &#165;47.4 trillion in new bond issues,
and this is likely to rise if tax revenue goals, which have recently tended
to be overestimated, are not met. As of the end of FY1995, the government
will have &#165;222 trillion in outstanding debt, an increase of &#165;47.4
trillion on the previous year. <BR>
<BR>
For the time being, MoF officials have no choice but to increase JGB issuance.
Japanese politicians are unlikely to agree to raise the consumption tax
(a less-onerous version of the European value-added tax) which currently
is a gentle 3%. Exacerbating the government's fiscal troubles is a &#165;5
trillion income-tax cut spread over three years, a concession forced on
the government in 1994 in return for a rise in the consumption tax to 5%
starting in April 1997. This reduction in the income-tax take is partly
responsible for the failure of revenues to increase this year and for a
projected drop in tax revenues by 4.4% in FY1996. Japan's ratio of public
debt to GDP, at present 49%, is expected to rise to 57% within five years.
<BR>
<BR>
Also complicating matters for MoF bureaucrats is the improbability of their
being able to push through any significant increase in the official discount
rate. Higher interest rates would mean more attractive bonds with higher
coupons, but they could also stall Japan's nascent economic recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Revolt of the pension funds</B> <BR>
<BR>
The MoF can always count on Japan's big life insurance companies to absorb
large volumes of JGBs. Japanese life insurers are legally obliged to make
their pay-outs from interest income and have opted to stick to yen-denominated,
safe JGBs. Their aversion to foreign securities is well-known; it dates
from the late 1980s when, partly under pressure from the MoF, they invested
heavily in US treasury bills and then lost huge amounts when the dollar
dropped from &#165;240 to &#165;100. <BR>
<BR>
The pension funds, however, which have traditionally been major clients
of the life insurers, have different imperatives. They are responsible to
a workforce that is ageing faster than any other in the industrialized world
and cannot afford to be over-cautious about returns. The low coupon rate
is driving them away from the life insurers and, thanks to liberalization,
they can now find a new home for their funds. Investment advisory companies,
a generic term which includes foreign funds, offer higher returns through
investment in foreign securities, and are now permitted to manage Japanese
pension money. <BR>
<BR>
An informal decision by Japanese life insurers earlier this year to decrease
their guaranteed returns to pension funds from 4.5% to 2.5% triggered the
possibility of a flight of funds towards trust banks and investment advisory
companies. For example, earlier this year, the Japanese Pension Welfare
Service Corporation, a big public-sector pension fund, threatened to withdraw
some &#165;5 trillion it has placed for management with life insurance companies.
By February, funds run by the Japan Securities Dealers Employees Union and
the National Labour Banks Employees Union had decreased the amounts they
entrusted to life insurers, and pension funds at Nissan and Nippon Electric
Corporation threatened to follow suit. Although the outflow from the life
insurers is still quite small, the writing is on the wall: any organization
which relies on low-yielding JGBs cannot count on the loyalty of its clients.
<BR>
<BR>
For the time being, however, the MoF has found in the Bank of Japan (BoJ)
an unusual ally in its efforts to maintain demand for JGBs. Starting in
mid-1995, the BoJ has been engaged in what is known as <I>rinban</I> (buy-and-hold
operations) usually with one- or two-year-old JGBs, averaging as much as
&#165;500 billion in purchases every month. Creating demand is only a secondary
reason for the BoJ's buying JGBs. The main reason is that with the official
discount rate at 0.5% and the overnight call rate as low as 0.43%, bond
purchase is the only way the central bank can inject liquidity into the
economy. Nevertheless the practice has some economists worried. Tetsufumi
Yamakawa, senior economist at Goldman Sachs (Japan), says: &quot;If the
market perceives the BoJ's buying of bonds as a price-keeping operation,
when and if the BoJ stops doing so, there could be disappointment in the
market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Faced with a saturated domestic market in which most purchasers of JGBs
have simply bought and held their bonds, the only way the MoF could reduce
the cost of the national debt was to reform bond-issuing and trading mechanisms,
thus making JGBs more versatile in the hope that this will attract new investors.
<BR>
<BR>
The reforms include a rationalization of settlement dates, which at present
follow a totally unpredictable pattern based on a now-abandoned 19th-century
lunar calendar; the introduction of a five-year JGB futures market in order
to even out a yield-curve that is concentrated on trading in the 10-year
benchmark bond; the creation of a genuine repurchase agreement (repo) market
to replace a clumsy domestic version called <I>gensaki</I> that has been
hamstrung by a sales tax and restrictions on interest on collateral; and
the borrowing of a US technique called strips (separate trading of registered
interest and principal securities) which involves stripping out of a bond's
interest payments for sale. <BR>
<BR>
An active advocate of these changes is Yo Takeuchi, director of MoF's government
debt division, who unabashedly describes himself as &quot;a salesman for
JGBs&quot;. He tells visitors: &quot;The Japanese flag means good quality
- risk-free and at a bargain price.&quot; If Takeuchi, decked out in light-grey
suit, wine-coloured striped suspenders, striped shirt and a red tie crowded
with tiny yellow elephants and giraffes, looks more like an intruder from
Wall Street than a MoF bureaucrat, that's not an entirely inaccurate impression.
Educated at the University of California, Berkeley, Takeuchi appears to
be strongly wedded to the introduction of efficiency to the Japanese bond
market even though moves towards transparent and rational rules are likely
to ruffle feathers in other parts of the MoF. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are not a Bangladesh,&quot; says Takeuchi, pointing disparagingly
at a Japanese bond-dealing settlement calendar on the MoF operations room
wall. &quot;Even Bangladesh doesn't have a five-day and 10-day settlement
system.&quot; The calendar shows the days of a week linked to dates ending
in five and zero, a pattern that can be traced back to the settlement of
rice futures during the Edo period (1600-1868). <BR>
<BR>
Despite its antecedents, this system is of relatively recent origin. It
was introduced in 1987 as a means of putting an end to rampant speculation
triggered by the lowering of long-term interest rates to 2.55%, just five
basis points above the discount rate. On just one day that year, trading
volume in the 10-year benchmark bond reached &#165;8 trillion though only
&#165;3.1 trillion of that bond had been issued. Five-and-zero-day settlement
brought speculation under control by forcing settlement of accounts and
slowing down trades. One problem with the system is that it often conflicts
with the western calendar, Japanese holidays, and the securities association's
own rules that require periods for paperwork to range from no less than
three trading days to no more than six. In the past year exceptions had
to be built in, because of 72 settlement days 27 ended in neither a five
nor a zero. Moreover, the sheer number of exceptions required a committee
of the Nihon Sogo Shoken KK (Japan Bond Trading Co Ltd) to determine settlement
days ahead for each year. Worse still, the system results in delays of 15
days or more in the delivery of a bond. For example, a bond purchased on
May 2 is only likely to be delivered on May 20. <BR>
<BR>
Although the MoF does not officially take credit for the elimination of
this arcane system (effective later this year), a spokesman for the Nihon
Sogo Shoken, an association of securities dealers and bankers, conceded
that the adoption on October 1 of a rolling eight-day settlement system
was agreed to by his organization &quot;through guidance from MoF&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
As Takeuchi puts it: &quot;An Edo-era financial structure is a great hindrance
to us in reducing the cost of issuing. Now that the JGB settlement is linked
to the international financial system, we can anticipate more purchase of
JGBs by foreigners.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The new system will regularize settlements to a seven-day period so it is
still a far cry from the same-day settlement that can be had with computerized
trading abroad. According to a bond dealer at a foreign securities house,
the MoF had to compromise with the industry because some smaller organizations
were not able to handle a shorter settlement period. The process of harmonizing
settlement days with practices abroad has gone relatively smoothly, but
so far not much else has. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Shadow without substance</B> <BR>
<BR>
When a five-year JGB futures market was introduced on February 16, some
15,000 contracts were traded that day. Two trading days later, however,
this was down to 135, and today the market is moribund. &quot;Right now
what we have is shadow without substance,&quot; says Takeuchi. A futures
market has been established, again at the apparent prodding of the MoF,
but for the time being the ministry does not issue a five-year cash bond,
largely out of consideration for the three long-term credit banks (Industrial
Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank), which together
with three other banks were given the specific right to issue five-year
bonds during a time of more stringent market regulation. The view in the
financial industry in Tokyo is that the MoF will eventually issue a five-year
cash bond, possibly as early as 1997, but not until the long-term credit
banks have found alternative sources of income, possibly from bonds with
a duration of between two and three years. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is very difficult for us to issue four to six year bonds now,&quot;
says Takeuchi. Although demand has increased for the medium-term instruments
in recent years to about 20% of the trade volume of the benchmark 10-year
bond, in one one-week period in late February there was just one trade executed
for a four-year JGB. <BR>
<BR>
As Cameron Umetsu, senior economist at UBS Tokyo, put it: &quot;Considering
Japan's is the second-largest government bond market in the world, it is
still strikingly immature.&quot; Umetsu lauds the launching of the five-year
futures market but says: &quot;We are still a long way from a fully liquid
yield-curve.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Various sources pointed out that the 15,000 contracts on the first day of
the five-year futures market were largely congratulatory trades. The real
test of the success of the market will come later this year when an old
10-year benchmark bond will become available for trade as a five-year bond.
<BR>
<BR>
Although Takeuchi says he is &quot;determined to bring diversity into the
JGB market,&quot; at every step entrenched procedures seem to stand in his
way. For example, there is at present no real bond repo market. Instead
there are two repo-like markets, one of which, called <I>gensaki</I>, is
hindered by the application of a tax of 4bp per transaction. <BR>
<BR>
Although the <I>gensaki</I> market follows similar principles to other repo
markets, the sales tax (which translates into a levy of about 2% on any
bond traded once a week over a one-year period) has prevented the market
from taking off. At present, primarily JGBs of less than one-year maturity
(which are exempted from the transaction tax) are traded on the <I>gensaki</I>
market. In 1994, the total <I>gensaki</I> turnover of JGBs with maturities
over one year was about &#165;66 trillion - a pittance compared with the
fully developed US repo market. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;For us and the financial institutions, the repo market is very important,&quot;
says Hiroyuki Kudo, senior managing officer at the Bank of Tokyo's securities
business division. &quot;The repo market in the US is the biggest money
market, eight times larger than the Federal funds, and the biggest short-term
money market in the world.&quot; The view among Tokyo bond analysts is that
a Japanese repo market would bring to JGBs what they most lack: liquidity.
Although trade is no longer concentrated as heavily in the 10-year benchmark
bond as it used to be in the late 1980s when fully 95% of trade was taken
up by the benchmark, if institutions could borrow a bond safely for a short
period, demand would be created for a wide variety of JGBs along the yield
curve. <BR>
<BR>
Another disadvantage of the <I>gensaki</I> market is that the borrower cannot
specify the bond of choice but has to take whatever is available. Although
a bond-lending market known as the <I>taishaku</I> market exists parallel
to <I>gensaki</I>, it appears to have developed primarily in order to avoid
the transaction tax as well as the long waiting periods that the lunar-calendar-based
settlement system throws up. <BR>
<BR>
Since this market evolved on its own, it has existed in a state of legal
limbo in which lenders have accepted unsecured transactions mostly in order
to avoid both tax and lengthy settlement periods. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bureaucrats who won't let go</B> <BR>
<BR>
Although Takeuchi's department has been supporting the creation of a new
Japanese-style repo market, expected to start at the beginning of this month,
the launch has been resisted by taxation officials. Whereas the new market
will require payment of funds roughly equivalent to the value of the bond
being borrowed, parties will be able to avoid the transaction tax as there
will be no sale. Although individuals connected with the formulation of
the new repo market are unwilling to talk on the record, it would appear
that interdepartmental negotiations over the creation of the repo market
have involved considerable bureaucratic haggling over the past year. Initially,
tax officials demanded that borrowers in the new repo market paid a fee
equivalent to 100bp above the call-market rate. The idea appears to have
been to discourage borrowers who might want to avoid the transaction tax.
(This is in spite of the fact that the tax at present is so steep that it
has effectively discouraged the growth of just such a market.) <BR>
<BR>
The total amount of tax raised from JGB transactions on the <I>gensaki</I>
market was less than &#165;30 billion in 1994, so the real issue - as one
securities dealer involved in formulating the new repo market argued - may
be not so much the revenue as the reluctance of MoF bureaucrats to relax
their grip on securities transactions. &quot;The idea that securities could
be traded without the government being there to take its share seemed to
bother them,&quot; the industry representative told <I>Euromoney</I>. Nevertheless
the new repo market is expected to be a success. As Marshall Gittler, bond
analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, puts it: &quot;The new repo market will
definitely fill in some missing links in the JGB market.&quot; Certainly,
the &#165;221 trillion of JGBs in circulation is likely to be increased
if they can be lent out in an easy and safe manner. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps farthest down the line in streamlining the flow of JGBs is the strips
market, which the MoF would like to see inaugurated in April 1998. &quot;Canada
was able to save 100 basis points in placing its debt once it introduced
strips,&quot; says Takeuchi. <BR>
<BR>
The MoF, which used to view foreign financial institutions as &quot;the
enemy&quot;, recently invited two US brokerages to join a Japanese brokerage
and a Japanese life insurance company on a committee aimed at setting up
a strips market for Japan. The Americans were invited because strips are
essentially an American invention and US institutions have the greatest
experience with the system. The separation of interest-bearing coupons from
a bond gives a purchaser of the strips a clear idea of earnings on interest
and thereby permits institutions to plan their cashflows more precisely,
thereby lowering their risks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need a technical adjustment,&quot; says the MoF's Takeuchi. &quot;We
are now doing an official study on how to introduce a strips market.&quot;
The greatest hurdle, again, appears to be tax laws. At present interest
rate income attracts a 20% withholding tax for foreigners from non-tax-treaty
countries and 10% for Japanese. What with Japanese politicians being distrac-ted
by the <I>jusen</I> scandal and an election likely later this year, it is
not clear at the moment if the law on withholding taxes can be revised in
time to start strips two years from now. <BR>
<BR>
In spite of the major innovations initiated by the MoF, Lehman Brothers'
Jones remains sceptical about the Japanese government's ability to continue
to place its debts at present levels. According to Jones, the pick-up in
the Japanese economy alone is already a negative factor for JGBs. &quot;Thanks
to the recession, people weren't buying very much last year, so money was
available to fund government finance at low interest,&quot; says Jones.
&quot;Now that the economy has picked up, there is greater demand for funds
so the government now has to pay more for it, just like everyone else.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Jones is equally unimpressed by the MoF's streamlining of the mechanisms
of the bond market: &quot;They are trying to Americanize the bond market,
to turn it into something like the US T-bill market. That will take the
sand out of the machinery, but by doing so they will also make the bond
market more responsive to actual conditions in the economy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And that, according to Jones, will mean an increase in long-term interest
rates. <p>

<H2>THE NEW WORLD CLASS: 
HOW LOCAL GOES GLOBAL</H2>
<H4>The new class divide is between cosmopolitans and locals: the new challenge
is to help reinvent civic life, argues Rosabeth Moss Kanter </H4>
With the world economy in a period of dramatic change, the question of how
we will connect to this new world is the most important issue of our lifetime.
Even people who think that international trade means patronising the exotic
restaurant down the street must make that determination because their businesses,
jobs and quality of community life are at stake. On every continent people
are asking how they fit in the new global economy. And leaders responsible
for the political order that follows the already-existing global economic
order are often failing to provide answers. <BR>
<BR>
As people living in the world's last superpower, Americans in particular
are living in a time of contradictions which highlight the changes affecting
everyone. Americans enjoyed a rare period of cultural and economic dominance
after World War II during which the US set standards for the world. English
became the language of air traffic control and international business. Dollars
were strong and welcomed everywhere. American products became the first
global products -; Gillette razors, Coca-Cola, Disney characters -; often
succeeding by selling images of American culture like Marlboro's cowboy
or Levi's blue jeans. <BR>
<BR>
The US exported political models along with its technology and pop culture.
Multinational companies taught US management principles to executives throughout
the world, spreading a universal culture of commerce. Its universities educated
the elite of many countries. Americans assumed that everyone liked them
and that everyone wanted to be like them. <BR>
<BR>
But by the '90s, America's place in the world had changed. A recent <I>New
Yorker</I> cartoon pictured a man, apparently an American executive, saying
his nightly prayers: &quot;I pray that we continue to deserve to consume
a disproportionate share of the world's resources.&quot; These days, people
question whether the US will continue or even deserve to do so. <BR>
<BR>
The US economy has recovered from a period of stagnation but few believe
that security -; let alone unchallenged superiority -; has returned. Other
countries do not automatically follow US leadership on international matters,
the most dynamic growth markets lie in unfamiliar regions and America's
reputation for quality products has had to be re-earned. Its secondary schools
are not the world's best, while its outstanding universities are enrolling
an increasing percentage of foreign students. America's universalistic culture,
even its use of the English language adopted so widely abroad, is being
challenged on its own shores by bilingual and multicultural movements. <BR>
<BR>
FDI has also become a more important influence on American soil. Over about
a decade, foreigners have paid $316 billion to acquire US companies, on
top of the many international firms that have started new operations there.
Nearly 5 million Americans work in foreign-owned companies or their US affiliates.
This means that foreign competition exists next door to US companies, on
their home territory. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The new citistates </B><BR>
<BR>
Another key change is the growing importance of sub-national entities -;
a series of strong companies and communities popularly dubbed &quot;citistates&quot;,
which sometimes make their own foreign policy. Indeed, the National League
of Cities has argued that America is a common market of local economic regions
and a civic activist group in Seattle has created a vision of Cascadia -;
a Pacific north west economy that includes Washington, Oregon, British Columbia,
and Saskatchewan. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder the last superpower is having an identity crisis. The US century
-; and the European half-millennium -; is coming to an end and the world
century is beginning. For business and communities to prosper, the new standard
to meet is the world class. <BR>
<BR>
The phrase &quot;world class&quot; is a term suggesting both the need to<B>
</B>meet the highest standards anywhere in order to compete and the<B> </B>growth
of a social class, defined by its ability to command resources and operate
beyond borders. If the class divide of the industrial economy was between
capital and labour or managers and workers, the class divide of the emerging
information economy could be between cosmopolitans and locals. <BR>
<BR>
Cosmopolitans are card-carrying members of the world class: often literally
card-carrying, with passports or air tickets serving to admit them. They
lead firms that are linked to global chains. Comfortable in many places,
their skills are portable and their outlook is broad. It is mindset not
travel that defines them -; some widely travelled people remain hopelessly
parochial. Cosmopolitans are rich in three intangible assets that translate
into pre-eminence and power in a global economy: These are concepts, the
best and latest knowledge and ideas; competence, the ability to operate
at the highest standards of any place anywhere and connections, the best
relationships which provide access to the resources of other people and
organisations around the world. <BR>
<BR>
Cosmopolitans carry these assets around with them, in the process creating
and sustaining part of a more universal culture that transcends the particularities
of place and, in the eyes of some locals, threatens the distinctive identity
of communities. They argue for a qualitocracy in which the highest quality
matters more than place of origin, because in such conditions cosmopolitans
who tap into the best in the world can automatically win out over those
who are more restricted. <BR>
<BR>
Locals, by contrast, are defined primarily by particular places. Many are
rooted in their communities but remain open to global thinking and opportunities.
Others are simply stuck. The people at the extreme end of the local class
are the isolates, those whose skills are not particularly unique or desirable,
whose connections are limited to a small circle in the neighbourhood and
whose opportunities are confined to their own communities. <BR>
<BR>
Isolates face increasing limits to opportunity. They lack control over resources
and knowledge, which can move rapidly in and out of their communities. As
they are dependent on decisions made by cosmopolitans about where to invest
and locate they can easily become nativists, resisting globalism. <BR>
<BR>
Cosmopolitans often have strong feelings of membership in particular communities.
They are not anti-local but supralocal, connected with communities but transcending
them, and their linkages to wider networks give them opportunities and options
that local isolates lack. Consequently, cosmopolitans often value choices
over loyalties. Local nativists value loyalties over choices, preferring
to preserve distinctions and protect their own group. Cosmopolitans characteristically
try to break through barriers and overcome limits; nativists try to preserve
and even erect new barriers, most often through political means. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Economies go global, politics local </B><BR>
<BR>
These differences create one of the great tensions and paradoxes of our
time. While economies are globalising, politics in many parts of the world
are localising. Large countries and companies are burying the political
hatchet to reach foreign customers or attract investment -; one impetus
for peace in the Middle East -; while smaller, more isolated entities are
engaged in a kind of tribal warfare, trying to achieve or restore local
sovereignty. Many of the tragic troublespots of the world are places insufficiently
linked to the global economy, where internecine warfare or jurisdictional
disputes are at the root of bitter battles over the distribution of crumbs
rather than collaborative efforts to enlarge the pie. <BR>
<BR>
Some people feel excited about international opportunities as ways to grow
their businesses or careers, but frightened by changes in their communities
and lives. That is why an economic recovery does not translate immediately
into optimism. During times of change, job displacement and career insecurity
are rampant, and some nativists retreat into protectionism in the hope that
the doors can be closed and globalism banished. <BR>
<BR>
Global economic interests and local political ones potentially clash in
a variety of domains. Even organised crime is crossing borders to work in
dishonest global harmony, while lawful society is &quot;haggling over legal
jurisdiction and perpetuating a multitude of police agencies carefully keeping
secrets from each other,&quot; according to Donna Goehle (The Buy America
Act, <I>Columbia Journal of World Business</I>, Winter 1989). Globalising
economic interests are often left uncontrolled by any territory-oriented
body. When Banco Latino International became America's first international
bank bankruptcy in 1994 -; after its Venezuelan parent was seized for corruption
-; neither the US Federal Reserve nor Venezuelan authorities seemed clear
about who had jurisdiction and who could have prevented the crisis. <BR>
<BR>
Business is increasingly global but &quot;all politics is local&quot;, as
the late US parliamentarian Tip O'Neill once said. Businesses generally
want the freedom to pursue resources or markets anywhere but as business
mobility increases, the fate of local populations becomes tied to distant
forces they do not control. In reaction, politicians court local votes by
capitalising on the discontent and insecurity of their constituents and
promising job security by placing entry or exit restrictions, like the anti-Nafta
forces mobilised by populist millionaire and erstwhile presidential candidate
Ross Perot. Separatist movements to increase local sovereignty, like that
of the Qu&eacute;becois in Canada, seek additional power to set territorial
rules. <BR>
<BR>
Where innovation, education and collaboration flourish and links to global
networks are clear, popular security increases. Where they are missing,
economic marginality results. And concentrated marginality builds an underclass
visible in inner cities everywhere, one largely populated by minority groups.
Inner city ghettos in industrialised countries are a kind of new third world:
attempts to help them often resemble foreign aid programmes, including packages
to combat illiteracy and Peace Corps-type volunteers. <BR>
<BR>
If inner cities are the first destination for poor immigrants, those ethnic
groups that escape tend to be the ones connected to networks that help them
join the world class. Lack of the cosmopolitan skills are self-reinforcing,
creating a downward spiral for those minority groups whose natural ethnic
network does not reach far beyond the community itself. Cuban exiles in
Miami started out with inherent network advantages that translated quickly
into business advantages. Asian-Americans often possess ties to growing
markets that can be leveraged for local success: Mochtar Riady built Lippo
Group and Boston's small Asian American Bank serves the local Chinese population
and finances trade with south east Asia. <BR>
<BR>
New forms of security are therefore urgently required. What seem to some
like hostile forces, such as foreign ownership of US companies, must be
converted into sources of benefits for locals. Community spirit must be
restored, unifying people across groups and sectors in a common question
for excellence that will link their communities to the rest of the world.
<BR>
<BR>
Many Americans no longer believe that Washington can fix things, a feeling
echoed in many other western countries. Although they mistrust government
at all levels, they have slightly more faith in local attempts to revitalise
regional economies. They believe that things are out of control nationally
but possible to deal with regionally, especially if businesses commit to
specific local projects. Some people think there is more hope of solving
social problems through business than through government. If this is true,
then the community institutions that depend on business support -; civic
associations, not-for-profit social and cultural organisations -; also require
reinvention. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A high-order political game </B><BR>
<BR>
Cosmopolitans, therefore, must play a high-order political game. Even as
they globalise, businesses must know how to be responsive to the needs of
the communities in which they operate. Communities, for their part, must
determine how best to connect cosmopolitans and locals and how to create
an atmosphere that will both attract and hold footloose companies. In the
middle are vast numbers of people whose prosperity depends upon them learning
what it takes to become world class. <BR>
<BR>
The competitive business battles of the future will be fought not among
nations -; the US versus Japan versus Europe. There will be contests between
government-backed consortia in fields such as aerospace, and some countries
will contain a higher proportion of mem- bers of the world class. But the
competitive battles will be among global networks whose participants span
many countries or regions. The range of locations and the sizes of the companies
represented in the networks will vary; companies do not have to be giants
to flourish in the new global networks. Cities and local economies will
flourish to the extent that they link to global activities and networks.
They must become world centres of distinctive world-class skills. <BR>
<BR>
<B>From companies to communities </B><BR>
<BR>
While global networks pass overhead like satellite transmissions, most people
continue to operate firmly on the ground. How can global forces be corralled
for the benefit of communities, rather than causing their destruction? <BR>
<BR>
In a project on local challenges in the global economy I embarked on a research
and consulting tour of American cities. Over 2,650 business heads returned
questionnaires; almost 100 companies were profiled after extensive interviews;
hundreds of community leaders, public officials and ordinary people were
interviewed and hundreds more participated in civic forums to decide how
to act on the results. <BR>
<BR>
By approaching these regions through the lens of business, I was able to
view local economies not as abstractions or aggregate statistics but from
inside the organisations that struggle every day to make and sell goods
or services. I was able to sound out business and civic leaders about their
strategies to improve their economy and quality of life in the light of
global changes. And I identified three archetypal ways that the global economy
can work locally, built around the triumvirate of world-class resources:
concepts, competence and connections. Cities specialise in using these resources
to link their population to the global economy. Thus, they develop pre-eminence
in one of three generic ways: as thinkers, makers or traders [see page 57].
<BR>
<BR>
Thinkers specialise in concepts: they are magnets for brainpower, which
in turn is channelled into knowledge industries, and their competitive edge
comes from continuous innovation. They set world standards and export both
knowledge and knowledge-based products that command premium prices and enjoy
temporary monopolies because of the innovation involved. Thinkers count
on their cleverness and creativity to win a niche in world markets: as their
original concepts pass into common use they must think up new ones. <BR>
<BR>
Makers specialise in executional competence, possesing skills that meet
high-process quality standards and an infrastructure that supports high-value,
cost-effective production. Makers attract world manufacturing because of
their competence and are thus magnets for foreign investment. Traders specialise
in connections. They sit at the crossroads of cultures, helping move goods
and services from one country to another and managing the intersections.
Miami is a quintessential trader, bridging Anglo and Latin cultures just
as the great trading cities Singapore and Hong Kong link Anglo and Chinese
cultures. <BR>
<BR>
What distinguishes the world-class centre from the merely good is the ability
to be a global centre of at least one of these three domains. After all,
great companies can start anywhere -; usually where the entrepreneur is
already living -; and can move part or all of their operations easily. For
a place to be world class, it must feature a concentration of skills that
are hard to uncouple from local assets -; for example, colleges and universities
in Boston, Latin American experts in Miami. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, for an area to remain competitive as others around the world
compete to attract and retain businesses, minimum standards must be maintained.
Every area must contain a range of support institutions, provide a modern
infrastructure such as transportation and telecommunication, engage in activities
that provide employment and amenities and ensure a positive business climate.
Every area needs to refurbish deteriorating or underused assets such as
parklands, ports or state schools. <BR>
<BR>
Here too, world-class resources and skills can be applied to encourage new
concepts through investment in innovation, greater competence through investment
in education and stronger connections through investment in collaboration.
<BR>
<BR>
Communities need both magnets and glue. They must have magnets that attract
a flow of external resources -; new people or companies -; to renew and
expand skills, broaden horizons and hold up a comparative mirror against
world standards. Communities also need social glue, a way to bring people
together to define the common good and identify strategies that benefit
a wide range of organisations and people in the community. In addition to
the physical infrastructure that supports daily life and work, such as roads,
subways, sewers, electricity and communications systems, communities need
a social infrastructure for collaboration to solve problems and create the
future. <BR>
<BR>
It might take a concrete form such as civic leadership groups, public-private
partnerships, industry councils or other institution-spanning bodies which
are broader but less formal than government and sometimes more important
in getting things done. Roger Milliken in Spartanburg and Alvah Chapman
in Miami have outlasted local and regional officials and held multiple leadership
roles. Politics involves battles over distribution, who gets which slices
of the pie. A community's social infrastructure, in contrast, offers the
prospect of expanding the pie. Yet this social infrastructure and the social
capital or human relationships that support it are too often neglected,
allowing the area to remain fragmented. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How collaboration can help </B><BR>
<BR>
Crises sometimes galvanise leaders to improve the infrastructure for collaboration.
In Cleveland business leaders led a remarkable turnaround of dying industries,
lost jobs, racial tensions, deteriorating education, incompetent politicians
and a river declared a fire hazard. Cleveland Tomorrow, formed in December
1981, brought together the heads of 36 major businesses to create strategic
plans which revived community spirit while bringing new industry, new jobs
and new tourist attractions such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a
new sports stadium. With 56 chief executives on board, Cleveland Tomorrow
continues to create civic partnerships. <BR>
<BR>
Excellence is the best protection against global competition. Communities
must connect to the world through world-class skills. The clearest danger
to the viability of communities is not globalisation but a retreat into
isolationism and protectionism. In the global economy, those institutions
that are fragmented and those organisations or people that are unconnected
and isolated are at a disadvantage. They are targets of nativists who capitalise
on discontent by blaming outsiders and urging that barriers be erected to
stem the global tide. But if communities retreat into nativism they are
unlikely to find solutions to the very problems that led to their discontent
in the first place. And, just as ironically, the best way for communities
to preserve their uniqueness and control is to be globally excellent. <BR>
<BR>
The companies that will make their cities world-class are not just the global
giants but numerous small and medium-sized enterprises. After corporate
giants have been fine-tuned, re-engineered, downsized, streamlined or dressed
up for sale, communities are left with the fact that most of their jobs
and businesses are in smaller organisations. These smaller enterprises -;
manufacturers, professional firms, trading companies, software developers
-; must become cosmopolitans. It is essential to help those companies innovate,
educate and collaborate so they can join the world class through their direct
exports or memberships in international networks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Small companies must also join world class </B><BR>
<BR>
For example, Hans Balmer's Symtech in Spartanburg is an equipment distributor
that also sets up its customers' factories. Maria Elena Ibanez's International
High-Tech Marketing in Miami is a company that has sold computers to Africa
and sold Japanese consumer electronics bought in the US back into the Japanese
market. Tech Ridge is a 30-person manufacturer of photo-identification cameras
with technology so desirable that the much larger Polaroid took it as a
partner to Mexico. Cohen &amp; Wilks International is a small British clothing
supplier whose joint venture with a giant Japanese trading company gives
it a desk in 189 offices worldwide. <BR>
<BR>
Just consider Boston's two most globalised companies. One is Gillette, giant
manufacturer of razors and other consumer products, with over 70% of its
sales and employees outside the US. The other is The Bamboo Fencer, a four-person
craft shop near a brewery in a neighbourhood close to the inner city. Its
bamboo comes from a company in Panama which it partly owns or from surplus
imported from China by Orvis, a maker of fishing rods in New England. Its
employees are from Nepal, Laos, Puerto Rico and Texas. It sells its fences
nearly anywhere but Boston. And it expects future growth from a new venture
with an Italian designer to make bamboo fences for the German market. Both
companies are led by cosmopolitans. In its own way, each is connected to
the world. And while leaders of both have deep local roots in their home
communities, they are also members of the world class. <BR>
<BR>
There is already a world market among places to attract and hold business
investment. Communities everywhere must develop their direct economic connections
to the world. To compete, cities need economic development strategies that
include, in effect, their own foreign policies. Look at the brochures of
cities all over the world, and you will see that they are showing off their
international offices and factories the way they once boasted about their
local museums and churches. The slick brochure for the city of Lodz in Poland,
for example, features foreign companies located there: Boston's own Gillette
as well as Shell, Pepsico, Sara Lee, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Coca-Cola and
VF Corporation, parent of Wrangler jeans. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout Europe, cities are not only making their own foreign policy and
connections, they are forming groups to help them do so. Eurocities, formed
in 1986, is an association of 58 European regional centres that play an
international role, including Barcelona in Spain, Cologne in Germany and
Lyon in France. Its goal is to facilitate its member cities' international
links and to gain &quot;political recognition of the position and role of
cities in Europe&quot; at European Union deliberations in Brussels. The
voice of cities is being heard. <BR>
<BR>
As cities and regions develop explicit strategies and foreign policies,
competition among places to be world centres of thinking, making and trading
promises to be increasingly fierce in the future. Cities can no longer afford
complacency. They must actively create their own futures. They must do so
as leaders of regions that acknowledge their shared fate. Cities and suburbs,
edge cities and downtowns, prosper -; or fail to prosper -; together. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity and innovation in companies are facilitated by cross-fertilisation
and by flexible organisations encouraging people to combine ideas across
different fields. In <I>The Economy of Cities</I>, Jane Jacobs argued that
cities grow faster and can renew themselves periodically because their diversity
of institutions stimulates a similar cross-fertilisation or clash of ideas.
Recent economic studies confirm that the adoption of new technology is more
likely when companies are located in places with diverse economies rather
than near those specialised in their particular industry. <BR>
<BR>
Cities need to be places that help people in an industry gain strength not
just by talking to each other but to those who think differently, challenge
assumptions and bring ideas and resources from outside the industry or locality.
Detroit's downhill slide beginning in the mid-'70s took place because the
car industry cluster there was so strong it became insular; there was little
external stimulus to innovation. With major rivals and suppliers clustered
in the area, auto executives apparently thought there was no need to look
beyond the Detroit region to stay abreast of new developments in the industry.
The Japanese auto companies proved them wrong. By the end of the '80s, flights
from Detroit to Tokyo were packed, some of the most important centres of
innovation sprang up elsewhere at NUMMI in northern California, Saturn in
Tennessee and Honda in Ohio, and American car manufacturers were embedded
in dense global webs drawing on many centres of expertise. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Survival through diversity </B><BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, too much reliance on particular industries can lead to a company
town writ large, one that is highly vulnerable to industry cycles and capital
flight once companies no longer need their founding location. Tying a city's
success to a small number of large industries means that Seattle would have
busted long ago, when the forest products boom ended, and would never have
risen from the ashes of periodic Boeing layoffs. Or Boston would still be
in the doldrums from defence industry cutbacks and computer hardware industry
crashes. <BR>
<BR>
Core global capabilities create new industries as old ones die -; like software
and telecommunications replacing computer hardware around Boston because
of a fertile environment for new concepts and the means to start businesses
based on them. An area's core skills can be generalised over a variety of
industries, bringing related diversity in many companies, as happened with
manufacturing skills in Spartanburg and Greenville; textile manufacturing
attracted equipment suppliers that used machine-making skills to diversify
the area's industrial base beyond textiles. An unexpected combination of
diverse industries can create new ones: aerospace engineers plus Hollywood
equals Los Angeles' multimedia companies. <BR>
<BR>
Core global skills take a long time to embed in community institutions,
like Atlanta's 25-year climb to technology prominence. They are long-lasting,
occasionally even over centuries, like northern Italy's core competence
in artistic design which made Florence a capital of the Renaissance and
Milan a fashion capital today. And a region's core skills give additional
power to what would otherwise seem like unrelated industries. For example,
Miami's health technology firms take advantage of trade connections with
Latin America, while Boston's larger set of health technology firms take
advantage of computer software and other technological innovation in the
area. Each of these cities can seem unique or exotic, a product of historical
accidents and the independent actions of business entrepreneurs more than
conscious strategies. But at some point luck was converted into strategy,
civic leaders recognised potential skills and made decisions that supported
them. <BR>
<BR>
Other American areas strong in the generic skills outlined above have similar
combinations of foundation organisations and investments that make them
magnets. The San Francisco Bay area or Austin, Texas are both centres of
technological thinking, building on great universities and federal funding.
The greater Cleveland area or northern Indiana are centres of manufacturing
competence, building on foreign as well as domestic investment in world-class
quality. New York City or Los Angeles are global trade centres, benefiting
from a combination of cross-border population flows, transportation links
and strength in finance, communication and other business services. <BR>
<BR>
Core capabilities can also bring core rigidities: an over-reliance on known
technologies and an inability to change. When a region becomes so strong
at industries based on one core skill that others are neglected it creates
tensions in the community between the cosmopolitans who benefit from the
core skill, who can pick up and move elsewhere, and the locals who are left
behind. It creates weaknesses and vulnerabilities. <BR>
<BR>
Cosmopolitans and locals can be united around a vision of excellence. This
vision should build on the area's historical advantages to increase its
stock of world-class concepts, competence or connections: its skills as
thinker, maker or trader. It should rest on a set of linked premises, which
show how cosmopolitans and locals can succeed together: <BR>
<BR>
* That the best social programme is good jobs. <BR>
<BR>
* That the best jobs provide linkages and capabilities for the global economy.
<BR>
<BR>
* That the best source of those jobs and capabilities is a world-ready business.
<BR>
<BR>
* That the way to attract and keep world class companies is to build a strong
community, one that adds value to the company's business through its core
global skills, welcomes newcomers and offers a high quality of life. <BR>
<BR>
* That a desirable community is one that can work together to address its
problems and build a healthy business climate that creates good jobs...
the best social programme. <BR>
<BR>
A campaign for leadership and excellence -; spearheaded by an existing civic
organisation, a coalition of organisations or a new public-private partnership
-; would invite locals to join the world class. It would promote world-readiness
for local companies and job security for the local workforce. It would serve
as an umbrella for efforts to initiate, publicise and extend area-wide actions.
Instead of walls that divide, communities and their people should build
bridges that connect. Then the faultline between cosmopolitans and locals
will be healed, and globalisation will be embraced as an opportunity for
locals to thrive.<BR>

<H3>THE THINKER BOSTON </H3>
Knowledge industries are crucial for the Boston area's 3 million population,
one of the world's highest concentrations of college-educated people, making
it a centre of world class concepts. The magnet is the area's laboratories
higher education and academic medical centres. <BR>
<BR>
The area's best industries tend to be defined by process not product, technology
not market: one company uses the same fibre-optic technology both to help
surgeons look inside the body and to make street signs. Concepts derived
from its thinkers command a premium, making its per capita income among
the nation's highest. That makes its prospects only as good as its last
idea and Boston is characterised by comebacks, written off only to bounce
back again. <BR>
<BR>
The most significant public investment has been federal defence and research
spending; the most important political decisions affecting the area between
1940 and 1980 were federal decisions to pursue new technologies for World
War II and the Cold War. Cuts in arms spending during the '70s hit the local
economy hard. The most significant private investment has been venture capital:
together with an array of technology transfer programmes and informal networks,
this has translated new concepts into commercial enterprises. <BR>
<BR>
A slowdown in growth since 1990, typified by the downturn faced by computer
giant Digital in the face of competition from California's Silicon Valley,
has prompted some soul-searching. Many companies and politicians are so
locally focused that they do not take full advantage of their own international
connections: the city's take-it-or-leave-it attitude makes it rank low in
customer service and kindness to strangers and puts off some would-be investors.
This illustrates the typical danger of the Thinker: to fall prey to arrogance,
orthodoxy and elitism and to emphasise knowledge work to exclusion of other
fields. 
<BR>

<H3>THE MAKER SPARTANBURG </H3>
The sister cities of Spartanburg and Greenville, South Carolina, with a
total population of just under 600,000, have together attracted the highest
amount of per capita diversified foreign investment in the US, making them
an object lesson for others and a centre of world-class competence. <BR>
<BR>
The foundation was laid in the '50s with textile factories: European equipment
manufacturers followed to locate near their American customers, benefiting
skilled production workers and suppliers. As the area gained increased manufacturing
competence, American subsidiaries of foreign companies became models for
their foreign parents, outperforming them and creating a virtuous circle
of interest. There is now a solid base of mid-sized entrepreneurial companies
with international connections. <BR>
<BR>
The interstate highway from Charlotte, North Caroline, to Atlanta is nicknamed
&quot;the Autobahn&quot; in honour of the large number of companies in the
area from German-speaking countries such as BMW, which recently set up its
first-ever manufacturing facility outside Germany there. <BR>
<BR>
The most significant public investment has been in customised training:by
helping workers meet the needs of manufacturers, these cities have derived
local benefits from the global economy. The critical political decision
at the local level was actively to pursue outside investment, including
from foreign companies. The most significant private investment has been
foreign capital, accompanied by foreign expertise. <BR>
<BR>
The area features a network of strong locally based business leaders such
as Roger Milliken, chairman of the eponymous textile giant, who &quot;get
things done and make decisions&quot;. This group has led the way in shaping
a local foreign policy, developing collaboration and encouraging a positive
work ethic and hospitable climate for entrants, including extra language
classes in upgraded local schools. Social problems have been worsening in
the area's urban core, however, along with race relations. <BR>
<BR>
The danger facing any Maker city is the temptation to stress reliable performance
over innovation and to train the workforce for production efficiency while
neglecting those offering new ways of thinking. <BR><BR><HR width=60%>
<H3>
THE TRADER MIAMI </H3>
Miami, founded only in 1896, is often identified as an international city
rather than an US one, a centre of world-class connections: benefits tend
to accrue to so-called gold-collar workers (highly paid executives and professionals).
<BR>
<BR>
Miami is often chosen as a headquarters site because no one Latin American
country can represent a whole continent. This was highlighted by the Summit
of the Americas, held in Miami in December 1994, which brought together
US President Bill Clinton and heads of state from 33 Latin American and
Caribbean countries to discuss cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
Its foundation organisations reach back to the postwar resort hotels that
provided the area's first flow of external resources in the form of tourists;
some decided to settle, like Jewish garment manufacturers from New York
who formed an ethnic colony. It is now home to a significant garment-making
cluster but its future lies elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
Fidel Castro turned out to be the city's single most important economic
development agent: Miami was revived by a significant political decision
to admit refugees from nearby communist Cuba and by significant public investment
in the physical infrastructure for trade, the airport and seaport to help
the exiles build an economic base. <BR>
<BR>
The bilingual, Spanish-speaking population, with strong ties among itself
and to the outside world, made the city the place to be to make deals across
cultures. The 1977 International Banking law allowing foreign banks to open
there prompted the biggest building boom in its history and attracted significant
private investment from Latin America and Europe. <BR>
<BR>
The danger for Trader cities is that they can become mere conduits for the
exchange of goods and services without adding either manufacturing or intellectual
value. Miami also fights a reputation as a centre of less savoury trade,
for example in drugs and arms, and its success<B> </B>at creating foreign
comfort might also reduce domestic comfort: some companies complain that
the foreign flavour of the city makes it hard to attract talent from other
parts of the US.  <p>

<H3>INTERNET </H3>
<H2>Opening windows with the internet </H2>
<H4>The internet's free technology raises questions about all the old ways
of doing things. It makes communication easier than ever - both inside
and outside a company - and it revolutionizes information storage and
access. But who will be first against the wall when the changes begin to
bite? Felix Salmon investigates how far the net will shake up banking </H4>
Joe Banker is feeling old - and he's only 24. He's just had a brand-new
Sun workstation installed next to his Windows 95 pc and is unsure about
what it all means. It's got one of those clever optical mouse things attached
to it. It boasts three buttons. Bill from it was ever so enthusiastic about
it in the pub last night. &quot;Functionality,&quot; he explained, &quot;is
all about what your machine is capable of doing. The analysts now create
beautiful reports in Word 7, embedding Excel 6 charts. The rocket scientists
can run extremely powerful options-pricing algorithms in half the time it
would have taken them last week. And if you press shift-control-a and the
middle mouse button, an instruction is sent to the coffee machine to have
a fresh cup ready for you in four minutes' time!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Joe's stomach begins to tighten whenever anybody comes along to install
a new piece of hardware or software. He knows there's a wonderful internal
computer system which makes his life a lot easier, but he just can't understand
all the different commands, applications and error messages which appear
whenever he tries to use it. Most of the time, the only thing on the screen
of his ludicrously over-specified workstation is the cnn home page on the
World Wide Web. That, he can understand. It won't plot a yield curve, but
it gives him what he wants. <BR>
<BR>
But soon, Joe is going to come across a technological innovation he'll actually
welcome - an internal internet, or intranet, which provides a single
interface for software, information, communications, etc. If 1995 was the
year that banks went into the internet, then 1996 is the year that the internet
goes into the banks. <BR>
<BR>
At Morgan Stanley, every employee's computer is already fitted with a Web
browser. Logging-on brings up an internal home page containing internal
news that is updated daily. All in-house equity research is accessible from
internal servers, which drastically reduces paper and printing costs, and
saves vast amounts of filing cabinet space, all over the world. Some facilities
are marginally used - for example, a search engine which identifies
members of staff on Morgan Stanley's office floor plan. Others, such as
a completely up-to-date internal telephone and e-mail directory, are used
all the time. <BR>
<BR>
There is a comprehensive and well-indexed list of Web sites relevant to
employees in every imaginable part of the bank, which are available with
one click of a mouse. There are discussion groups on a large number of subjects
- related and not-so-related to work - to which employees all
over the world contribute via e-mail. And any information that Morgan Stanley
wishes to make available to clients or to the general public can easily
be placed on its<B> </B>Web site, tagged so that all or only some people
can have access to it. <BR>
<BR>
The people running the system can easily tell which services are proving
popular and which aren't. Mark Kennedy, a former Morgan Stanley technology
vice-president, has called this its &quot;most overlooked benefit&quot;.
This information, he<B> </B>writes in a research briefing, &quot;is invaluable.
It separates the winners from the losers in the information world. Once
something can be measured, there is almost no end to the ways the measurements
can be used.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All of this marks a profound shift from the over-specification which is
the bane of Joe Banker's life to, if anything, under-specification. His
old desktop computer, in theory, enabled him do about 905% of what he wanted
to do but the difficulty of charting a course through the maze of options
tended to restrict him to far less than 100%. Now with little more than
a point-and-click Web browser, he can now do about 95%. Soon, this figure
will get closer to 99%, thanks to the internet's hottest new piece of software,
Java. <BR>
<BR>
Java, the internet's own computer language, is a key element of its accessibility
and appeal to users. Whenever there's something Joe wants to do, the it
people can write a simple Java application that allows him to do it. <BR>
<BR>
The openness of internet protocols means that it doesn't matter if the employee
is working on a Unix workstation or a pc - or even an Apple laptop
in a hotel in Tajikistan. An in-house application written in Java can be
used by any computer accessing the network. Until very recently, each application
would need to be written once for each system. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, there are many reasons, according to Morgan Stanley's Kennedy,
&quot;to think that applications written in Java will be better than the
standard alternatives&quot;. For one thing, they're invisible: the user
still has only the point-and-click Web browser interface to learn. For another,
applications (and their updates and patches) don't need to be installed
on every machine in the company: they just sit on a single Web repository
until needed. <BR>
<BR>
This is the major benefit of the internet for finance professionals: ironically
enough, it actually reduces information overload. It marks a move from a
&quot;just-in-case&quot; to a &quot;just-in-time&quot; approach to information
storage. No longer is it necessary for everybody who might need a piece
of information to have a copy of it. Instead of massive duplication of information
in both paper and electronic form, internet servers can provide users with
the most up-to-date version of any document they want, when they want it,
whatever machine they are working on, wherever they are in the world. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bandwidth is the thing</B> <BR>
<BR>
The standard &quot;look and feel&quot; of a Web browser and its ability
to work on any old machine is a big step on from standard client/server
systems. The user no longer needs to understand a multitude of applications
and certainly doesn't need to have a copy of every application he's likely
to use installed on his machine. (In a recent survey, 56% of managers said
that this sort of ease of use was the single most critical factor for a
corporate information system.) Indeed, the user doesn't even need a pc at
all: a standard $500 &quot;network computer&quot; of the sort announced
last month by Oracle, equipped with a very basic chip and internet connection,
should suffice. Information professionals - which include bankers -
no longer aspire to having faster chips than the next man: the important
thing today is bigger bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, an internet or intranet (the new generation of internal network)
system is much more versatile than an old-style centralized information
database and interface. Instead of relying on programmers to create data
entry and reporting programs, information can be collated, published and
managed at source. In short, control of information no longer resides in
one place. <BR>
<BR>
Large, centralized information providers such as Reuters, Bloomberg and
Knight-Ridder are basically editors and compilers of information they are
paid both to receive and to distribute. The internet shows one way of cutting
out the middleman altogether and &quot;disintermediation&quot; is becoming
as important a word in it as it is in banking. <BR>
<BR>
The number of &quot;hits&quot; (downloaded files) made by Morgan Stanley's
9,500 employees on its intranet has increased from nothing three years ago
to 1.6 million per week now, with no sign of slowing down. These numbers
dwarf the 10,000 to 20,000 hits per day received by Morgan Stanley's Web
site - the information available to the rest of us - impressive
though that number is. What is really happening is that the growth of intranets
in banks is providing the demand for which external sites are forming part
of the supply. As the former grows so will the latter (including among them
<I>Euromoney</I>'s own which goes on line this month -- see page 234) and
in the process large parts of the information industry will be restructured.
<BR>
<BR>
The Morgan Stanley Web site is popular for two reasons: it provides high-quality
information unavailable elsewhere and it updates it regularly (daily, in
most instances). Its site includes the Global Economic Forum, with analyses
of global economic trends, as well as equity analysis for clients. <BR>
<BR>
But although there are one or two Web sites of interest to many financial
professionals, the World Wide Web is at heart the apotheosis of narrowcasting:
the information tends to be so fine-grained that only a small number of
people access any particular page. <BR>
<BR>
The internet started life at the us Department of Defense's Advanced Research
Projects Agency. Most internet backbones - the fibre-optic networks
that the internet runs over - were built by western governments. The
World Wide Web was developed at the <I>Conseil Europ&eacute;en pour la Recherche
Nucl&eacute;aire</I> (cern). Today's most popular Web browsers are more
or less the same as those created at the University of Illinois's National
Center for Supercomputing Applications. <BR>
<BR>
Users of the internet are therefore leveraging large amounts of public money.
But increasingly nowadays, the information access from the internet is no
longer free.<B> </B>The death knell of the publicly-funded internet was
sounded in April 1995, when America's National Science Foundation announced
that it would no longer fund the nsfNet t1 backbone. It passed the responsibility
for infrastructure maintenance to six commercial companies - psiNet,
uuNet, ans/aol, Sprint, mci and agis-Net99. These companies now control
the internet's fibre-optic motorways. <BR>
<BR>
The first users to notice the introduction of charges were those wanting
to register a domain name (the identifier which comes after the &quot;@&quot;
in an e-mail address). But then regular Web surfers began to notice a very
large increase in corporate advertising on popular sites and an explosion
in the number of sites requiring registration and/or a subscription fee.
<BR>
<BR>
Two years ago it would have been unthinkable for the <I>Banking and Finance
</I>it<I> Informer</I> newsletter, distributed over the internet, to charge
its current annual subscription of $300 for the service. Already many popular
sites, such as the <I>Financial Times</I> and <I>HotWired</I>, require registration
before they can be accessed. Registration usually adds no value for the
user (although &quot;Daily Me&quot;-style personalized pages are becoming
more common), but gives the provider valuable demographic information. <BR>
<BR>
Salomon Brothers now charges for information it makes available on the World
Wide Web, but it is unlikely that the internet will be a significant source
of revenue for investment banks in the foreseeable future. &quot;There's
not a great number of opportunities to make money, but there is a great
number of opportunities to serve clients better,&quot; says Philip Harrison,
head of Morgan Stanley's European internet activities. Clients who use the
bank's Web site are much more likely to give that bank valuable mandates.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Highly confidential</B> <BR>
<BR>
Banks were slow to pick up on the availability of the free technology, largely
because they tend not to believe in the &quot;free lunch&quot;. Another
reason was security: open networks are always less safe than closed ones.
The computing industry was happy to co-operate in this: although suppliers
paid lip service to open networks, they wanted everybody to use <I>their</I>
protocol. It took disinterested academics to create truly open protocols
for use on the internet. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, however, banks have been embracing internet technology with all
the zeal of the newly-converted. In a recent survey for Mercury Communications,
92% of financial institutions in London and 88% in New York said they were
either using or planning to use the internet. For some, this involves little
more than a dial-up account with a retail internet service provider. For
others, it forms the backbone of their entire corporate it system. And when
City Research Associates polled City financial institutions last month,
62% said, unprompted, that the internet would play a very significant role
in their future. <BR>
<BR>
Banks, however, are not entirely happy. Some have yet to be convinced of
the solidity of internet technology. &quot;We don't find the software reliable,&quot;
says Mukarram Sattar, head of operations, technology and software at Citibank
in London. <BR>
<BR>
Other banks use Lotus Notes for internal communication and make it deliberately
difficult for employees to send external e-mails. (Lotus Notes can do more
things than e-mail or most intranets, but just as with the pc, this is not
always a good thing.) Much internal communication in a bank is highly confidential
and e-mail is the perfect communication tool. Bankers spend a lot of time
on the telephone, but ringing up a colleague is not always an easy procedure:
there can be very few financial professionals without a deep-seated loathing
for voice mail. An e-mail, by contrast, appears as soon as it is sent, can
include detailed data and lasts in unambiguous written form for as long
as it is needed. What's more, it can be sent to a number of people simultaneously.
<BR>
<BR>
And this is where the problem lies. A desktop e-mail application can send
highly confidential data from Fred@jpMorgan to Joe@Salomons just as easily
as it can to Fred's colleague John in the office next-door. Faxes have been
arriving where they weren't intended to go for many years now, and many
cyber-denizens have received e-mails not meant for them. <BR>
<BR>
There is encryption technology, of course. Morgan Stanley has an encryption
program for sending confidential information outside the company that is
so powerful it needed to obtain a munitions licence from the us government
before being allowed to use it. But widespread use of such technology <I>within</I>
a company is enormously wasteful of bandwidth and is rarely used. <BR>
<BR>
Certainly, &quot;you're not going to route internal communications via the
internet until capacity and encryption techniques improve&quot;, as Morgan
Stanley's Harrison says. In other words, hackers aren't going to be able
to intercept your internal mail en route. But Harrison is less convincing
when he says that external people won't receive confidential information
by mistake because their e-mail addresses require a domain name. (For example,
Jack at Morgan Stanley can send an e-mail to Gary at Morgan Stanley just
by typing &quot;Gary&quot;; to send it to Fred, he needs to type in &quot;Fred@JPMorgan.com&quot;.)
The fact is that no e-mail program requires the full e-mail address of the
recipient to be typed in each time. And by the time Jack notices that one
of his recipients ought not to have been on the list, it's too late. <BR>
<BR>
Another common worry about providing all employees with internet access
is that they will waste valuable time aimlessly surfing. It's certainly
easy, even for a surfer with the best of intentions, to get sidetracked
or &quot;caught in the Web&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Policing surfers</B> <BR>
<BR>
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the amount of wasted company time is quite
high for the first couple of weeks that an employee is connected, but rapidly
levels off thereafter. Still, says Harrison, &quot;we need to be pro-active
about policing it&quot;. Morgan Stanley employees, for instance, cannot
visit the most popular Web site on the internet: that of <I>Playboy</I>
magazine. Pro-active maybe, but not Draconian. After Morgan Stanley blocked
access to the espn television sports network's site after noticing particularly
high usage of it, it received a barrage of complaints from salespeople and
traders. Apparently, many would use the sports results as a reason to phone
clients: &quot;Haven't the Bulls done great? Oh, and while I'm here, do
you think I could interest you in a Kingdom of Sweden 10-year at eight under?&quot;
Access was soon restored. <BR>
<BR>
Paul Lindner, one of the architects of Gopherspace - the briefly-popular
precursor to the World Wide Web - has said that &quot;distributed computing
is like driving a wagon pulled by a thousand chickens&quot;. The act of
harnessing these chickens is not an easy one, and banks are now competing
with the likes of Netscape, Microsoft and ibm for the computer geniuses
who can do it well. They don't come cheap. (Conversely, technology companies
are hiring bankers in an attempt to get lucrative hardware and software
contracts. In the City Research Associates poll, 79% of financial institutions
spending more than &#163;10 million per year on it said that external it
suppliers were not sensitive to their business requirements.) <BR>
<BR>
The rise of the internet marks the democratization of it. Previously, it
took mind-boggling amounts of money to exploit state of the art technology
fully - the largest investment banks each spend upwards of $500 million
annually on it. Now, anyone with a pc can join this information elite. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the last four years, the investor base for Brady bonds has broadened
significantly from one that was almost completely dominated by professional
traders to one with a significant proportion of retail investors,&quot;
says the introduction to one new site on the Web. &quot;Until BradyNet started
publishing Brady bond information, technology had not kept pace with that
very important demographic sectoral change and virtually no new information
channel had opened to improve market transparency for those investors.&quot;
In this respect BradyNet is typical of many new sites. <BR>
<BR>
Just as banks are cutting out the middlemen in many areas, their role as
middlemen is also changing. Banks have made money by providing bond and
equity prices and analysis to small and medium-sized investors. And they
have made even more by providing, say, risk analysis for the same clients.
<BR>
<BR>
Now small technology companies, such as Palo Alto-based Integral, are offering
companies an alternative way of managing derivatives, and getting advice
and pricing. It makes use of jp Morgan's RiskMetrics data which is freely
available on the internet and then offers, according to the company, &quot;objective
accurate pricing and Value-At-Risk (var) exposure analysis for virtually
any type of derivative or hedge instrument. Portfolios can be analyzed for
var, current mark-to-market and other customized reports. Reports can be
run in real time or processed for overnight delivery anywhere in the world
via e-mail or fax.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are targeting corporates who will spend $30,000 to $50,000 a year
on RiskNet,&quot; says Raj Patel, Integral's managing director in London.
&quot;Typically, a bank rings up a corporate and says it should do a swap.
The bank then transacts that swap with that corporate. We can provide a
second opinion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Patel would like to keep banks happy too: for about $3 million a year, he'll
let them outsource their risk management advice operations and provide software
for their corporate clients, with built-in profit margins, using whatever
model they'd like<B>.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Integral can take heart from the City Research poll: 79% of financial institutions
spending more than &#163;10 million per year on it said that they would
increase their spending on external packages over the next three to five
years. <BR>
<BR>
On balance, the internet must be a good thing for banks. It can revolutionize
both their internal and external communications. It makes technological
integration after a merger a much less painful process. It provides opportunities
for outsourcing much expensive technological legwork to companies such as
Integral or The Bankers Network. And it brings them closer to clients. But
whatever privileged position banks had in the old information culture is
eroding fast. <BR>
<BR>
The Mercury Communications poll came up with another very interesting result.
When asked what the most important element of a business was today, financial
professionals in Tokyo, Paris and Frankfurt voted two-to-one in favour of
human resources over technology. In London, however, technology won by 41%
against 31%, and in New York the ratio was 31% to 11% in favour of the computer.
It would seem that, in the world's biggest markets, a bad employee with
good tools can do more than a good employee with bad tools. And the internet
is now the world's most powerful enabling tool. <BR>
<BR>
The internet is here to stay and will grow in importance at its present
exponential rate for the foreseeable future. Already, Wells Fargo offers
full retail banking services over the internet. It is only a matter of time
until share trading joins in too. Eurobond traders are probably safe: big
deals need the personal touch. There will also be an explosion in the number
of bankers telecommuting: there is little reason for dealers, say, to work
in expensive city centre offices. <BR>
<BR>
Telecommunication companies ought to be worried: the technology already
exists for telephone calls to be made at zero marginal cost over the internet;
with the next jump in bandwidth, this could become commonplace. After that
comes speech recognition and television-quality real-time video and voice
applications. And after that, we might finally see the first virtual banks.

<H2>Our new web site: http://www.emwl.com </H2>
In June, <I>Euromoney</I> and <I>World Link</I> magazine are launching their
internet site on the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
The entire editorial content of both magazines plus selections from other
<I>Euromoney</I> titles will be accessible, along with league tables, surveys
and polls. <BR>
<BR>
Major features of the site are the interactive discussion forums, direct
links to the editors of the magazines and virtual round table debates addressing
major issues in global business and finance. Visitors to the site can add
their comments directly to an ongoing discussion, or suggest further topics
and start a new one. <BR>
<BR>
The content is divided both geographically and by product. Visitors to the
site can browse via the world map, select either a region or country of
their choice, and read articles listed on those pages. Alternatively, they
can select a category of interest (government bonds, for example, or foreign
exchange, banking technology, derivatives etc) and find relevant articles
presented there. <BR>
<BR>
All material on the site is indexed to our search engine, providing useful
and relevant search results tailor-made to the user's requirements. With
links to other sites of relevance, we provide a comprehensive list of high-quality
information which cuts down time spent on more general searches across the
internet. <BR>
<BR>
<I>emwl Internet </I>is not an electronic version of the printed magazines.
Although the content of both magazines is available on the site, there are
also capital markets league tables from Euromoney's proprietary databases
Bondware and Loanware, the interactive discussion forums and debates, and
dates of forthcoming industry summits, conferences and seminars. It's a
brand-new product for a brand-new medium. For more information contact Penny

<H3>CONSULTANTS</H3>
<H2>The lowdown on McKinsey </H2>
<H4>Senior executives tremble when McKinsey and Co comes in to examine a
bank - its consultants' fixation with the bottom line is legendary.
But is there as much myth as substance to the reputation? Michelle Celarier
examines the performance of those high-flyers who've left the consultancy
to occupy top positions in banking and the McKinsey philosophy they bring
with them. </H4>
Like many partners at elite consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co, George Feiger
was offered a prominent position at a financial institution he had once
advised - in his case, newly-created SBC Warburg. Feiger, say insiders,
had been instrumental in providing the conceptual framework that gave Swiss
Bank executives the courage last year to make a successful bid for Warburg.
It was thus no big surprise when the man who had been the brains behind
the operation was asked to join the firm to help integrate the two institutions.
<BR>
<BR>
But controversy has dogged the tactics of 36-year-old Australian-born Feiger,
who heads investment banking. Former Warburg bankers have heavily criticized
his introduction of a product-led approach at the expense of a traditional
corporate advisory one, saying it has led to a downgrading of client relationships.
One former director who left says that, under Feiger's direction, bankers
had to give up long-term relationships and were put in the awkward position
of advising companies which were competitors. Moreover, each client was
given revenue targets and bankers were told they'd better meet them. &quot;It
isn't very far from this to a confrontational situation with a client if
you're desperate to produce revenues - even if it's not in the client's
best interest,&quot; he explains. Among the severe repercussions of this
product-led approach was the loss of some high-profile clients, such as
the Halifax Building Society. <BR>
<BR>
Former associates at McKinsey, where Feiger led wholesale banking operations
for Europe out of London, consider him an extremely talented, dynamic individual.
But the former Warburg bankers see a different side. &quot;He isn't easy
to communicate with,&quot; says one SBC Warburg banker, who adds that he
tried to convince Feiger that his approach was wrongheaded. &quot;I always
felt we weren't really talking the same language. He'd already made up his
mind what he wanted to do and was extremely sure of his own rightness.&quot;
Now, Feiger is said to be &quot;rethinking&quot; his blueprint for re-shaping
Warburg's investment banking unit which, insiders readily acknowledge, was
in some disarray before he arrived. Feiger declined to be interviewed. &quot;He
doesn't like the press,&quot; says an SBC Warburg spokesperson. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the alleged flaws in Feiger's approach - &quot;cold&quot;
and &quot;insincere&quot; are two charges laid at his door - they attract
so much attention precisely because of his association with McKinsey, the
premier US-based consultancy which has a revered - and often feared
- status in boardrooms everywhere. The intellectual giants at McKinsey
are quick to size up trends, from deregulation to globalization, and to
offer hard-headed corporate solutions designed to produce higher profitability
in a changing world. Its influence through a vast network of former partners
in positions of economic and political power around the globe - the
McKinsey mafia, as it is often referred to - makes whatever the company
thinks or does significant. It also gives it an aura of infallibility. &quot;The
main reason people hire McKinsey is the name,&quot; says Tom Rodenhauser,
the editor of <I>Consultants News</I>, which tracks the industry. &quot;Just
bringing in McKinsey is enough to make a lot of people quake.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There is little doubt that the world of finance has been ripe for McKinsey's
advice. Over the past 15 years the stupendous growth of Wall Street firms,
as well as US, Asian and European banks, into sprawling financial institutions
with vast product lines and far-flung geographic commitments has put many
managements at sea. Many of the leaders came up through the ranks of trading,
brokerage sales or deal-making: they had little or no experience of managing
huge, complex organizations. As a result, &quot;McKinsey's role has increased
dramatically,&quot; says one former partner, now in a senior position at
a major Wall Street firm. But even McKinsey partners now acknowledge the
firm is struggling to stay on top of a rapidly changing environment. And,
as the Warburg controversy perhaps best illustrates, questions remain whether
McKinsey's theoretical approach and its by-the-numbers solutions have been
the right ones - or if innovation, creativity and relationships have
suffered in the process. <BR>
<BR>
The secrecy that shrouds the work which McKinsey performs for its clients
means that one of the few ways to see its advice in action is in the companies
which have hired its partners on to their staff - usually after engaging
the consultancy to help their institutions through crises. Feiger's is only
the latest in a long line of such hirings. Others include John Cecil, chief
administrative officer at Lehman Brothers; Steven Green, chairman of HSBC
Capital Markets; Lukas M&uuml;hlemann, chairman of Swiss Re; and Phil Purcell,
chairman and CEO of Dean Witter Discover. Another former McKinsey high-flyer
in a key executive position is Goldman Sachs partner Larry Linden, who was
first taken on as a consultant to work out back-office problems impeding
Japanese derivatives trading and then was asked to remain to run the bank's
complex systems. <BR>
<BR>
Feiger's appointment is also the most controversial, partly because he is
not in a strictly administrative role but heads a high-profile unit full
of prima donnas. Many other McKinseyites-cum-executives have been painted
in a more favourable light - especially by investors elated by their
fastidious approach to the bottom line. Not all appear to be as lacking
in people skills as Feiger, either. <BR>
<BR>
HSBC's Green was brought in to reorganize the Hongkong Bank's treasury department
in the mid-1980s. Still group treasurer, he now also heads the merged capital
markets unit. Green gets high marks from subordinates as well as competitors.
&quot;He's a normal sort of bloke who is always extremely supportive and
enjoys being involved both with marketing and with customers,&quot; says
Richard Tickner, managing director of global capital markets at HSBC. In
addition, he says, Green has a great analytical strength that allows him
to focus &quot;on the important problems deeply and quickly, and come up
with a pragmatic solution to what seems like a very complex issue&quot;.
Although Tickner says he does not know if this attribute stems from Green's
consultancy background, the description bears an uncanny resemblance to
the McKinsey strong suit. <BR>
<BR>
Since the 1980s McKinsey has made something of a speciality out of consulting
to investment banks post-merger. In such con-flict-ridden environments,
its consultants not infrequently have been regarded as the only individuals
whom top management could trust. That was certainly the case with Lehman's
Cecil, a former McKinsey senior partner. One of McKinsey's many Harvard
MBAs, he was for years a consultant to Lehman Brothers when it was still
owned by American Express. Cecil was present at the meeting of Lehman top
executives Richard Fuld and Christopher Petit with American Express CEO
Harvey Golub (another ex-McKinseyite) when he told them early in 1994 that
he'd decided to spin off Lehman. Former Lehman executives say that Fuld
and Petit's bitter battle for control had left them with few people they
could trust, while facing new-found responsibilities far beyond their narrow
capital markets expertise. The two turned quickly to the 39-year-old Cecil
and asked him to join their organization. (McKinsey also convinced Nippon
Life Insurance to invest in Lehman at the same time.) <BR>
<BR>
<B>McKinsey's batting average</B> <BR>
<BR>
Cecil is now considered the main strategist inside the firm, although he
has taken such a low public profile that many high-ranking employees do
not know who he is. He is credited with an ambitious cost-cutting programme
that has put Lehman back on track with a McKinsey-like analysis of the profitability
of various business units and an obsessive concern for detail, such as prohibiting
the purchase of too many expensive brass lamps in executive offices. Even
the flowers in the reception area are fake these days. <BR>
<BR>
But Cecil's duties are much grander than these small cost-cutting exercises.
&quot;He has the dual challenge of not just doing performance management
but redesigning strategy,&quot; says McKinsey partner Marshall Lux, who
co-heads the consultancy's 150-member US investment banking and wholesale
financial services practice. &quot;He's smart as hell and the guy for this
job.&quot; (Lehman's announcement that president Petit would relinquish
his chief operating officer title to devote his time to wooing clients is
giving Cecil more day-to-day responsibilities.) <BR>
<BR>
Cecil's successes have been mixed. Even he admits that the restructuring
has been so time-consuming that the firm has not been able to build new,
potentially profitable businesses as quickly as it would have liked. &quot;Some
things are hitting for our competitors that are still not developed for
us,&quot; he says. Lehman has designs on being one of the global survivors,
but many question its ability to bring something unique to the table. Analysts
and competitors agree that although Cecil has been unable to breathe new
life into an organization whose revenue base has been stagnant even in a
bull market, neither has anyone else. <BR>
<BR>
The decision of former McKinsey practitioner Harvey Golub to sell the Shearson
retail component is blamed by many for hurting Lehman's turnaround. Competitors
note that prior to the split, for example, Lehman had quite a reputation
in the preferred stock market which it had created and sold to its retail
client base. But the bank missed out on the explosion of corporate issuance
that happened after the shedding of the retail business, and the new Lehman
has yet to come up with a clever idea to replace it. <BR>
<BR>
In the late 1980s retail did not look as exciting as the wholesale side
of the business. But today McKinsey director and senior partner Lowell Bryan
(known internally as the god-father of the consultancy's financial institutions
group owing to his role in its founding shortly after he joined the company
in 1975), considers retail business one of the few bright spots on the horizon,
in particular fund management. Equity is another. Fixed-income, however,
has become so commoditized by the twin forces of globalization and technology,
argues Bryan, that it's hardly worth the effort. <BR>
<BR>
While Lehman concentrated on institutional business, particularly on the
then-profitable fixed-income, former McKinsey partner Phil Purcell had the
foresight - or luck - to take the opposite approach. Purcell decided
to move out of the glamour businesses of investment banking and proprietary
trading when he took over Dean Witter - then a brokerage unit of Sears
- in a move that was highly controversial at the time. &quot;In hindsight
it turned out to be an excellent move for them,&quot; says James Hanbury,
a brokerage analyst at Schroder Wertheim, who gives the former McKinsey
partner high marks for turning the firm into a mutual fund marketing organization
with a healthy credit card component. &quot;He strikes me as extremely solid.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But like many of the institutions it serves, McKinsey is not always able
to see too far into the future. &quot;This is an industry that's changing,&quot;
says partner Jim Rosenthal, the other co-head (with Lux) of the US investment
banking practice. &quot;Could any consultant to this industry have perfect
prediction ability? No one could.&quot; McKinsey's batting average is pretty
high, however, with both partners and competitors rating the successes higher
than 50%. <BR>
<BR>
Nowhere is benefit of hindsight more poignant than at Swiss Re, where Lukas
M&uuml;hlemann took over in 1994. Swiss Re's profitability was trailing
competitors and one of M&uuml;hlemann's first actions was to sell its direct
insurance unit at the handsome price of Swfr5.5 billion and focus solely
on the core re-insurance business. According to UBS insurance analyst Thomas
Kalbermatten, the direct insurance division had been built up by another
former McKinsey consultant, Werner Seifert, who argued it would provide
diversification for the much more volatile re-insurance business. &quot;M&uuml;hlemann
undid what the previous McKinsey person had done,&quot; muses Kalbermatten.
(Seifert had left to head the German Stock Exchange in Frankfurt before
M&uuml;hlemann came on board.) <BR>
<BR>
Of M&uuml;hlemann, the UBS analyst says: &quot;He sees the big picture,
definitely.&quot; The former McKinsey partner had been considered a top
contender to succeed managing director Fred Gluck, who retired from the
consultancy in 1994, but the position went instead to Indian-born McKinsey
careerist Rajat Gupta. <BR>
<BR>
M&uuml;hlemann has taken a very un-Swiss, shareholder-friendly approach
to running Swiss Re. Perhaps this is due to his US education: he too is
a Harvard MBA. Yet Kalbermatten questions whether the huge advances made
by Swiss Re will be sustainable. &quot;I do have doubts whether the next
couple of years will be as good as the last,&quot; he says, noting that
price deregulation in Europe is just gearing up. <BR>
<BR>
Competitors love to typecast McKinseyites as arrogant and elitist. &quot;Whenever
I've met them I've found there's a huge built-in McKinsey ego,&quot; says
one of the strategic consultants at Boston-based Bain &amp; Co. Self-confident
is how McKinseyites describe themselves. Such an attitude may make it difficult
for McKinsey to admit that it has ever been at fault with its advice or
approach, but as the world of finance changes so too do the solutions for
its problems. That keeps McKinsey employed. <BR>
<BR>
During the 1980s, for example, McKinsey was advising financial institutions
expanding their global reach to organize in matrix fashion, which often
meant individuals had two reporting lines: for instance, one for product
and one for geography. But other consultants say matrix organizations created
too many power struggles and began to give way early in this decade to organization
along product lines. The matrix organization, McKinsey's Bryan now says,
was always seen as &quot;transitional&quot;. Today's vogue word is &quot;networks&quot;.
This system has flattened the organizational structure and given a few key
individuals much more power. Institutions must still determine whether clients,
products or geography will be the primary &quot;axis&quot; around which
the networks will turn. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Product versus client focus</B> <BR>
<BR>
Now product orientation is falling into disfavour. In theory, at least,
globalization tends to lend itself to organizing around products sold worldwide
for maximum profitability. Yet technology and the globalization that quickly
erases arbitrage possibilities have shortened product lifecycles. The derivatives
debacles of 1994, followed by their numerous lawsuits, further illustrate
the near-sightedness of a rigid adherence to managing by product. <BR>
<BR>
Such realities have made sources close to SBC Warburg argue that former
McKinsey partner Feiger was behind the times in his approach. A few top
organizations, notably Morgan Stanley, have steered the business back to
clients, after believing they veered too far in the other direction. &quot;The
axis that is getting more important is the client axis,&quot; says Bryan,
who admits it is a tough problem for McKinsey clients as there is an inherent
con-flict between &quot;maximizing profits&quot; and &quot;total client
service&quot;. &quot;People are making progress, but it's a continual issue,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
McKinsey has brought much-needed rational thinking to the business. But
its partners come close to admitting that the technological and geo-political
changes sweeping through the industry are outdating its advice as quickly
as it is given. Partners acknowledge they are struggling to help their clients
fix such perplexing problems as unprofitable geo-graphic expansion and uneconomic
compensation levels. They are also suggesting how clients can cope with
the rapid commoditization of many product lines and conflicting management
imperatives. <BR>
<BR>
Bryan has embarked on a new research project to explore how the banks can
adapt to this new, ruthless global environment. &quot;The biggest challenge
to the industry is that 50 players are all trying to have the same global
position when there's not room for more than eight or 10,&quot; he says.
&quot;Everyone adopts similar strategies and you get these wars of attrition.&quot;
Some industry executives joke that this is because everyone has hired McKinsey,
though the company insists it has not recommended a global strategy for
everyone. <BR>
<BR>
But McKinsey clearly is looking for new approaches. Acting as though the
company itself were the client, Bryan is using the much-ballyhooed McKinsey
method, a hypothesis-driven approach which reaches conclusions and solutions
based on a dispassionate analysis of the facts. It may seem ironic, but
the primary hypothesis of Bryan's new research is that many notions of how
institutions develop strategies and build organizations have been made obsolete
by global expansion and technology. So much for all the millions of dollars
banks have doled out to McKinsey for those &quot;notions&quot; in recent
years. <BR>
<BR>
The McKinsey methodology is highly praised by its practitioners. Lux says
the hypothesis approach allows for &quot;Socratic debate&quot; among members
of McKinsey teams as they test it. And he says it tends to focus the discussion
on issues that matter: &quot;'So what?' is a classic McKinsey question,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
It may sound scientific, clever and precise but critics claim that the method
can also lead to too narrow a focus - that it is so abstract and numbers-orientated
that it can miss the human dimensions of business success. Former consultant
Richard Radkowski is a principal with the venture capital firm New Paradigm
Ventures of Connecticut, which has competed against McKinsey. He claims
that by following a series of quick steps to solve a problem, the McKinsey
solutions all fit into a preconceived notion, resulting in a &quot;canned
approach&quot; lacking insight and creativity. Such unquantifiables as innovation
and good old-fashioned client hand-holding that drive the best of the investment
banking behemoths can fall by the wayside. <BR>
<BR>
Some former partners go so far as to say that the results sometimes can
be &quot;a little too theoretical&quot;, making them difficult or too expensive
to implement. But McKinsey defends its approach. Partners note the importance
of bringing rigorous profit analysis to a business that has long been shrouded
in mystique. &quot;I believe numbers are very important in this business,&quot;
says Rosenthal. &quot;The mystery around the profitability often obscures
the reality of any specific line of business.&quot; In its most simplistic
terms, the McKinsey business analysis attempts to tell clients which products
and markets make money and why. <BR>
<BR>
Complaints are viewed as sour grapes by some McKinseyites. There's always
tremendous resistance when a McKinsey team goes in and &quot;takes a business
apart piece by piece and puts it together again&quot;, says former partner
Larry Skilling, who founded and now heads Enron Capital Trading, a Texas-based
company that grew out of mergers between McKinsey clients Internorth and
Houston National Gas, and which has become a wholesale banking operation
of sorts within the energy business. It is also a company whose profits
have sky-rocketed in recent years, he notes. Skilling says that as organizations
get big and complex, they tend to lose their way - and that's where
McKinsey comes in. &quot;People don't like change and you can't afford McKinsey
unless you need them to help you change significantly.&quot; A McKinsey
project can run easily into millions of dollars. <BR>
<BR>
The company that pioneered the consulting industry was started in 1926 by
Chicago accounting professor James Oscar McKinsey who was soon joined in
the business by a Harvard law graduate, Marvin Bower. Bower is considered
the company's spiritual father for his role in steering it toward a behind-the-scenes
influence in the highest corporate reaches and running it somewhat like
a law partnership, despite its being incorporated. Nowadays, McKinsey &amp;
Co is considered the largest strategic consultant in the world, with revenues
totalling $1.5 billion in 1994, 60% of it earned outside the United States,
according to estimates by <I>Consultants News</I>. <BR>
<BR>
Unlike some competitors, McKinsey does not base fees on performance or on
any quantifiable results. And despite being widely considered as the most
expensive consultant in the field, it does not appear to be losing ground.
&quot;Clients work with us for long periods of time because they believe
they get value,&quot; says Bryan. &quot;They're not just doing it because
it is fashionable.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
McKinsey, which has been growing at about 15% annually, now has 67 offices
in 36 countries. It hires the best and the brightest, competing with Wall
Street for Harvard MBAs, as well as placing an emphasis on physics and mathematics
majors from top universities in the United States and abroad - it likes
the problem-solving abilities of such abstract thinkers. Consultants -
there are 3,156 - are known for their gruelling hours of work and for
enduring constant travel. They are also the most productive in the business,
bringing in more than $475,000 each a year. <BR>
<BR>
The tradition of hiring Harvard business school graduates and sending teams
of them to dispense advice to chief executive officers dates from the 1950s.
&quot;Other consultants hired old men who dispensed wisdom; we decided to
hire young people and train them how to be problem solvers,&quot; says partner
Bill Mattasoni. The approach has always been controversial. Even today,
one of the most damning criticisms that any former McKinsey partner seems
willing to go on record with is that the youthful lack of experience of
its employees sometimes can lead to naive views. But that doesn't stop them.
<BR>
<BR>
If a McKinsey employee fails to make partner in five years, he is asked
to move on. &quot;It's an up-or-out mentality,&quot; says one former employee
now working on Wall Street. Yet this fiercely competitive environment conversely
seems to breed a bonding spirit and those who leave speak warmly of the
company, offering such statements as: &quot;I'm a friend of McKinsey.&quot;
Says former partner Skilling: &quot;It really is a class act. They know
how to get the best out of people. You never get bored.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Informal and formal alumni activities only expand McKinsey's reach into
the world at large. Former McKinsey partners can be found in the executive
suites of such non-financial companies as IBM, Sotheby's, Westinghouse Electric,
Lotus Development, Inchcape, Asda, Groupe Bull and even in the UK government
- all places where, unsurprisingly, they often hire their former McKinsey
colleagues on consulting projects. As a result, McKinsey never needs to
advertise or engage in marketing in the conventional sense. <BR>
<BR>
While the financial industry does not make up a dominant portion of its
practice, McKinsey's influence in the realm of finance is unparalleled.
As the company does not talk about its clients, it is hard to know precisely
how deep is its penetration of the industry. Bryan says, somewhat sheepishly,
that &quot;it's not 100%&quot;. But some previous and current clients include
Merrill Lynch, American Express (when it owned Shearson Lehman Brothers),
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Dean Witter,
Citicorp, CS First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Banque Indosuez, Nippon Life Insurance,
Sumitomo Bank - even the Bank of England. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, McKinsey has been a big-picture/strategy type of consultancy,
but Bryan notes that the company is devoting more time to the thorny problem
of compensation. &quot;American companies are tired of being raided because
it bids up the price of labour,&quot; he says. Labour problems are making
firms search for ways to build loyalty to the institution, to build partnership,
as opposed to individualism. <BR>
<BR>
One way is to offer equity participation, particularly effective if individuals
have to commit capital instead of just receiving stock options that have
no downside for the individual, but have the deleterious effect of diluting
shareholdings. Many of the boldest attempts, like Salomon's efforts to tie
its proprietary traders' earnings to overall performance, have not fared
too well. It is an issue that McKinsey does not claim to have figured out.
&quot;It's a continuing state-of-the-art problem,&quot; sighs Bryan. <BR>
<BR>
Expanding on the theme, partner Rosenthal says the biggest surprise in the
global financial world over the past year has been the &quot;the nature
of the participation of the European universal bank in the global capital
markets. A direction is clear, but the extent of their commitment is still
to be fully determined.&quot; Translation: the universal banks, with their
hefty capital bases, have clearly hurt the economics of the business, at
least temporarily. Since their traditional commercial banking business is
becoming even more commoditized than global investment banking, they feel
they have no choice but to try for the latter strategy. To do so, they've
opted to buy American and British know-how by hiring some of the most talented
players at such outrageous compensation packages that consultants describe
them as uneconomic. <BR>
<BR>
For the future, McKinsey's philosophical view perhaps is best expressed
in new book, <I>Market Unbound: Unleashing Global Capitalism,</I> co-authored
by Bryan and McKinsey senior engagement manager Diana Farrell. (It truly
is an old boys' network: there are few women partners.) <BR>
<BR>
The book considers the break-up of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM) during 1992-93, which it regards as a telling event: markets had overtaken
governments. Bryan and Farrell dismiss the role of the US Federal Reserve
in unhinging markets the following year as a symbol of the volatility that
occurs as governments continue to try to exert influence. <BR>
<BR>
However, the &quot;global capital revolution&quot; that they describe in
mostly glowing terms has untoward effects. Looking at the declining profitability
in the most globally-integrated markets, such as foreign exchange and fixed-income,
&quot;one of the implications of this work is that the easy profits are
over&quot;, the authors conclude. <BR>
<BR>
McKinsey has long prided itself on its work as an outside strategist for
corporations, for example, advising investment banks on why and how to go
after that equity opportunity in Malaysia. Now that the financial institutions
have stretched themselves across the globe, McKinsey's work is changing.
It is destined to be geared to &quot;helping to make the organization more
effective or eliminating drains on profitability&quot;, says Bryan. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, says his colleague Rosenthal, over the past year the firm's US
practice has been concentrating on such matters because &quot;it's becoming
clear to the industry that it's difficult to achieve attractive returns
in Europe and Asia. It's much more difficult than anticipated.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As the global investment banking industry in McKinsey's view apparently
is set for secular decline, the partners must be grateful that the firm
decided not to venture into the investment banking business, an idea that
was considered several times. Former partner Skilling, who was at McKinsey
at one such time, says it would have created potential conflicts of interest
with clients. Anyway, he believes that the work McKinsey does is more substantive.
&quot;Given the financial churning many investment banks do, I'm not sure
I'd feel real good about it when I went home at night.&quot; McKinsey, on
the other hand, &quot;has its values in the right place&quot;, he says.
&quot;You feel like you're doing God's work when you're there.&quot; That
may be so. But, to quote the proverb, the devil is in the detail.  <p>

<H3>JAPAN</H3> 
<H2>A game of catch-up </H2>
<H4>After a disastrous few years, Japanese securities houses have begun
to rediscover how to make money in international business. They are cutting
costs, building up proprietary trading operations and taking advantage of
the demand from Japanese retail investors for foreign bonds. But can they
ever catch up with their US and European rivals? Garry Evans reports </H4>
Daiwa Securities has gone through an irritating few months. When the $1
billion bond-trading loss at Daiwa Bank's New York branch became public
in October, the securities firm began to feel the repercussions too. But
the two firms are not in any way connected. In fact, Daiwa Bank used to
be a part of, and is still close to, Nomura, Daiwa Securities' greatest
rival. <BR>
<BR>
In London, Daiwa Securities' officials had to chase away cameramen from
the BBC mistakingly camped outside the firm's eye-catching building in King
William Street. One senior executive of Daiwa Securities recalls that he
received many letters from business contacts commiserating with him on the
scandal. &quot;I don't know how to respond,&quot; he laments. &quot;If I
write back, these people will be so embarrassed they'll never do business
with me again.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Such annoyances aside, Daiwa Securities has every reason to feel pleased
with its progress over the past 12 months. Profits from the London operation
reached &#163;9.4 million ($15 million) in the April-to-September half-year,
according to figures published by the <I>Nihon Keizai Shimbun</I> newspaper.
Says Alex Monnas, deputy chief executive of Daiwa Europe: &quot;Over the
past five years, we have slowly been building a portfolio of enduring businesses
in London. We haven't completed the process yet, but the development has
finally started to pay off in terms of profitability.&quot; In New York,
too, Daiwa has been more consistently profitable than the other three big
Japanese securities firms (see table). <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, all the big four firms had a decent year in international business
in 1995. Nomura and Daiwa remained in the top 10 of Eurobond lead managers.
Nomura was up two places to fourth; Daiwa rose one place to seventh. Even
Yamaichi - virtually ruled out of contention for major international
mandates a few months ago - rose to 17th place on the back of a $2
billion deal for Sweden at the beginning of December. <BR>
<BR>
The Japanese have made inroads in other areas, too. Nomura achieved a number
of breakthrough deals that suggested, almost for the first time, that it
is capable of winning major non-Japan related business. In the UK, for example,
it was part of the GRS Holding consortium that bought one of the rolling-stock
leasing companies sold by the government. Nomura provided the debt for the
deal, and will eventually securitize the lease receivables. In Vietnam,
it is financing an industrial zone in Haiphong. It monopolizes the lead
managing of bond issues by Baltic states: it brought the debut issues of
both Latvia and Lithuania in 1995, and is rumoured to be planning a Deutschmark
issue for the Estonian capital Tallinn in January. <BR>
<BR>
The securities houses' greatest successes this year, however, have come
from selling large bond issues into Japan. With bank deposit rates in Japan
little over 1%, Japanese retail investors discovered in early summer that
they could make better returns, with little extra risk, by buying sovereign
Euroyen bonds. By the autumn, investors were becoming more adventurous,
buying Eurodollar and Euro-Australian dollar paper. <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the Japanese securities houses had a bonanza on their hands. They
were able to provide the cheapest funding available in the market to many
of the world's largest borrowers. Consequently, Daiwa and Nomura jointly
led a &#165;550 billion (then worth $6.3 billion) three-tranche Euroyen
deal for Italy in May - the largest-ever Eurobond. In October, Daiwa
again brought Italy to market for $1.5 billion in dollars, reflecting the
shift in Japanese investors' preferences. In May Nomura was the first to
reintroduce Brazil to the market after January's turbulence in Latin America.
Nikko's highlight was probably a &#165;100 billion deal for Argentina in
August. <BR>
<BR>
The Japanese know this windfall won't go on for ever, but they are prepared
to enjoy it while it lasts. Says Monnas: &quot;We don't see an early end
[to retail-targeted issues]. But we are not budgeting, or basing our medium-term
strategy, on this lasting very long.&quot; Although there is no sign of
interest rates rising in Japan, redemptions in 1996 will not be as large
as last year. Redemptions of all personal assets by individuals are predicted
to total &#165;35 trillion in the first quarter and &#165;32 trillion in
the second, according to estimates by the Yamaichi Research Institute. Those
are still large figures, but well down on the &#165;50.4 trillion in the
last three months of 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, there are signs that selling Eurobonds into Japan is already getting
harder. Daiwa's Italy dollar deal saw a lot of flowback a month after placement,
as investors sold to take advantage of the capital gain they had obtained
from the sudden fall in the yen. In December, the <I>Nihon Kinyu Shimbun</I>,
an influential trade newspaper, reported that the sales staff of the securities
houses were up in arms at having to sell excessive amounts of bonds from
high-risk sovereign issuers to retail investors. The paper quoted one broker
as saying: &quot;Some individuals do not even know that the value of bonds
changes as a result of price fluctuation ... Some countermeasures must be
taken against possible trouble with individuals.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Masashi Kaneko, co-chairman of Nikko Europe, agrees that the Japan-targeted
deals have got too big. Between $200 million and $1 billion is the ideal
size, he suggests. &quot;It behoves all of us to do the right issues for
the right borrowers at the right price,&quot; he argues. <BR>
<BR>
But these are the niggles that come from success. In general, business for
the Japanese houses is in far better shape than 12 months ago. When Hitoshi
Tonomura, head of Nomura's international business, was brought back to London
by the firm in April to shake up the European operation (he had headed London
in the 1980s), he found an institution in disarray. &quot;My reaction was
that we had a lot of talented people not well organized,&quot; he recalls.
&quot;There was a lack of communication. Everything had gone wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Nomura suffered from high overheads (partly because of its palatial building
near St Paul's Cathedral), little focus and poor morale. Since then, Tonomura
has reduced staff in London from 700 to 600 (and throughout Europe from
1,500 to 1,200). He has cut fixed overhead by 16%, and begun linking pay
more closely to performance. He says there is &quot;a little bit more room
for rationalization in continental Europe&quot; where he &quot;may close
one or two offices&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
But Tonomura's most dramatic move was to pull out of market-making in French
government bonds and UK gilts (markets that his Japanese competitors are
still in). &quot;We wanted to show clear lines of focus,&quot; says Tonomura.
&quot;We got rid of businesses where we thought we couldn't exercise our
advantage. When we joined the gilt market, we thought it would be an important
way into the Eurobond market. But it turned out not to be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reassessment</B> <BR>
<BR>
The other securities houses, except Nikko, have been pruning too. At Daiwa,
Monnas says his budget last year was 12% less than in 1994 - and he
came in 2.5% under it. At Yamaichi in London, new chief executive Kenkichi
Nakajima has even been sending expatriate Japanese staff back to Tokyo.
The number of Japanese staff in London has fallen from 40 to 32 in six months.
<BR>
<BR>
But the Japanese did not react to their difficulties merely by cutting costs.
All four firms have gone through a process of reassessing their fundamental
strategies. And all four have come to roughly similar conclusions. First,
that they should not rely purely on Japan-related business, because this
has always shown a tendency to dry up just as they came to depend on it.
Second, that they should leverage off their large capital bases (even Yamaichi,
the smallest of the four, has more capital than Morgan Stanley) and do more
proprietary trading. Third, that each overseas operation needs to develop
its own local independent business lines that are autonomous of Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
The advantage of last year's upsurge of Japan-targeted bond issues is that
it will give the London operations the breathing space to build up these
other businesses. &quot;London has become the main centre for sourcing investment
products to supply to clients in Japan,&quot; argues Nikko's Kaneko. &quot;We
intend to reinvest some of the profit from that to strengthen other areas
such as bond and equity distribution in Europe and Asia. We have to build
on top of the pipeline between Europe and Japan a sustainable local business
- that happens most naturally with trading.&quot; With that aim, Nikko
recently employed Brian Berry from CS First Boston to be co-head of sales
and trading. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura has the most sophisticated trading operation of the four. A team
of asset traders led by Simon Fry - also a former CS First Boston employee
- has had some success in structuring transactions for on-sale, mainly
to banks. After one year's operation, Tonomura says Fry's team has &quot;started
to make a very good return&quot; - a view echoed by Nomura's rivals.
At Daiwa, Monnas has built up a market-directional proprietary trading operation,
but also wants eventually to develop a credit trading business on the same
lines as Nomura's. <BR>
<BR>
It is in New York, however, that proprietary trading plays the greatest
role. This is mainly because there is very little other business the Japanese
houses can do in the US: there are few underwriting opportunities, and Japanese
investors no longer buy treasury bonds in the volumes prevalent in the 1980s.
&quot;We have taken a hard look at what we should be doing in the US,&quot;
says David Sexton, vice-chairman of Yamaichi International (America). &quot;We
recognized that our most significant asset was our big capital base. You
have to use the capital aggressively for your own account.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yamaichi has followed a policy in the US of poaching teams of traders. In
1994, it brought in a four-man team from Swiss Bank Corporation with a risk-arbitrage
strategy in takeover stocks; last year it found a group from Lehman which
uses a relative-value approach across a broad spectrum of instruments. &quot;The
common thread is that these are analysis-based arbitrage strategies,&quot;
says Sexton. &quot;We are not interested in market-direction trading.&quot;
After a disastrous year in 1994, Yamaichi just returned to profit in New
York last year. <BR>
<BR>
Daiwa has also struggled to find a winning formula for its US operation.
&quot;New York is our biggest headache,&quot; admits Yoshio Maruyama, general
manager of the international investment banking department of Daiwa Securities
in Tokyo. &quot;They can't do underwriting business, so they need to find
new types of business that they can do on their own. We want to make New
York an independent house that doesn't rely on the Japanese head office.&quot;
But, he admits, &quot;we haven't yet found a business that could be the
pillar of the US operation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But it is not just in trading that Japanese houses want to build. Nomura,
in particular, has had some success in entering new investment banking businesses.
It has focused on securitization - a business that has almost no synergy
with Japan (where securitization is, in practice, prohibited). In New York,
Nomura worked with Olympia &amp; York on a securitization of the World Financial
Centre. In London, in addition to the rolling-stock lease deal, in August
it bought 1,700 pubs from brewers Courage and Grand Metropolitan for &#163;240
million with a view to securitizing the assets. <BR>
<BR>
Now that the securities houses have proved they can win big Eurobond mandates,
they want to extend their distribution capabilities beyond Japan. &quot;We
really want to sell foreign bonds overseas,&quot; says Hitoshi Ishihara,
deputy president of Yamaichi in Tokyo. &quot;London still relies too much
on the Japanese market.&quot; Nomura and Daiwa have gone furthest to overcome
that reliance on Japan. Nomura's small December Eurodollar issue for Lithuania
was sold predominantly outside Japan, for example. Daiwa also has a good
track record with placing paper from issuers such as the National Bank of
Hungary to a wide range of investors. <BR>
<BR>
These deals point to a surprising conclusion: emerging markets are becoming
the Japanese houses' strongest niche. While western corporates, for example,
see Japanese firms as second-tier players, for Asian and eastern European
borrowers, Nomura and the others, with their access to the large Japanese
investor base, look at least as prestigious as large US or European investment
banks. <BR>
<BR>
The recent spate of Japan-related deals will reinforce that positive image.
&quot;We think we've built up a good profile with issuers,&quot; says Daiwa's
Monnas. &quot;That's valuable. It opens the door to other business.&quot;
Daiwa's profile in eastern Europe helped it win a joint lead-manager role
with HSBC Markets on the privatization of Poland's Bank Gdanski last month.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite these successes, the Japanese securities houses still lag behind
their US and European competitors in many areas. The Japanese are still
nowhere in privatization. The Gdanski deal was just about the only leading
role (apart from regional lead-managerships) played by any Japanese house
in an international equity offering last year. Their derivatives expertise
is negligible. Few major western companies deal with them. They don't touch
M&amp;A (apart from the handful of Japan-related deals). In equities, they
have a steady business in selling Japanese equities to western institutions,
and a tiny business selling US and European equities in Japan - but
nothing else. <BR>
<BR>
The wisest Japanese investment bankers recognize that the fundamental problem
is management style. Japanese firms have generally failed to promote good
foreign executives, and communication between different offices is poor,
even non-existent. The Tokyo head office monopolizes decision-making, ceding
little power to London or New York. <BR>
<BR>
Tonomura at Nomura in London acknowledges the shortcomings. &quot;I'd like
to make some changes to the overall management structure,&quot; he says,
&quot;but you have to deal with cultural differences between Japan and the
rest of the world.&quot; Some things are moving on. For example, Fry now
reports to the head of bonds in Tokyo and not to Tonomura. &quot;This is
the first time at Nomura that someone has reported directly to Tokyo,&quot;
says Tonomura. The London office, he reports, now cooperates better with
New York. <BR>
<BR>
Slowly, too, senior non-Japanese executives are gaining a limited amount
of power. Max Chapman, formerly chief executive of Kidder Peabody, is co-chairman
of Nomura in New York and, by all accounts, has a certain degree of autonomy.
Nikko in London appointed Michel de Carvalho (previously of CS First Boston)
as co-chairman, alongside Kaneko, in April last year. De Carvalho says the
arrangement is working well: &quot;I have felt a total openness on all matters
- even the most sensitive. Personal chemistry is much more important
in our business than nationalities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So can the Japanese claw their way up into the top tier? Much will depend
on how Japanese investors behave. Since 1990, Japanese institutions have
been reducing their holdings of foreign securities - these are now
about 7% of assets, down from 15% five years ago. But big changes are under
way in the pensions market in Japan. New, more adventurous, fund managers
are winning business. Returns from domestic investments have been dire.
Nikko's Kaneko, for one, thinks this will spell a big increase in overseas
investment over the next five years. &quot;That's good news for the London,
New York and Asian offices of Japanese securities houses,&quot; he argues.
<BR>
<BR>
The big hope for the Japanese is that a growing institutional investment
base in Japan will allow them to win a range of international investment
banking business. &quot;It's not so different from the situation US investment
banks were in five or 10 years ago,&quot; says Kaneko. &quot;They were able
to build business in Europe on the back of their natural US investor base.
There's no reason we shouldn't be able to do the same.&quot; <BR>

<H3>OFFSHORE BANKING CENTRES</H3> 
<H2>Cleaning up offshore </H2>
<H4>There are still offshore banking centres that cater for the sleazier
end of the market, but most of these are new. The others would have us believe
they've grown respectable in their old age. Jules Stewart reports </H4>
Offshore banking is a lucrative business. It's estimated that the sector
manages some $2.1 trillion in assets, and business is growing at up to 15%
a year. Not surprisingly, then, new centres are seeking to snatch a piece
of the action from established centres such as Switzerland and the Channel
Islands, and newer - but now respectably regulated - island jurisdictions
such as the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. <BR>
<BR>
Established centres, including some European ones, have not always been
as choosy as they are now about whom they deal with - that's in part how
they built up their operations. But would-be newcomers are finding that
this time-honoured path into offshore banking has in the past few years
turned into a legal and political minefield. Western governments are cracking
down on offshore money laundering, especially of funds from drug trafficking,
which has been the primary attraction for some of the racier jurisdictions
that have set up shop in the past few years. <BR>
<BR>
According to one banker the Cayman Islands, a British dependency, started
offshore activities in the 1960s with &quot;a fairly lax&quot; regulatory
regime. Today the Caymans are the world's fifth biggest financial centre,
with over 550 registered banks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Twenty years ago a small state or island could open its doors to offshore
clients on a no-questions-asked basis,&quot; says Philip Middleton, a partner
at international accountacy firm KPMG. &quot;The way in now is to establish
a niche or specialization, such as Bermuda's captive insurance industry,
Aruba's strong Dutch connection or the double-taxation arrangement between
Mauritius and India. Even so it is tricky to get credibility.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Being open to all-comers is certainly not the way to do this. When Montserrat,
a tiny British dependency in the West Indies, began seeking out deposits,
the claim was that it was not supporting brass-plate banking operations,
since its laws required banks to be open to the public. In practice, though,
some banks were only being staffed for an hour a day - between 3am and 4am.
Some five years ago the UK treasury sent in an undercover hit squad to clean
up the operations. <BR>
<BR>
The Seychelles is another jurisdiction that has evoked the wrath of international
regulators by virtually opening its doors to anybody with $10 million to
invest who does not wish to be inconvenienced by tiresome questions about
the money's origin. The UK (which once administered the chain of tiny Indian
Ocean islands), the EU, the US and the OECD have united to condemn what
they see as an open invitation to money launderers and drug smugglers. So
far this threat has sufficed to send potential customers off in search of
other havens for hot money. <BR>
<BR>
Now-respectable centres have been quick to turn away dubious flows of money
from some of the emerging markets. In Europe this mainly means Russia and
the former Soviet Union and eastern-bloc countries, while on the other side
of the world US drug enforcement officials have had their hands full chasing
down offshore cocaine money. &quot;There is a scenario which everybody in
this business dreads,&quot; says a banker. &quot;One big money-laundering
scandal can blow your operation out of the water.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which collapsed in
July 1991, is an example of how badly things can go wrong. While the going
was good BCCI was able to pull the wool over the eyes of banking regulators.
Set up as a holding company in Luxembourg, with its principal operating
subsidiary based in Grand Cayman, BCCI obtained licences for 70 branches
worldwide. It managed to stay one step ahead of efforts to scrutinize its
operations, and by the time the Bank of England finally blew the whistle,
it had already established operations in the Isle of Man, one of the UK's
three offshore financial centres. This has already cost the Manx compensation
scheme nearly &#163;23 million in payouts to depositors. The Isle of Man's
two UK offshore competitors, Jersey and Guernsey, refused BCCI a banking
licence. <BR>
<BR>
Former Soviet party apparatchiks who have amassed their fortunes by selling
off liberated assets are trying to squirrel them away offshore, according
to bankers, who say they have found a haven in Cyprus. But they've met with
a chillier reception in places like the Channel Islands. &quot;The Channel
Islands only want the top 500 banks,&quot; says Greg Branch, a partner with
accountants Arthur Andersen in Jersey. &quot;There have been a number of
enquiries from Russian and eastern European banks that wanted to set up
business here but they were rejected.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Safe centres</B> <BR>
<BR>
Money flows from some Latin American countries are another potential nightmare
for offshore banks because of the extent of money laundering. Coutts &amp;
Co, NatWest Group's private bank, has 40 client relationship officers calling
into Latin America to develop business. &quot;Huge flows of money are coming
out of these countries and moving primarily into Caribbean island offshore
centres like the Bahamas and Cayman or into US safe havens such as Miami
and San Diego,&quot; says Coutts' chief executive David Went. &quot;But
we have a policy that requires two pairs of eyes to vet each new account.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Coutts has spread its business widely, with a physical presence that stretches
from Beverly Hills to Switzerland and Singapore. But, Went says, the bank
has stayed out of what he terms the &quot;racier&quot; centres where the
quality of regulation might be viewed as somewhat dubious. <BR>
<BR>
As for new jurisdictions, Arthur Andersen's Branch says the problem is always
going to be that people with money go where they feel safest. &quot;Quite
often these places have no deposit protection scheme so they've got to select
quality banks,&quot; he says. &quot;Investors tend to go to places with
a tradition.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For most people Switzerland - whose banking system manages more than 30%
of the $2.1 trillion in offshore assets - is synonymous with tradition.
The other leading custodians of the world's private wealth are London and
the US, with about $300 billion each, while a smaller amount is held in
Caribbean havens such as the Bahamas and the Caymans. <BR>
<BR>
Swiss private-banking trustworthiness and commitment to confidentiality
are reliable almost to the point of being staid. Expertise is a key factor
that attracts investors to Swiss banks. Ian Woodhouse of Price Waterhouse
notes that Switzerland has some 5,000 experienced fund managers and client
relationship officers. &quot;This,&quot; he says, &quot;provides a significant
advantage in terms of skilled labour for private banks and clients to draw
on.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Switzerland's rock-solid reputation and convenient location in
the heart of Europe ensure that it continues to benefit from currency and
political uncertainty in neighbouring countries. These days Swiss bankers
claim that fears of European monetary union, primarily in Germany, have
driven a substantial amount of funds into the Swiss franc. German money
to the tune of some Dm90 billion ($61 billion) has also flowed into Luxembourg
over the past three years, ever since the German authorities introduced
a withholding tax. <BR>
<BR>
There are signs, however, that Swiss banks may themselves be harbouring
fears that Brussels could exert pressure for increased disclosure and harmonization
now that Switzerland has forged closer ties with the EU through its membership
in the European Economic Area. Guernsey has become a favoured spot for Swiss
banks, which now account for more than 40% of the island's deposits. &quot;There
seems to be a concern among Swiss bankers that the EU might eventually find
a way to tighten its net around Switzerland's privileged banking status,&quot;
says a Guernsey banker. &quot;The concept is not so far-fetched as it may
sound. Luxembourg and Dublin will eventually have to fall into line, and
once the bureaucrats in Brussels have tasted blood, it's impossible to predict
where their appetite will take them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There is fierce opposition to outside interference in neighbouring Lichtenstein.
Small wonder since the system, which a local banker says is &quot;free from
any socialist tendencies&quot;, has brought the principality an average
annual income of more than Sfr42,000 ($35,000), making the 30,000 Lichtensteiners
richer than their Swiss neighbours. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't believe harmonization necessarily equates with progress,&quot;
says Heinz Nipp, chief executive officer of LGT Bank in Lichtenstein. &quot;There
is no reason why Lichtenstein should be punished for what is perceived as
a need for higher taxes in the EU. We have always had a balanced budget,
so perhaps others would do better to address their own financial problems.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Nipp insists that LGT bank is not snobbish about its customer base and will
accept customers with less than Sfr250,000 to invest, although they should
not expect red carpet treatment. A deposit of Sfr1 million ensures &quot;active&quot;
assistance from the bank, including non-discretionary advice on portfolio
investment possibilities. For truly individual service, the client should
come with at least Sfr3 million in his pocket. With that much deposited
the bank will act on a discretionary basis, with two or three of its fund
managers aware of the client's financial requirements. <BR>
<BR>
The core attraction of Lichtenstein's private banking industry, which sets
it apart from Switzerland and other offshore centres, is its long experience
in offering <I>Anstalt </I>and foundation services to the mega-rich. The
Anstalt is widely considered the ultimate in banking secrecy. Unlike in
Switzerland, where bankers are legally obliged to be aware of account holders'
identities, this is not required in Lichtenstein except where there may
be legitimate suspicion of criminal activity. A lawyer signs a due-diligence
agreement with the Lichtenstein authorities, and when both are satisfied
that the money involved is clean, the customer is referred to one of the
local banks. <BR>
<BR>
The foundation is simply a contractual agreement with no legal ownership.
It is an asset in itself and is not allowed to carry on commercial business.
The Anstalt entails setting up an offshore holding - generally for the purposes
of tax and estate planning - and has a governing body. Only the lawyer and
the Anstalt's appointed directors are aware of the beneficiaries' identity.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have a number of advantages over Switzerland,&quot; says Nipp.
&quot;People are obviously attracted by the high degree of confidentiality
we offer our customers. This has never been questioned and it is unlikely
ever to become an issue, since we are all aware that our financial services
system is vital to Lichtenstein's economic prosperity.&quot; Another attraction
is that Lichtenstein, unlike Switzerland, has no withholding tax. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lichtenstein is primarily for those clients who want an additional
element of secrecy and protection for their assets,&quot; says Price Waterhouse's
Woodhouse. &quot;It is very strong because of its proximity to Switzerland,
which is the world's leading offshore centre. The principality tends to
serve traditional wealth more than the new money coming out of places like
Latin America.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Luxembourg is still the favoured safe haven for the proverbial Belgian dentist's
surplus millions. Bankers estimate the Grand Duchy is home to some 3,000
equity, bond and currency funds and sub-funds which manage investment capital
in excess of &#163;200 billion ($308 billion). Taking into account cash
on deposit in Luxembourg's more than 200 registered banks, the total comes
to well over &#163;500 billion. By comparison, Britain's island tax havens
pale into insignificance, with only &#163;175 billion between them, according
to estimates compiled by <I>Offshore Alert</I> magazine. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1989 Dublin has been making a determined effort to give Luxembourg
a run for its offshore money. The International Financial Services Centre
(IFSC) has over the past four years built up total regulated funds to $35
billion. Dublin is now giving consideration to opening up to high net-worth
individuals to complement its existing lines of business, which are bank
treasury and syndicated loan operations, corporate treasury, captive and
offshore life assurance and fund administration and custodial operations.
IFSC officials claim that major advantages of setting up in Ireland include
lower start-up and operating costs than in Luxembourg, with the same ability
to market products into Europe with an EU passport. Dublin's 10% corporate
tax deal granted by the EU runs out to 2005, although its funds are tax-exempt
in perpetuity. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're not unduly worried about that 2005 date,&quot; says a banker
at a UK bank in Dublin. &quot;Irish corporate tax rates are now 38% and
falling. In nine years' time we believe we will end up with an EU-type coordinated
rate of 20% tax.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Global customers</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Channel Islands share a head of state with the UK but are crown dependencies
and so not part of the UK. This means they are not bound by EU banking restrictions
and tax laws. &quot;Nevertheless our money-laundering laws and confidentiality
are equivalent to that prevailing in EU countries,&quot; says Arthur Andersen's
Branch. <BR>
<BR>
The islands are attracting an increasing volume of corporate business, with
Guernsey a leading centre for captive insurance companies. &quot;As corporations
globalize they require a need to locate their treasury operations in tax-favourable
jurisdictions,&quot; says Branch. He says Jersey has attracted a number
of these banks, such as Morgan Grenfell, Kleinwort Benson and Citibank.
<BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere in Europe, Malta is one of the new centres making a pitch for
funds to manage from Italian and other central Mediterranean investors.
The Malta Financial Services Centre (MFSC) claims there are about 70 registered
trusts operating on the island, and its chief executive Andr&eacute; Camilleri
says expansion plans are being undertaken in a &quot;slow and steady fashion
to ensure that we find the right niches in a very competitive market&quot;.
The MFSC insists that Malta's legislation is tougher than the EU's on money-laundering.
The Prevention of Money Laundering Act adopted in 1994 empowers Malta's
attorney general to act on the mere suspicion of illegal activities to prevent
funds from being transferred. <BR>
<BR>
Cyprus considers itself a natural haven for Middle East money, as Arab countries
have traditionally used the island as a springboard to Europe. &quot;Arabs
feel more comfortable banking outside their home countries,&quot; says a
British banker. Offshore banking opened up in Cyprus in 1982 when the authorities
decided to compete with Bahrain. There are 30 offshore banks on the island
with total funds of slightly over &#163;1 billion. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Since the fall of the Soviet Union a lot of our business has been
Russia-related,&quot; says Mark Johnson, general manager payments systems
of the Federal Bank of the Middle East. The bank, one of 10 or so Lebanese-connected
institutions operating in Cyprus, is registered in the Cayman Islands. &quot;Even
before the USSR collapsed there was a dual-taxation arrangement.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Johnson says Cyprus's geographic location creates a bridge between the Middle
East and the former Soviet Union. &quot;We also act as a major correspondent
for smaller Russian and Ukrainian banks. There is a growing interest in
doing business with the CIS and we are involved in trade financing and private
banking.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>New business</B> <BR>
<BR>
Cyprus considers Gibraltar, Malta and the Gulf states its main competitors
for offshore business, but the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia might
provide a window of opportunity to increase its business volume. &quot;There
have always been strong connections between Cypriots and Serbs via the Orthodox
church,&quot; says a local banker. &quot;A lot of Serbs have moved their
base here and in the new environment we could see a lot of people starting
up businesses between Serbia and the west using Cyprus as a base.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Offshore centres closer to US time zones have been successful in tapping
into the flow of funds from that country. Bermuda, a British crown colony
which lies closer to Boston and New York than to the Caribbean, became an
offshore centre nearly 50 years ago and found a niche in offering tax-exempt
status to certain companies registered on the island. Today it is the world's
biggest offshore centre for captive insurance companies. It has also been
successful in attracting corporate business, especially Hong Kong companies
- including Jardine Matheson - seeking a new home before the colony reverts
to Chinese rule in 1997. &quot;As a British colony Bermuda is an ideal offshore
base for a company comfortable under the British legal system,&quot; says
a banker. <BR>
<BR>
Including the Hong Kong exodus, there are some 8,600 tax-exempt companies
incorporated in Bermuda. Of these some 1,350 are insurance firms that make
up one of the island's economic mainstays, with gross premiums of $18 billion
and more than $76 billion in assets. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;One factor that has held Bermuda back is the inability of foreign
banks to establish themselves on the island,&quot; says Arthur Andersen's
Branch. The three Bermuda institutions with banking licences are Bank of
Bermuda, Bank of Butterfield and Bermuda Commercial Bank. Bermuda's finance
minister, Grant Gibbons, says there have been discussions about allowing
more banks to apply for a full licence, but no immediate changes to the
law are envisaged. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Three years ago we allowed trust companies to set up in Bermuda and
there are now 35 in operation,&quot; he says. &quot;Some 100 foreign banks
operate through arrangements with these trust companies. There is a probability
that we will do other things, such as expand the number of secondary stock
market listings.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Gibbons says Bermuda's success as an offshore jurisdiction stems from the
quality of its infrastructure, a good representation of international accountancy
firms and a very tough stance on money laundering and other illegal activities.
&quot;We are very careful about money laundering and the background of individuals
who want to do business here,&quot; says Gibbons. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign exchange earnings from international business grew to $350 million
in the first nine months of last year compared with $328 million in the
same period in 1994. This was achieved in spite of the political uncertainty
before last August's referendum in which Bermudans voted three-to-one to
remain a British colony. &quot;We expect to see continued good growth this
year,&quot; says Gibbons. <BR>
<BR>
Offshore growth is being driven to a significant extent by what Derek Ross,
partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche, defines as &quot;club-class&quot; banking.
&quot;This typically means a customer with &#163;50,000 to &#163;200,000
available for management,&quot; he says. &quot;In Britain, the lowering
of the top rate of tax to 40% has enabled people to accumulate larger amounts
of wealth.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Much of this money has been inherited or made by entrepeneurs during the
boom years of the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Ross says these clients want
transactions of a financial engineering nature as well as speedy and accurate
execution. &quot;Some of the older and more established banks are not really
tooled-up to handle that,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
A generation ago the private banking client identikit would have thrown
up an &quot;old money&quot; European, typically a member of the landed aristocracy,
who was happy to have his personal banker simply take his money and place
it securely on deposit for him. &quot;Today we're getting a lot of people
who have inherited that wealth, along with self-made entrepeneurs who have
a more active approach and want to make that money work for them,&quot;
says Coutts' chief executive Went. <BR>
<BR>
The new breed of high net-worth individuals who have appeared in the past
10 to 15 years are looking for expert advice on how to put their money to
work. The industry has become a fee jamboree for fund managers in the world's
offshore financial centres who are taking in fees estimated at between $1.5
billion and $2 billion a year for their portfolio management services. <BR>
<BR>
The industry's rapid expansion is also fuelled by new money coming out of
Latin America, eastern Europe and east Asia. &quot;In some of these countries
there is not a long history of political stability,&quot; says Went. &quot;As
people are creating wealth and have the ability to take it offshore they
want to protect themselves from political instability.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, traditional European multi-millionaires in search of a discreet
haven for their family fortunes are not exactly a dying breed. Henry Hoare,
chairman of Messrs C Hoare &amp; Co, Britain's last family-owned private
bank, sees continuing growth potential in the market. &quot;There are more
people around with money these days,&quot; he says. &quot;The world market
for private banking is growing and we only need an infinitesimal share of
that market to keep us going.&quot; Hoare's customers are traditional high
net-worth individuals who normally count their assets in millions of dollars.
&quot;There is very little advantage for people on a straightforward salary
to bank with us,&quot; he says. <p>

<H3><B>TURKISH EQUITIES </B></H3>




<H2> <B>Time to clean things up</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Foreigners love the Turkish
stock market because it behaves like none other on earth &#173; driven by forces
only a few can understand, involving politics, hidden assets and the so-called
"chatterers". It's been referred to as one big inside trade. But there are
serious attempts to clean it up. And Global Securities, the market leader, is
under pressure to change its act. David Shirreff reports </B> </H4> 

<P> When the
Islamic/centre-right coalition banned Turkish nationals from entering the
country's 74 casinos from October 1, where did gambling addicts put their money?
On the Istanbul Stock Exchange of course. That, according to the popular daily
<I>H&uuml;rriyet</I>, explained the inexorable rise of the stock exchange index
in the final days of September.

<P> Experienced Turkish brokers immediately recognized this story for what it was
&#173; complete rubbish. Mehmet Akkent, manager at Citicorp Securities in
Istanbul, took time off to call the journalist and scold him for giving another
jerk to an already chaotic market.

<P> It's a game played by a whole raft of newspapers and magazines. Sometimes the
stories, like this one, can be harmless fun. Sometimes they make a bunch of
speculators, and perhaps the journalist, a heap of money. Sometimes they can be
damaging, like the story flown by <I>Sabah,</I> Turkey's highest-circulation
daily, on August 7.

<P> <I>Sabah</I> said that the securities watchdog, the Capital Markets Board
(CMB), was investigating two alleged irregularities: first, that a former head of
the Privatization Administration (PA) had done a sweetheart deal with one broker
in June, selling it stock in the national airline (THY) just before earnings
announcements tripled the price. It also claimed that the same PA head had given
the broker early warning of a cancelled tender for stock in Eregli Iron &amp;
Steel (Erdemir).

<P> The broker, Global Securities, issued a statement the same day, explaining
that it had bought the THY stock legitimately on behalf of two US clients. The
CMB also announced within the hour that there had been no abnormal selling of
Erdemir stock and there was nothing to investigate. Global and former
privatization chief Ugur Bayar seemed to be cleared on both counts.

<P> Unfortunately, analysts at Merrill Lynch in London had picked up the
<I>Sabah</I> story and reported the inquiry as fact in its daily fax to clients,
referring to Global only as "a leading Turkish broker". Merrill later retracted
the story, saying there had been no intent to damage Global.

<P> Turkish brokers are used to the extravagances of their own irresponsible
media. But when the game spills into the international arena, the impact can be
more severe. In the pressure-cooker world of Turkish politics, business and
finance, the multi-coloured newspapers and gossip-mongers delight in seeing
conspiracies and nepotism in every cranny of the market. They have found plenty
of mileage in the fact that Mehmet Kutman, founder and CEO of Global Securities,
is the first cousin of Mesut Y&#158;lmaz, prime minister of the last centre-right
coalition and former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of late president Turgut &Ouml;zal.
The media also exult in the fact that Kutman and Bayar share a pedigree going
back to populist prime minister Adnan Menderes, who was hanged after the military
coup of 1960. Each had a grandfather who shared a prison cell with Menderes.

<P> <B>No smoke without fire</B>

<P> Kutman points out that Global grew big before Y&#158;lmaz had any influence
in Ankara: "We never won a mandate while he was in power." Yet once the press
discovered the relationship he wasn't allowed to forget it. Now that Y&#158;lmaz
is in opposition, the pro-government press has declared open season on Global.
Bayar, who was fired in July after clashing with the new coalition government,
also complains that he's been stigmatized by the press. The youngest-ever
privatization chief at 32, he seems to have fallen out with both centre-right
parties, despite close relations with president S&uuml;leyman Demirel. "Today I
have more friends in the [Islamic] Refah party," he says.

<P> While the Turkish media are generally regarded with contempt, there is always
the suspicion that there's no smoke without fire. Indeed, the <I>Sabah</I> piece
did alert the CMB to what it believes <I>was</I> manipulation of THY stock, not
by Global but by a group of domestic speculators using foreign brokers.

<P> "We saw a 50% to 80% price increase in the stock," says Cemal
K&uuml;&ccedil;&uuml;ks&ouml;zen, deputy head of the CMB's enforcement
department. "We also saw that 80% to 90% of the transactions were executed by
foreign investors." This trading pattern looks to the CMB like a classic case of
manipulation by Turkish speculators, who cover their tracks by dealing through
foreign brokers. The CMB's suspicions were heightened by the appearance of a
series of articles on THY in leading Turkish newspapers, talking up the stock,
together with an unprecedented announcement of monthly profits.

<P> The CMB asked the five Turkish brokers through which most of these suspicious
trades had been executed to indicate who was behind the trades. The CMB was
politely referred to the foreign brokers and on August 21 it wrote to six of them
asking them to name their clients. Four &#173; Morgan Stanley International, UBS,
SBC Warburg and Prime SpA Global Fund, Milan &#173; replied, regretting that
client confidentiality prevented them from giving names. Salomon Brothers and
Morgan Stanley Asset Management didn't answer.

<P> Not satisfied with this, CMB chief Ali Ihsan Karacan on October 7 invoked a
1992 provision in the board's statutes, which requires that every investor,
domestic or foreign, should declare its identity to the local intermediary. The
CMB said that in future it would want this information for every trade &#173;
triggering incredulity among foreign investors and an almost complete halt to
foreign buying of Turkish stocks. Arnhold &amp; S Bleichroeder of New York
obliged with a client list. The CMB also received letters from UK brokers SBC
Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and Caspian Securities advising them to apply to their
regulators. So the CMB approached its fellow regulators, the Securities &amp;
Investments Board (SIB) and the Securities &amp; Futures Authority (SFA) in the
UK and the Consob in Italy, to put pressure on brokers to comply with this
ruling. The foreign regulators said they couldn't oblige in the THY case, but
they would put pressure on brokers in any future inquiry.

<P> That didn't seem so satisfy the CMB, which on November 2 banned the three UK
brokers from dealing in the Turkish securities markets. Foreign brokers saw this
as an example of the CMB's excessive zeal in a market which makes up in
regulation what it lacks in self-discipline. "The CMB and the Istanbul stock
exchange (ISE) have their hearts in the right place," says a London-based Turkey
analyst. "They're trying to apply different rules to a different culture."

<P> Foreign portfolio investors love Turkey precisely because it dances to a
different tune. While other emerging markets are jerked up and down by US
interest rates or other global economic indicators, the Turkish market is
refreshingly counter-cyclical and provides what asset allocators most seek &#173;
diversification. Foreigners own around 40% of the market's free float, but they
account for only 10% or 15% of the trading volume. The bulk of trading is by
short-term Turkish investors &#173; who discovered the wonders of stock-trading
long before the Islamists turned them out of the casinos. There are the legendary
names, touted in the weekly magazines, such as Halil G&uuml;vener, Mehmet Esener
(known as Monsieur Butterfly), Refik Aydogan, and groups that hunt in packs, such
as the once-active, now slightly chastened, Group from the Covered Bazaar.

<P> One former dealer at Finansbank recalls with awe the size of one private
customer account, admittedly in the heyday of 1993: "This man had a $75 million
position in Turkish stocks, and that was just with us. He probably had similar
positions with other brokers."

<P> Behind the big players, and the less well known company chief executives and
finance directors &#173; who trade on what might in more polite markets be called
inside information &#173; comes the herd. These are the small and medium-size
investors, who read the money magazines, listen to the manipulators, the
<I>&ccedil;&#158;t&#158;rc&#158;lar </I>(chatterers), and find themselves
whipsawed by every scramble into and out of stock. Sudden crazes can start,
either on information that is not official but has become generally known, or on
information that has been available, but whose significance is suddenly
recognized. C&uuml;neyt Demirg&uuml;res, head of equity research at
Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities, recalls writing about the hidden assets of
Alt&#158;ny&#158;ld&#158;z, a wool products firm, which took the form of a 13%
stake in the acrylic-fibre plant Aksa. That stake added $83 million to the asset
value of the company but Alt&#158;ny&#158;ld&#158;z was trading at $66 million.
"As soon as we wrote about it, the stock rose 50%," says Demirg&uuml;res. Aksu
Iplik, another textile firm, has a closed plant in Istanbul. "I have written that
one day they will sell," says Demirg&uuml;res. "All the same, come the sale, the
speculators will pile in."

<P> Turkey is a gloriously inefficient market. Others refer to it as "one big
inside trade" &#173; although no worse than Greece or Pakistan. While
"unofficial" information circulates swiftly, the ISE says it is quick to quiz
companies on new rumours. "If there's no fact behind the rumour, we publish the
company's denial in the stock exchange bulletin," says ISE vice-chairman Aril
Seren. The ISE and the CMB are fighting a battle against great odds. But their
efforts are respected. "I live in constant fear of the CMB," says a Turkish
broker in London. "Anyone who doesn't is an idiot." Article 47 of the capital
markets law is "draconian," the broker says. "You can be put in jail."

<P> <B>The longest wrangle</B>

<P> But the Turkish courts are not used to applying the law. In the 15 years of
its existence the CMB has successfully concluded only one prosecution. That was a
case of insider dealing at Bahar Securities. Five people received one-year jail
sentences commuted to fines of around TL1 billion ($11,100). The offences were
detected in April 1995, brought to court in June of that year, and the case
concluded this July. "There's no court specialized in capital markets," laments
H&uuml;lya Kemahli, acting head of the CMB's legal department. "Small cases can
take three years to come to court." The CMB's longest wrangle has been over
&Ccedil;ukurova Elektrik, a power company whose state share was sold in 1993.
Since then its balance sheet has been pillaged, to the detriment of shareholder
value, by member companies of the Uzan group which built up a 30% stake,
effectively controlling the management. The CMB brought a prosecution in 1995,
but a guilty verdict was overturned by the supreme court, and a final judgement
is pending. Today, the CMB has 49 prosecutions outstanding, but no great hopes of
securing convictions.

<P> Many firms, including Global Securities and Garanti Investment Bank, have
caught employees front-running their clients. "It has happened at this firm,"
says Kutman at Global. "Three people have been fired because of front-running."
Mustafa G&uuml;rtin at Garanti admits: "We've fired some people on serious
suspicion of front-running, and they've been hired by other institutions." Those
institutions should know perfectly well why the employees lost their jobs, says
G&uuml;rtin, "but we don't officially let them know. As an industry we have to
talk about this."

<P> Global, Garanti and others have grown up in a jungle. Global, in particular,
has won a reputation for aggressive dealing and "pushing the edge of the ethical
envelope", in the words of a former employee. Many foreign brokers won't deal
with Global. Ostensibly this is because it is the only Turkish broker perceived
as direct competition &#173; it markets direct to foreign institutional
investors, while the others go through foreign brokers. But some foreign firms
have other reasons for not using Global. They believe it is too aggressive,
sometimes sloppy on execution and its research has gone off the boil. "I've seen
Global ask for a 5% commission including doing a foreign exchange transaction on
our behalf," says a broker in London. Says another: "We don't use Global. It's
competition, and, because of its size and position it moves share prices around."

<P> But much of the criticism is the politics of envy. Global employs twice as
many staff, around 300, as its nearest rival. It is undisputed market leader,
although other firms claim higher turnover in government bonds, and primary issue
volume. Unlike any of the other big brokers it is independent, not answerable to
a banking or industrial parent. "They decide things quickly, they're extremely
ambitious, they may have overstretched themselves," says the head of research at
a close rival. A Turkish trader now in London sums up Global: "They may be doing
only 15% of things right, but they're leading the pack."

<P> Mehmet Kutman started Global in 1990 at the age of 30. He and Erol G&ouml;ker
were at tourism company Net Holding when they raised $50,000 from friends and
started with seven people. From the beginning the target was foreign
institutions. The big years for Turkish stocks were 1993 &#173; when the market
index moved from 4,072 to over 2,000, in Turkish lira terms &#173; and 1994 which
was so volatile that the brokers continued to do well. Global grew from a
seven-person show to a company employing 90 people and making revenues of $16
million a year. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) spotted a winner and
bought a 9% stake in 1993. Global's success encouraged it to do a flotation on
the ISE in May 1995, in retrospect "the biggest mistake we made in Global's
history," says Kutman. Securities firms shouldn't go public, he warns, because
"your clients become your shareholders".

<P> For the initial public offering (IPO), Global estimated its share price at
TL6,000 a share, but at the Dutch auction it was swamped with offers, some as
high as TL100,000. The issue was priced by lead manager Paribas at TL60,000, but
in the first hour of trading it dipped 11%. "Paribas had a Greenshoe option but,
because of lack of knowledge of the market, it couldn't stabilize the price,"
says Kutman. Since then, the Global share price has gone south and now languishes
at around TL1,300, leaving a bad feeling with some major shareholders. They
include Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Asset Management,
Genesis, Fidelity, the IFC and Moore Capital, a hedge fund with over 10%. "With
the IPO, a lot of people got upset," says the head of another brokerage firm.

<P> Kutman is regarded as smart but short on management skills for the size of
firm that Global has become. "We've had a lot of criticism, some warranted, some
unwarranted," says Kutman. "In the last six months, politics in Turkey has got
extremely dirty, with everyone digging up everything. The press carries no
responsibility for what it writes."

<P> But internally, Kutman recognizes a turning-point has been reached: "Now it's
cleaning-up period," he says. He has a compliance committee of three. There has
been more pressure on compliance this year since Global opened an office in New
York, which is regulated by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC).
Kutman is still looking for an independent compliance officer fluent in the rule
books of the SEC and the Turkish CMB.

<P> <B>Bad blood</B>

<P> Rival firms acknowledge that Kutman and G&ouml;ker showed the Turkish market
what brokers could achieve with good research and extensive foreign marketing.
But they're quick to point to egg on the face of their biggest competitor. Take
Yatas, an IPO led by Global in August this year. Originally, Garanti Investment
Bank had the mandate and was looking at a price of TL23,000 a share. According to
market sources, Garanti "had already signed the contract with Yatas" when Global
barged in and insisted it could do the deal at TL26,000 a share. Global got the
mandate, but the issue was badly received and the price fell 12% in two months.
Global tells a different story. It says it was approached out of the blue by
Yatas for a second opinion on Garanti's recommended issue price. Global, having
said the price should be TL24,000 to TL28,000, was offered the mandate instead.
Kutman relates: "I called Ferit Sahenk [vice chairman at Garanti] and said 'We
won't do the transaction if Garanti isn't in it'. Ferit said 'No problem', but
then he called again and said apologetically 'My team doesn't accept'." Kutman
decided Global would have to go it alone. But the switch of lead managers leaked
into the market and bad blood affected the issue, Kutman believes: "Garanti
suffered, we suffered, the market suffered."

<P> In such cases, market participants won't give Global the benefit of the
doubt. They love to see it embarrassed. They relate with glee how Global was shut
down for a day, omitting to mention that seven other brokers were too. It
happened on April 18 this year. The CMB says it detected abnormally high volumes
and suspected stock manipulation at eight brokers &#173; Delta, Erciyes, Global,
Genel Yat&#158;r&#158;m, &Ouml;ner, Polen, &Uuml;niversal and T&uuml;r (which was
shut down by the CMB in July). But Global argues that it was the fallout of a
turf battle between the CMB and the ISE: Global was picked on because its volume
is always among the highest.

<P> "We never want to grow as big as Global," says a rival broker. "If you grow
too far in Turkey, you take a huge market risk." Such rivals calculate that with
300 people, some on wages that can touch $300,000 a year, Global would have been
hurting during this summer's sluggish markets. They blame Global for inflating
salaries in Istanbul to around twice what others are prepared to pay.

<P> The demand for high-calibre people is likely to increase in the short term.
The CMB has ruled that banks must put their equity trading activity into a
separately capitalized entity by January 2. Although there is still horse-trading
about how much the capital should be &#173; the options to date are TL500 billion
for full trading powers, and TL125 billion for limited trading powers &#173;
banks, such as Is Bankas&#158;, Demirbank, Finansbank and T&uuml;rk Ekonomi Bank
(TEB) will have to staff up separate subsidiaries. Garanti Investment Bank is one
of the few that already has a securities subsidiary, Garanti Securities, although
it had been mothballed.

<P> There is much criticism of the CMB's attempt to impose a mini Glass-Steagall
Act. Global expects it will benefit in the short term, "but in the long term,
no", says Kutman.

<P> Competition for Global's market position is increasing. Other firms are
playing up the virtues of tighter ethics, better research, better-run asset
management and more intelligent corporate finance. No firm yet beats Global on
all these counts, but a few excel in one department or other.

<P> There is also the race for the domestic retail market in securities. Is
Bankas&#158; has a head start with its nationwide branch network. But Global has
eight branches and three rep offices and intends to have 13 branches and 20 rep
offices by the end of 1997. Finansbank has been opening branches in the east
recently and now has a total of 23 of which 12 are corporate and commercial
branches and 11 for private banking. Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities, the oldest
securities firm in Turkey, claims 40,000 domestic clients, but has only four
branches and two agencies.

<P> If ethics were the only criterion then TEB would lead the market, as indeed
it headed <I>Euromoney's </I>poll last month for the most trusted investment bank
or broker in Turkey. So strict are its rules that the bank will not execute sell
orders on behalf of clients, in case they become liable for capital gains tax.
TEB Research is a separate company in a separate building with no access to the
bank's credit analysis or corporate loan data. It was set up  to supply research
to Morgan Stanley Asset Management and its first Turkish investment fund,
launched in 1989. General manager of TEB Research Zeynep T&uuml;rkeri says she
had a shock herself, moving from the Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB)
six years ago, to find that she no longer had access to corporate loan data. Says
a source at T&uuml;rk Ekonomi Bank: "We don't even tell TEB Research what IPOs
we're doing. It's an independent think-tank operation." TEB has supplied the
market with some outstanding talent in recent years.

<P> Perhaps next in ethical standards is Garanti Investment Bank (Garanti
Yat&#158;r&#158;m Bankas&#158; &#173; GYB). It insists on Chinese walls between
its domestic and foreign business, asset management, and proprietary trading.
Employees may trade on their own account only outside stock exchange hours and
even then must use another broker. "Our aim is to be the JP Morgan of Turkey,"
says general manager Mustafa G&uuml;rtin. GYB has been put together as a
full-service investment bank. Now, because of the CMB's new ruling, equity
trading must be put through a revitalized Garanti Securities &#173; GYB's 12
stock exchange seats will be added to Garanti Securities' three. "We think we're
one of the market leaders in equities," says G&uuml;rtin, "particularly in
brokerage for foreign clients." But he doesn't mean in transaction volume, which
he regards as "simply leverage for more meaningful investment banking".

<P> Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities is trying to build itself into a full-service
investment bank and sees Global as its chief competition. Coskun Akdeniz,
assistant general manager, lost eight of his staff to GYB earlier this year.
"Morale was low," he recalls, "but I came back in six months."
Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities, a subsidiary of the Eczac&#158;bas&#158;
chemicals group, was established in 1976 and lived through the corporate bond
crisis of the early 1980s. In 1994 it began to build its reputation as a research
house, benefiting from the input of Atilla Yesilada, formerly of Global, now back
as head of research at Global. Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities is reckoned to
have the best research on Turkish companies: certainly C&uuml;neyt
Demirg&uuml;res, director of equity research, is regarded as the best
stock-picker in Turkey. He came to Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities in March this
year from TEB, via ING Barings in Istanbul. He believes in brief,
up-to-the-minute reports easily digested by busy fund managers. "Investors don't
have time to read extensive reports unless they're going to buy a majority," he
says. He aims to have a report out within a week of visiting a company and to
keep it updated. Eczac&#158;bas&#158; Securities also has a macroeconomic model,
run jointly with Bosphorus University &#173; "a vector auto-regression model",
says Demirg&uuml;res. "Some people are using CapM (capital asset pricing model)
but that's difficult in an inefficient market like Turkey."

<P> Eczac&#158;bas&#158; has "been around for years", comments a rival. "They
have a lot of small retail clients, they and the mother company have a good name,
but they're not innovative and they have no corporate finance." Akdeniz is
determined to build that up, however, which probably means poaching a team from
another firm.

<P> <B>Jumpy market</B>

<P> There are 169 brokers in Turkey, but most are small-scale operations, some
set up by market players just to trade their own account. Only about 30 firms
have a broad base of retail or institutional clients. Foreign asset managers
typically deal through three or four favoured brokers, spreading their orders to
avoid moving the market. In such a jumpy market the local players are always
watching what the foreigners are doing. "Whenever we buy something," says Mehmet
Akkent at Citicorp Securities, which has three seats on the exchange, "people
think it's going to go up. That's our disadvantage." Other brokers that buy
mostly for foreign clients, such as Garanti, Ko&ccedil; and Alfa, experience the
same problem. The phenomenon explains why Turkish speculators might go through
foreign brokers if they wanted to push up the THY stock price.

<P> Research is probably the strongest factor in choosing a Turkish broker.
Global led the way. It still has more and better-paid analysts than any other
house. Atilla Yesilada, who was at Global until June<B> </B>1993 and returned
there in November<B> </B>1995, is regarded as perhaps the best writer on Turkey's
macroeconomy. "A good interest-rate call on one T-bill auction can pay Atilla's
salary," comments a London broker who uses his research. But connoisseurs believe
Global's output has lost its edge recently. They regard TEB's research as more
rigorous and Eczac&#158;bas&#158;'s as more "direct and to the point".

<P> Ata Securities, a subsidiary of the Ata construction group, produces research
in English, Turkish and Japanese. It believes that when Japanese investors become
familiar with Turkey there will be a flood. "Nomura has just launched a new
open-ended fund for Turkey, in Tokyo," says Mehmet Sami, senior vice-president at
Ata Securities. Ata also opened an office in New York this year and has a
marketing arrangement with worldwide brokerage agency Auerbach Grayson &amp; Co
of New York. Started in 1991, the 100th Turkish broker to be founded, Ata now has
150 people and according to its own reckoning has ranked second in fixed income
and equity trading since 1992. It was the first broker to establish an equity
fund, in 1993, and has made a name managing domestic Type A investment funds,
which must be at least 25% invested in equities and are tax-exempt, and Type B
funds (tax-exempt for retail clients). It will also manage own-label funds for
local insurer Isvi&ccedil;re Sigorta.

<P> But the newest kid on the block is Alfa Securities, started by Aziz Karadeniz
and his team from Interbank in July this year. "Two weeks ago we were number 11
in equity trading, and this week we were 19th," said Karadeniz excitedly in early
October. Since Alfa trades only for clients it cannot push itself up the league
tables with own-account trading. Karadeniz took 30 people from Interbank after
suffering too many changes in senior management there. For finance he went to
Halit C&#158;ng&#158;ll&#158;oglu, who controls Demirbank, which is also active
in the securities markets. "Alfa has nothing to do with Demirbank," Karadeniz
insists. "It's more of a venture-capital investment for Mr
C&#158;ng&#158;ll&#158;oglu." C&#158;ng&#158;ll&#158;oglu has also invested in
Global Securities.

<P> Alfa trades equities and government bonds &#173; "our bond desk is already
among the top five securities houses," says Karadeniz &#173; and it employs 59
people. Its premises are in the luxury shopping and office complex Akmerkez, in
the Etiler district of Istanbul. Rivals wonder how the operation can hope to
cover its costs, particularly in sluggish markets. "We calculate," says one,
"that Aziz would need to be turning over 7% of the market just to break even. No
securities house does even 5%." But Karadeniz is bullish: "We're covering more
than 90% of monthly expenditure," he said in October. "We're far ahead of our
business plan. Our problem is to decide whether we should jump on the bandwagon
and grow." Alfa has TL500 billion ($6.5 million) in capital. Its licence cost
around $1.25 million and it needed around $1 million working capital. Karadeniz
says recurring costs are around $300,000 a month.

<P> And this is in the teeth of a commission war. Finansbank, which was a leading
player in equities until it lost a swathe of people to other firms, has been
boosting its volumes for the last four to five months by charging little or no
commission. "That's put them in the top five for equity trading, but I can't see
that they're making money," says a rival. Finansbank chairman H&uuml;sn&uuml;
&Ouml;zyegin is regarded as perhaps the smartest mind in the market. A commercial
banker by training &#173; he was general manager of Pamukbank at 32 &#173; he set
up his own bank in 1991 and was fantastically successful in 1993 and 1994, being
the driving force behind the Type A funds. But in 1995 there was an exodus from
Finansbank. Traders, researchers and corporate financiers left for jobs in
London; half a dozen of its renowned treasury team also left. Finansbank is now
trying to broaden its retail base in Turkey, by opening provincial branches.
"H&uuml;sn&uuml; is very good, very opportunistic, but he doesn't delegate," says
a rival broker. Kutman at Global owes him a favour. When he was starting out in
1990 and 1991, only &Ouml;zyegin understood his business and gave him a credit
line. "Without him Global wouldn't be here today," says Kutman. "I regard
H&uuml;sn&uuml; as a big brother. He became a shareholder, and he probably made a
lot of money from the line."

<P> The temptation for banks and securities houses in Turkey is to forget their
customers and play the game of shorting the dollar and buying Turkish T-bills for
their own account at a real yield of 25%. Players of this game were caught out in
1994 when the lira plummeted. But risk managers don't expect that kind of crisis
in the near term because of the very predictable stabilization policy of the
treasury and the central bank, and the government's need to roll over its
domestic borrowing. Money supply is carefully monitored and fine-tuned through
T-bill auctions while the lira is steadily devalued in step with the inflation
rate &#173; at present around 85%.

<P> But financial managers with an eye beyond today's quick profit are concerned
with ensuring an income stream once the short-dollar game ends, as it surely
will.

<P> Commissions from brokerage are not enough. The future lies in privatizations,
IPOs and corporate finance. The PA is shying away from its previous market-driven
approach, which was to unload chunks of state-owned companies via block sales. "I
believe an equity offering is not the right vehicle for privatization," says
Yal&ccedil;&#158;n Atl&#158;, vice president at the PA. Such an offering, he says
"can be used as an instrument by politicians and bureaucrats. I would rather
resolve the problems of the companies with the ministries and municipalities
before doing an equity offering. Then the shares would float at close to their
value."

<P> Ugur Bayar, who as privatization chief unloaded the more marketable small
companies, such as cement plants, and residual state holdings in already listed
companies, wrote recently that he now favours a pause in the programme while the
politics are sorted out and the public are properly informed. But the augury is
not good. Successive coalition governments have eyed privatization as a one-time
source of revenue, but have also fought for patronage of the 50 or so companies
whose management they can hire and fire. The public has come to see this as a
cynical game which is getting the country nowhere. According to the latest
government programme, Etibank, Erdemir, and T&uuml;rk Telekom are next in line.
Six consortia have been invited for the second time to make proposals on
T&uuml;rk Telekom. But left-wing politician M&uuml;mtaz Soysal is poised to block
the sale again in the constitutional court.

<P> Corporate finance teams looking for a flow of deals may have to go elsewhere
for a time. There are plenty of private Turkish companies wanting capital. The
Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB) is the envy of many for its combined
project finance and corporate finance team. TSKB, a small consortium bank owned
by Is Bankas&#158; and the Sabanc&#158; group and others, has 60 analysts
including 15 project engineers. It concentrates on IPOs and financial
restructuring for unlisted companies. "We don't publish equity research on listed
companies," says Metin Ar, executive vice-president at TSKB. Because TSKB is also
a lending bank, "our corporate finance is eating some of our lending business",
Ar admits, "but that's better than letting Global do it." TSKB employs 360 people
and has a loan book totalling around $300 million. TSKB's pitch to clients is not
to maximize proceeds from stock offerings but to build up shareholder loyalty. It
particularly likes deals that involve an IPO and financial restructuring, such as
an offering for fruit-processing firm Konfrut G&#158;da. The IPO was accompanied
by a medium-term loan to pay off some burdensome short-term debt, bringing TSKB
more business and making the company more attractive to investors. The bank
believes it will have done the biggest volume of IPOs of any Turkish house this
year.

<P> TSKB hasn't decided how it will comply with the CMB's requirement to separate
the equity business. It already owns 57% of high-volume securities house
Yat&#158;r&#158;m Finansman, of which Is Bankas&#158; also owns 30%.
"Yat&#158;r&#158;m Finansman is pretty active domestically," says Ar, "but it has
no international relationships."

<P> Is Bankas&#158; may eventually find TSKB and Yat&#158;r&#158;m Finansman too
serious competition to remain part of the group. TSKB has a well-identified niche
and could happily shed its majority shareholder.

<P> But banks such as Is Bankas&#158;, Ko&ccedil; Bank and Akbank which each sit
in a cluster of related listed companies, have difficulty persuading the market
that they are truly independent. Some investors believe their investment funds
carry too high a proportion of listed stocks of companies of their own groups.
Others would go further and say inside information is almost bound to be passed
between companies of the group. "How can you prevent the flow of information
between all the bits of Is Bank and its affiliates?" asks one stock analyst
rhetorically. This use of internal company information is so natural in Turkey it
is hardly thought of as unsporting.

<P> A possible example occurred with Sabah Yay&#158;nc&#158;l&#158;k, which owns
<I>Sabah</I>, the very newspaper that took a swipe at Global and Ugur Bayar. In
summer 1995 there was a flood at the paper's printing works in Istanbul and the
share price fell 12% to TL800. A local broker reported the following sequence of
events: soon after the flood Sevket Bilgin, a member of the Bilgin family, which
controls <I>Sabah</I>, began to build up a block of shares totalling 5.8% of the
company's capital. This was dutifully reported in the stock exchange bulletin.
Two months after the flood, the bulletin also reported that the printing plant
was insured &#173; the company had received a TL83 billion insurance payout.
Bilgin bought 2.9% more of the stock as this news was absorbed and the share
price rose to TL1,250, then sold 4.3%. In March the Bilgin family sold a further
2.7% of its Sabah stake.

<H2> <B>Revolving door at the central bank</B> </H2> <P> Turkey has had four
central bank governors in as many years. Before that, during his six-year tenure,
R&uuml;sd&uuml; Saracoglu went through three presidents, five prime ministers and
eight or nine treasury ministers. The post is precarious and surrounded by
precarious people.

<P> Today, Saracoglu and one of his successors, Yaman T&ouml;r&uuml;ner, have
become politicians because, they argue, you can't change things as central bank
governor. Present incumbent Gazi Er&ccedil;el would agree. His job is to keep the
lira and the monetary aggregates stable, coaxing market-driven interest rates
ahead of the 80% inflation that he can do nothing about.

<P> It is politicians &#173; at the moment an incongruous coalition of religious
fundamentalists, Refah, and the right-of-centre True Path Party (DYP) led by
foreign minister Tansu &Ccedil;iller &#173; who must implement a macroeconomic
stabilization programme to tackle the country's structural problems and bring
down inflationary expectations. The central bank and the treasury's technicians
are just mountain guides, keeping the economy on a slow descent and ensuring it
doesn't fall off a precipice.

<P> "My monetary policy mainly depends on the exchange rate, interest rate and
monetary aggregates," says Er&ccedil;el. "Any deterioration of the current
account could put us in an enormously risky position. If your trade balance is
out of control, that's when your reserves will just disappear in a very short
time.

<P> "My monetary programme is on the right track, designed unfortunately
according to 80% inflation. I'd always prefer single-digit inflation, but today
I'm indifferent if inflation is 70%, 60% or 100%. The most important thing is to
establish stability."

<P> According to bankers and businessmen in Istanbul, the central bank and the
treasury are doing a superb job, coordinating the auctions of treasury bills with
the central bank's monitoring of the money supply and control of liquidity
through open market operations. They would say that wouldn't they, carp the
cynics. In this inflationary environment, with 25% real interest rates in lira,
relative to its stable descent against the dollar, banks and big companies can
make good money buying Turkish T-bills with borrowed dollars. They don't need to
lend to customers or invest in industrial growth. What this is doing to the
long-term future of the economy is another story. Again, the Istanbul businessmen
say the private sector is immune to what the weak government in Ankara is or is
not doing. It has its own sources of finance. Meanwhile the black economy &#173;
trade with Russia and the former Soviet Union, smuggling in the south-east, and
drug trafficking &#173; is pumping an invisible $10 billion a year into the
visible $20 billion trade gap. But think what the country could achieve with
strong economic leadership in Ankara. "The situation is unsustainable," admits a
treasury technician. But for the central bank and the treasury team the only
sensible course is to maintain stability until a credible medium-term programme
begins to bite.

<P> Er&ccedil;el has learned crisis management the hard way: "First the test, and
then the lesson," he recalls. One crisis came in the first week of July, when the
new Refahyol coalition announced a 50% increase in state sector wages, and rolled
over one of the <BR> T-bill auctions. "That created extra liquidity in the
market," says Er&ccedil;el. "We observed that in two days the currency in
circulation had increased 60%. We reacted with open market operations and sold
dollars &#173; in three days I sold $750 million and together with open market
operations soaked up about 80% of the increased liquidity. Then we slowly
absorbed the remaining 20%. The market at least saw the ability of the central
bank to absorb the highest possible liquidity, plus they understood it is firm
about the implementation of market policy."

<P> There have been other flurries in the bond market, such as for example, when
Abdullah G&uuml;l, Refah's senior economic minister of state, said the abolition
of interest rates was among his party's goals. Cognoscenti remembered that his
party had signed a protocol with its coalition partner to uphold free market
principles for the life of the government. The flurry was short-lived.

<P> The technicians at the treasury, in the present climate of cooperation, are
happy with the independence of the central bank. But it wasn't always like that.
With a treasury minister or a prime minister determined to force down interest
rates or cut government borrowing, the relationship can turn nasty.

<P> That happened to Saracoglu and his immediate successor B&uuml;lent
G&uuml;ltekin. Saracoglu points to a chart (see left) which logs the level of
central bank advances to the treasury to finance the budget deficit. In August
1991 when prime minister Mesut Y&#158;lmaz opted for early elections the
austerity belt was loosened and advances began to rise. S&uuml;leyman Demirel,
then head of the DYP, came to power with &Ccedil;iller as his economy minister.
Saracoglu was put under enormous pressure by &Ccedil;iller to finance the budget
and lower interest rates. "It took Demirel until May 1992 to see the light," says
Saracoglu, pointing to how the advances then declined, until August 1993 when he
had had enough of &Ccedil;iller and resigned.

<P> Next man in, B&uuml;lent G&uuml;ltekin, could not halt the demand for new
advances as &Ccedil;iller &#173; who became prime minister in 1993 when Demirel
became president &#173; attacked interest rates again, cancelling treasury
auctions, which had the effect of flooding the market with liquidity. Then in
January 1994, the lira was devalued by 30%. At the same time Moody's downgraded
Turkey's medium-term debt from Baa3 to below investment grade. Foreign investors
withdrew from the T-bill market, Turkish banks and investors rushed to cover
their short dollar positions, and the economy was in crisis. Later, three Turkish
banks were allowed to fail. The rest had their deposits guaranteed by the
government, but they were nevertheless starved of liquidity.

<P> Er&ccedil;el remembers this time well as chairman of T&uuml;t&uuml;nbank.
"For about five months it was a nightmare," he recalls. "Every day when I woke up
I was happy for about five seconds, until I realized I was facing another day. My
bank had $600 million in foreign exchange deposits and about 250,000
deposit-holders. Slowly and surely people were coming to withdraw their foreign
exchange, and Turkish lira, from my bank. It was very difficult to supply the
liquidity, because liquidity was very short, even though the deposits were
guaranteed. We had to supply the deposits, whatever the cost. Some days we earned
money, some days we lost."

<P> "G&uuml;ltekin resigned five days after the devaluation," recalls Saracoglu.
"He should have resigned before." The root of the problem then and now, says
Saracoglu, is the excessive power of the treasury minister. "The discretionary
powers given to the minister are way too broad. They have been used to do actions
which are politically motivated," he says. Saracoglu, who was a minister of state
in the previous ill-fated coalition &#173; of his Anavatan (Motherland) Party and
the DYP &#173; has plenty of ideas for reforming the central bank, the banking
system, insurance, social security and the privatization process. For the banking
law, "getting rid of the phrase 'minister' would be a huge step forward", he
says. "Banks have to be regulated by a technical body, not a politician."

<P> G&uuml;ltekin's successor Yaman T&ouml;r&uuml;ner did strike a couple of
blows for central bank independence: "I made two conditions before taking the
governorship," says T&ouml;r&uuml;ner, "to change the law to limit central bank
advances to the treasury; and to free foreign exchange and interest rates." He
became governor in February 1994. In a month and a half he had changed the law:
for 1994 the central bank could finance only 15% of the budget, for 1995 the
limit was 12%, this year it is 10%, next year 6% and in 1998 it must hit 3%. A
glance at Saracoglu's chart shows that advances declined steeply until March 1995
then rose somewhat before the December 1995 election. T&ouml;r&uuml;ner also
congratulates himself for bolstering the central bank's reserves from a low of $3
billion to around $18.5 billion at the time he left, in November 1995.

<P> T&ouml;r&uuml;ner says he resigned "because I decided to become a politician.
I did whatever I could do at the central bank, but reducing inflation is the
problem of politicians." He's now a parliamentary deputy for the DYP. Opponents
suggest unkindly that he was found a safe seat to give him parliamentary immunity
from attack through the courts. Almost every high-profile figure in Turkey is
facing a court action for corruption, brought or threatened by political
opponents. &Ccedil;iller has two hanging over her, involving allegations of
self-enrichment while in office, and interfering with public tenders. Prime
minister Necmettin Erbakan has also been accused of self-enrichment. Saracoglu is
under investigation for abusing the privileges of office. Most pragmatists see
these cases as a game of tit-for-tat: whether there was or was not any corruption
is incidental. "If these people are seen to be doing their job effectively, the
accusations soon run out of steam," says a senior Turkish banker.<B><I>-

<H2> <B>Little stability, <BR> lots of profit</B> </H2> <H3> <B>Old Turkey hands
reckon you can't judge investment prospects from outside. Once in, you are likely
to perform well, they say. But the country's image is so bad that new inward
investment is at a standstill. Metin Munir reports</B> </H3> <P> There are few
countries which have as bad an image among foreign investors as Turkey, but it
fits badly with reality. Viewed from a distance the country seems to be wreathed
in a mist of bad news and misconceptions. According to foreign businessmen who
live there this is probably the single biggest reason why so little foreign
direct investment is being made and why the trickle has been dwindling recently
because of political uncertainty.

<P> Markos Komondouros of SBC Warburg, who has been living in Istanbul for nearly
three years, says: "Turkey has a serious image problem. Its image does not
reflect the reality of Turkey but it is keeping investors away".

<P> "Never have I heard a good story told worse," says David Edgerly, Istanbul
general manager of Alliance Capital Management. "Looked at from the outside
everything is blurred by political instability, macroeconomic imbalances,
corruption and police over-reaction. But you have to look at the whole mosaic,
which reveals itself only when you live here for a while."

<P> One crucial part of this is that foreign multinationals operating in Turkey
have always managed to turn a profit. The fact that the average per capita income
is $2,000 is misleading. The distribution of wealth is uneven and one-fifth of
the population enjoys an average income adjusted for purchasing power of $14,000.
There's a great deal more wealth about than is made public: tax evasion is common
and vast undeclared resources which do not get calculated in the nation's
accounts are spread throughout society. The market is large and dynamic and just
beginning to enjoy a consumer boom. Of the population of 60 million, 60% are aged
between 15 and 30. There are 11 million households and almost a million marriages
a year. The inception of the customs union between Turkey and the EU at the
beginning of the year has enhanced the country's strategic position as a bridge
to Central Asia, the Middle East and the Black Sea.

<P> "Turkey is a country for those who want to make money," says Edgerly. "It is
like riding a rocket ship. If you want stability invest in Switzerland where they
will make you pay for the privilege. If you want to make money come to Turkey."

<P> Relatively few have heeded this call: the inflow of new investment has been
small considering Turkey's market size. Countries with GNPs of Turkey's size in
Latin America and east Asia attract foreign investment of between $5 billion and
$15 billion a year, says Yavuz Canevi, one of Turkey's most respected bankers and
chairman of the Foreign Investors Association (Yased). Turkey, by contrast,
attracts a paltry $1 billion, less than 1% of GNP. Canevi laments that the hopes
created by customs union have been dashed by political instablity and that new
foreign investments in Turkey are at a standstill.

<P> Yased calculates that the ratio of new foreign investment to total foreign
investment has been declining rapidly since 1994, when it was 43%. The figure was
11.5% in 1994 and 6.5% in 1995. For the first time this year there was also a
decline in overall permits issued by the prime minister's office. At the end of
August authorized investments stood at $1.04 billion compared with $1.33 billion
at the same time last year. In addition to this, some companies already operating
in Turkey have started postponing or suspending renovation and expansion plans.

<P> "The incessant crisis situation and instability are the causes of these
negative deveopments," says Canevi. "They attest that there is no confidence left
in Turkey's current structure. It is impossible to expect foreigners to invest in
a country where the chairman of the Confederation of Employers Union has gone on
record as saying that his members have got no appetite left for investment."

<P> Because there is a lot of suspicion and uncertainty surrounding the
intentions of Necmettin Erbakan, the country's first Islamist prime minister, the
situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. His visits to Iran and Libya,
two countries ostracized by the West because of their alleged support for
terrorists, have worsened an already bad image in the West. His messages
concerning the economy are paradoxical and often nonsensical. Despite
pronouncements to the contrary, Erbakan does not have the political clout to
realign Turkey's foreign policy or dismantle its free-market economy. His
fundamentalist Welfare Party won 22% of the popular vote and has only 159 seats
in the 550-member national assembly so his government can survive only as long as
he toes the line drawn by his coalition partner, the pro-west and liberal former
prime minister Tansu &Ccedil;iller. His pre-election promises &#173; for example,
abolishing interest on loans and deposits in line with Islamic principles,
quitting the EU customs union and introducing an Islamic dinar to replace the
Turkish lira &#173; have no chance of being fulfilled.

<P> <B>Springboard</B>

<P> For most Turks the question is not whether Erbakan will turn Turkey into
another Iran but whether he will be able to avert the lurking economic crisis and
press ahead with much-needed structural reforms. Not many people have confidence
that he will achieve much here. He does not understand how the modern world works
and is ignorant of the workings of the Turkish economy.

<P> Businessmen in Turkey &#173; Turkish and foreign &#173; have learnt to live
with constant political uncertainty and macroeconomic imbalances and prosper
under the most adverse conditions.

<P> "Turkey is a phenomenon," says Christoph Urban, general manager of the
operations of German electrical engineer Siemens in Turkey. "When you are far
away you don't see the strengths. You don't see that you can do business very
well under these circumstances."

<P> According to Urban, prospective foreign investors look at the general
political and economic picture in Turkey rather than studying the records of
sucessful companies operating there. Siemens has been trading in Turkey since the
1920s and manufacturing there since the 1950s. It has never lost money. "Siemens
Turkey, in terms of relative profit, is one of our most profitable operations in
Europe," says Urban. "Invest, invest, invest is our motto."

<P> In 1994, when Turkey was hit by one of its worst economic crises, Urban was
negotiating to buy one of Turkey's largest household appliances companies. The
takeover, which cost Siemens-Bosch $140 million, was completed last year.

<P> "For us Turkey is not just a large market with 60 million-odd people but a
springboard to all these regions beyond," says Urban. "It was not Siemens AG
Germany that built the new offices in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. We have done it and do it from here. Part of the
Middle East, Bulgaria and Romania, where a joint venture has recently been
started, is also under the aegis of the Istanbul operation.This is our Eurasian
dream. It has already started and I think we are on the right track."

<P> Siemens' experience is not unique. Companies as diverse as Citibank, Tetra
Pak and Sheraton have also succeeded there. One of the latest to make a flying
start was Telecom Finland, which is the biggest shareholder in cellular telephone
operator Turkcell. Turkcell became the fastest-growing of Telecom Finland's
investments as soon as it started operating in Turkey.

<P> On the other hand, Telecom Finland's experience of investing in Turkcell (see
box) throws light on why some companies are not keen to even consider investing
in Turkey. In general terms, there are many other countries which, if not as
profitable, are less hassle to invest in and easier to understand. For
mostpotential investors the mist of political instability and macroeconomic
imbalances covering Turkey is too impenetrable. This seems to be true even for
Siemens when it seeks to persuade its German principal that further expansion is
justified. "When I ask my corporate office for another Dm100 million to invest in
Turkey," says Urban, "they look at me and say: 'Don't you know there is
competition?' And I see my German colleagues flying past Turkey, going to the Far
East, to Malaysia, to Singapore and to China."&#009;*

<H2> <B>Turkcell's line goes dead</B> </H2> <P> Turkcell was one of the world's
fastest-growing cellular telephone networks when last August the Turkish
government forbade its making new sales. This was ostensibly because Turkcell
&#173; a Turkish, Finnish, Swedish joint venture which has accounted for more
than 10% of investments made in Turkey in the past decade &#173; had not
fulfilled its contractual obligations. It had allegedly sold more licences than
its infrastructure could handle, thereby causing hardship to its customers.
Unfortunately these included communications minister &Ouml;mer Barutcu. Industry
sources say the real reason was political.

<P> "I was horrified when I heard the news," says Leena Suhonen, the Turkcell
board member who represents Telecom Finland, the biggest partner, with 34% of the
equity. Turkcell's other shareholders include Ericsson Telecommunications (15%),
&Ccedil;ukurova Holding owned by reclusive Turkish billionaire Mehmet Emin
Karamehmet (15%), and Turkish businessman Murat Vargi (14%).

<P> There were good reasons for Suhonen's reaction: Turkcell had captured nearly
70% of market share and was selling between 30,000 and 40,000 licences a month
just before new sales were suspended, compared with 10,000-15,000 the previous
year. "In 1994 I laughed a little when I heard the estimates of my Turkish
colleagues," says Suhonen. "But that year Turkcell became number one in sales in
Europe. Similarly, at the beginning of 1995 their estimates were high. But by
this time I knew more about Turkey and the Turks, so I wasn't laughing."

<P> By August this year Turkcell had 445,000 subscribers and was the world's
sixth-largest cellular telephone company. But on the 14th, Turkish Telecom (TT)
wrote to Turkcell general manager C&uuml;neyt T&uuml;rktan informing him that
there would be no new subscriptions because Turkcell had outgrown its
infrastructural capacity. Industry sources say TT, a state agency awaiting
privatization, wrote the letter under pressure from Barutcu. One source says the
minister wanted to give Turkcell's less successful rival Telsim a chance to catch
up.

<P> In the 1980s, when the Turkish government opened the market to cellular
telephones, it was decided that licences would be given to two companies.
International bids were invited and licences were awarded to Turkcell and Telsim.
Telsim is owned by a consortium led by the local Uzan family (the Rumeli Group)
and includes Simko Detcon (Deutsche Telekom's consultancy arm), Siemens and
Alcatel. Presently, though, the Uzans' stake is more than 90%.

<P> The Uzans are a much-feared, secretive clan who own a diversified
conglomerate that includes TV networks, banks, hydroelectric dams and cement
companies. They achieved international notoriety when they gained control of the
privatized &Ccedil;ukurova hydroelectric plant and started hiving off funds. The
foreign institutional investors who had large holdings in the company kicked up a
fuss, but to no avail.

<P> Last year the government suspended Telsim's telephone licence sales, claiming
that it was attempting to defraud TT of its share of revenues &#173; TT received
65% of revenues in 1994 and 33% in 1995. It's probably no coincidence that this
came in the wake of a lengthy smear campaign conducted by an Uzan network, Star
TV, against then prime minister Tansu &Ccedil;iller and her businessman husband.
Nor is it insignificant that the decision to halt Turkcell's sales came soon
after Star TV halted its tirade against the &Ccedil;illers.

<P> Turkcell's Turktan concedes that at about the time of the ban there were
isolated infrastructure problems but, as Telecom Finland's Suhonen points out,
there will always be holes in a developing cellular network &#173; it's true even
of relatively well established systems in Scandinavia.

<P> A senior Turkcell executive says that after Telsim resumed operations: "Word
reached us again and again that it was our turn to be shut down. They wanted to
let Telsim bridge the gap between us and them and they extracted a political
price from the Uzan group for this."

<P> In just over two years the partners in Turkcell had put in $350 million,
making it the biggest single foreign investment since 1994. When the ban came
into effect a further $350 million investment was in the pipeline. After it,
Turkcell petitioned TT to conduct an inquiry and produce a report on its
infrastructure. TT's report, according to Turkish daily <I>H&uuml;rriyet</I>, was
positive but did not impress Barutcu. "Reports don't impress me,"
<I>H&uuml;rriyet</I> quotes him as saying. "My method is to pick up the telephone
and ring. If I can get through I will be satisfied and lift the ban."

<P> Last month the government told Turkcell it could resume selling licences.
There was, however, another shock for foreign investors when Barutcu said he
would not recognize the agreement signed by his predecessors. Under this the two
operators have options to buy licences for 25 years at $500 million to be paid in
four instalments over two years. Barutcu now says the companies must pay the full
$500 million up front. <B><I>&#173; MM</I></B>

<H3><B> EURO GOVERNMENT BONDS </B></H3>

<H2><B>The shape of things to come</B></H2>

<H3>
<B>A single European currency looks increasingly likely to be instituted on schedule on January 1 1999. With this in mind government bond strategists are trying to predict the likely shape of the euro market. A few patterns, such as the transition towards a credit-driven market, are emerging. But much still hinges on decisions yet to be taken. Philip Eade reports</B>
</H3>
<P>
When politicians from the so-called Club Med countries of southern Europe say they intend to qualify in time for the first round of the EU's economic and monetary union (Emu) &#173; due to start, as the Bank of England has taken to saying, in just 550 business days' time &#173; it's time for the financial markets to sit up and take notice. That they have done so seems clear from recent movements in bond market indices and the growing demand for advice and information on the likely shape of new markets. 

<P>
By late last month, following budgets in Italy, Spain and Portugal designed to meet Maastricht treaty criteria for entry to a single currency, the yields on the long-term government bonds of each of these countries had fallen by around 100 basis points over German Bunds since the beginning of the month, to 230bp for Italian bonds and 150bp for Spanish and Portuguese ones. 

<P>
But just as discussions about which countries will be in and which will be out of Emu have moved to a new stage, so too has the debate about the future shape and mechanics of the euro government bond market. Europe's bankers are frantically chewing over the practical implications for staffing and back-office requirements, strategy and the optimal deployment of resources. 

<P>
"Events have moved on very quickly," says Graham Bishop, an adviser on Emu at Salomon Brothers in London. "Until recently, the City by and large did not really believe that the politicians were going to do it. Suddenly the penny has dropped &#173; they are going to do it." 

<P>
Experts on the single currency such as Bishop are rushed off their feet giving speeches at seminars, chairing committees, and reassuring clients. At the <I>Euromoney</I> London seminar on Emu and the debt markets at Claridge's hotel last month, delegates' notepads were abnormally free of doodles. Banks such as Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Paribas have been overwhelmed by the response to similar closed-door events for their clients &#173; some 225 investors are said to have attended Paribas' conference. Rarely can there have been such a thirst for knowledge about a bond market that doesn't yet exist. 

<P>
The interest is understandable. At issue is what may become the world's largest government debt market. Assuming, as appears more and more likely, that all EU members will eventually enter into monetary union, the euro-denominated government bond market will be worth some Ecu2.1 trillion &#173; measured according to Salomon Brothers' government bond index of tradeable bonds (fixed-rate over one-year life remaining) &#173; compared with Ecu1.6 trillion of US government bonds and Ecu1 trillion for the Japanese market. "That's a hugely attractive market not just for domestic investors but for investors around the world," says Bishop.

<P>
The most profound change in the European government bond market will be the disappearance of spreads determined by currency strength and their replacement by those influenced by perceptions of credit quality. This stems from the Maastricht treaty stipulation that a government in financial difficulties cannot be bailed out by borrowing from the European Central Bank (ECB). 

<P>
Sovereign credit analysis is therefore set to rise in prominence. It requires specialist skills, however, and banks are scouring the globe for people with an intimate knowledge of Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's methodology. But even the credit-rating agencies have yet to perfect their analytical approach to sovereign governments that issue in a currency they cannot print but in which they tax.

<P>
Under the present system, while the foreign-currency debt ratings of EU member states vary between AA minus and the top rating of AAA, local-currency debt from all countries &#173; with the exception of Greece &#173; is rated AAA by S&amp;P. 

<P>
There are several reasons for this, among them the ability of governments to increase taxation and the fact that local-currency debt is mostly locally held (90% in the case of Belgium, for example) &#173; governments tend to be more reluctant to let down their own citizens than investors from abroad. But the most compelling reason is that if push comes to shove governments can get themselves out of trouble by printing money. 

<P>
In the euro environment, increasing money supply will no longer be an option for salvation. According to Konrad Reuss, a director at S&amp;P in London, the closest proxy to sovereign-debt ratings in the new market will therefore be today's ratings for foreign-currency debt. 

<P>
Ratings, says Reuss, will be influenced by the so-called no-bail-out clause &#173; whereby countries at risk of default will not, in theory at least, be rescued by other Emu members &#173; as well as the conduct of monetary policy and management of official currency reserves by the ECB. 

<P>
But more significantly, perhaps, says Reuss, S&amp;P's ratings will also depend on factors such as "tax burden and revenue-raising flexibility, budgetary balance trends, fiscal pressures and borrowing plans, debt burden and contingent liabilities". 

<P>
Critics of Emu have highlighted the likelihood of a dramatic downgrading of the debt of countries such as Belgium, which has a debt ratio of close to 130% of GDP. Bernard Connolly, formerly an expert with the European Commission, now with AIG Trading, sees a "malign" weakness in euro debt because "it doesn't have a governmental sovereign borrower. When the debt of all these states is denominated in [effectively] an external currency, the risk of default will increase".

<P>
Such concerns are amplified now that Italy, Portugal and Spain are pressing so hard for early entry, and because Germany has apparently failed to force through former finance minister Theo Waigel's stability pact. The proposed pact was to involve the threat of automatic fines for budgetary infractions to ensure sound finances among Emu participants and thereby avoid a fragmented bond market. Germany deems it vital that the euro remains as strong as the Deutschmark, but it looks increasingly unlikely that it will. 

<P>
<B>Watered-down pact</B>

<P>
The European Commission in Brussels has for the moment agreed to far less draconian "preventative" measures than those called for by Bonn, including the requirement that EU members submit budgetary goals to the EC and an early warning system for identifying and correcting budgetary slippages. 

<P>
A recent EC agreement, reached in mid-October, encompasses the threat of sanctions for states that fail to reduce budget deficits in excess of 3% of GDP. As far as flexibility goes, the EC now says that the "temporary and exceptional" circumstances under which the Maastricht treaty permits leeway should apply when resulting from "an unusual event outside the control of the relevant member states and which has a major impact on the financial position of the general government, or when resulting from a severe economic downturn, in particular in the case of significant negative annual real growth". Again this falls short of the original German demand for a fixed target of negative growth of 2%. A final decision will be taken at the EU summit in Dublin in December, but the omens do not look good for Waigel's stability pact in its original form. 

<P>
Whatever the final outcome, the new euro bond market countries that fail to keep their budget deficits in check may have their debt downgraded, perhaps for the first time below that of some companies and local authorities. Traditionally, rating agencies have refused to ascribe corporates a rating higher than the sovereign in whose jurisdiction they operate. But now the ceiling will be the AAA rating given to the Emu area as a whole &#173; as announced by S&amp;P in October &#173; rather than the individual country ratings. These, judging from the foreign-currency debt ratings now given to EU members, will in several cases be a few notches below the maximum.

<P>
However, despite the no-bail-out clause in the Maastricht treaty, there is still a widespread assumption that no member of Emu will be allowed to default, a factor that will enhance market perceptions of the creditworthiness of the weaker economies and narrow the spread at which their debt issues trade. 

<P>
Says Thomas Mayer, an international economist at Goldman Sachs in London: "It is highly likely that the ECB would have to come to the support of a country in payment difficulties. The default of a major debtor such as a government would most likely endanger the entire financial sector of the monetary union, and the ECB would be called on as the lender of last resort to avoid a collapse of the banking system. Financial market participants would therefore most likely discriminate among different government borrowers much less than could be warranted by economic fundamentals."

<P>
"Of course they can't say that high debts won't be a problem," says Mary Bloem, an Ecu and euro bond strategist at Paribas in London. "That would immediately create a very strong free-rider incentive. However, if a country does step out of line, it will have a strong spill-over effect in the form of a higher structural level of yields. The euro would weaken and so I think that confronted with such a situation, if things got really bad, the country would be bailed out." 

<P>
Another US bank economist adds: "We need to know how real the no-bail-out clause is and the degree to which it is believed it will have an impact on the credit spread at which issues trade. We don't feel it is terribly likely that countries will be allowed to go broke. Individual countries can't devalue but collectively they will be able to monetize the debt [issue more paper]. [The situation] lies somewhere between a complete loss of seigniorage and where it is at the moment, but quite where is unclear. Some of the more aggressive assumptions about credit spreads are perhaps a little too optimistic but sovereigns are not going to trade as if you were viewing them as corporates."

<P>
Traders say that a feel for how the new euro market will be traded can be gained by looking at today's credit-driven debt markets, where credit-spread trading has increasingly become separated from interest rate directional trading. In theory those trading credit spreads are not taking directional risk. In the German Pfandbrief market, for example, borrowers are now often traded on spread versus Libor or versus governments, regardless of which government or which Libor that is. 

<P>
"A while ago you used to see people trading Euro-Deutschmarks with a Deutschmark book, French franc Euros with a French franc book and so on," says a London-based trader. "As the liquidity in the individual Euromarkets has dried up, banks have begun to trade generic credit spreads out of one book regardless of currency. You may well see the same development in the future euro government markets. It's possible that you'll start to look at Emu member governments from the perspective of credit spreads versus some benchmark, perhaps the euro Libor curve or some benchmark government yet to be decided by the market." 

<P>
In such a trading environment, macroeconomic analysis looks vulnerable as a research function, although banks will require analysts able to address the issue of where the European economy as a whole is going. "There may be some good employment opportunities for those types during phases A, B and C when we are looking to see if the convergence rates are sustainable," says Steven Major, an Emu expert at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in Paris.

<P>
With fewer markets and probably less volatility within the euro market, it is likely that many bond traders will lose their jobs. Individual currency desks will be a thing of the past. It is expected that each bank will end up with at most two dealing rooms &#173; even the likes of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) are busy closing down dealing rooms right across Europe. The losses may be partly offset by the shift of intra-European volumes to the borders, trading the euro market versus the US dollar market for example, but bond strategists say the scale of such activity is difficult to predict. Traders are having to be philosophical about the changes. As one put it: "There isn't a lot of point in doing the whole thing unless we get a significant reduction in the number of people involved in the business."

<P>
<B>Securitization boom</B>

<P>
For sales, on the other hand, unless there is massive consolidation among funds, there is unlikely to be a significant reduction in the number of accounts that need to be covered. However, the investment decisions of clients in the new market may well change, so sales personnel will need to become conversant with new products. Investors that favour diversification, for example, are likely to find themselves more drawn towards emerging markets. They are also more likely to be interested in products such as credit swaps and asset swaps that will give them different yield enhancement for their portfolio. "Provided banks can provide structures that work for the buy side," says one banker, "there will always be issuers who see the demand for these types of products."

<P>
Bets on the continuing convergence have already caused many traditionally conservative fund managers to look at markets a long way from Germany and western Europe. "The chances of making a lot of money through market selection within Europe are much lower with Emu," says Paul Cavalier, a director at Lombard Odier International Portfolio Management in London. "We might emphasize more the allocation between the major currency blocs and we'll have to look further afield into emerging markets if our clients let us. Otherwise, we'll focus more on duration decisions and how to add value that way."

<P>
"Banks will have to think more laterally," adds Major at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais. "We have the prospect of a booming securitization market for debt in Europe, although these markets are still in their infancy. There will also be a lot of refinancing of privatized utilities to be done &#173; if anything, the pace of sell-offs should accelerate as countries try to meet the deficit criteria. Such borrowers may want to look at many different types of instrument, so origination and structured financing will be interesting areas." 

<P>
Europe's corporate bond markets are undeveloped at present but strategists say the new opportunity of marketing to an Emu-wide public could prompt takeoff. "The coming years will hopefully give us a lot more opportunities to sell normal government bonds and move to a German corporate or French agency, picking up yield and hoping for it to tighten in," says Lombard Odier's Cavalier. But before that can happen, credit-rating agencies will need to build up an extensive library of credit assessments for potential borrowers.

<P>
<B>Repo riddle</B>

<P>
Refinancing of banks and the effect on bond markets is still an area of discussion. Ultimately, however, say Emu enthusiasts, the single currency should have a hugely beneficial and expansionary impact on the repo market. "It is already clear that the main method of implementing monetary policy by the European Central Bank will be repos with itself," says Bishop. "To the extent that there is eventually a very large, homogeneous bond market, the way in which the dealers such as ourselves will finance ourselves is via repos, and the fact that the UK gilts market has gone to open repos is symbolic of the way modern markets are moving. Repos look set to be a major financial instrument and a major source of competition from the securities market for banks. The corporate treasurer or bank looking for a Libor-plus short-term asset will be very happy to have a loan to a securities dealer collateralized by a zero-risk-weighted central government bond."

<P>
But not everyone is so convinced that once all debt is denominated in euros there will be a single repo rate. "You might get a generic premium for repoing say German bonds over Italian bonds and then on top of that a bond-specific premium," says one bond strategist. "There may be one reference rate, but it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be one monetary policy in Europe. Assuming T-bills are separately auctioned in each market, there will be some difference due to perceptions of prevailing conditions. Once you allow for the fact that short-term paper can trade at different spreads in different markets, I'm not totally convinced you are going to get a homogeneous repo market."

<P>
However, unless European payments systems can be integrated, borrowers from central banks will not be able to use their bonds in one payment system to cross-collateralize borrowings in another.

<P>
It is expected that the ECB will not discriminate on the eligibility of euro government bonds for repo (repurchase agreements), in effect blurring the distinctions between different issuers at the short end of the curve. If there is a credit differential, banks will be expected to repo the cheapest-to-deliver bonds to the ECB &#173; perhaps Italian, Belgian or Spanish government bonds, rather than Bunds. Does this mean that the cheaper bonds will enjoy greater liquidity than the more expensive, and more liquid futures?

<P>
It is still unclear as to whether one generic futures contract will be sufficient to hedge the bonds of all Emu governments. The most likely scenario, say traders, is that there will be one liquid contract, to track most probably either French or German government bonds, depending on which one has the most attractive characteristics. In addition, there might be demand for more niche contracts, for example to hedge the credit-spread basis risk between Italian government bonds and French or German benchmarks. 

<P>
According to Bloem at Paribas, the Ecu market provides an interesting pointer as to what might happen. Between 1990 and 1991, both Matif and Liffe launched 10-year Ecu futures contracts in an effort to gain market share in what was seen as the single-currency market to be. The contracts were more or less the same &#173; one major difference was the type of deliverable bonds: Ecu-denominated OATs into the Matif contract and a basket of various triple A rated issuers into the Liffe contract. The Liffe basket included Ecu OATs, European Investment Bank bonds, UK gilts and Italian government bonds. Although in theory all bonds had the same rating, in practice there was always one country's bond that was cheaper to deliver, so in the end the Liffe contract proved an unsatisfactory hedging tool. "It shows that in the euro environment one has to be very careful in introducing basket-type euro futures contracts," says Bloem. "But the higher the level of fiscal coordination and transfers, the less need there will be for separate contracts." With the huge volume of euros, it is likely that a number of futures contracts will develop at various points along the yield curve. Trading is expected to be broken down into sections of the curve, with traders trading all credits in that section. 

<P>
Primary dealing in government bonds is expected to remain the preserve of national markets. Major issuing states, including the UK, Germany and France, require banks to have a local presence and meet local supervisory standards, and the EC has no plans to alter this situation in the short term. "There is nothing in the Maastricht treaty saying that it ought to change," says one Brussels insider. "It's a misconception that the treaty creates a single financial market. There is no reason why market conventions should change &#173; look at the US, where they vary from state to state. In any case, such decisions are unlikely until the operational phase is fully under way in 2002 or 2003." 

<P>
<B>Deposit migration </B>

<P>
Nevertheless, banks grouped in one country will no longer have protection in the form of currency differentiation. German banks, for example, stand to lose the advantage of sharing a common passport with the world's second-strongest currency. "German banks will have no natural advantage over, say, French or Dutch banks in competing for euro business," says Brendan Brown, a European strategist at Tokyo-Mitsubishi International  in London. "Some of the huge international holdings of Deutschmark deposits now in Frankfurt are almost certain to migrate to Paris and Amsterdam." Brown adds that the advantage German banks have had in the EuroDeutschmark market will also not carry over into the euro capital market. "Parochial rules now in force such as issuing banks in Deutschmarks having to have a full subsidiary in Frankfurt will be swept aside. Moreover, German banks could face revolt in their lucrative domestic corporate loan business." 

<P>
German bankers, though, remain confident about the future. "Technically speaking, of course, the Deutschmark will cease to exist," says Jan Gindra, head of debt origination and syndication at Commerzbank in London. "But the fact is that all the large issuers that we have been bringing to the market in Deutschmarks will continue to issue in euros. Germany has so many funding requirements due to the reconstruction of the country. So we expect to be very well positioned. Borrowers from outside Germany will also go where the demand is, which is Germany."

<P>
The race is also on among Emu governments to become the benchmark issuer &#173; and France appears to be winning. The French have a very streamlined, liquid, benchmark-oriented market, with the added bonus of a strips market. There is a lot of pressure on other countries to restructure their bond markets in order to be able to compete.

<P>
By making such a strong effort to make its OATs fungible with the Ecu &#173; many of the coupons are of a similar size and paid on the same day in Ecu and French francs, and all Ecu paper is 1:1 convertible with the euro &#173; the market should very quickly be in place to show the value of a euro versus a French franc bond. The spread is contracting all the time. The Republic of Korea, which issued in Eurofrancs recently, is known to have been influenced by the possibility of getting an early foothold in the euro market &#173; it considers the Eurofranc market to be a prelude to the new market. 

<P>
German banks counter that Germany is adapting fast and that its paper has always been seen as more reliable than that of other European issuers. Besides, says Michael Lewis, senior European economist at DMG in London, the principle that today anchors government bond issues to their domestic market may fall away. Banks may lose automatic access to the top table for issues in their own country. "It's going to be the placement ability of the bank that counts," he says.

<P>
The race to become Emu's benchmark issuer looks as if it will cause redenomination of government bonds to accelerate after monetary union begins. Disincentives to redenominate include the cost of reissuance and the problems associated with rounding. Nevertheless, France and Belgium committed themselves some time ago to converting their existing government debt to euros as soon as the single currency is introduced on January 1 1999. Now it looks as if Germany will do the same &#173; the Bundesbank has been hinting as much for some time and bankers expect an official announcement soon. 

<P>
"The pressure is building up from the German market participants," says Mark Fox, chief European strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. "Paris stole a march over Frankfurt in the Ecu market simply because of the amount of Ecu issuance from the French government and French borrowers. The Germans are anxious not to let the same thing happen on the euro. They want to be in round one of the competition."

<P>
<B>Illiquidity threat</B>

<P>
There are many other issues still to be decided, including the timetable and mechanics for the redenomination of  debt and the schedule on which governments will issue new bonds &#173; for example, will it be coordinated or will it be allowed to be opportunistic? 

<P>
Those closely involved in the consultative process such as Bishop at Salomon Brothers are confident that all these can be resolved: "So far a lot of technical work has been done and there are no deal breakers. Nobody has uncovered things &#173; including information technology issues &#173; where it is manifestly obvious that it can't be done."

<P>
But a topic that has begun to surface in closed meetings is how to avoid the future illiquidity of government bond issues. "People say it will be one big market, that's nonsense," says Stephen Bell, chief economist at DMG in London. "You'll still have a Bund market, an OAT market, etcetera. They may be more homogeneous but they won't be fungible. There's no incentive for governments to do that."

<P>
Concerns over liquidity will be exacerbated because countries will be issuing less debt, squeezed by the stability pact and a continued application of the Maastricht criteria. Chris Golden, chief economist at Nomura Securities in London, warns that unless individual bond issues are big they will be as illiquid as Japanese government bond issues. That might demand the politically unthinkable, a central issuing agency for benchmark euro government debt.

<P>
Connolly at AIG Trading forecasts that for political reasons the Emu governments will move towards a US treasury-like central entity, or a kind of European Monetary Fund, to cope with asymmetrical shocks between countries. This will happen either by stealth, or because of some internal Emu financial crisis. A central borrowing agency is not foreseen in the Maastricht treaty and it is dismissed by most pro-Emu politicians as politically incorrect. But Connolly foresees an Emu central treasury as a Trojan Horse. It would open the way to Emu's ultimate goal, a European economic government for core Emu countries. 

<P>
With so many loose ends, banks will find it difficult to decide on the correct allocation of resources for the new system.

<B>Is Martin Taylor's halo slipping?</B>
</H2>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>With his fluent MBA-speak and breezy openness Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays, has charmed shareholders and colleagues alike. But is their rapturous applause of his every move overdone? Is Taylor a genius or just brilliant at public relations? Brian Caplen analyzes the man and his strategy </B>
</H4>
<font size=3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the evidence of his most ardent supporters Martin Taylor, chief executive of the British clearing bank Barclays, is destined for nothing less than sainthood. Appointed two years ago to do one of the toughest jobs in UK banking, he has convinced shareholders and staff that he is the bank's saviour.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ask a Taylorite to characterize the man and a string of superlatives gushes forth: brilliant intellectual, warm personality, rational, intuitive, tough, humane, erudite, approachable, far-sighted, down-to-earth, an outsider, insightful. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But, given the failure of the British banks to become leading international players, are the tireless efforts of even the most talented individual enough to make Barclays world-class? 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One or two analysts who remain stubbornly outside the Taylor adoration circle are beginning to wonder. They argue that in spite of Taylor's undoubted qualities, the underlying substance of what he has achieved at Barclays is less than it appears. The debate over loan-loss provisions, the share buy-backs, the internal restructuring, the focus on Europe - all have been much more dramatic at the ideas stage than in their ultimate effect. These analysts say what he has done so far is to re-engineer the bank in a short-term way rather than set it on a long-term growth path. The debate will get fiercer as Taylor's term of office lengthens and there is a longer track record to judge him by. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But, whatever blows are traded between his supporters and the much smaller group of detractors, Taylor will undoubtedly be remembered as a radical who broke the cultural mould in UK banking. At the minimum, he will be credited with bringing up-to-date management thinking into a conservative industry even if he doesn't achieve major strategic breakthroughs. How did a young man (by the standards of British banking at least - Taylor is 43), with no previous banking experience, get himself into a position where he could be considered for such accolades?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As with many high-fliers, Taylor owes his success to a combination of talent, determination and good fortune. He was born in<BR>
Burnley, an unglamorous town in Britain's de-industrialized north, and a long way from the bright lights of the City of London. When Taylor was eight, his accountant father died,  and his stepfather, who ran his own pharmaceuticals wholesaling business, sent him to a preparatory school, where he won a scholarship to Eton. Already he was beginning to display a diversity of intellectual interests and an unwillingness to be channelled by the education system along any one road. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although naturally drawn to classics, he studied maths and science in the last years of school because he felt "desperately ill-educated in that area", and then went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1970 to read English. After a few weeks he fell out with the English department and decided to switch to Chinese, but the dons insisted he stuck out the first year before changing. That meant completing a three-year Chinese course in two years, and may explain why he didn't obtain a first-class degree. "I was awfully frivolous at Oxford. I spent more time reading other people's subjects than my own," Taylor once recalled. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Four-year attention span</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His butterfly tendencies were to the fore when it came to selecting a career: he chose journalism, the favoured pursuit of those with short attention spans and low boredom thresholds. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He didn't even pick financial journalism, the more solid and respectable end of the profession, and was somewhat irritated when it picked him. In his first job at Reuters, the agency put him on the economics desk, a subject he says, "it would never have occurred to me to read". He worked for Reuters in London, Paris and Frankfurt for four years before joining the <I>Financial Times</I> in 1978 where he became editor of the Lex column, which analyzes corporate performance. It was in this role that Taylor gained his insights into the workings of British companies, clearly thinking he could do better than existing management. Eventually, he launched himself into a business career. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"He was a very good analyst and was interested in the characters of the people who ran companies and how this influenced the way they managed," says Barry Riley, a <I>Financial Times</I> journalist who was editor of Lex while Taylor was an assistant. "He was always very critical [of companies] and very ambitious, but it was a surprise when he went into industry. We thought he might get one of the FT's top foreign postings in New York or Paris."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An often-stated maxim of Taylor's during his time as a journalist was that he never did a job for more than four years, and in 1982 he duly switched track completely by joining the chemicals group Courtaulds. Legend has it that Courtaulds' chairman, Sir Christopher Hogg, was so impressed with Taylor's performance as a questioner at a press conference that he offered him a job on the strength of it. While this may have made a good headline for the colleagues Taylor left behind, it is incorrect. Hogg and Taylor knew each other socially through mutual friends at Oxford and when Taylor decided the time was right to leave the FT he went to Hogg for advice. "I said he could do worse than come into industry but was not sure that he would want to because things were very difficult at that time," says Hogg.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Taylor, perhaps influenced by his northern heritage, wanted to get his hands dirty. He turned down offers to do stockbroking research in the City in order to tackle the problems of a British firm trying to stay competitive in the cheap-labour businesses of  cloth and underwear manufacture. "There were tons and tons of talented people in the City," he said in a newspaper interview while still at Courtaulds. "I couldn't see myself making a significant contribution really, and I did feel that industry was far more in need of people than the City."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Starting out as Hogg's personal assistant in order to learn the business, Taylor became chairman of Courtauld Textiles in July 1988 and chief executive of the company in 1990 when it demerged from the group. Along the way he was involved in his fair share of factory closures, rationalizing the business so that while turnover may have declined, profits and earnings per share improved.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was this track record that attracted Barclays' headhunters to Taylor at the same time as Taylor was himself thinking about moving. "You don't expect me to be chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles for the rest of my life?" he confided to a City friend over lunch in mid-1993. Whether the corporate grapevine was working is unclear, but within weeks came the announcement that Taylor would be the new chief executive at Barclays. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For beleaguered shareholders at Barclays, the appointment was "almost too good to be true", to quote one. Barclays shares rose 4% on the news, while Courtaulds Textiles stock fell 2.6%. Investors were still recovering from the shock of Barclays' &#163;244 million ($380 million) pre-tax loss in 1992 because of imprudent property lending and the effects of the UK recession. The reporting of first-half profits of &#163;335 million for 1993 had cheered them a little, as did the acceleration in earnings at Barclays' investment banking arm BZW, but there was ongoing concern about Andrew Buxton combining the roles of chairman and chief executive of the group. Taylor's appointment was a welcome relief to shareholders and many employees worried about the bank's future. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What they saw in Taylor was a man of great breadth, displaying the varied qualities required of the boss of a large and complex company. An intellectual genius who speaks five languages besides the Chinese he read at Oxford, and who does sums mentally faster than colleagues with calculators, Taylor is nevertheless noted for his intuitive approach to management and for sometimes trusting gut feelings over fully rational decisions. "My stomach is almost always right," he once said. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While noted for his success in business restructuring and for taking the tough measures necessary to get a company back in shape, Taylor is also admired for his human qualities: an ability to talk to employees at all levels on common terms; a penchant for discussion along with an openness to new ideas and criticism; a persona and charm that enable him to convert opponents to his way of thinking. Taylor's character is full of contradictory facets that would probably be destructive in someone less accomplished, but in his case they seem to enhance his flexibility. The upshot is someone whose background is middle-class but whose independent stance makes him always seem the outsider. At Courtaulds while working among manufacturers he was regarded as a City person; at Barclays, ironically, he is seen as a manufacturer by some and as a business manager by others, but by no-one as a banker. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taylor sees his independence as positive in management terms. "It has helped me enormously not to be a Barclays insider," he says. "I also think it helped me quite a lot not to have the ideas of another bank and be comparing those with the way Barclays does things, much to the annoyance of my colleagues."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Personality overstretch</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Socially, Taylor is seen as aloof yet convivial. Riley of the <I>Financial Times</I> recalls that "Taylor was never a great socializer and definitely not one of the lads, but was easy to get on with". Hogg says: "He was a joy to work with. He is very rational but also very human with a good sense of humour. Unlike a lot of people he never had an axe to grind."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drawing on his background as a journalist, Taylor has proven to be adept at promoting his ideas through the media. He tries to see as many as possible of the journalists and analysts who request interviews and meetings. But while eagerly stepping into the limelight on behalf of the bank, he stays as far away as possible when he leaves work. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Little is known about his private life except that he is married with two daughters, lives in Blackheath (a pleasant area of London but not one patronized by the rich and famous), and lists his interests as reading, music, travel and architecture. He is known to enjoy walking, a time he uses for thinking and talking aloud to himself about complex issues. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taylor admits that he is not hugely extrovert and that his public role at Barclays causes him "personality overstretch" - hardly surprising given the number of roles he is required to play. He can be visibly nervous on occasions, as during his first annual general meeting with Barclays when 200 members of the Struggle Against Financial Exploitation (Safe) staged noisy protests over what they saw as the bank's poor treatment of its customers. A quaking Taylor refused to stand to make his report and said he was more comfortable sitting. Predictably, Taylor's salary, then pegged at &#163;737,500, drew hostility and one share-<BR>
holder said that his move from Courtaulds seemed to be "like a football club hiring a synchronized swimmer". 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But away from the rough and tumble of shareholders' meetings, it's difficult to find anyone who has a negative slant on Taylor, in respect of his personal qualities. One or two analysts complain that when the going gets tough, Taylor rounds on them personally rather than answering the question. Many who know him complain that he simply talks far too fast. "He has so many ideas pouring out of his brain, it's difficult for us mere mortals to keep up," says Robin Gilbert, a City investment analyst who has known Taylor since he worked as a journalist. Taylor underwent speech therapy to slow himself down and Gilbert says he is now speaking at about a quarter of his original speed. He adds: "What you see is what you get with Taylor. No-one has any negative words to say about him." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As far as Barclays' shareholders and senior employees are concerned, Taylor's magic spell remains unbroken since the day he joined the bank. Barclays' shares trade at a premium to other UK banks and senior executives are enthralled with the open working environment their chief executive has fostered. Noted for his relaxed manner and casual dress, Taylor began his job at Barclays by describing bankers as "pompous and stuffy". 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a more recent interview, he told <I>Euromoney</I> that Barclays suffered in the past from "confusing formality with discipline". He said it reminded him of an ancient, hierarchical culture where people believed that if they obeyed certain rituals the sun would automatically shine and the rain would certainly fall. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"What we want is a culture where people don't feel the need to come to meetings and never take their jackets off, and read out a 14-page prepared document. That's a waste of time," he says. "I want a culture where people have read the documents, where the documents are good and clear, where they can be challenged and discussed quickly and decisions made."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many Barclays executives were clearly desperate to break out of the straitjacket of a civil service-style formality that existed at the bank prior to Taylor's arrival. These days they are enthusiastic as they explain the bank's<BR>
new thinking.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"There is an open and questioning environment," says Brandon Davies, treasurer for UK banking services. "At one time people never questioned policy; now asking questions is encouraged and ideas are coming from much lower levels. We are creating a fluid organization. At first there was some insecurity about changes but, as they have gone on, people have become more relaxed about it. They realize that change can come about without them losing their status in the bank." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, so infectious has Taylor's quest for change become that some staff are urging him to go faster. Taylor recently told a colleague that, when he first joined the bank and visited retail branches, they complained of how impossible it was to keep up with the pace of technological and market change. Now when he talks to them they worry that the bank isn't going fast enough. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Says one Taylorite at Barclays: "I would like to see things being done faster. Martin Taylor is very much on his own, maybe he needs a think-tank around him to get the process moving quicker." But the complaint of one or two hard-nosed analysts is much more fundamental. They ask: "What exactly is the process?" Likeable as they find Taylor, and much as they welcome his openness to their enquiries, they still find his strategy for the bank lacking. They accuse him of bewitching the market by telling shareholders what they want to hear and yet failing to provide the bank with a solid growth plan. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"A lot of what Martin Taylor has done is to give voice to concerns [about Barclays] and to deal with them in a way that is slightly alien to a lot of his peers," says Gerry Rawcliffe, senior analyst at UK-based ratings agency Ibca. "But there is a slight element, when you are listening to him, that you are listening to an MBA speak, and you wonder what the substance is." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rawcliffe adds that a lot of the thinking at Barclays is in line with general thinking at UK banks and was being put into practice before Taylor arrived. These include such things as improved risk management, the best use of capital and the blurring of the boundaries between the commercial and the investment bank so that large corporate customers are provided with a kind of one-stop shop for loans as well as security issuing and M&amp;A advisory services. "How much [of this] is attributable to Martin Taylor is questionable," says Rawcliffe. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jenny Alexander, associate director at Ibca, says: "Barclays would have recovered and would be doing very well whether they had appointed Martin Taylor or not. It will take five or 10 years to properly judge his performance."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Less patient observers say the market will not allow Taylor that long and they feel that most of the measures taken so far have not addressed the crucial issues. Some analysts detect Taylor's Courtaulds restructuring formula being reapplied at Barclays and they are starting to be concerned about its limitations. Courtaulds Textiles has not fared so well since Taylor left. "Barclays is playing good bank, bad bank. The theory is, if you get rid of the bad bank, you will be left with the good bank. Fair enough: the problem is where do you find growth?" says Norrie Morrison, who recently joined Nikko Europe as a banking analyst. Before this Morrison was with Kleinwort Benson where he co-wrote a critical report on Barclays, published last summer, in which he advised investors to "sell Barclays, buy Lloyds".
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chief among Morrison's criticisms of Taylor's strategy is his decision to shrink the loan book, especially loans to large corporates where margins are thin. Taylor's argument is that lending to large corporates long ago became a commodity business with poor earnings and is interesting only if it leads to fee income for other services. Large banks did it because they always had, without asking why. Taylor's strategy is to carry only lending that is genuinely profitable or essential to secure a profitable relationship. Barclays' executives say they have been so bold as to ask corporate customers what the minimum participation in a syndication would be that would entitle the bank to be considered for other business.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Questionable assumptions</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to the Kleinwort Benson report, shareholders were led to believe that while Barclays suffered from reduced income during 1994, this was the price to pay for the transition to a higher-quality business. Margins had improved and would continue to as the bank took on new business. The report questions this assumption and says: "Barclays is in a volume/margin squeeze; while its net interest margin is supported by a shrinking loan book, any attempt to resume lending will remove this benefit". 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By contrast "Lloyds [a rival UK clearing bank] has succeeded in growing its income by being less aggressive on pricing in 1993 and 1994". The report also says that Barclays' costs are less firmly under control than Lloyds', and that Barclays' emphasis on the investment banking side of the business will lead to a more volatile earnings stream.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sceptical analysts are also dismissive of Taylor's emphasis on risk management and his much-trumpeted share buy-backs. Admirers believe he has made considerable progress by making individuals responsible for loans rather than committees and making everyone in the bank more risk-aware. But Morrison says: "There are analysts around who recall being lectured by Barclays on risk management back in 1986. They thought they had it cracked then and they were one of the last banks to suffer in the recession, but they didn't escape. Risk management is fundamental but it doesn't help you grow the business." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is more, a key Taylor initiative on risk failed to take off. He wanted to allocate a certain amount of capital against individual loans based on the risk of default as well as to make general provisions in case some of them went bad. The aim was to get a better picture of the bank's risk profile and make allowances for it. But this move partly misfired because the bank's auditors and the Inland Revenue said these new provisions could not be tax-deductible in the same way that provisions against specific bad debts are. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The debates about risk and lending margins are closely connected with another Taylor-inspired debate about how much capital a bank should have. If a bank can assess its risks better and allocate capital accordingly, and if it pulls out of high-risk, low-margin business, it may need less capital. Rather than use the excess capital imprudently, as banks have always been accused of doing, far better to hand it back to the shareholders, says Taylor. He calculates that Barclays needs between &#163;6.5 billion and &#163;7 billion of capital and has led two share repurchases: one last year involving &#163;180 million worth of shares and another costing &#163;306 million in February.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tim Clarke, director of broker Panmure Gordon, is unimpressed. "They're only buying back 2% chunks of shares. That's not capital buy-back, that's short-term capital adjustment. To say 'we've got 2% too much capital' is highly contentious. No-one can tell within 2% whether they have too much. I doubt whether they can tell within 5% or 10%."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clarke links the disappointment over the buy-back to Taylor's management style. "He is good at grabbing headlines and being up with the latest thing that analysts and the press want to hear about. But the follow-through is beginning to be disappointing."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clarke cites the failure of Barclays to articulate its European strategy as another example. As part of the management restructuring that Taylor carried out in 1994, Carlos Martinez de Campo was put in charge of the entire European retail business and given a reporting line direct to Taylor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This was a surprising move given the small amount of total assets and profits that Europe accounts for. "One of the key strategic questions for Barclays must be its strategy in Europe. It's been one of the problem areas," says Clarke. "The signal [the reshuffle] gave was that Barclays was going to take a major initiative in Europe on the retail side, that it was going to expand in some dramatic way." So far no such move has been announced. Asks Clarke: "How long can the jury [judging Taylor's performance] stay out? You've got to see results." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taylor says that with European retail, "we didn't sit around talking about strategy. The place was just bleeding. We have been trying to get rid of the bits that were dangerous". A strategy of focusing on the upper-middle market with a strong asset-management slant is now in place. On share buy-backs, Taylor comes close to agreeing with his critics. "It's something we will do as often as we need. It's a capital management programme."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although some financial-sector analysts have their doubts about the Taylor approach, the stock market has been giving him the benefit of the doubt (the share price fell after the 1995 results announcement on February 27, but it recovered later on news of the latest buy-back). 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taylor could still win the argument if he can find other sources of growth apart from lending and demonstrate over time that Barclays uses capital better than its competitors. The purchase of asset manager Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors for $440 million in mid-1995 was a very clear example of the way his mind is working. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Combining this business with that of BZW Asset Management has created one of the leading institutional fund managers in the world. Taylor sees this as a growth area which should provide a stable earnings stream, which is sharp contrast to the flows from investment banking. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He once told a group of analysts that asset management would be Barclays' fourth box of activity, with the other three being retail, commercial and investment banking, and there is speculation that the asset management side could be pulled out of BZW and given independent status. "[The acquisition of Wells Fargo Nikko] was Taylor's first deal [as Barclays CEO]," says a Barclays executive close to the deal. "He was terribly enthusiastic about it." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Last month Taylor visited Japan for the second time since becoming chief executive and, while it was his chiding of Japanese banks for failing to write down their bad loans that caught the newspaper headlines, the real purpose of his visit was almost certainly to convince pension fund managers there of<BR>
the advantages of using third-party invest-<BR>
ment managers. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since Japanese public and pension fund assets currently stand at $2 trillion, and are expected to increase to $3 trillion by 2000, and since only between 3% and 4% of the total corporate funds are externally managed - compared with nearly 40% in the US - there are some rich pickings on offer.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Can Taylor find other seams to mine as potentially lucrative as this one? If so, the sceptics may not want to be reminded of their present scribblings in a few years time, and Taylor's halo may remain in place.&#009;
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>What his boss thinks</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The reason Martin Taylor hasn't made more dramatic strategic changes at Barclays is that he wasn't supposed to, says his boss, chairman Andrew Buxton. The thinking behind his appointment was to bring in fresh ideas from outside and to change the management style, not change the fundamental business. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
"The basic strategy hasn't changed," says Buxton. "Barclays is a successful business and Martin has focused us fairly clearly on having a stable, quality business. It's a track we were on before he arrived but not to the same extent."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Buxton says comment by journalists and analysts about the lack of change "is a function of huge expectations that were hyped in the media quite unnecessarily" after Taylor's appointment. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
"I don't think that many people in the media appreciate that there was a recovery going on at Barclays anyway and that we had changed the strategy of the group before Martin arrived. They expected Martin to sell this and buy that, but that's not Martin's philosophy. He wasn't satisfied with the quality of the portfolio and, for example, has tackled the French business very aggressively over the past two years, but he hasn't changed the basic strategy [of the group]. He <I>has</I> changed the way the group is managed and the focus on management issues is much greater than before." 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Buxton says that officially the chairman is responsible for strategy but, in practice, both he and Taylor work together on it. "I am not going to take a strategic decision before we have talked it through together."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Before Taylor's appointment Buxton was criticized for holding both posts and he says with hindsight he wished he had split the roles earlier, not for reasons of corporate governance, but because of the practicalities of managing a company as large as Barclays. It has made possible some of the Taylor innovations, such as increasing the number of people who report directly to the chief executive and improving staff access to<BR>
the CEO.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Buxton admits that banks can be hierarchical places with committee cultures. "I was always worried I would be brainwashed by the system before I reached a senior enough position to change things," he says. "I like to think this didn't happen. I am quite prepared to challenge the group over what's best for the business. Martin and I are both business managers." <B><I>- BC</I></B>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>The homilies of St Martin</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>On management style</B> I think people have got individual styles of management but I believe they should be a reasonably broad spectrum because the style of management appropriate to one situation can be different to that required by another. A manager who only has one tool kit can get into trouble if he or she meets a situation that doesn't fit it. I don't like being typecast as a particular sort of manager because it suggests I'm only happy in a particular type of situation. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>On understanding a business </B>I spent an awful lot of time [in 1994], about six months or so, trying to build an intellectual map of the business so that I understood the linkages and also understood that when something happened externally what that meant for all parts of our business. It takes quite a long time to build that model but I find it quite hard to operate without one. I think I have got one now. It's not at all perfect. It looks like one of those maps that people drew in the 17th century: China is too small and the great southern continent is half there and half not there, but it gets better every day as the details are filled in. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>On not being a banker </B>I try to be myself. I think there are some admirable things about bankers. I haven't got 20 years of history or banking experience in my head but I do have strong feelings about what is good and bad banking, and I'm very clear on where I want Barclays to go. There are two perils that an outsider faces in an organization like this one: one is to be sucked in, the other is to be rejected. The line between the two is quite narrow and in my early days here I found it not all that easy to navigate. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>On dress code</B> I have never had any views on dress code. I think people have to be comfortable the way they are. People have to be free to express their own personalities and I would encourage them to do that. But I try to make the meetings I go to more business-like and less formulaic and get way from the idea that we have a meeting every Tuesday and that's the kind of meeting we have. There was an awful lot of old ideas carrying on in the business where people were doing things because they always had. We had just forgotten why we here and what we were trying to do.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>On changing people's attitudes </B>Its difficult [to do] with some, not difficult with others. I think some people [at Barclays] have been very relieved to have things done differently, not all of them were happy. The business was not totally successful and there was a lot of concern. People knew that what they were doing wasn't working. I found I came into a business where, if anything, the problem was they expected magical results too quickly. They weren't opposed to change.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Relationships between commercial and investment banks </B>The principal differences between investment banks and commercial banks arise from the fact that a commercial bank has franchise income and endowment income so you know, at the beginning of the year, if you do nothing you are going to get some money through the door. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
An investment bank doesn't [know this] except on businesses like asset management. There is automatically a greater sense of urgency and that drives a whole lot of other differences and behaviour, such as compensation packages which are the symptoms of this rather than the root cause. They are different sorts of business to run. That said there are considerable linkages between them and one of my most serious objectives has been to get the boundaries between businesses right, because they were wrong, and to make them boundaries rather than barbed-wire fences, and to create synergies across the businesses. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Size of bank capital </B>I don't believe capital is the great icon. It's unhealthy for institutions to have too much. They tend to get flabby. In the cycle, the time when banks have most capital is the time when they shouldn't be spending it. At a time of low credit asset growth and low inflation we can invest heavily in the business - for example we bought Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors for around $440 million - and still have substantial capital. If you have too much you find it burns a hole in your pocket and you do something silly with it. <B><I>- BC</I></B>

<H3>DEUTSCHE TELEKOM</H3> 
<H2>Nowhere to hide </H2>
<H4>So much rests on the success of the Dm15 billion share issue for Deutsche
Telekom, scheduled for November - not least the credibility of Frankfurt
as a financial centre. But the odds are stacking up against a trouble-free
issue. There's discontent in the top-heavy syndicate, the anti-trust measures
under which Telekom will operate are still not clear, the German economy
looks shaky and there are no plans to sweeten retail investors. Laura Covill
reports </H4>
In the first week of 1996, irate customers smashed windows at the Deutsche
Telekom shop in Kassel, north of Frankfurt, and showered it with protest
leaflets. Every television satirist in Germany tore into Deutsche Telekom
in the following weeks, mocking the dense logic and baffling doublespeak
that accompanied a new scale of charges introduced at the beginning of the
year. Telekom made matters worse when it transpired it had inadvertently
charged some New Year's Day callers at peak rates, netting an embarrassing
extra Dm13 million ($8.8 million) because of a computer error. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is happening regularly,&quot; says one alarmed Frankfurt banker.
&quot;First there was the theft of telephone card units, then the sex services
charging exorbitant rates to unwitting customers. And now this. People just
don't believe Telekom any more. They're prepared to think the worst.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Such disasters have recently turned Germany's main telecommunications provider
into public enemy number one. Can this be the same company which hopes to
spark a German shareholder revolution, whip investors into a frenzy of enthusiasm
and raise Dm15 billion towards the end of this year? <BR>
<BR>
In panic, Telekom has thrown money at the image problem. It spent Dm40 million
compensating customers for the Dm13 million gaffe and has run an apologetic
advertising campaign that smacks of desperation. But the near-monopoly has
no good news to tell to attract investors to its initial public offering.
Despite the vital importance of the issue, Telekom's story is still too
nebulous to convince any sceptical private investor, let alone professionals,
that Europe's biggest-ever share offer will fly. <BR>
<BR>
If it doesn't, not only will Telekom fail to raise the amount it needs for
investment, but the credibility of Frankfurt itself will suffer as a hub
of equity capital-raising. The Bonn government has insisted that the work
of the German syndicate members must be done out of Germany. It is said
to have asked Deutsche Bank to manage the issue entirely out of Frankfurt
rather than doing the deal from London, where it was about to move its investment
bank. The newly-acquired Kleinwort Benson is also firmly excluded from Dresdner
Bank's Telekom team in Germany, although the Dresdner subsidiary is a member
of the UK syndicate. Leading figures at Goldman are criticized by German
banks for having to fly in from London for meetings. <BR>
<BR>
Retail investors at home are the key to this issue and, if they don't buy
Telekom this year, they are hardly likely to go for the second tranche in
1998 - let alone the flotation of Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Post or Postbank
over the next five years. That would scupper Germany's privatization programme.
<BR>
<BR>
The bad news is that the unwieldy 22-bank syndicate with its three global
coordinators is riven with internal politics. The choice of Goldman Sachs
as one of the three injured the pride of Deutsche and Dresdner. They're
obliged to treat Goldman as an equal despite the fact that two-thirds of
the issue volume is expected to be raised in Germany. &quot;It's incredible
to think they found it necessary to appoint a global coordinator with real
clout in only one tranche,&quot; says one of Telekom's German bankers. <BR>
<BR>
So there are three chiefs: at Dresdner, which has special charge of the
German retail market, Euromarket veteran Hansgeorg Hofmann has just taken
over from fellow board member Alfons Titzrath, who retired in December.
Hofmann's style is more boisterous than that of the understated Bernd von
Maltzan of Deutsche, which is in charge of the German institutional market.
Head of German equities at Deutsche, von Maltzan is something of a champion
for German bankers who believe in the independence of <I>Finanzplatz</I>
Frankfurt and are resisting the hegemony of Morgan Grenfell's equities team
in London. Goldman's team, which will orchestrate a sales strategy for institutional
investors outside Germany, is led by partners Scott Mead in London and Philip
Murphy in Frankfurt. <BR>
<BR>
Many banks in the syndicate complain that the lead-time has already been
far too long. Banks started lobbying Telekom, the German finance ministry
and even chancellor Helmut Kohl back in 1992. The three global coordinators
and 19 co-lead managers were named in November 1994 and will have endured
each others' idiosyncrasies for two years by the time the issue comes to
market in November. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's normal for syndicate members to be appointed relatively close
to the actual offering,&quot; says one of the global coordinators. &quot;Two
years is the longest lead-time so far during which global coordinators have
been named. So it has been very difficult to manage the expectations of
the banks in the syndicate.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Discipline is being enforced by Telekom itself, which refuses to tell the
co-leads or even the global coordinators what underwriting quotas they can
expect. &quot;They want to keep the banks on tenterhooks as long as possible,&quot;
says one of Telekom's bankers. <BR>
<BR>
That has upset some German banks which are relatively unused to bookbuilding
and prefer the old fixed-quota system whereby they knew in advance how large
an issue would be, the size of their quota, and how much they would earn.
<BR>
<BR>
The higher-placed co-leads such as Commerzbank, WestLB and DG Bank are closely
matched in placing power and each is fighting to win the largest quota,
as much for prestige as for profits. <BR>
<BR>
They are also watching their backs for new rivals: dozens of other institutions
are seeking an underwriting role via the back-door, soli-citing Telekom,
the finance and post minis-tries, trade unions, political parties and almost
anyone in Bonn who will listen. Lloyds Bank subsidiary Schr&ouml;der M&uuml;nchmeyer
Hengst is believed to be the only bank in Germany which has made a virtue
of staying out of the syndicate, hoping that its aloofness will appeal to
investors looking for impartial advice. <BR>
<BR>
A few big German banks that wish to increase their visibility with international
investors fear that the global coordinators will deny them a place in the
foreign tranches. &quot;The issue is at risk,&quot; says one Frankfurt banker,
&quot;unless all the banks in the syndicate can use their full international
placing power.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some banks boast that they have received private assurances on quotas from
Telekom or the finance ministry, but the global coordinators dismiss such
claims. As far as they are concerned, each bank's share of the issue will
remain open until the last minute. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;At the end of the day, the issuer and the global coordinators will
look at each bank and at how much demand and what quality of demand they
were able to generate - and allocate accordingly,&quot; says a source at
one global coordinator. <BR>
<BR>
The size and the quality of demand are the big unknowns. Telekom must go
to the market this year because the company needs the money for continued
investment and restructuring - and also because it has made a public commitment
to a listing in November. Although the company might have been wiser to
give itself the option of a two-tranche issue extending into 1997, as some
bankers suggested, retreating at this stage would look like an admission
of failure. <BR>
<BR>
The public bravado shown by Telekom's bankers is in stark contrast to their
private concerns about the size and the pricing of the issue. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Pricing misperceptions</B> <BR>
<BR>
Telekom originally said it wanted to raise Dm15 billion during 1996, 60%
of it in the German market and 40% abroad (four international tranches are
scheduled: America; the UK; the rest of Europe; Asia and the rest of the
world). Now bankers estimate that the total placement could be nearer Dm12
billion, with only half of that placed in Germany. <BR>
<BR>
In reality the syndicate will simply raise as much as possible - and hope
that it reaches double figures. The issue's total volume depends on the
price, and predictions of what that will be are becoming more and more hesitant.
Telekom itself has come to realize that it can only speculate about its
earnings potential in two or three years' time. <BR>
<BR>
Telekom finance director Joachim Kr&ouml;ske made a serious gaffe in 1994
by suggesting that the issue price would be around Dm30. The problem is
that that ballpark figure has constantly been repeated in the German press
and sticks in the minds of retail investors. Convincing them of the validity
of another figure may now be difficult. <BR>
<BR>
On the same theme, when the syndicate was first formed, various banks tried
to earn a cheer by setting their analysts to produce detailed reports on
Telekom's financial prospects. A Deutsche Bank Research report dated December
1994 confidently predicted pre-tax profits of Dm6.4 billion in 1995 and
Dm12.7 billion in 2000. Vereinsbank Research made a highly detailed set
of projections the following March (see table page 39). <BR>
<BR>
Analysts who were bullish a year ago have gone to ground, insisting that
serious comment is out of the question at this stage. After another year
as Telekom-watchers they have learned to be cautious. Now most analysts
are reluctant to say anything at all about Telekom until they see the 1995
results in May. In fact, they are actively trying to quash the impression
created by their own forecasts. <BR>
<BR>
Bill Coleman, telecoms analyst at James Capel in London, is one of the few
analysts prepared to stick his neck out. On the assumption of pre-tax earnings
of Dm5 billion in 1995, he says, Deutsche Telekom's price-earnings ratio
works out at 22, compared with an average of 12 for telecoms companies in
Europe. &quot;The balance sheet looks OK, but there's a lot we don't know
about Telekom,&quot; he cautions. <BR>
<BR>
Peter Wirtz, telecoms analyst at Oppenheim Finanzanalyse in Cologne, points
out that the company has already revised down its turnover forecast for
1995 from Dm69 billion to Dm67 billion. Therefore, Wirtz reasons, the price
increases Telekom has just introduced will act as a greater damper on earnings.
Moreover, the projected turnover of Dm80 billion for the year 2000 &quot;looks
like a very optimistic figure to me&quot;, he says. <BR>
<BR>
On the basis of his own projections for Telekom's 1995 results, Wirtz estimates
that the issue price will be Dm25 to Dm30 (five to six times nominal value).
Although the price will in fact be based on earnings forecasts for 1997
and 1998, Wirtz's figures are &quot;pretty accurate&quot;, says a Telekom
banker who has seen the issuer's financial projections for those two years.
<BR>
<BR>
Forecasts so far have assumed a substantial improvement in productivity
and the reduction of the workforce by a further 40,000 by the year 2000.
But the banks know well that any earnings estimate has to be highly provisional
because Telekom's financial situation is about to change dramatically. <BR>
<BR>
Enormous reserves have to be built up rapidly to meet pension obligations
(previously paid by the state) and, from 1996 onwards, the company will
not only have to charge value-added tax but will also be liable to pay income
tax for the first time. Some changes will be for the better: Telekom no
longer has to transfer earnings to the state to cover the losses made by
the postal service. &quot;Deutsche Telekom has more unresolved issues on
the pure reporting side than any other German company,&quot; says one of
the global coordinators. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, a battalion of competitors will have emerged to face Telekom
in the terrestrial and mobile telecoms market. Telekom will lose its monopoly
of land-based telephone services on the first day of 1998. A number of competitors
are planning to launch rival services as soon as they get their licences
in the spring of 1997. <BR>
<BR>
Wirtz of Oppenheim Finanzanalyse expects the main challengers - RWE, Mannesmann,
Thyssen, Veba and Viag - to achieve an annual turnover in telecoms of up
to Dm10 billion each within five years. They may grow even stronger as a
result of a recent spate of alliances. Vebacom and Mannesmann Eurokom have
agreed to marry Veba's terrestrial network with Mannesmann's D2 mobile web,
while RWE Telliance will merge with VEW Energie and VEAG Vereinigte Energiewerke
to create a new national terrestrial network. Internationally, German firms
have forged alliances with Cable &amp; Wireless, British Telecom and AT&amp;T.
<BR>
<BR>
New telecommunications legislation, establishing what these companies will
be allowed to do, and how they will be regulated, exists in draft form.
But it may be heavily amended before being passed by parliament in late
June or early July. Until the shape of the market is clear, no one can accurately
price Telekom stock. The delay in the legislation was the reason for postponing
the issue from spring to November. <BR>
<BR>
Chief executive Ron Sommer complains that it took five months to agree new
tariffs with government agencies - while in the meantime emerging competitors
were free to plan their own prices. That interference will not go away.
Moreover, even after the Telekom stock is placed, the government will still
be a majority shareholder. <BR>
<BR>
In the face of this adversity and uncertainty the syndicate members can
hardly go out and market the issue to institutional investors. They plan
to hold their fire until early September when they begin a 12-week campaign
of marketing to institutions. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It would be a huge mistake to approach investors beforehand,&quot;
says one of the global coordinators. &quot;Banks would be doing a very dangerous
thing to spread information months before the offering without being controlled
by Deutsche Telekom and the global managers. That would dilute the story
and endanger the whole offering. Anyone who talks about Telekom now is misinforming
the investment community. The danger is that we would have to go back and
correct that point of view.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yet some of the leading banks in the syndicate have already made some bold
assumptions. The first non-German house to secure a top position in a German
privatization, Goldman Sachs, won its global coordinator's mandate by convincing
the government and Telekom that the US institutional market - particularly
long-term investors who can be reached only via a full listing on the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and via a top-flight US investment house - was
vital to the success of the placement. At the time of its appointment, Goldman
said it expected a full 20% of the issue to be raised in the US. <BR>
<BR>
Some investment bankers question that assumption. Goldman's adversaries
in the syndicate point out that the recent initial public offering (IPO)
of German chemicals group E Merck raised Dm2.4 billion altogether, but just
5% of that in the US market - although without a NYSE listing. &quot;It
wasn't even worth making the trip over there,&quot; says one German banker.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Pros and cons of a US listing</B> <BR>
<BR>
Daimler-Benz is the only German company so far to have achieved a NYSE listing,
before its capital increase in 1994. Although Daimler reached new investors,
US ownership of the company increased to just 8% and has since returned
to the original 6%. A number of German corporations argue that a lower level
of American depositary receipt (ADR) programme has taken them the same distance
- and avoided the headache of negotiating a disclosure deal with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). <BR>
<BR>
Like Daimler-Benz, Deutsche Telekom will have to produce a reconciliation
of some balance-sheet items to US GAAP accounts - the SEC argues that German-style
accounts don't offer the necessary transparency to international investors.
Although Telekom is free of some of the accounting difficulties encountered
by Daimler - pension reserves and the valuation of semi-manufactured goods
were both thorny problems, for instance - Telekom will still be obliged
to publish two sets of results. <BR>
<BR>
If the US figure is substantially adrift of the German figure, that will
trigger distrust among investors. Daimler's two-year track record of double
accounting shows that the discrepancy between the two net earnings figures
can fluctuate wildly from the huge (over Dm2 billion in 1993) to the acceptable
(around Dm200 million in 1994). The problem is predicting the degree. <BR>
<BR>
One sure result of producing US GAAP figures, according to Wirtz of Oppenheim
Finanzanalyse, is that sophisticated investors will take a less generous
view of the company's balance sheet. &quot;There won't be the usual valuation
adjustments on the stock because of the assumption of conservative [German]
accounting,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
But tempering their fears of investor apathy, bankers are heartened by the
generally robust demand for telecoms stock. Robert Millington, an analyst
at BZW in London, recalls that the three main telecoms privatizations of
last year - Dutch KPN, Spain's Telefonica and Portugal Telecom - generated
$16 billion worth of demand in pursuit of $5.7 billion worth of stock. <BR>
<BR>
But this year there will be plenty of alternative telecoms issues. STET
of Italy is scheduled to raise $6.5 billion in the first half, while Telefonica
is aiming for the second half with its $1.5 billion issue. There are three
smaller issues too, OTE of Greece, Bezeq of Israel and Orange of the UK,
looking for a total of around $2 billion. Adding Deutsche Telekom's $10
billion, that makes $20 billion of new stock from a single sector this year.
<BR>
<BR>
There is a hope that the stock's weighting in the Dax index, the index of
30 leading German shares, will be sufficient to pull in demand. Institutional
investors who track the index, so the theory goes, will be obliged to invest
in Telekom because it will be a dominant component of the Dax. <BR>
<BR>
If the Dax committee at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange had decided to include
Telekom's entire market capitalization in the Dax, Telekom would certainly
have become the heaviest-weighted stock in the index, triggering huge demand.
But only the listed part of Telekom's equity capital will feature, comprising
only about 3% of the Dax. <BR>
<BR>
Telekom and its advisers are assuming &quot;normal&quot; conditions when
the issue comes to market. According to one Telekom banker, that means a
dollar rate of around Dm1.50, a continued trend toward lower Deutschmark
interest rates and no fall in the Dax from now to November. In nine months'
time, those objectives may not seem so modest. <BR>
<BR>
Some international investors are increasing the German weighting in their
portfolios. Morgan Stanley recently decided to raise its weighting in Germany
from 7% to 16% of its European model portfolio. Its strategists expect short-
and long-term German interest rates to fall further, providing economic
stimulus and encouraging domestic investors to switch to equities. <BR>
<BR>
Eberhard Weiershauser, treasury partner at Schr&ouml;der M&uuml;nchmeyer
Hengst in Frankfurt, hopes that other international investors will follow
suit. &quot;London has been pro-French for three years now. You need a microscope
to see the positions in German securities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But, as with all large issues now, the level of international institutional
demand depends mainly on the enthusiasm of retail investors. &quot;A successful
retail placement is the precondition for everything,&quot; says one of the
global coordinators. &quot;No institution abroad will invest in Telekom
if it's shunned by the German market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Millington of BZW points out encouragingly that retail demand has absorbed
around 50% of the equity in the last three continental telecoms issues.
&quot;The importance of domestic demand is clear,&quot; he says. &quot;If
we take the average of around 50% retail participation in the last three
privatizations and add on around 10% of stock placed with domestic institutions,
the mountain of around $20 billion of new telephone company issuance falls
to around an $8 billion drain on international investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But the equity culture is evolving slowly in Germany. Just 6% of German
households have direct investments in equities; most of the nation's Dm3
trillion in private wealth is held in low-risk instruments such as savings
accounts, three-month term money, or government bonds. <BR>
<BR>
Telekom acknowledges that it will have to reach &quot;new groups of investors&quot;.
And everyone agrees that a huge marketing exercise will be needed to change
public attitudes towards share ownership as a worthwhile long-term investment.
But no one wants to foot the bill. <BR>
<BR>
The finance ministry is thought to be reconsidering the possibility of tax
breaks on share ownership - although that option was ruled out last year
- but a look at the government's books suggests that a U-turn now would
be unlikely. Germany is in danger of failing to meet the Maastricht convergence
criteria this year because its budget deficit is too high, so the government
would be reluctant to forego tax revenue. <BR>
<BR>
R&uuml;diger von Rosen, head of the German Equities Institute (DAI) and
figurehead for the equities lobby in Germany, says privately that he has
given up hope of persuading the government to make tax concessions on equities
ownership - or at least to remove incentives on alternative investment vehicles
- in time for this year's sale of Telekom stock. <BR>
<BR>
Last autumn Kr&ouml;ske ordered the banks to reduce custody charges for
first-time investors. (Minimum annual charges often gobble up all the gains
on a modest share portfolio of, say, Dm15,000.) But the banks flatly refused.
None of the main German institutions has any intention of reducing its bank
charges. &quot;If we have to start trying to convince people that the Telekom
share is attractive, we've had it,&quot; says one Frankfurt banker. &quot;The
share's attractions have to be self-evident.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Education, but no concessions, seems to be the strategy. Commerzbank has
run advertisements about saving for retirement by investing in equities.
Dresdner Bank is enclosing information on Telekom shares when it sends statements
to its four million retail customers - but it will be making no concessions
on the usual fees. &quot;We won't be sacrificing large sums,&quot; added
the Frankfurt banker. &quot;A charge of Dm20 [his bank's annual custody
fee for securities accounts] won't put investors off.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Setting a precedent</B> <BR>
<BR>
Bank charges and additional incentives will make no difference, say the
banks, and the hugely-discounted <I>Volksaktie</I> (people's share) for
the mass market is a thing of the past in Germany. &quot;Looking at privatization
issues over time,&quot; says one of the global coordinators, &quot;we've
seen that the number of participants is going down and the average allocation
is going up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yet Bonn has told German banks that those which reduce custody charges on
equity portfolios will be looked on favourably when the issuing syndicates
for future mandates are selected. Telekom is just the first in a series
of privatization issues which will come up in Germany over the next five
years. <BR>
<BR>
According to a recent valuation, Deutsche Postbank is worth between Dm4
billion and Dm5 billion and should be ready for flotation between 1998 and
2000. Other candidates for privatization mega-issues are Deutsche Bahn (the
railways) and Deutsche Post (the postal service). A second Dm15 billion
tranche of Telekom stock is planned for 1998, followed by the sale of the
government's majority share in the company. When the syndicate is appointed,
Germany's top banks are no longer guaranteed leading positions. <BR>
<BR>
During the first wave of privatizations, when stock in Volkswagen, Viag,
Veba, Depfa Bank and other state-owned corporations was floated, Dresdner
and Deutsche played as a team. Germany's two largest banks took turns to
hold the top position in each syndicate, to the exclusion of other institutions.
It wasn't until the Lufthansa privatization in 1994 that Bonn held its first-ever
beauty contest for investment banks. In the event Dresdner won, but the
point had been made. <BR>
<BR>
German banks have grasped that mandates no longer pass down from generation
to generation and they are responding by building up their placing power
and custody services abroad. Dresdner recently purchased US asset manager
RCM to increase its market base in North America. Commerzbank bought Jupiter
Tyndall of the UK, Martingale Asset Management in Boston and has established
an asset management operation in Singapore. Bayerische Vereinsbank is still
looking for an asset manager in the US after its thwarted attempt to acquire
part of the Oppenheimer Group of New York. <BR>
<BR>
Dresdner and Deutsche acknowledge that the good old days are over. When
Schroders, the London merchant bank, was selected last autumn to carry out
a valuation of the German Postbank, German financiers viewed this as a disturbing
precedent. &quot;Just as they chose Schroders to make an expert valuation,
so they could choose Commerzbank or WestLB to lead a privatization,&quot;
one German banker notes. Although neither of those institutions has the
international placing power of Deutsche, Dresdner or Goldman, they are now
considered by rivals to be experienced enough to coordinate a major privatization
issue. So are a number of non-German banks. <BR>
<BR>
Bonn's more eclectic approach is not the result of a new generation of young
Turks in the government and the finance ministry. Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who is personally credited with many key decisions (including the choice
of Goldman Sachs as a global co-ordinator for Telekom) has been in office
for 14 years and senior personnel at the finance ministry are equally long-term.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The federal government is more aware of the impact of European integration
and the idea of reciprocity between nations,&quot; says one Telekom banker.
Bonn has to be seen to be giving foreign institutions a fair chance. <BR>
<BR>
It is a sign that the Bonn government realizes how much is at stake with
the Telekom issue, since failure will be impossible to conceal. In the past,
issuing banks in Germany have often taken unsold stock onto their books
and fed it into the market gradually. Now, recent financial legislation
requires the disclosure of a shareholding of more than Dm100 million in
a public company - less than 1% of the new Telekom stock would be worth
that sum. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the German banks' fund management arms are less willing than in
the past to accept unsold stock into their investment vehicles. If banks
were seen to be left with paper on their hands that would severely dampen
prospects for the second Telekom tranche in 1998 and for the whole German
privatization programme. <BR>

<H3>CHINA</H3> 
<H2>Breaking the taboo </H2>
<H4>The enormous enthusiasm international investment bankers showed when
China began floating state-owned companies in 1993 has cooled markedly.
The poor market performance of the early issuers has slowed the flow of
new ones. But signs are that the Chinese authorities are adopting a more
realistic approach to attract back foreign investors. Sophie R&ouml;ell
reports </H4>
Four years ago the word privatization was taboo in China. &quot;When I came
here in 1992 nobody would talk about it,&quot; recalls one investment banker,
&quot;and we had to be very careful about mentioning that kind of thing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Now there is even a sign outside the building where China Eastern Airlines
is working on the company's long-awaited New York listing indicating the
&quot;China Eastern Privatization Office&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
With nearly 40 Chinese companies already listed on international exchanges,
or authorized to list, and two official domestic stock markets plus a further
17 informal ones scattered across the country, the adoption by the Chinese
of privatization as an acceptable part of the language should not come as
much of a surprise. <BR>
<BR>
Add to that the fact that in 1993 the non-state sector already accounted
for nearly 60% of industrial output and that China's state statistical bureau
expects the state's share to shrink to 25% by the end of the century, and
there can be little doubt that a dynamic process of privatization is going
on. <BR>
<BR>
But surprise is exactly what it does cause. &quot;Even I was taken aback,&quot;
says CS First Boston's chief representative in China, Carl Walter, on seeing
the sign at China Eastern's headquarters in Shanghai, a view shared by other
bankers who warn that even today privatization is a word that is discouraged
in China. <BR>
<BR>
It is a candid admission of the terms on which investment banks have been
prepared to get involved in listing Chinese companies - that is, without
assurances that a wide-ranging sell-off of state assets would take place
and, perhaps more importantly, without any explicit commitment to private
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
Neither of these terms are likely to change in the foreseeable future. When
the proposals for the ninth five-year plan (1996-2000) were published after
the meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's central committee last September,
they included adherence &quot;to the principle of maintaining public ownership&quot;
as reforms of state-owned enterprises are &quot;deepened with a view to
building up a modern enterprise system&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
With the macroeconomic situation improving and inflation once more at manageable
levels, improving the performance of state-owned enterprises is now a high
priority for the government. Hardly a day passes without some discussion
in the official media about what can be done to improve the situation. The
question has attracted a spate of official speeches and government-sponsored
conferences. <BR>
<BR>
But there has been no indication that a drastic solution is at hand. If
there is any overall plan in Beijing for bringing vitality to state-owned
enterprises it is that there should be no plan: the piecemeal, experimental
approach is the way forward. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Chinese don't have grand unifying theories like the eastern Europeans,&quot;
says John Crossman, chief representative at Jardine Fleming in Shanghai.
&quot;The Chinese have: 'We're going to try this, we're going to try that,
we're going to muddle through, don't worry'. They say: 'Look where it got
the eastern Europeans, they went out and bought some Harvard Business School
or McKinsey study, and they went all out and shot themselves in the foot
- in fact they blew their foot clean off.' And they laugh at them. They
think they've done it poorly. They don't believe that they have done a good
job by their people.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Ironically, the use of the former Soviet Union's experience as a blueprint
by the Chinese for what to avoid has acted as a catalyst in opening up China's
capital markets. &quot;I never in my life thought that there would ever
be anything like what happened - overseas listing of Chinese companies or
even development of stock markets domestically,&quot; says CS First Boston's
Walter. &quot;And the only reason I think it did happen was because of what
happened to the Soviet Union: it disappeared in three days. And I think
Deng Xiaoping understood what happened very clearly, and that if they didn't
really try to make a qualitative push, beyond what I call the eastern European-style
revisionism of the 1980s - which was basically joint ventures and very much
at the margins in special economic zones - then China was going to ultimately
experience problems.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Room for improvement</B> <BR>
<BR>
Enter the stock market &quot;experiment&quot;, as it is still called by
Chinese officials. Experiment it may be but because of China's size it has
been a headline-catching initiative. And, even without a formal privatization
programme, there has been a steady flow of Chinese companies listing on
domestic exchanges and becoming available to foreigners (the &quot;B&quot;
shares), and gaining approval to list on international exchanges. <BR>
<BR>
These approvals are announced in batches by the Chinese Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC). In 1993 nine companies were given the green light, in
1994 22 companies and in 1995 a further seven. So far 21 of those have been
listed. <BR>
<BR>
For international investment banks, parti-cipation in the experiment has
meant a massive boom followed by bust; enormous enthusiasm and a China binge
to begin with, followed by the inevitable hangover; and excitement at being
able to participate in an economy with the size and growth rates of China's,
followed by a realization that even after 20 years of reform, it is very
much a planned economy. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers, brokers and investors are at best deflated. Personnel have been
redeployed, efforts focused elsewhere in the region. &quot;A lot of bankers
are somewhat discouraged,&quot; says one. &quot;Chinese companies have performed
well below expectations and there's a lot of disappointment. And I don't
see any dramatic change in the offing that would make them perform a lot
better.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
True, underwriters have few complaints about the number of companies on
offer for private-sector participation. On international exchanges alone
&quot;they've got 19 companies that have been approved to list, but that
haven't listed yet&quot;, points out one banker. &quot;Of what other country
around the region can you say there are 19 companies trying to go to the
market?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nor, as might have been expected to happen, have many sectors been put out
of bounds by the government because they are viewed as too sensitive for
foreign investment. The 22 companies given permission to list in 1994 included
not only four electricity-generating companies but also two large airlines.
The only areas where foreign investment has specifically been barred are
telecoms operations and media. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers are not surprised at these priorities. &quot;They don't want to
lose control of their ability to monitor what's on the airwaves,&quot; points
out Crossman. &quot;Some of that goes into the telephones as well - they
want to be able to maintain control of what's being said over the telephone
- it's more of a dissident thing. Now if dissidents are going to travel
on China Eastern Airlines, they can catch them at the check-in lounge, it's
not a big deal. And they've got lots of other airlines that they own - so
they're not particularly worried about that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Telecoms are obviously attractive. As one Beijing investment banker points
out: &quot;With a low penetration rate of a few lines per 100 people, bringing
that up to anywhere near Third World standards would imply a tremendous
amount of growth for any telecoms company.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, blanket sectoral restrictions have not been the greatest cause
of frustration. With 10 of the companies approved in 1994 still not listed,
it is clear that there have been difficulties in bringing to market even
companies whose listings are approved. <BR>
<BR>
There is no single cause. In the case of the two power companies - Shandong
International and North China Power - negotiation of a tariff has been the
stumbling block. For the airlines, rumours circulate about a variety of
issues that are as yet unsettled, such as land-use rights, tax issues and
dividend pay-out ratios. <BR>
<BR>
The poor reception of Chinese companies in the international markets has
led to a loss of impetus to resolve those issues. In 1994, Chinese companies
were selling at price/earnings ratios of over 20. Now it would be an impressive
achievement to reach a P/E ratio of 10. <BR>
<BR>
Like most governments engaged in privatization, the Chinese are extremely
concerned that state assets should not be sold off cheaply. The only specific
constraint, though, is that companies are not sold off below net asset value.
But the sums that Chinese companies can attract now are fairly close to
that cut-off. <BR>
<BR>
That, bankers say, is probably the main present problem on the Chinese side
with issuing equity. &quot;Of course there is ideological resistance,&quot;
says one underwriter, &quot;but much more important than that is what I
call rent-seeking resistance. It's a major operation for these companies
to repackage themselves, to get their accounts in order, to handle the triangular
debt issue and so on. And they get all that resolved and they say: 'Wait!
I used to be able to keep all the money I made. Now I have to give it to
the investors. And not only that, but I have to write all these damn reports.
I went through all that nonsense, and I sold the assets at almost net asset
value anyway - so how much money have I made?' So people are asking themselves
do we really want to do this? Is it worth it? Is it worth all the trouble?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Blaming market performance</B> <BR>
<BR>
After seeing the money their assets could attract in the heady days of 1993
and 1994, a not uncommon attitude on the Chinese side is to blame the markets
alone for low valuation of their assets. On this outlook, all they really
have to do is to wait for the markets to improve again or hunt around for
new markets to try out: if companies with New York and Hong Kong listings
have not performed so well, it could be worth trying other exchanges. In
1995 agreements were signed with both the Tokyo and Singapore stock exchanges,
and discussions with Australia and London were undertaken. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, there is not much incentive to approve more substantial
companies for listing. When the 1995 batch of seven was announced, underwriters
let out a veritable groan. &quot;We're just left here twiddling our thumbs,&quot;
says one. &quot;There's just nothing to do. These companies are too small,
they're in the wrong sectors. There's really not a lot major banks can do
with them.&quot; The inclusion of a Chinese traditional medicine company
was symptomatic. &quot;Give me a break!&quot; exclaims one underwriter.
&quot;You're not going to get any western investor for that. It doesn't
seem to me to be a logical company to go out and list.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Here the method of selecting companies for listing - not according to what
investors want but according to quotas allocated to localities - may explain
the choice of these specific companies. Once they receive their allocations,
it is the provinces and municipalities that decide which companies should
be sent up to the CSRC to receive final approval for listing. &quot;The
really big filtering-out is at the level of the regional governments,&quot;
says Anjali Kumar at the World Bank, which conducted a study of the screening
of applications for listing in the period up to 1994. <BR>
<BR>
But if the selection process has left a lot of room for political manoeuvring
and just plain ignorance about what investors are interested in, few bankers
argue that improving the process would release a batch of model Chinese
companies that have just been waiting on the sidelines to dazzle international
investors. <BR>
<BR>
<B>From planned to market economy</B> <BR>
<BR>
As analysts have discovered, the problems with Chinese issuers are rather
more endemic. Even darlings of the international investment community like
Tsingtao Brewery have fallen from favour. The truth is that, after 40 years
of a planned economy, it will take time for Chinese issuers even to understand
what it means to be listed on an international exchange. <BR>
<BR>
The government's ambivalent attitude towards privatization has not helped
this. It retains a controlling stake in all companies and, in most cases,
the stake available to foreigners has not even been close to 50%. This is
not a problem in itself. But it is a problem when investors feel that they
have had absolutely no influence on the behaviour of a company. &quot;A
lot of investors feel they have been taken for a ride,&quot; says one banker.
&quot;They feel that the Chinese have issued enough shares to attract a
lot of money but not so much that they cede control to anybody. And the
Chinese still see the company as their own little fiefdom, and public investors
don't have to be taken into consideration when they make decisions.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
More cynical bankers will raise a common accusation heard in emerging markets
- that all they have done by participating in listings is to help companies
raise cash. &quot;It's a cash-raising exercise,&quot; says one. &quot;They're
not really privatizations. They're doing it to raise cash for these companies
so they can modernize.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To back up this view, they point out that in most cases listing has not
led to a radically different approach to that which prevailed when the companies
were fully state-owned. &quot;Haixing Shipping is a classic example,&quot;
says Jardine Fleming's Crossman. &quot;They thought of themselves as a utility
and they kept shipping coal, even though they weren't getting paid for it,
because they thought their responsibility wasn't to their shareholders but
primarily to their customers who weren't paying them. And basically they
acted like the old state-owned enterprises they always were. So you ask
yourself what was the point? And they took the money and they went and bought
some new ships - but there hasn't been a radical change in the enterprises,
except maybe that once a year they've got to put out statements.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The interim earnings announced by Chinese companies last August were the
last straw for some. The worst offender was Hong Kong-listed Maanshan Iron
&amp; Steel which reported a massive 93% drop in half-on-half profits. Across
the board, earnings were well below analysts' expectations. <BR>
<BR>
It was not only the companies that were to blame. In a planned economy,
government policies have strong repercussions on company performance. The
austerity measures imposed by the government in 1993 in an attempt to cool
down the economy played a big role in reducing earnings. Even with the best
will in the world, Chinese companies are far from independent players. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Communication problems</B> <BR>
<BR>
Austerity measures imposed from above played an important role in Maanshan
Iron &amp; Steel's poor results. As a Baring Securities report points out,
drops in sales reflected &quot;weak demand from the credit-tight construction
sector&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
What annoys analysts more is that companies did not properly inform them
of what was happening. A comparison by Baring Securities of market-consensus,
full-year forecasts with actual first-half interim results, shows the enormous
discrepancies. For Maanshan Iron &amp; Steel, the consensus forecast of
Rmb770 million ($93 million) was confounded by paltry actual first-half
earnings of Rmb40 million. <BR>
<BR>
The Baring Securities report says that &quot;in isolated cases, company
managements were suspected of withholding information from the market, as
in the case of one company which went on an around-the-world roadshow near
the end of 1995, telling investors that everything was as smooth as can
be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Others in the market share that view. &quot;Analysts are fed up. We have
really had enough,&quot; says the head of research at one Shanghai brokerage.
&quot;These companies have been lying to analysts. Somebody has got to take
responsibility, heads have got to roll.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the CSRC, which might perhaps be charged with the responsibility
of cutting off those heads, does not hold out much hope of radical action.
The CSRC has a staff of only 120 people and its officials say there is little
they can do except in the most blatant cases of abuse. Generally, they say,
that has not been the problem. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When we go down to investigate we find very few companies that are
actually trying to lie, to deceive the public,&quot; says a CSRC source.
&quot;Most people just don't know what they're doing. It takes time for
them eventually to learn how to do it, how to be responsible to the shareholders
- because they have been responsible only to their superiors in the government
for the past 40 years - and then all off a sudden the whole thing has changed.
So the mentality has to be changed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Holding back on the big ones </H3>
The new year for Chinese equity is kicking off much as last year ended -
with small issues. Two roadshows are in progress, one for the Jingwei Textile
Machinery company (a $27 million deal) and one for noodle manufacturer Tingyi.
Foshan Ceramics, also relatively small at $50 million, is likely to be the
next in line. <BR>
<BR>
Nor are deals likely to dazzle with their pricing. Fund managers expect
Jingwei to list at a 20% discount to the current market, &quot;a realistic
level&quot; according to Ching Ju Yeh, a fund manager at HSBC Asset Management.
Ching predicts that over this year the average price/earnings ratio for
Chinese issues will be a meagre six. <BR>
<BR>
Investors are in a cautious mood. Unless market sentiment towards China
improves dramatically, 1996 is unlikely to be the year of the flashy deal.
As one fund manager points out, investors are not in any rush to get involved
in primary offerings. &quot;For over 70% of Chinese shares, the current
market price is still below the IPO price,&quot; he says. &quot;So I think
investors will be very cautious about taking up new issues. They'll tend
to think that you can always buy them cheaper in the secondary market.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
That pessimistic mood will inhibit the arrival in the market of the larger,
more strategic companies that the Chinese are not keen to see sold off cheaply
to foreigners. The most eagerly awaited of these issues are regional airlines
China Eastern and China Southern, which had been expected to list on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) last year but failed to do so. <BR>
<BR>
Fund managers are uncharacteristically upbeat on China when it comes to
discussing the prospects of airlines as a sector. According to Billy Chan,
who manages the GT PRC Fund: &quot;In each geographical area the airlines
have a strict monopoly. So given the huge growth in flights in China over
recent years, which will probably extend into the future, this is probably
a very good business to go into.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Still, investors are withholding final judgement until they see what kind
of a deal is thrashed out between the airlines and the government on issues
ranging from division of airspace to fuel supply. &quot;Conceptually they
sound good,&quot; says Chan, &quot;but I haven't yet seen a prospectus or
talked to the management.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Dealing with those issues may take some time. &quot;I don't expect them
to finish all the due diligence until the second half of 1996,&quot; says
one fund manager. If one airline comes to market then the other is unlikely
to be offered until later - possibly even as late as 1997. <BR>
<BR>
Other large deals in the batch of 22 companies approved for listing in 1994
may not receive so enthusiastic a response. This is particularly true of
the two power companies that remain to be listed, Shandong International
and Datang Power. After the poor performances of the two other power companies
in the batch of 22, both of which were listed on the NYSE in 1994, investors
are justly cautious about the remaining two. Shandong International in particular
may suffer from the troubles of its predecessor: it is in the same province
as the New York-listed Shandong Huaneng, whose share slumped after the government
refused to allow the company to go ahead with capital expansion. Electricity
tariff rises have also proved difficult to negotiate with the authorities.
<BR>
<BR>
Still, with inflation now at manageable levels, the market for power operators
and other infrastructure companies dependent on government-regulated tariffs
may improve as price increases and investments become less contentious issues.
That could work in favour of the listing of the Guangzhou Shenzhen Railway
- approximately a $400 million deal. That, according to Nicole Yuen, a director
at SBC Warburg, could be &quot;one of the most notable issues for the first
half of this year, if not the whole year&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, the smaller, less contentious issues will go ahead. As
one underwriter explains: &quot;Generally the more political an organization
is, the more political an industry is and the more difficulties you have
with all these bureaucracies. And it also depends how complicated the company
is. Some companies have subsidiaries, they have factories and facilities
all over China, and then you have a hell of a time doing the accounting,
legal due diligence and things like that - it just prolongs the time it
takes to bring an issue to market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The deal not to look out for this year? Apparently First Automotive - which
is likely to be an issue of more than $500 million. According to one banker:
&quot;That's a sort of a headline enterprise of China, so that will probably
take a long time, because it's so big, it's so well-known, so everybody
in China will try to get their hands on it and get a share of the glory.
It's expected to come out, but I don't think it will until 1997.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Still, a shortage of big-ticket deals may not be a bad thing. As SBC Warburg's
Yuen points out: &quot;You need to have a variety of industries and companies
that try to list and come to the market. And the biggest may not be best.&quot;

<H3>CHINA</H3> 
<H2>Bank of China's cultural revolution </H2>
<H4>The Bank of China aims to be a major international player by the year
2010. But it faces many challenges, not least of which is the transformation
of a large proportion of its international profit - from Hong Kong - into
domestic profit in less than 500 days. Sophie Roell reports on the bank's
efforts to expand its areas of expertise, introduce tighter controls and
achieve real independence </H4>
Bank of China's 20-storey head office is almost the only tower block on
Beijing's &quot;Financial Street&quot;. So far, no other banks have moved
there. The most prominent building is the Holiday Inn. In years to come
this could turn out to be a booming financial district - or another failed
government planning effort. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the Bank of China is familiar with the limitations of government
planning and no stranger to the vagaries of Chinese history. As the bank
looks ahead to the next century, it can boast that it at least survived
most of the last one. Set up in Shanghai in 1912, the bank managed to weather
the Communist takeover in 1949 and subsequent upheavals. <BR>
<BR>
The key to its success - ironically, given its name - has been the large
proportion of its assets kept outside China and its function as the country's
foreign exchange bank. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when all banks
within China were subsumed into the People's Bank, Bank of China managed
to operate its branches abroad under its own name. <BR>
<BR>
Today, as China's banks struggle to transform themselves from being the
finance arms of government departments into modern commercialized entities,
Bank of China's presence abroad has again served as a cornerstone. In 1995,
over 60% of the bank's profits were from its overseas operations. <BR>
<BR>
The bank's outlets span several continents: 89 branches and sub-branches
in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia; nine subsidiaries in Hong
Kong and Europe; a joint venture bank in Hong Kong; and an investment bank
registered in Luxembourg. Including the four banks within the Bank of China
group, mainly located in Hong Kong, there are a total of 500 overseas offices,
employing 20,000 people. <BR>
<BR>
The bank has no desire to relinquish its international focus. Its president,
Wang Xue Bing, spent five years as head of Bank of China's New York branch
- and is said to have joked with World Bank president James Wolfensohn during
his visit to China last year that he, too, was a New Yorker. The bank's
recruitment policy focuses on hiring foreign-language speakers. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, according to Mao Xiao Wei, general manager of the bank's strategic
development department, Bank of China has set the year 2010 as a target
for becoming a &quot;high-quality international player&quot;, if not one
of the biggest. <BR>
<BR>
Such ambitions are some way from realization. After receiving a D financial-strength
rating from Moody's last August, it is clear the agency's analysts do not
think too highly of the bank's &quot;intrinsic safety and soundness&quot;<B>
</B>without the implicit government support which buoys up Bank of China's
normal Moody's rating (Baa1). <BR>
<BR>
A large percentage of the profits from the bank's international operations
are from its Hong Kong branches and subsidiaries. Strictly speaking, these
are less than 500 days away from becoming domestic profits. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreign exchange strength</B> <BR>
<BR>
If not yet a first-tier international player, Bank of China is regarded
by the Chinese as their most international bank. Whether borrowing or depositing
foreign exchange, or arranging trade financing instruments, Chinese customers
almost always go to Bank of China. Last year Bank of China held a 50% market
share of foreign settlements. The bank also dominates the foreign exchange
market in China with a market share of 70%. <BR>
<BR>
Most of the characteristics of China's banking system today are the result
of government planning, and Bank of China's foreign exchange strength is
no exception. In the past, while China's three other main state banks specialized
in either industry and commerce, agriculture or construction, Bank of China
was mandated to do all the country's foreign exchange business, including
managing a large portion of the country's forex reserves. <BR>
<BR>
The problem for Bank of China is that its monopoly is now a thing of the
past. That means it not only faces competition from other domestic banks
but, more worryingly, from foreign banks. As one Bank of China official
points out, while Bank of China still has a 70% share of the domestic foreign
exchange market, &quot;two years ago, we had almost 100%&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, it has had to play catch-up in the area of local currency
transactions which in the past were not part of its mandate. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of 1995, the bank had 3,359 domestic branches - far fewer than
the other major state banks. Its total local currency deposits and loans
stood at Rmb390 billion and Rmb100 billion respectively - low compared to
other big banks. <BR>
<BR>
This local currency weakness, bank managers argue, has to change if Bank
of China is to realize its ambition of becoming a proper international bank.
&quot;We consider developing local currency business very urgent,&quot;
says Mao, &quot;because, if you look at the biggest international banks,
they have a lot of international business - but this is based on strong
local currency business.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The past five years have seen a rapid build-up of local currency deposits
to Rmb390 billion from Rmb78 billion<B> </B>- a rate of increase of around
38% each year. Renminbi lending has risen at a rate of 16.8% per annum.
New bank branches and sub-branches have been opened across China. <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China has few illusions about being able to catch up with other
banks in terms of branch coverage. But this may be the bank's biggest advantage.
If anything, other banks suffer from having too many staff and a branch
network which is large for the sake of comprehensiveness rather than profitability.
With 190,000 employees serving the domestic market, Bank of China has, by
Chinese standards, a trim workforce. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Compared with other banks, we're quite small,&quot; says Mao. &quot;At
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China the total number of employees
is more than double. What we are interested in is efficiency and profitability,
not only the size of the operation. We even think the total size of our
bank is too big.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most Bank of China branches are concentrated in the coastal and other prosperous
regions. The aim is to focus primarily on cities. Says Mao: &quot;We would
like to be a city bank, and focus on city business. If we open new branches,
it will be in the big cities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere, non-profitable branches will be restructured or closed. &quot;We
have plans to do this, but it's a little bit difficult to put into practice,&quot;
says Mao. &quot;But this year we are really going to try to [identify] the
offices that are not profitable and, in restructuring them, even close down
those that performed badly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The fact that Bank of China officials publicly state their commitment to
profitability rather than size is a victory against old-style Chinese banking.
As Joe Zhang, a China banking analyst at WI Carr in Hong Kong, points out,
with one bank for every 2,350 residents, China boasts a higher density of
bank outlets to population than most of the industrialized world. <BR>
<BR>
Says Zhang: &quot;In China, the size of a bank is often interpreted as the
most important symbol of its success and prestige. It is not return on equity
(ROE), return on assets (ROA) or marginal profit on capital that guides
banks' growth strategy, but rather total assets - even if that means falling
ROE and ROA, and negative marginal profit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Strategic development</B> <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China's strategic development department was set up only this year.
It testifies to the bank's confidence that it is finally free to decide
its own fate. <BR>
<BR>
Chinese banks' right to be independent of government interference became
law on July 1 last year, when the country's commercial banking law came
into effect. Before that date, if even a local government official ordered
a bank to make a loan to a venture - however unviable - the bank had no
power to refuse. <BR>
<BR>
This was hardly surprising: a local bank branch was considered the funding
arm of the local government and not really a bank at all. Salaries were
set according to the civil servants' pay scale and, until the late 1980s,
local governments had more of a say in the appointment of regional branch
managers than the bank's own head office. <BR>
<BR>
The commercial banking law aims to break for good the close ties between
banks and local government. For example, it prohibits banks from establishing
a branch structure which coincides with administrative boundaries. <BR>
<BR>
But even if, in future, all lending decisions are made on purely commercial
terms, the banking industry will still be shackled with loans - many of
which have turned bad - made in the past for political reasons . <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China has been shielded to some extent by its overseas focus, but
there is little doubt that it too is affected by the problems of the Chinese
banking system, in which western analysts estimate about 15% of loans are
non-performing or bad. <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China itself puts this figure at 2%. The discrepancy could be explained
by what one analyst calls China's &quot;liberal loan accounting practice&quot;.
In China banks are able to accrue income on overdue loans for up to three
years. The comparable figure in the west is 90 days. <BR>
<BR>
Banking supervisors at the central bank - the People's Bank of China (PBOC)
- are working on clarifying the issue of problem loans. PBOC officials are
determined to have a banking system that is adequately supervised, with
prudential regulations and a proper accounting system. But the Ministry
of Finance is not so keen to confront the problem of bad loans immediately,
as this could mean a big bail-out of the banks. (Bank of China, as a state-owned
bank<B>,</B> technically belongs to the ministry and has to apply to it
to raise capital.) According to Zhang, who formerly worked at the PBOC,
&quot;there is even fear that some institutions may be operating on negative
capital&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The Ministry of Finance allows less than 1% provisioning for bad debts each
year. That is &quot;something, but not nearly enough&quot;, says one analyst.
Resolution of the problem has been postponed, in the hope that the banking
system will somehow muddle through. <BR>
<BR>
It is not a simple issue. At stake is the whole problem of reforming state-owned
companies. If loss-making state companies are to be bailed out by the government,
banks may be right not to write off their loans. <BR>
<BR>
The infrastructure in place for banks to make claims on the assets of bankrupt
companies is inadequate. The official <I>China Daily</I> newspaper recently
reported complaints that &quot;the rights of banks and the debts owed to
them were not properly protected during the bankruptcy process, with banks
unable to collect on guarantees or mortgages they had been given&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Bank of China officials are concerned. &quot;The key point is how to assess
the problem loans,&quot; says Mao. &quot;In some cases, there are a lot
of very hard negotiations between the banks, the local government and the
enterprises. The government - and, in most cases, when we say government
we mean the local government - would like enterprises to go bankrupt and
the debts to be written off, because then the state banks' money will be
kept in their province, and become their money.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In view of the high tax rates on Chinese banks, the inflation of profit
figures caused by ignoring bad debts only serves to deplete capital further.
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, Bank of China is likely to be the only major state bank to report
a profit for 1995. Provisional figures given by the bank indicate profits
will be about Rmb10 billion. <BR>
<BR>
It has also been successful in boosting its capital by repeatedly begging
the Ministry of Finance for more money to match the rapid growth - over
50% in 1994 - in the bank's assets. Last year the ministry agreed. It raised
the bank's capital considerably - by Rmb22 billion - to Rmb52 billion. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, according to Bank of China calculations, its ratio of core
capital to total risk stands at 12.89%, well above the BIS's 8% standard.
But the bank says it is still not enough and that lack of capital could
inhibit &quot;business development&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The hope is that the bank will be able to leave the legacy of the past behind
by crowding out past poor assets with sound future lending. As the bank
itself admits, however, in spite of the commercial banking law, not all
future lending will be made on commercial grounds. <BR>
<BR>
State banks can still be called upon to do some policy lending at the behest
of the central government. The policy banks set up in 1994 to take this
burden away from commercial banks are still too small to be able to take
care of all policy lending. <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China officials say they have no problem with this - provided the
government gives them a subsidy to carry out this function. &quot;We don't
think 'policy loan' is a bad word,&quot; says Mao. &quot;A lot of policy
projects are good to finance: that has to be decided on a case-by-case basis.
But we need a commitment from the government that, if necessary, they will
provide us with a subsidy, following the commercial banking law.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In practice, the pressure on banks to give in to government demands at local
branch level is still enormous. &quot;Sometimes it is extremely hard for
branches to withstand local government wishes,&quot; explains one bank official.
&quot;The government will say, 'You have a branch in our province. You've
got deposits from our people. You have to pay for that by extending loans
for the project.' And local bank employees find it hard to withstand these
arguments.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, the Bank of China is struggling to comply with the commercial
banking law's provision - designed to alleviate the problem of local government
interference - that the basis for branch networks be unconnected with local
government districts. The new structure of the bank remains undecided. &quot;It's
possible we will work out a structure which will follow economic zones,&quot;
says Mao. &quot;If certain provinces have the same level of economic development,
we will consider them as one unit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This is a tough requirement for Chinese banks which have traditionally opened
branches at every level of administrative unit. As a result of its special
foreign mandate, Bank of China adopted this approach only in 1992 and it
is now having to rapidly backtrack. <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China managers are candid about the fact that bad loans are as much
a problem of internal weakness, as outside interference. Says Wang, the
bank's president: &quot;The major change we are facing now is to strengthen
our internal management system. We need to learn more from [our] international
experience. We need to work out our inherited problems.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Analysts agree that management expertise needs to improve. &quot;Last year
banks as a whole lent less than before to the state sector, so they do seem
to be finding new borrowers,&quot; says one Beijing-based banking specialist.
&quot;The question is do they have the capacity to separate good borrowers
from bad ones among these new customers? That's the essence of the banking
business. And I'm not sure that Chinese banks have the capacity to do this
kind of work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Centralization</B> <BR>
<BR>
Bank of China's overseas operations, and the opportunity this affords bank
employees to gain experience outside China, give the bank another advantage
over other Chinese banks. <BR>
<BR>
The bank is moving towards &quot;centralizing operations to reduce risks
and increase efficiency and profitability&quot;, according to one Bank of
China executive. This has been most obvious in the area of foreign exchange
dealing. This business has already been taken away from branches and is
now run exclusively by head office. &quot;We think this is the most risky
business and should be controlled by head office,&quot; says Mao. &quot;In
the past, branches used to be allowed to do a certain amount of foreign
exchange business on behalf of customers, as brokers. But we have centralized
that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That is good news. As recently as last month, details were published in
the Chinese press of foreign exchange trading losses of $175 million at
the bank's Shandong branch. According to allegations in the <I>Shanghai
Securities News</I>, the former head and deputy head of the branch's foreign
exchange division accepted bribes of $120,000 from a foreign financial institution
to undertake the disastrous deals. <BR>
<BR>
Overall changes in China's financial system, particularly at central bank
level, are easing Bank of China head office's bid to exert greater control.
One notable area is liquidity management. In the past, bank branches were
required to meet high reserve requirements at local level, by depositing
money at local PBOC branches. <BR>
<BR>
In turn, if a bank faced liquidity problems, a branch would turn to the
local PBOC branch for support: the central bank was a lender of first rather
than last resort. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1994, however, PBOC has shifted its lending to banks' head offices.
Although required reserves, at 13% of deposits, still have to be met at
local level, required excess reserves, of a further 5% to 7%, are met on
a consolidated basis. <BR>
<BR>
This year also finally saw the introduction of a national interbank market,
accessible only by head office, or branches authorized by head office. It
is intended that this will gradually supersede the regional interbank markets.
<BR>
<BR>
The appearance of a national interbank market - in which interest rates
for periods of less than 60 days are unregulated - also augurs well for
another much-awaited event in Chinese banking circles: interest-rate liberalization.
<BR>
<BR>
The government's aim in setting rates has been to prevent outflow of funds
by keeping long-term deposit rates high but lending rates for ailing state-owned
enterprises low. As a result, according to Zhang of WI Carr, &quot;banks'
margins have been squeezed razor thin&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers look forward to the day when they will have more discretion on the
rates they charge to lenders. &quot;The basic rates of saving and deposits
and of fixed-asset loans are legal rates that cannot be changed,&quot; says
Mao. &quot;For working capital loans, the central bank announces the floating
rates and gives financial institutions a margin: a commercial bank can make
a loan within this margin under the approval of the monetary authority.&quot;
But, even for the working capital loans, the amount of discretion given
to banks &quot;generally speaking&quot; is &quot;not much&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
However fast the pace of change, Bank of China managers have gripes about
other mechanisms now in place. The biggest constraint is the quota system
used by the PBOC, in the absence of developed mechanisms of monetary control,
to control inflation. At the beginning of each year, the central bank sets
a lending limit, or quota, for each bank. This cannot be overshot, regardless
of how much a bank raises in deposits. <BR>
<BR>
This year, Bank of China, because of its size, was one of the few banks
subject to a quota. Managers, however, are hopeful that within the next
few years, the quota will disappear. <BR>
<BR>
However much Bank of China suffers from its position as a big state-owned
bank, too rapid a distancing from the government could be harmful. The growing
distance between the bank and the government was the main reason for the
downgrade by Moody's last April from A3 to Baa1. <BR>
<BR>
Few argue that the government would allow a state-owned bank to get into
trouble. However, there is a danger that the bank's interests will be less
strictly guarded in future. As one analyst points out, &quot;Chinese banks
have a lot of services - in Bank of China's case in particular for payments.
The fees they are charging on a lot of those services are outrageous. The
reason the banks can do it is because they are a monopoly. But what will
happen when they face competition in these services?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The most obvious challenge is foreign banks which are still allowed only
one branch per city and are excluded from local currency business. At the
moment, Bank of China says it has little to fear. Although foreign banks
may be more experienced in foreign exchange transactions, their limited
branch network prevents them from winning business from Bank of China. <BR>
<BR>
If the twists and turns of the Chinese banking environment are enough to
cause the average banker to pull his hair out, Bank of China executives
remain unperturbed. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, their plans are ambitious. Although traditionally a specialized
bank, managers say that in future they would like Bank of China to be a
&quot;universal bank&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The past decade has seen the bank making strides into a traditionally very
limited area of banking in China, the retail market. Around Beijing, a newly
designed logo sparkles above retail outlets in an attempt to attract individual
customers. Radios blare with advertisements for the bank's Great Wall credit
card, ATMs can be found in most major shops and in parts of the country
with developed communications systems - mainly coastal areas such as Shenzhen
- telephone banking has been introduced. <BR>
<BR>
Progress has not been impressive by international standards. China's credit
cards have turned out to be debit cards. And it is hard to find an ATM which
works. <BR>
<BR>
Home mortgages are another area of interest to the bank. Although Bank of
China has not delved into it yet, Mao calls it &quot;the area with the most
potential for the banking business&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
One major area which will become out of bounds to commercial banks as a
result of China's reforms is merchant banking. This is a significant change.
Traditionally most Chinese banks have had a trust and investment department
- even at branch level. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Investment banking</B> <BR>
<BR>
All these are being hived off. Bank of China Trust and Consultancy - the
bank's merchant banking arm - is still a department of the bank, but the
process of separation is likely to be complete by next year. Bank of China
officials hope they will be able to keep it as a subsidiary and retain the
Bank of China name. <BR>
<BR>
This would involve a special dispensation from the government. But the fact
that the People's Construction Bank of China managed to get approval for
a joint venture investment bank with Morgan Stanley - even though this was
just before the law made investment banking business illegal for banks -
shows that the authorities are prepared to make some exceptions. <BR>
<BR>
Abroad no restrictions apply, and Bank of China is actively involved in
investment banking through its Hong Kong branch and subsidiaries. The next
plan is to open a merchant bank registered in London. <BR>
<BR>
It seems that the bank is prepared to do anything. &quot;Everything we're
allowed to do, we want to do,&quot; says Mao. <BR>
<BR>
Will Bank of China eventually move its headquarters to Shanghai, China's
designated financial centre? The bank is keeping its options open. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some people have been encouraging all the commercial banks, especially
the biggest four, to move their offices to Shanghai. Maybe in future we
will put focus on our Shanghai branch,&quot; says Mao. &quot;But it depends
on how Shanghai develops as a financial centre. Hong Kong is a bigger financial
centre within Asia, and we will have to see how Shanghai compares with that.&quot;

<H3>HIGH-TECH STOCKS </H3>
<H2>Cash return or crash and burn? </H2>
<H4>In the space of a few years, the Californian boutiques helping high-tech
companies come to market have seen their profitable niche invaded by major
Wall Street firms. Now banks and investors from across the Atlantic are
threatening to get in on the act. But are the Europeans buying into a maturing
industry - or a market reaching its top? Michelle Celarier investigates
</H4>
Turning up at a local charity event recently, a San Francisco investment
banker was stunned by the number of Chanel suits. It was like something
out of <I>Bonfire of the Vanities</I>. &quot;Social X-rays&quot; -
the term Tom Wolfe coined to describe New York's skeletal society matrons
- had replaced the laid-back &quot;California girls&quot; the banker
remembered from his college days at Stanford University. <BR>
<BR>
All this haute couture is just one sign of the San Francisco Bay area's
financial coming of age. A posting here was once the kiss of death for an
investment banker's career, but the boom in technology-company flotations
has changed all that. &quot;There's a ton of money coming in here,&quot;
says Mike Hall, an attorney at Venture Law Group in Menlo Park's Sand Hill
Road, a two-mile strip in Silicon Valley where scores of venture capitalists
have their offices. Thirty miles (50 kilometres) south of San Francisco,
this street of unassuming suburban business parks houses some of the most
expensive real estate in the US, rivalling Manhattan and Honolulu. <BR>
<BR>
A huge amount of money has been pouring through this district. Last year,
venture capitalists raised $4.5 billion to pour into technology start-ups,
the biggest chunk of it going to Californian companies. Just two years ago,
they raised only $1.5 billion. And this is just the first step in the process
towards an eventual public offering (IPO). In 1995, technology-company IPOs
raised almost $9 billion, about 40% of the $20 billion total Wall Street
financing that year and more than double the amount raised in 1994. This
year, the trend has accelerated. By the end of June, more than $10 billion
had already been raised. <BR>
<BR>
For the handful of investment banks that dominate the area, it's a licence
to print money: last year bankers earned $1 billion in gross spreads off
technology deals. Investors can't seem to get enough of technology stocks.
As Frank Quattrone, recently recruited as chief executive of DMG Technology,
notes, technology companies now have a combined market capitalization of
nearly $1 trillion. <BR>
<BR>
Quattrone should know. As one of Silicon Valley's leading bankers when he
was at Morgan Stanley, he helped float many of the stars, including Internet
pioneer Netscape, whose IPO last summer set the standard for all others
since. At DMG Technology, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's new high-tech banking
operation, he is set to shake things up further. DMG says it is going to
be the low-cost producer, somewhat amazingly, since Quattrone was reportedly
lured to the company by a compensation package valued at $20 million over
three years. <BR>
<BR>
Not since the Gold Rush last century has the San Francisco Bay area seen
such easy money. But will it all be spoilt by speculative fever and cut-throat
competition? Old-timers say the quality of companies is already diminishing,
just as it did during the similar, if less spectacular, technology boom
of the early 1980s, or the ill-fated biotech boom of the early 1990s, when
investors discovered it took time and money to make the start-ups profitable.
&quot;Both investment banks and venture capitalists have become more aggressive,&quot;
says Gary Morgenthaler, who heads the Silicon Valley office of the venture-capital
firm Morgenthaler Partners. &quot;There is a lot of pressure, and they are
reaching for companies. We see a lot of companies going public where we're
scratching our heads. It's dangerous.&quot; The arrival of foreign banks,
and the interest among foreign investors - demonstrated by the overflowing
attendance at American boutiques' European conferences this year -
are considered two of the clearest signals yet that the market is nearing
its top. <BR>
<BR>
Local investment bankers predict that margins will be squeezed and at least
one of the high-tech investment boutiques, which have expanded their staffs
to churn out the deals, will be gobbled up by a big institution before it's
all over. At the same time, bankers say they are preparing for an eventual
downturn in IPO business. Noting that many newly-public companies have built
up huge cash reserves, the bankers are beefing up M&amp;A teams to help
advise on the expected consolidation. They are also looking abroad, seeking
both investors and corporate-finance clients. Regardless of how this boom
plays out, no one is betting on technology going away. <BR>
<BR>
Historically, technology has been viewed as a niche business rather than
a strategic interest for bankers and investors. Financing was mainly handled
by a small group of boutiques such as Hambrecht &amp; Quist (H&amp;Q), Robertson
Stephens and Montgomery Securities (all partnerships based in San Francisco)
and Alex Brown (the lone East Coast firm). H&amp;Q and Robertson Stephens
are the purest technology boutiques. Alex Brown, which went public in 1986,
has $500 million in equity and is bigger than the other three, calling itself
a &quot;major-bracket&quot; firm. Montgomery, three times the size of H&amp;Q,
boasts of its New York-style pressure-cooker atmosphere. It has the largest
trading operation west of Manhattan, which is run by former New Yorkers.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>New Yorkers head west</B> <BR>
<BR>
The latest boom has doubled or tripled the workforces of many local institutions,
bringing in many self-styled &quot;survivors of New York&quot; to work in
the Bay area. New York institutions such as Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, Lehman
Brothers and Merrill Lynch have also boosted their presence. But only two
of New York's bulge-bracket firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have
shown a consistent commitment to the business. Last year they ranked second
and fifth, respectively, in the league table of technology IPO lead managers,
as measured by the amount raised, according to Securities Data. This year,
by June, they ranked first and third. <BR>
<BR>
Price competition has so far been non-existent, with relationships critical
in landing deals. But all that could change as technology becomes mainstream
and the competition heats up. &quot;It is one of the most strategic and
rapidly growing segments of industry,&quot; says Brad Koenig, who heads
Goldman Sachs's San Francisco investment-banking operation. <BR>
<BR>
Local bankers like to talk about how many silicon chips are in cars and
kitchens and how the Internet will eventually replace telephones as the
dominant mode of communication. Technology, they argue compellingly, is
invasive. By some definitions, it already accounts for 10% of US GDP and
is growing at 10%-plus annually. Moreover, it's a global industry. Half
of the sales of the big US-based high-tech companies are already international,
notes Koenig. And while some 80% of the world's high-tech companies are
located in the US, with half of those in Silicon Valley, companies in places
as far-flung as Israel, Belgium and Singapore now account for 20% of the
bankers' business. Goldman estimates it will soon be 25%. &quot;You have
to target this business to be successful, and every one of the global firms
is evaluating how it can do so,&quot; says Koenig. <BR>
<BR>
The big European players have taken note. Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS)
hired a team of bankers from firms such as Hambrecht &amp; Quist and Alex
Brown a year ago, and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) has approached San Francisco
boutiques about possible joint ventures. But it is Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
that took the boldest step, when its US subsidiary set up the boutique-like
DMG Technology. Headed by Quattrone and staffed by almost three-quarters
of Morgan Stanley's former technology team, including corporate financier
Bill Brady and M&amp;A specialist George Boutros, it already has a professional
staff of more than 40. <BR>
<BR>
DMG Technology is counting on Deutsche Bank's financial strength, low cost
of capital and, most importantly, relatively low target for return on equity
(ROE) to help bring in the business. While US firms must show their shareholders
a 20% ROE, the universal bank needs to make only half of that. And DMG is
willing to pass along the savings to the client. &quot;We will be more aggressive
in using our capital to the benefit of our clients,&quot; promises Quattrone.
Deutsche is also willing to pay more for talent, and the Quattrone team's
huge pay package has already boosted salary levels in the Bay area. All
told, it's almost certain to mean lower profit margins for the industry,
predicts a Silicon Valley banker. Morgan Stanley &quot;will have to increase
its cost structure or risk revenues going away,&quot; he notes. Morgan Stanley
did not return calls to comment, but it is said to be trying to repair the
damage done by the defections from its technology team and has offered huge
bonuses to keep those members that are left. <BR>
<BR>
The idea of price competition surprises DMG Technology's potential customers.
&quot;It's novel,&quot; muses Morgenthaler, a long-time Goldman client.
&quot;It would cause a fundamental rethinking of the business, which has
never been characterized by open competition.&quot; Investment banks now
charge a flat 7% on equity underwritings, regardless of size. That makes
it more lucrative than fixed-income, which earns 1%, or high-yield, with
3%. &quot;I think there is room to compete profitably,&quot; says Morgenthaler,
&quot;but if they take that approach, they will challenge the business.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Others don't think such a tactic is necessary, and many believe it will
be used only as a loss-leader. &quot;I don't think you pick your underwriter
based on price,&quot; says Andy Rachleff, who runs the venture-capital firm
Benchmark Capital Partners. He and his peers are critical to the investment
bankers' success, since they have a key role in deciding who wins mandates
for their start-ups' activities. Rachleff advises his companies to choose
their underwriter on the basis of quality of research, trading support and
&quot;chemistry&quot;. &quot;I don't think Frank needs to [cut prices] in
order to win, because he's so good.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Whether or not there is a price war, the sudden shift of players is sure
to have a major impact on the business. And while every bank is trying to
take advantage of Morgan Stanley's loss of staff, none is more confident
than Goldman Sachs. &quot;We're in the best position to take advantage of
it,&quot; says Koenig. Goldman has the global reach, the top-ranked analysts,
what one competitor calls a &quot;marquee name&quot;, and a record of success.
Last year, the IPOs it launched showed an average 66% return, putting it
third among the top 10 lead managers. Alex Brown - which has the broadest
reach of any of the smaller players - came first with 84%, and Morgan
Stanley was second with 73%. Goldman is now aggressively courting Morgan
Stanley's clients, including Apple Computer, for which it recently did a
$660 million convertible overnight financing. Morgan Stanley represented
Apple during its ill-fated merger talks with Sun Microsystems, which was
represented by Goldman. <BR>
<BR>
Most of the smaller firms have no ambitions to be bulge-bracket players,
but they're not sitting still. As a group, they tout their expertise and
believe their focus is what sets them apart. &quot;The rest of the world
is waking up to what we knew 20 years ago,&quot; says Andrew Sheehan, a
managing director at Alex Brown, pointing to the firm's success in promoting
success stories such as Microsoft and Silicon Graphics in their early days.
Although Alex Brown is based in Maryland, with offices in Tokyo and London,
its San Francisco office now employs 60 investment bankers out of its 190
worldwide. This year, the firm has jumped to number two in lead-managing
technology IPOs (in terms of amount raised), up from third place in 1995.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Depth of knowledge can't be possible if you're spread in 10 to 15
sectors,&quot; says Misha Petkevich, a managing director at Robertson Stephens,
last year's top technology lead manager in terms of number of deals and
amount raised. A salesman at a bulge-bracket firm, who might be trying to
sell Latin American debt as well as the latest Internet IPO, can't have
the technical expertise required, he argues. &quot;The big investment banks
have always allocated resources based on the flavour of the month,&quot;
he says. &quot;Our view is that there are good and bad markets. I love downturns:
they get rid of all the big boys.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The venture-capital companies may be enamoured of the big New York firms
and their cachet, but the specialists get their share of deals, and are
often sought as co-managers because of their depth of research and commitment
to coverage. Venture capitalist Morgenthaler explains: &quot;Since fees
are the same, and if the stock is hot anybody can get it sold, the difference
comes down to, 'What is the quality of the research?'&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Highly-regarded, independent research has been key to the success of Alex
Brown, which claims to have the largest research team covering technology
in the US, and of Cowen &amp; Co, a research and money-management house
that covers only three other industry sectors. &quot;We have exceptional
research and more all-star analysts than some bulge-bracket firms,&quot;
boasts Terrence Connolly, who runs Cowen's investment-banking activity.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Internet craze</B> <BR>
<BR>
Flushed with success, the smaller firms are trying to make their mark abroad.
Hambrecht &amp; Quist recently reopened its London office, closed in the
late 1980s following a financial scandal that almost bankrupted the company.
And Cowen has been sponsoring conferences in Europe for the past three years,
showcasing its European corporate clients to US and foreign investors. &quot;The
entrepreneurial community in Europe is active and robust. Those companies
need to go public and need to use investment bankers,&quot; says managing
director Robert Valdez. The reason European companies turn to US bankers
is simple. There is still no easy route for a small company to go public
in Europe, though attempts are being made to establish a European equivalent
of Nasdaq, the US's over-the-counter stock market. <BR>
<BR>
Robertson Stephens has just added a London office to its branches in San
Francisco, New York, Boston and Tokyo. It sponsored its first conference
in the city last month. &quot;It was fabulous, wildly successful,&quot;
says Petkevich. The 200-strong audience was double what the firm expected,
and 80% of those present were Europeans eager to find out about US technology
companies such as America Online, which Robertson Stephens took public several
years ago. Likewise, Montgomery Securities syndicate head Dick Smith notes
that a conference his firm held in Paris in April was an &quot;enormous
success&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Europe, like other parts of the world, may be creating more high-tech companies
in which US investors are eager to invest. But whether European investors
can be convinced to buy technology stocks is a matter of great debate among
Silicon Valley bankers. Robertson Stephens's Petkevich says the firm has
consistently placed between 15% and 20% of its deals in the hands of European
investors, even though they were covered out of San Francisco. Others, however,
note that European investors have largely missed the high-tech boom in the
US stock market. <BR>
<BR>
Barry McCurdy, the research director for the highly-regarded San Francisco
boutique Volpe Welty, is among those who doubt there will be any great European
interest in the near future. He headed H&amp;Q's UK office in the 1980s,
and covered Scotland. &quot;I'd never bother to go there now,&quot; he says.
&quot;If a market cap is less than $500 million, they're just not interested.&quot;
Scottish money managers have been out of the market for four or five years,
he says. &quot;Either they feel they've missed it, or they haven't gotten
to the point of pain yet because their returns are adequate.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In a way, of course, many Silicon Valley bankers don't want to see a great
influx of foreign investors. They recall with trepidation the stock-market
crash of 1987, which occurred shortly after European investors finally bought
into US equities. Almost by definition, foreign investors are less informed,
say the us bankers. &quot;There are market-top signals everywhere,&quot;
says one veteran, &quot;but when European investors start throwing fistfuls
of money at it, that'll be the real top.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What may finally pull in the foreigners is the craze for Internet companies,
estimated to represent half of the investments in the venture capitalists'
portfolios. At Goldman, which just lead-managed the IPO of Yahoo!, the Internet
directory firm, Koenig says this is the firm's greatest emphasis. &quot;The
Internet is the biggest story and will continue to be for some time,&quot;
adds venture capitalist Rachleff. Investors and bankers alike admit they
are looking for the next Netscape. Kleiner Perkins, the venture-capital
firm that backed Netscape, earned an estimated 2,000% return on its $5 million
equity investment. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers note that Internet stocks are particularly vulnerable to bad news.
Without any historical method of valuation (ie, no price/earnings ratios),
flotations are supposedly priced on the basis of price/revenue ratios. In
reality, however, they are priced on the basis of other Internet company
IPOs, leaving little room to reflect differences in quality. This makes
their stock prices particularly volatile. &quot;There can't be as much value
in the Internet as the portfolio of money suggests,&quot; says Venture Law's
Hall. &quot;There will be some crash-and-burn stories.&quot; Unable to pick
the winners from the losers, many bankers and venture capitalists are said
to be playing a batting-average game: if they do enough deals, they're bound
to score some hits. So far, so good: venture capitalists say that many had
returns of over 100% last year, though 30% is more normal. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Surviving a bust</B> <BR>
<BR>
The bust that followed the original Silicon Valley boom in the early 1980s
dragged many technology firms under. But today's market is even wilder.
&quot;Very few Internet businesses today are profitable,&quot; says Morgenthaler.
&quot;When the dust settles, and investors come to their senses, they are
going to look at which businesses are generating a return on equity.&quot;
The fear investors have is that the good companies could get dragged down
with the bad. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have absolutely zero control about what happens out there,&quot;
philosophizes Robertson Stephens's Petkevich. Competitors like to point
to his company, the number-one lead manager last year, as the most vulnerable
to any downturn. Last year, it came fifth among the top-10 technology IPO
underwriters in terms of deal performance, with a 38% average return. This
year, it has so far taken things easier, ranking only seventh in terms of
dollars raised. Has it done the right deals? &quot;We won't know until it
starts to slow down,&quot; says Petkevich. In past downturns, he points
out, the firm has stuck to its knitting and come out all right. In 1994,
for example, when many Wall Street firms suffered losses, Robertson Stephens's
revenues were basically flat. &quot;We were focused. When the market turned,
we were already having conversations with companies. If you focus on a special
industry, you pay attention to it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In preparation for the next phase, though, most of the firms are trying
to change their emphasis or at least tout their M&amp;A expertise. That
is where the big money is to be made next, and where companies such as Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs excel (Morgan Stanley has already advised Netscape
on several acquisitions). But the smaller firms are also gearing up. Cowen
&amp; Co, for example, recruited Lehman alumnus Valdez in 1994 to set up
its M&amp;A advisory practice. And some are already well positioned. Alex
Brown's global reach helped make it number seven in global M&amp;A deals
last year. It represented US companies Software Toolworks (sold to Pearson)
and Teknekron (bought by Reuters) and helped Diamond Multimedia buy the
German graphics company Spea Technology. &quot;We were brought in because
the small advisory firms that took it public couldn't do it,&quot; says
Sheenan. In addition, he jokes, the firm has an active bankruptcy and reorganization
department. <BR>
<BR>
Silicon Valley's original boom was financed by a group of banks known as
the Four Horsemen - Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Robertson Stephens, Alex
Brown and LF Rothschild, which was wiped out in 1984's high-tech crash.
With technology becoming a fixture of the industrial landscape, bankers
hope the next downturn will bring mergers among financial institutions,
rather than outright failures. There is also talk of companies selling out
soon, while the market is still hot. &quot;The time to be selling your business
is when everything is just fine, not when you're in trouble,&quot; says
Volpe Welty's McCurdy. &quot;If you want to sell, the time to do is when
everything never looked better.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bankers also think the time is ripe for greater foreign investment or joint
ventures. Reports that SBC was on the prowl for a small boutique have met
with denials from all concerned; however, bankers close to the situation
admit the European bank has talked to some of the private-partnership boutiques
about possible joint ventures. Montgomery's Smith confirms his firm has
been talking to SBC about possible deals that would give him greater access
to potential European corporate-finance clients. Robertson Stephens executives
insist they want to remain independent, and Hambrecht &amp; Quist is in
the midst of registration for an IPO and is keeping mum altogether. <BR>
<BR>
Precisely because its capital structure is changing, H&amp;Q is widely viewed
as the most vulnerable to takeover. An estimated 20% of the firm will be
sold, but, more importantly, the partnership system that helps keep many
such firms together will disappear. Already H&amp;Q has lost four of its
most talented research analysts, three to UBS and one to DMG. <BR>
<BR>
Robertson Stephens may also be ripe for picking. San Francisco-based Bank
of America has been rumoured to be negotiating to buy the high-flier, but
Robertson Stephens's president has vehemently denied it. Still, other bankers
speculate that the firm's strategy of doing so many deals that bring in
current income but might come undone in a few years suggests it is setting
itself up for a quick sale. <BR>
<BR>
A financial market characterized by highly-profitable, small partnerships
that are suddenly thrust into a much bigger, bare-knuckled competitive world
reminds many newcomers of their past. Could it be, wonder veterans of New
York in the 1980s, or London after Big Bang, that San Francisco is the next
spot for a shake-out in investment banking? McCurdy, a former London banker,
reminds those who have spent all their banking lives on the West Coast of
what happened to the City's small firms after Big Bang: &quot;There wasn't
a single success story.&quot;  <HR>
<H3>&quot;Just suspend your disbelief&quot; </H3>
After barely two months in business, the newest player in technology banking
has already landed a dozen M&amp;A assignments and minor positions on six
equity mandates. &quot;We had a strategy to get into the flow,&quot; says
DMG Technology's boss, Frank Quattrone, who until April ran Morgan Stanley's
high-tech team. Last month DMG landed the lead-management mandate for a
$100 million secondary offering for Wind River Systems, and another lead-manager
spot on a software IPO for Document Sciences, both of which are in negotiation.
&quot;We're off to the races,&quot; Quattrone declares. <BR>
<BR>
DMG Technology has a lot to prove, though. Until recently its employees
made up the bulk of Morgan Stanley's high-tech team; now they must show
they can work as well for new backer Deutsche Bank. &quot;People are watching
to see if DMG can succeed,&quot; says Andy Rachleff, who runs the venture-capital
firm Benchmark Capital Partners. Rachleff and his peers are critical to
the investment bankers' well-being: the first financiers for start-ups,
they also play a central role in deciding who handles public offerings or
M&amp;A assignments. Even after the companies they sponsor go public, venture-capital
companies usually retain hefty stakes and are often represented on the board
of directors. <BR>
<BR>
Rachleff is well disposed towards Quattrone and his colleagues. At Morgan
Stanley, they underwrote more of his business than anyone else. &quot;They
do a fantastic job of packaging the company's story for investors,&quot;
he says, &quot;and they are incredibly valuable as advisors helping understand
the public-market perspective and thinking through acquisition strategies.&quot;
And yet, Benchmark has just chosen Morgan Stanley as the lead underwriter
for an IPO it is planning. &quot;They just made a more compelling case for
how good a job they would do,&quot; he says. As for DMG, Rachleff notes:
&quot;In any start-up it's an up-hill battle. If they can recruit quality
analysts and can build a quality distribution channel, it ought to be very
successful.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Quattrone realizes that winning over the venture capitalists is one of his
most important tasks. &quot;There are some influential companies we need
to make the case to. It's the 80/20 rule: 80% of the high quality IPO prospects
are in the portfolios of 20 venture-capital firms.&quot; Quattrone convinced
his former employer, Morgan Stanley, to set up its office in Silicon Valley's
Menlo Park, where it would be close to the venture-capital firms; DMG Technology
is located there as well, while most of the investment banks are an hour's
drive away in San Francisco. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, he has close working and personal relationships with the main
players. His message now is: &quot;Trust us - we're going to deliver
the goods. We've delivered before and we're going to do so again. Just suspend
any disbelief and you may imagine us succeeding.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Already DMG Technology has more senior high-tech bankers than Goldman Sachs
and more professionals than many of the local boutiques. Since Morgan Stanley's
respected technology analysts did not follow Quattrone to DMG, he has had
to recruit in that area and has nabbed such well-regarded individuals as
Internet specialist Bill Gurley of CS First Boston. He is also working hard
to convince venture capitalists that CJ Lawrence, the US equity-distribution
arm of Deutsche Bank, which has 200 institutional accounts, can find buyers
when the time comes to float high-tech start-ups. <B>- MC</B> <HR><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1>

<H2>GUT TAKES A TUMBLE </H2>
<H4>Did Nikolaus Senn, chairman of the embattled Union Bank of Switzerland,
seize a merger proposal from CS chairman Rainer Gut and use it as a crude
weapon against his bitterest enemy and major shareholder Martin Ebner? Here's
the story whose climax a third of all Zurich inhabitants watched on television.
But will it have a happy ending? And who pairs off with whom? David Shirreff
reports </H4>
Nikolaus Senn, the 69-year-old chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland, unwinding
at his holiday home in Florida, gets a message from the office in Zurich.
Rainer Gut, chairman of rival group CS Holding, wants to have a talk. <BR>
<BR>
Senn is suddenly wrenched, from the relaxation of Palm Beach, back to the
hot-house he left in Zurich. It's two weeks before his bank's annual general
meeting (AGM) - the last he will see as chairman. It promises to be
a cliff-hanger. According to the rumours that abound in the Swiss-German
city Martin Ebner, maverick banker whose fund BK Vision is a major UBS shareholder,
is close to amassing enough votes to block the appointment of Senn's designated
successor, outgoing chief executive Robert Studer. <BR>
<BR>
There are also rumours that Gut has joined forces with a group of institutional
shareholders in UBS - Winterthur Insurance, Swiss Re-insurance, Roche
Holding - either to support Ebner, or to push UBS in some other uncomfortable
direction. Senn is curious to know what Gut has to say. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I called to set your mind at rest,&quot; says Gut. &quot;There's no
truth in these rumours that we're planning to support BK Vision at your
AGM.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Glad to hear it,&quot; says Senn thinking, is this all? Gut isn't
a man who calls you just to tell you what he's <I>not</I> going to do. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is one other thing,&quot; says Gut. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's that?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
According to both sides, Gut then suggests it might be time to discuss a
merger between the two banks. <BR>
<BR>
But how he broaches the subject, and how it is received by Senn, later becomes
a matter of fierce controversy in Zurich. Is this a veiled takeover threat,
or a friendly offer to share some thoughts on a question that is &quot;bound
to be raised sooner or later&quot; as a defensive CS press release afterwards
explains. <BR>
<BR>
Gut's conversation with Senn is friendly - they've known each other
for years. Senn says he'll consult his executive committee, due to meet
in 10 days' time. Gut says he'll fax times and places where he can be reached
over Easter. The date is April 1. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This isn't an April Fool's joke is it?&quot; asks Senn. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; says Gut. He's serious. <BR>
<BR>
The fact is, Switzerland is over-banked. A McKinsey report three years ago
suggested 25,000 banking jobs would have to go by the end of the century,
and since then only 10,000 have been cut. There is revolution among the
cantonal banks; smaller specialized or universal banks have been absorbed
into bigger groups. But almost everyone accepts that the financial retail
sector must be squeezed some more. The debate is about who takes the pain,
and how fast. <BR>
<BR>
All three big banks UBS, CS Holding and Basle-based Swiss Bank Corporation
(SBC), began restructuring their domestic retail operations two years ago.
But in a persistent recession, and a property slump that hasn't reached
bottom, there is an argument for more radical surgery before the banks'
solid profits and their fat capital base start to erode. <BR>
<BR>
Gut, widely revered as Switzerland's foremost investment banker, is more
ready than some to believe the draconian analysis of McKinsey, and more
recently Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which predicts 50% fewer jobs in Swiss finance
by 2005. <BR>
<BR>
Gut also has an eye on global investment banking, where his group, which
includes CS First Boston and Credit Suisse Financial Products (CSFP), has
some of the vital ingredients to make the big league, but somehow hasn't
achieved the critical mass. And, as one rival puts it, he needs the &quot;oxygen&quot;
of a new acquisition. Last year he tried to buy Commerzbank, the year before,
Creditanstalt-Bankverein. Now he sees UBS as a target. <BR>
<BR>
The two banks, UBS and CS Holding, &quot;would together have a chance in
the medium term of making the first league of the global finance industry&quot;,
wrote Gut in a letter to UBS board members 10 days later. &quot;Given the
tendency of the industry to consolidate,&quot; he continued, &quot;a union
between two strong partners can lead to a quantum leap forward. Timely co-operation
is preferable to a defensive merger.&quot; What he didn't say, but what
was surely in his mind, was the estimated Swfr450 billion that UBS has in
funds under management. Together, the banks would be managing about Swfr800
million, making them the second biggest fund manager outside the US, below
only Japan's Kampo. <BR>
<BR>
In hypothetical terms, Gut's proposal made some sense. But the 64-year-old
banker, veteran of many boardroom battles and cross-cultural skirmishes,
had either overlooked or chosen to ignore the psychological impact his suggestion
might have on a bank that already felt under siege. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Ebner factor</B> <BR>
<BR>
Martin Ebner and a group of like-minded investors have been stalking UBS
for four years, criticizing lack-lustre profits, threatening to unseat board
members, and recently unleashing a barrage of court-cases, frustrating board
decisions and even accusing top UBS managers of criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The battle began with Ebner's game of arbitrage between UBS's two classes
of shares - the registered shares (nominal value Swfr20) and the bearer
shares (nominal value Swfr100) which carry equal voting rights. (The registered
shares cannot be held by foreigners, which in theory keeps the majority
of votes in Swiss hands.) Ebner's fund BK Vision invested in the registered
shares when their voting leverage was undervalued, and drove up the price.
His strategic argument was that when UBS, like many other Swiss companies,
finally unified its two classes of shares into registered shares, holders
of the registered shares would enjoy a windfall profit. <BR>
<BR>
Matters came to a head in November 1994 when UBS called an extraordinary
general meeting to vote on the share unification. But it was proposing to
unify the stock into bearer shares, not, as other Swiss companies had done,
into registered shares. Ebner cried foul and attempted to get the move voted
down. He lost, but only by a narrow margin of around 0.3%. <BR>
<BR>
Recriminations followed. Ebner accused UBS of buying votes before the meeting.
UBS accused Ebner of flouting the company's bye-laws by forming a concert
party of investors. Ebner and his lawyer Peter Hafter launched five lawsuits
related to the affair, one of which is a criminal action against Studer,
then chief executive of UBS, for fraudulent business dealing. Another of
Ebner's lawsuits has effectively blocked UBS from going ahead with the share
unification. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout 1995 the slanging match continued, with Ebner not disguising
his distaste for Studer, the chairman-designate. In January this year Ebner
said he was continuing to build his BZ group's stake in UBS shares, which
then stood at about 10%, and that he might propose an alternative to Studer
at the annual general meeting on April 16. <BR>
<BR>
But in February it seemed the constellation of UBS shareholders was changing.
Industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny, a member of one of Switzerland's richest
dynasties, said he had bought a 5% packet of UBS registered shares from
BK Vision for around Swfr250 million. There were reports that Winterthur
Insurance, Zurich Insurance and Swiss Re-insurance had also bought similar
blocks of up to 5% from Ebner's BK Vision. UBS bye-laws, after a 1990 amendment,
allow major shareholders a maximum of 5% voting rights, whatever the size
of their stake. UBS also refuses to count votes that come under another
major shareholder's sphere of influence. For example, the 1.1 million (just
under 5%) votes of watchmaker Rolex Holding were disqualified in a 1994
vote because Rolex was identified with BK Vision, since it owned 50% of
BK Vision's capital. <BR>
<BR>
With this influx of new, establishment shareholders it seemed Ebner's influence
might be waning - until it became apparent that Ebner was replacing
his registered shares with UBS bearer shares. A group of shareholders traditionally
identified with him - Roche, right-wing politician and chemicals industrialist
Christoph Blocher, auto importer Walter Frey, each owning UBS stakes of
between 3% and 5%, were still in the frame. It was conceivable that Ebner,
by persuading a few pension funds - also his clients - could swing
enough negative votes to unseat chairman-designate Studer at the April meeting.
That, at any rate, was the analysis circulating in the press, and possibly
in the minds of UBS management. As April 16 drew closer, some calculations
put the possible negative vote as high as 50%. <BR>
<BR>
UBS knew it was under pressure. It launched an advertising campaign in the
newspapers, urging pension fund managers to take their responsibilities
seriously. It sent unprecedented questionnaires to shareholders asking them
to declare whether they had been approached by Ebner to join a vote at the
AGM or to co-ordinate their vote with other UBS shareholders. The letter
even wanted details of any share repo agreements that might temporarily
have assigned voting rights to others. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Escape route</B> <BR>
<BR>
With these signs of panic, Gut saw his chance: to offer UBS and its confused
shareholders a third way out of the stalemate that had paralyzed the bank's
decision-making for 18 months. They could vote for Ebner, they could vote
for Studer, or they could be asked to digest the fact that CS Holding and
UBS are in merger talks. <BR>
<BR>
After Gut's call, Senn went through the motions of considering his proposal.
In Zurich, incoming UBS chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta headed a small
task force working over Easter, reviewing data on market share, cost savings,
economies of scale, overlap and synergy. &quot;We told them, keep your emotions
out of it and look at the facts,&quot; recalls Studer. &quot;It would have
been incorrect vis-&agrave;-vis our shareholders not to have done so.&quot;
According to Senn, Gut had pressed for an agreement in principle before
the annual general meeting. At this stage only a handful of people on each
side knew of the proposal. In the light of what then happened, Gut might
have wished the whole thing had been killed at birth. <BR>
<BR>
By April 3, the Zurich bi-weekly <I>Finanz und Wirtschaft</I> was already
hinting that something was in the air. It mused over the strategy of UBS
shareholders Winterthur, Swiss Re and CS Holding, members of an existing
global financial services group. Their individual appearance around UBS
could be concealing a &quot;Gut-style vision - a leap into the global
elite of financial service-providers through a much heralded harnessing
of UBS with CS Holding&quot;, wrote Anne-Marie Nega-Ledermann. <BR>
<BR>
A reporter at the left-wing <I>Tages-Anzeiger</I> worked hard over Easter
to firm up the story. By chance his paper already planned to carry an interview
on April 9 with major UBS shareholder and board member Stephan Schmidheiny.
But the interview was only a general one. The reporter, Hanspeter B&uuml;rgin,
faxed Schmidheiny some more questions on April 4, which were specific to
UBS. Will he vote for Studer? Has he heard about a possible alignment of
Gut and Ebner? What does he think about a merger of two big banks? Schmidheiny
replied and followed up with a phone call saying he wanted the interview
to be as hard-hitting as possible. <BR>
<BR>
Yes, he will vote for Studer. Yes, he has heard rumours about Gut and Ebner
and &quot;I must say I'm somewhat shocked. I find it difficult to imagine
that the heads of these firms are using the money of their shareholders,
their pensioners and their insurance clients to join a conspiracy against
UBS, orchestrated by Martin Ebner, and the slanderous campaign against Robert
Studer&quot;. Schmidheiny also advised CS Holding that instead of thinking
about a merger with UBS &quot;it should do its homework on the acquisitions
it has already made in the last few years, such as Swiss Volksbank and the
Neue Aargauer Bank&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
By the evening of April 8, B&uuml;rgin had put together enough evidence
from &quot;three utterly reliable sources&quot; to come out with a strong
front-page story for the next day, the first edition after the Easter break.
The story was headed: &quot;CS wants control of UBS - Banker Rainer
Gut delivers ultimatum - should merger be forced? - Schmidheiny
fears conspiracy&quot;. Beside it was an editorial column headed: &quot;An
evil blackmail&quot; accusing Gut, Ebner and their supporters of &quot;an
irresponsible destabilization of the biggest Swiss bank&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The story was dynamite. The initial reaction from CS and UBS was a flat
&quot;no comment&quot;. But the unions were already up in arms at the threat
to thousands of jobs. At the Federal Cartel Commission the phones started
ringing: journalists and bankers, mostly Japanese, wanted to know if such
an enormous step is possible without the commission's say-so. It is, they
were told, until July 1 when a new monopoly law comes into force. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Recriminations</B> <BR>
<BR>
Inside the two big banks a witch-hunt began, or at least the pretence of
one. Who was the source of the leak? Gut's fury - the first time he
spoke about it publicly two weeks later - suggests there was no deliberate
leak on the CS side. &quot;Because it was publicized earlier than intended,&quot;
said Gut on April 22, &quot;[it] needlessly caused the financial world to
hold its breath.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Only a handful of people at UBS knew about the proposal - Senn, Studer,
Cabiallavetta, a team of experts, and, in preparation for their April 11
meeting, probably all members of the executive board. The full UBS board
includes Schmidheiny, who we know spoke to <I>Tages-Anzeiger</I>, and Andreas
Reinhart, a former shareholder in Ebner's BZ Bank, who was a candidate for
re-election to the board at the AGM. But, from bitter experience, some who
have tussled with him say there was no need to look any further than Senn
himself. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've had the experience of leakages from UBS too,&quot; says Kurt
Schiltknecht, chief executive of BZ Trust, part of Ebner's group. Schiltknecht
cites two occasions when the substance of private discussions between Senn
and Ebner were conveniently leaked a couple of days later. The first was
two years ago when Senn and Ebner discussed the introduction of a single
UBS share; the second after discussions on the relationship between BK Vision
and UBS. &quot;Two days later UBS made a press conference,&quot; says Schiltknecht.
&quot;This teaches you something.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
CS pointed the blame clearly at the UBS camp. A CS statement on April 9
said the <I>Tages-Anzeiger</I> article was &quot;based on a one-sided and
sensationalized leaked report of a telephone conversation between the respective
chairmen of CS Holding and UBS&quot;. But CS continued to believe that the
question of a merger should be debated, the statement added. <BR>
<BR>
Undaunted, Gut wrote a letter to UBS board members outlining his view of
the merger: &quot;Combined earnings could rise from the present Swfr3 billion
to Swfr4.5 billion or Swfr5 billion and even more,&quot; he said. In the
short term there could be a cost saving of Swfr2 billion. This could increase
shareholder value by Swfr20 billion, with a yield of 13% to 14%, Gut argued,
not to mention the further strategic opportunities. &quot;We believe we
have a duty to our shareholders to pursue this project. Now it has become
public we must proceed more carefully.&quot; Gut referred to a &quot;new
wind&quot; blowing through the banking scene. &quot;This new wind -
some people call it a storm - is unavoidable. We must unleash it, rather
than being caught by it,&quot; he concluded. The letter was leaked to the
<I>Neue Z&uuml;rcher Zeitung</I>. <BR>
<BR>
But it was already clear which way the wind was blowing. By leaking news
of the proposal to the press UBS was able to use the new threat as a rallying
cry. &quot;Evil forces are trying to destabilize the biggest Swiss bank,
in fact the entire Swiss banking system,&quot; UBS could argue. &quot;You
must vote for what is traditional and good: Mr Studer, who has kept the
bank on an even keel for eight solid years.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
UBS board member Reinhart in an April 10 interview with <I>Finanz und Wirtschaft</I>
gave the orthodox view: &quot;We need shareholders who stand fully behind
the present UBS [management] and think constructively with them...We don't
need any American raider-mentality to bring Switzerland forward, but positive,
constructive action.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The UBS board's executive committee spent two hours on April 11 deliberating
the CS Holding proposal, before rejecting it out of hand. A UBS statement
claimed that the group was significantly ahead of CS Holding in earnings
per share, earnings per employee and capital resources. The few possible
synergies in some fields would by no means compensate for the many negative
aspects of a merger between UBS and CS Holding. <BR>
<BR>
A Credit Suisse statement accepted the decision but the bank said it still
felt there was &quot;potential for the two organizations, merged together,
to take a strategic leap in the rapidly changing financial services world&quot;.
It could not understand how such a long-term vision could be &quot;perceived
as an attempt to influence UBS's current situation&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
But UBS's current situation was its major concern. It had fought off this
real or imagined attack from CS Holding, but would it win the vote in five
days' time? <BR>
<BR>
It was a battle which had been taken to the media, and would now be fought
in the media. But behind the scenes UBS was also canvassing for as much
shareholder support as it could get. There was relief when the Co-op Pension
Fund aligned itself with the UBS board. Although it represents only 1.5%
of the votes, the Co-op is identified with the trade union movement. The
panic about the job losses a merger would cause had brought the Co-op into
line. CS Holding also confirmed, in the face of rumours to the contrary,
that it would be casting its proxy votes in favour of the UBS board, as
it was legally obliged to do - unless depositors of shares with a custodian
instruct otherwise, the custodian must vote in line with management at a
company's AGM. <BR>
<BR>
The weekend before the AGM, Senn continued to use the media. In an interview
on local radio, he accused Credit Suisse of leaking the story. And in a
Sunday tabloid, he rather flippantly suggested that Swiss Bank Corporation
would be a more compatible partner for UBS. Gut kept silent. But his former
colleague Hans-J&ouml;rg Rudloff gave a full-page interview to <I>Finanz
und Wirtschaft</I>. Rudloff, a former CS board member and vice-chairman
designate of the newly merged Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, said
it would have been wise for UBS to consider a merger proposal carefully
instead of rejecting it in knee-jerk fashion after a few days. But these
things could not be done in public or under time pressure, Rudloff said,
adding that a merger between a big Swiss bank and an insurance company might
be more logical. <BR>
<BR>
On Monday, the day before the AGM, Rolex got a call from the UBS legal department
and learned that, although it had sold out of BK Vision, its voting rights
were still the subject of a legal action - accordingly its vote would
be treated the same as last time, as part of BK Vision's maximum 5%. Although
Senn had said he was confident of the vote the next day, UBS was clutching
at every advantage it had. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tuesday, April 16</B> <BR>
<BR>
More than 6,000 UBS shareholders are crowding into the giant ice-hockey
stadium at Oerlikon, a few kilometres outside Zurich. This is the canton's
greatest spectator sport. <I>Tele Z&uuml;ri</I>, the local TV channel, later
says that one out of three inhabitants tuned in to the live broadcast from
the Hallenstadion. An oompah-pah band plays on the podium. Well-dressed
city folk rub shoulders with loden-clad peasants, finishing their lunch
in the adjoining restaurants and bars. A giant television screen throws
up the picture of chairman Senn as he opens the proceedings for the last
time in his career. Beside him, suave, silver-haired, dark-browed, Studer
tries to banish the tension from his body-language. They must sit there
for four hours or more taking all the rubbish that the universe of UBS shareholders,
from the smallest to the biggest, wants to throw at them. There is Ebner
- they've seen him arrive dressed in an immaculate pale grey suit and
the inevitable bow tie, accompanied by his wife Rosmarie. They've spotted
Ekkehard Wenger, the professor from W&uuml;rzburg in Germany, veteran scourge
of many a protracted German blue-chip AGM, with his interminable lectures
on shareholder value. Senn has an antidote to long-winded speakers which
he thinks will work: a five-minute guillotine on all speeches - after
five minutes the microphone automatically cuts off. Before them at the end
of the day, the last item on the agenda is the vote for or against Studer
and three other candidates for membership of the board. <BR>
<BR>
Senn kicks off by answering a written question from Ebner: how many of its
own shares has UBS sold since the beginning of the year? A press report
in March said UBS was discussing the tax treatment of shares that it had
purchased around October 1994 to defend itself from an Ebner onslaught.
A purchase of more than 10% is regarded as a partial liquidation of the
company, with heavy tax consequences, unless the stake is sold again within
two years. Of the 2.6 million shares that showed up on the year-end balance
sheet, says Senn, the bank has sold 2 million. But he won't say to whom.
The Ebner camp suspects that UBS has parked them with Swiss Life, with whom
the bank has a joint venture. But a UBS spokesperson later tells <I>Euromoney</I>
Swiss Life &quot;has no participation in the shares of UBS&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Senn describes how he was &quot;extremely taken aback, not to say shocked,
by the manner of Gut's [merger] proposal&quot; and explains why it was rejected.
Then the five-minute speeches begin. The first attacks Ebner: &quot;It's
not just a question of cash-flow, Mr Ebner. Don't just think of performance
but of the people who depend on their insurance policies.&quot; With some
side-swipes at Credit Suisse, the attacks on Ebner continue: &quot;Ebner
and Co want higher and higher returns, nothing more. That's the new religion.
It's very seductive. But remember an old American Indian saying: 'Material
wealth impoverishes man'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Wenger chastises all the big Swiss banks for their poor return on equity,
far lower than Anglo-Saxon banks. He asks what happens to their already
bad real estate portfolios if property prices fall even lower. <BR>
<BR>
Ebner, when he appears on the big screen, is almost conciliatory. &quot;UBS,&quot;
he says, &quot;could be one of the finest banks in the world and one of
the best employers. All it needs is a strategy to optimize returns.&quot;
But he offers a token criticism of the management of UBS as being &quot;average
at best...They maintain the delusion that there is a contradiction between
being a good employer and a profitable company.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Only two investors attack Studer himself - one accuses him of driving
up fees and cutting branches - &quot;You [Mr Studer] can't accuse Ebner
of wanting to destroy jobs&quot; - the other recalls his poor performance
in a televised debate with then UBS board member and Ebner-associate Blocher
in 1992, on EU membership - &quot;which leads me to doubt his leadership
qualities&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
One speaker protests: &quot;People who envy the bank want to squeeze it
like a lemon. We will not be squeezed by Mr Ebner, or blackmailed by Mr
Gut. Mr Ebner, I offer you a lemon [the speaker takes one from his pocket],
and if you like you can share it with Mr Gut.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some 31 million votes or 80% of the voting rights are represented in the
stadium, but apart from Ebner no major shareholder ventures to speak. It's
a day for the little folk, a day of democracy, explains a meeting veteran.
The mood in the hall seems 100% behind Studer, but the UBS board knows not
to be misled by popular sentiment: that isn't how the powerful votes are
cast. The ballot boxes for the final vote go round. Studer and Senn, four
hours in the firing line, practise the appearance of quiet confidence. A
rough vote-count comes in: around 19 million for Studer and 11 million against
- the Swiss equivalent of motherhood and apple pie has won the day.
<BR>
<BR>
At a hasty press conference a relieved Studer promises strategic changes
at the bank, but warns &quot;you can't get rid of bad debt provisions; you
can't outsource them&quot;. Surprise guests at the occasion are Ebner and
Schiltknecht, keen to pay their respects to the hero of the hour. <BR>
<BR>
But, says Ebner in a confidential aside: &quot;It's not over by a long chalk.
Who do you think has been buying UBS shares for the past few weeks?&quot;
Swiss Bank Corporation, he suggests: &quot;They're already merging, they're
doing a dance together.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Epilogue</B> <BR>
<BR>
Gut saw UBS, an apparently impossible prize, cross his sights like a target
in a shooting gallery. He owed it to his shareholders to have a go. A merger
of two big Swiss banks would have been unthinkable even a year ago. But
the jumbo-merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz now in train meant that in the
past few months everyone in Switzerland had been paired off with everybody
else. <BR>
<BR>
If we believe Gut's vision, CS Holding and UBS had an opportunity to form
an alliance that would bring them into contention with the likes of JP Morgan,
Chase/Chemical and Merrill Lynch. That goal probably blinded him to the
terrible overlap the two banks would have had in Switzerland. In some cantons
the CS group already has a branch of Credit Suisse, and its satellites Swiss
Volksbank and the Neue Aargauer Bank in the same high street. Having another
branch to integrate would have been an extra headache, and a political nightmare.
<BR>
<BR>
Even if this seemed a digestible sacrifice, given the need to cut at least
another 15,000 banking jobs in Switzerland, Gut made two serious mistakes,
as even his friends point out. He underestimated the risk of a leak. And
he put a time-frame on a UBS decision. <BR>
<BR>
It seems he consulted few people before calling Senn. &quot;I know of three
CS Holding board members who weren't informed,&quot; says a board member
at another big Swiss bank. Nor does Gut seem to have formulated a merger
plan or considered which bits of the group would be kept and which spun
off. This surprises those who remember how meticulously he has planned other
takeovers. Some say he was advised, but badly, by a group of pension fund
managers. <BR>
<BR>
Although there were rumours that Gut, Ulrich Bremi, chairman of Swiss Re-insurance,
and Peter Sp&auml;lti, chairman of Winterthur Insurance, were planning something
together, and even collaborating with Ebner, there is no evidence to support
this. Bremi is a CS Holding board member; Sp&auml;lti would be, if he hadn't
resigned so recently from the UBS board (after UBS agreed a joint venture
with competitor Swiss Life, behind Sp&auml;lti's back). Each has a joint
venture with a part of the CS group. If CS were to merge with UBS those
ventures would be directly affected. Winterthur and Swiss Re each bought
shareholdings in UBS this year. But fitting those facts into a conspiracy
can only be speculation. <BR>
<BR>
Ideally, Gut's proposal to UBS needed time and smoke-filled rooms to mature.
But Gut may have seen only a small window of opportunity. UBS was on the
ropes and might possibly have jumped at this chance to rid itself of Ebner
forever. <BR>
<BR>
Gut's obvious Swiss rivals say the affair has considerably damaged his reputation.
He's under pressure to make his group perform. He has been looking for new
life-blood in Europe to help CS Holding grow. First, he tried to buy Commerzbank,
then Creditanstalt-Bankverein. Swiss Volksbank, bought in 1992, has broadened
the group's domestic retail base, but at the cost of Swfr6 billion in provisions
for bad property loans. <BR>
<BR>
Internationally CS First Boston and Credit Suisse Financial Products provide
the Swiss group with a unique range of businesses, but somehow the structure
isn't working, yet. Turf wars and battles about compensation abound (see
separate article, page 46). Although investment banking's return on equity
is around 15%, the group's average of 8.7% is nowhere near the yield of
a Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch. <BR>
<BR>
Gut is admired for taking his group as far as this, having rescued it from
the Chiasso scandal in 1977. But now he is having to compete with integrated
global powerhouses. To do so he may have to break some bones and integrate
his group more tightly, as he has just done in Germany. In the US it's more
difficult, since he doesn't want to lose Credit Suisse's grandfathered banking
licence. His admirers say: expect more surprises from Gut before he retires
in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A pyrrhic victory</B> <BR>
<BR>
Senn staked everything on getting his appointee Robert Studer elected as
his successor. He succeeded, but UBS is in the same, if not worse, position,
as it was before. Martin Ebner and his supporters still amassed 11 million
votes (38%) against Studer on April 16. Studer is under enormous pressure
now to justify his appointment as chairman and to deflect criticisms, not
just from Ebner, that UBS is a flabby, risk-averse, over-conservative institution.
Even the bank's triple-A rating has become a burden, suggesting that, if
global banking is about risk management, the bank at 45 Bahnhofstrasse isn't
working its capital hard enough. <BR>
<BR>
Studer is regarded by his peers as rather a lightweight. But that same peer
group sees in Studer's successor as chief executive, Mathis Cabiallavetta,
a worthy rival and the man most likely to guide UBS aggressively into new
territory. &quot;I'll never be as good as the nice things you write about
me,&quot; Cabiallavetta told a press gathering last month. <BR>
<BR>
UBS must somehow end the embarrassing four-year siege by a major shareholder
- &quot;the tail wagging the dog&quot; as some put it. One hope is
to silence Ebner by raising the bank's return on equity to Anglo-Saxon levels
of 15% to 20%. But the cost-cutting needed to do that would most likely
be politically unacceptable in Switzerland - without the smokescreen
of a merger. <BR>
<BR>
UBS cannot avoid the label that it is now in play. It is a solid bank, but
it has not made the strategic breakthrough internationally that CS Holding
and Swiss Bank Corporation have done. Apart from some strength in the UK
equity market, it has little to show for the many millions spent on growing
market share in Europe and the US. <BR>
<BR>
Germany's Allianz insurance is said to have looked seriously at UBS. It
was even rumoured to have bought a call option on UBS stock from Ebner two
years ago but, after UBS and Swiss Life formed their joint venture, it let
the option expire. <BR>
<BR>
Next year UBS has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Swiss Life, a stake that
Swiss Life can recall if there is a change of status at UBS. &quot;It's
a kind of poison pill,&quot; says Studer. Studer dismisses the thought of
anyone bidding for UBS: &quot;We have a market capitalization of around
Swfr30 billion. A serious bid would have to come in at Swfr50 billion to
Swfr70 billion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But the cash might be forthcoming and the poison pill easily swallowed if
UBS looked like fitting other long-term strategic goals. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Still wagging the dog</B> <BR>
<BR>
Every time the Swiss establishment thinks it has Ebner in a corner, he finds
an exit route they haven't thought of. <BR>
<BR>
His adventures with UBS registered shares are a case in point. Although
a majority of UBS shareholders voted in November 1994 to unify their holdings
into one class of bearer shares, the resolution has been blocked by an Ebner
lawsuit that could drag on for 10 years. And in the meantime it appears
Ebner's BK Vision has sold the bulk of its UBS registered shares and replaced
them with bearer shares. <BR>
<BR>
Ebner's performance at the UBS shareholders meeting disappointed those who
expected a show-down with chairman-designate Robert Studer. Ebner's speech
was tame and, after the meeting, he went out of his way to congratulate
Studer. Is the gadfly of the Swiss establishment converting himself into
a loyal UBS camp follower? <BR>
<BR>
Ebner-watchers have learned not to take anything he says at face value.
His lectures on shareholder value have a hollow ring. As one critic points
out, if he believed what he said about return on equity he would be investing
in Barclays not UBS. But Ebner's game can only be played in Switzerland,
where the Chinese walls between broking and fund management are paper thin,
and where dealing prices are often far from transparent. <BR>
<BR>
Ebner for years has shaken up the Swiss marketplace and kept it on its toes
- but how long can he keep it up? &quot;Ebner is finished,&quot; says
one interested party, &quot;the revolution is eating its children.&quot;
Don't hold your breath. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The ghost at the feast</B> <BR>
<BR>
Swiss Bank Corporation in Basle pretended to dismiss the CS/UBS merger proposal
as an all Zurich affair. But as the drama progressed, the name studiously
not on people's lips but undoubtedly on their minds was that of the third
Swiss bank. Now that the merger idea has been broached, and a CS/UBS combination
has been blown apart, only two other combinations remain: SBC/CS or SBC/UBS.
<BR>
<BR>
Outgoing UBS chairman Nikolaus Senn flippantly suggested that SBC and UBS
would be a better fit. He's right. The ownership structures are more similar;
there is less overlap on the domestic retail side; SBC Warburg is strong
in risk management, international equity and corporate finance; UBS is stronger
in fixed income and reasonable in equities; there is less overlap in Asia.
<BR>
<BR>
SBC was rumoured to be buying UBS shares last month, to help it exorcize
the Ebner threat. UBS chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta, and Marcel Ospel,
who becomes his counterpart at SBC this month, are relatively young, dynamic,
and good friends. Good enough to work in the same shop? It would be ironic
if Gut's 21st century vision for his own institution drove the other two
Swiss banks into each other's arms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The biggest loser</B> <BR>
<BR>
Gut was right about one thing, says one sympathizer, Switzerland has lost
its way. <BR>
<BR>
Market transparency has killed profitability in the home market, not to
mention the expense of operating there - 2% to 4% commissions are a
thing of the past. The most advanced companies, such as ABB and Nestl&eacute;,
have all but emigrated, in terms of their capital, ideas and production.
Novartis, the merged product of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, is likely to do the
same - at present Switzerland accounts for 36% of its expenses but
only 3% of its revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Since the Swiss economy has priced itself out of international competition,
the world-class Swiss banks will follow ABB and Nestl&eacute;, keeping a
toe-hold in Switzerland only for reasons of brand-name and prestige.  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1>

<H3><B>INTERNATIONAL EQUITY </B></H3>

<H2><B>New members for the GDR club</B></H2>

<H4><B>Cheaper to issue and less stringent than their American cousins, global depositary receipts are gaining popularity. New programmes have been developed by several emerging markets. For investors the advantage is a clean trade and the removal of forex risk. "It's dollar, boom, done," says one. Graham Field reports</B>
</H4>
<P>
Croatia, Morocco, Egypt and Lithuania usually only rub shoulders in the horse-trading for rotating seats on the UN Security Council or in the preliminary qualifying rounds of the World Cup. What they have in common this year, however, is that companies from these four countries have issued global depositary receipts (GDRs) for the first time. These issues illustrate the growing importance of the GDR market. 

<P>
Global depositary receipts accounted for around a quarter of total depositary receipt (DR) issuance in the first nine months of this year, with a further two thirds in the form of American depositary receipts (ADRs) and the remainder in either Rule 144A issues or European depositary receipts. GDR issues are either becoming bigger and fewer in number, from the better established markets, or are being made by companies that are breaking fresh ground. The new issuers indicate how the supply of GDRs will keep renewing itself, even if the ease of dealing directly in other markets eventually obviates the need for issues from the longer-established sources.

<P>
As the table on page 88 shows, the number of GDR programmes has expanded rapidly during the 1990s; GDRs now account for a rising proportion of the total number of programmes and are of growing importance to emerging markets issuers. However, some investors maintain that the differences between ADRs and GDRs are, as ING Barings director, Maurice de Bunsen, puts it, "rather semantic". Both are receipts issued against an underlying stock held in a depositary bank and, in that respect, the only difference is where they settle. Echoing this sentiment, emerging markets fund manager Giles Neville of Schroders says: "When I talk about a DR I'm not bothered whether it's listed in London, Luxembourg or New York, or whether it's a Chinese company listed in Hong Kong."

<P>
It is true that the choice of whether to issue an ADR or a GDR sometimes can be based simply on geographical convenience, or force of habit. Latin American companies, with their traditional orientation towards the US as a source of foreign capital, tend to look to the ADR market. In the case of Chile, this predilection is enforced by central bank requirements for any overseas equity issuance to be on the New York Stock Exchange. GDRs by Latin American companies, therefore, have been a rarity: Celesc in Brazil and Uruguay's Banco Commercial are the exceptions to the rule.

<P>
The global depositary receipt remains inherently different from its American cousin, however. Advocates of the instrument, such as global products manager for DRs at Bankers Trust, Peter Duggan, maintain that the GDR has a number of critical advantages for emerging markets issuers. The first is that it offers a wider investor base than an ADR, which trades only in the US. By issuing under Rule 144A, a GDR can be sold to US investors as well as to the core of European investors, who will typically take 80% of an issue. 

<P>
The second advantage is that it is a lot cheaper than an ADR, which requires a New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq listing. In any case, many of the companies that need funds would have problems satisfying New York listing requirements, not least because of the time needed to convert at least three years of their accounts to US GAAP requirements. The GDR, therefore, offers a quicker route to raise urgently needed capital.

<P>
Although there may be instances in which the specialist investor base in New York may justify an ADR issue &#173; for example, matching a mobile telephone operator in Bombay to specialist telecom funds in New York &#173;  usually the GDR market can supply adequate liquidity. According to Duggan, liquidity for GDRs has improved in the past two years, particularly since the London stock exchange eased its listing requirements to lure more of the GDR business away from Luxembourg, where lax listing requirements had encouraged the market to develop. In the first nine months of the year, 16.1% of total DR issuance was through London and 6.4% through Luxembourg. 

<P>
Traders, however, do not necessarily agree that liquidity is good; even in the big Indian issues in London, according to one trader, "the market is so illiquid that someone can go out and buy 10,000 GDRs and then there's a short in the market". 

<P>
"Everyone knows who the customers are and they'll speak to three or four different market makers at the same time, so everyone knows what's going on and everything's either bid up or pushed down". 

<P>
<B>Simplicity at a premium</B>

<P>
Whatever the advantages of GDRs, the underlying rationale for issuing them remains the same across different countries and continents: the need to bypass obstacles to investment in the domestic market. Foreign ownership ceilings in Korea and Taiwan have made their companies into leading issuers of GDRs. The two issues made by Croatian companies, drug group Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka, owed much to the cost of maintaining custody accounts in Croatia and, as elsewhere, the complications of exchanging dividend payments back into an investor's home currency. The dollar-denominated clearing and settlement of GDRs through Euroclear and Cedel in Europe and DTC in the US, "takes away all those concerns and problems", says Duggan. 

<P>
Richard Fairgrieve of Hermes Investment Management bought Pliva and Zagrebacka and agrees: "I've never dealt directly in the Croatian market. The GDR is a much easier vehicle than having to do the FX yourself. It's dollar, boom, done. The liquidity is better. You know you can always move at least some to the market makers, as opposed to dealing directly out there, wherever it might be." 

<P>
Such reassurance and simplicity are achieved at a price: the premium between many GDRs and the underlying stock. But it is not only hassle-free settlement that creates premiums. Market distortions also create pricing anomalies, which can lead, for example, to some Korean GDRs trading at huge premiums: Korea Mobile Telecom was trading at close to a 100% premium in October, Hyundai at 60% and Samsung, the main name in the market, was between 35% and 40%. 

<P>
The problem is all to do with conversion. In a totally free market, arbitrageurs would be able to take advantage of price disparities and soon eliminate discrepancies between the GDR price and the underlying price. The relationship between the two should reflect the exchange rate and nothing else, a situation that has virtually been achieved for Mexican ADRs. 

<P>
However, regulations often frustrate the arbitrageurs, as in the case of India, for example. It is possible to buy the GDR in London or Luxembourg and cancel it back into India, but once cancelled, the GDRs cannot be re-issued. In other words, the arbitrage only works in one direction. Hence, says BT's Duggan, in countries where GDRs are being issued for the first time it is important to persuade the authorities to adopt regulations that permit two-way trading. 

<P>
The performance of the underlying Bombay market and the effect it has had on GDR issuance is characteristic of DR markets as a whole. It helps explain the popularity of eastern European issues, which have performed well this year in line with the underlying markets. Hungary, for example, was up more than 100% in dollar terms in the year to mid-October, and Russia's equity market has been another outstandingly good perfomer.

<P>
<B>Disillusioned  </B>

<P>
Do not read too much, however, into the number of GDR issues by eastern European companies. Some, such as the two Croatian issues, have performed well, much to the satisfaction of investors. Pliva rose from $18.71 at issue in April 1996 to $50 in mid-October, while Zagrebacka Banka was trading at $19.50, compared with an issue price of $8.50.

<P>
Analysts are, however, sceptical about the significance of issues by Hungarian and Russian companies. Tom Chadwick, Hungarian equity analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, points to the fact that only one of the two leading Hungarian pharmaceutical companies, Gedeon Richter, has issued a GDR, even though the two have tracked one another closely in just about every other regard. "A GDR doesn't even improve name recognition outside Hungary for a serious stock," claims Chadwick, although he does concede that it has a "slightly different appeal for those who can't invest directly". The liquidity of the Hungarian market means that there is no appreciable premium for Hungarian GDRs.

<P>
Duggan has more serious reservations about the large number of Russian DR progammes established during 1996, which accounted for nearly 10% of those established in the first nine months of the year. "Companies did level-one programmes from an investor relations point of view and to get their name into the market. They've been oversold and many are inactive and have never had a share issued into the programme," he says.

<P>
Duggan believes the companies are disillusioned by the experience of maintaining the programmes, which have been orchestrated by banks that want to prove they have a large share in the depositary business. Most issues in 1996 have not been for capital-raising purposes so much as to raise companies' liquidity, profile and share price; in many cases, shares experienced a short-term price surge ahead of the DR programme.

<P>
Gazprom, which raised around $400 million in October from an American depositary share (ADS) issue in London, is something of a special case, given the problems in trading its shares domestically. The existence of management pre-emption rights over any purchase makes it difficult to buy the shares and as little as $5 million changes hands during a week. 

<P>
In addition to the doubts about Russian activity this year, there are other concerns. These are bound up with the laxity of the reporting requirements for securities listed on the Luxembourg exchange and the danger that inexperienced investors buy GDRs in the belief that they are buying the equivalent of a Luxembourg or Swiss or Dutch company, whereas it's an insider's market and it's difficult to know what's going on.

<P>
Immediate problems aside, the demise of the ADR and GDR markets has been predicted in the past because of the process of market reforms. "As domestic regulatory, custodial and settlement issues are sorted out and if transaction costs and spreads come down, GDRs will become less important," says Schroders' Neville. But he also recognizes that "there will be new countries coming in for whom the easiest way to raise money will be a DR or a listing on another market".

<P>
Over the longer term, for example, Korea's membership of the OECD is likely to lead to the removal of restrictions on share ownership and to erode the premium at which GDRs trade. India is also taking steps in the right direction as regards tidying up market practices. 

<P>
The most important and long-awaited change will be the introduction of share depositaries in India, which will immobilize the vast quantities of share certificates being shipped between custodians' vaults. Shares of the first eight companies were expected to be placed in the National Securities Depositary, run by the National Securities Exchange (NSE), as early as October, and an ambitious plan envisages shares representing 65% of market capitalization being immobilised within two years.

<P>
<B>Indian backlog</B>

<P>
However, these changes are unlikely to signal the imminent disappearance of the Indian GDR. Given that it is the government controlled Industrial Development Bank of India and Unit Trust of India that are promoting the depositary, along with the NSE, progress is not expected to be as rapid as it would be with the private sector in the lead. Although the Bombay Stock Exchange is considering its own depositary, the timing of its establishment is not clear. As a result, observers expect teething troubles for at least the first one or two years. 

<P>
Even if the National Securities Depositary meets its timetable, other problems &#173; such as registration as an officially approved foreign institutional investor and capital gains tax unless investment is routed via a Mauritian subsidiary &#173;  will still act as deterrents to direct investment and ensure that demand continues to exist for the GDR instrument. The backlog of Indian companies that have postponed issues from this year means supply will be forthcoming. 

<P>
Most observers expect India to remain at the core of the GDR market, but the extent to which its companies are able to continue issuing in 1997 will depend on the health of the underlying market. The same applies to eastern Europe. The strong performance of the Hungarian, Russian and Polish markets this year has improved sentiment towards the region, but a growing proportion of the expected GDR activity is likely to be from eastern Europe's peripheral markets. A second Lithuanian company is considering following Vilniaus Bankas in making an issue, and the first Slovenian issue could be coming to the market soon. Where north Africa and the Middle East are concerned companies could follow the path of Lebanon's Banque Audi and Morocco's Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur. &#009;*

<H2> <B>BZW's new coaches play it rough </B> </H2> 

<P>
<a href="em.96.10.1a.html"> Bill Harrison: A man in a hurry </b></a>
<P>


<H4> <B>A new generation of
managers has taken over at BZW following David Band's untimely death in March.
New chief executive Bill Harrison is a tough, no-nonsense British merchant
banker. In his first major interview Harrison explains
his view of the bank's future, his player-coach approach and why BZW isn't
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. But, first, we profile the efforts of the other man on
the touchline, the smooth American Bob Diamond, and his dramatic first three
months as head of the firm's most turbulent division, fixed income. By Steven
Irvine </B> </H4> 

<P> Inside Ebbgate House, the sheer size of the deal had the
champagne corks popping. One estimate has it that 100 bottles were drunk.

<P> Bob Diamond, just two months into the job, could afford a smile. BZW's new
head of global markets had scored a rare coup in winning the mandate to launch
the UK's $2 billion floating-rate note. BZW's status as sole bookrunner, where
it, and not joint-leads NatWest Markets or HSBC Markets, gains all the
league-table credit, sent out a powerful message: BZW has emerged as the UK's
best chance of having an investment bank in the big league.

<P> Diamond's appointment further confirms this. A fresh-faced 44-year old, he is
an archetypal product of Wall Street, his career divided between two of its most
powerful firms, Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston &#173; the sort of
high-profile banker who had always seemed beyond the reach of BZW's recruiters.
His nickname at CS First Boston &#173; although he denies any knowledge of it
&#173; was "the Coach", and he looked set for the big job: that of CSFB boss
Allen Wheat. Then, a messy revolt by bond traders in March forced his departure.
He was blamed for not managing the traders' bonus expectations well.

<P> His decision to join BZW at an estimated &#163;5 million ($7.5 million) a
year shows the resolve of Barclays' chief executive Martin Taylor to take his
investment banking subsidiary onto a new level. So much so that Diamond's hire
even makes it into BZW's history, <I>The First Ten Years, </I>to be published
later this month<I>.</I> "In anyone's language," the book declares, "Diamond was
a big hitter."

<P> The UK deal was a big success. Cool heads, Diamond's among them, will look at
it in perspective, however. For a start, selling a UK floater is not difficult.
In the unlikely event that you can't sell it, the bonds have a zero risk
weighting, and can easily be accommodated on the balance-sheet of a commercial
bank such as BZW's parent, Barclays, as a floating-rate asset. Besides, the UK
government clearly favoured the UK banks as lead managers of the deal.

<P> <B>Goodbye old team</B>

<P> Ironically, the champagne Diamond's team were toasting with was left over
from a huge batch BZW bought nine years earlier to celebrate the firm's first
birthday. The champagne has remained in the cellar ever since. The anniversary
party had coincided with the 1987 stockmarket crash.

<P> More sober BZW bankers remembered that the two men who had largely fostered
the bank's floating-rate note capability &#173; plus much else &#173; had gone.
Joint debt syndicate heads, Rob Jolliffe and Steve Hones, who arrived in 1995
from JP Morgan, left for Goldman Sachs and PaineWebber respectively in the
summer. In 1995 BZW was nowhere in floaters &#173; 21st in the league table. In
1996 Jolliffe's and Hones's influence had begun to tell. In the league table to
September the firm was sixth, having raised $6.4 billion, about three times the
tally for 1995.

<P> When Jolliffe and Hones arrived, the BZW Eurobond syndicate desk was
controlled by Alan Wilson, a personable Scot, whose nickname was "Ish". This was
because whenever Wilson was asked where he would price a bond he would reply,
"oh, around 25-ish, or 26-ish". Wilson was quickly moved to equity derivatives.
The Eurobond desk, driven by Jolliffe, Hones and head of debt origination, Yann
Gindre, gradually began to churn out results.

<P> The first half of 1996 was BZW's best ever. In the week he arrived, Diamond
was shown results that showed BZW was fourth in the Eurobond league table, and
first in its home currency, sterling &#173; up from third in sterling in 1994 and
1995. In the headline league table, which includes all international bonds, it
had gone up from 20th in 1995 to 13th. BZW raised a billion dollars more in the
first half of 1996 than in the whole of 1995.

<P> So why did Jolliffe, Hones and others go when a top-quality coach like
Diamond looked set to take BZW to the top?

<P> BZW's culture is not usually associated with a hire-and-fire mentality. It
<I>was</I> this summer. The first to go was Sam Marrone, Diamond's predecessor as
head of global markets, and a former US marine. He was told in late May that
Diamond would be coming. But, rather than simply fire him, BZW initially explored
a number of abortive solutions, which included giving Marrone the newly-created
title of markets division chairman, with Diamond as chief executive. While this
was going on, Marrone, a BZW employee since 1987, appeared indecisive. "He aged
10 years in three weeks," comments a colleague.

<P> On June 14, Marrone's senior staff were called to the eighth floor by Donald
Brydon &#173; the acting chief executive after David Band's death in March.
Brydon listed Marrone's strengths and how indispensable was his contribution to
the firm's current position. He then told those present that it would be made
public in the afternoon that Marrone was out and Diamond was in.

<P> Marrone left the trading floor that afternoon, and was given a separate
office in another building with a telephone and  a secretary. Like all the BZW
staff that would follow him he spent a fair amount of time at an outplacement
firm that BZW hired called Meridien. It wasn't until September that he finally
left, returning to New York to be ABN-Amro's head of US fixed income.

<P> A former colleague of Marrone says, "When he came over two years ago Sam
thought he had four years to build the business." That turned out to be a false
assumption.

<P> It was the first of many departures &#173; although it would be wrong to say
tensions were not already present. Yann Gindre, the flamboyant French head of
debt origination, was having minor bust-ups with Jolliffe. And Hones was known to
be pretty weary of bringing BZW's often backward systems and processes up to
scratch. For starters, the former Morgan syndicate heads had spent time during
their first months at BZW arranging for the syndicate desk's profit-and-loss
account to be kept separate from the secondary trading book. Things had improved,
but much still had to be done, and such exercises were time-consuming and
frustrating. Hones told Marrone he was considering an offer from PaineWebber. He
knew nothing of Diamond's joining at this point.

<P> <B>Late nights versus families</B>

<P> But, by Monday June 17, Hones had changed his mind, ready to see what Diamond
had to offer. Diamond began on Monday July 8, and took Hones and Jolliffe to
lunch. It was clear to Hones that he and his new boss shared a trading background
(Diamond started his career as a repo trader) and a similar view of the business,
but that life under Diamond would involve three years of very late nights. The
two qualities Diamond demands are loyalty and commitment. Even his secretary
(brought from CSFB) regularly works till 10pm. Hones is a family man.

<P> In contrast, the job at PaineWebber was a pure trading brief and offered
fewer management challenges. Since both he and Jolliffe already had their
one-year guaranteed bonuses in the bank, the question was whether six months of
turbulence was worth it.

<P> On Wednesday July 24, Hones informed Diamond of his decision. Diamond was in
New York at the time, and told him to wait until he returned so they could talk.
Diamond got back on Monday July 29, but Hones did not see him for a couple of
days. The conversation was said to have lasted no more than five minutes.

<P> It was a hectic period for Diamond, if only because he was busy recruiting a
new inner circle in three continents. He was also spending up to 15 minutes with
as many of his existing staff as he could. Gindre was given slightly longer and
explained the origination group's strategy.

<P> On July 19, Gindre interviewed the ex-Deutsche senior coverage officer,
Abigail Hofman. She had been out of the market since March for personal reasons,
and was introduced to Diamond by Alex von Ungern-Sternberg, the former group
treasurer at Deutsche Bank, who came to BZW last year as Marrone's deputy.

<P> It wasn't just BZW that was interviewing her, however. Hofman's old employers
were also keen to get her back, both because she is highly regarded in the market
and because she was popular with the Frankfurt set, who associated her with the
pre-Edson Mitchell era. Since Deutsche's top origination job in London was filled
by her old boss, Roy Boecker, she was offered in the region of &#163;500,000 to
play a senior coverage role and run the frequent borrowers desk.

<P> Over at BZW a similar role was initially envisioned. But then, unusually,
Hofman was offered Gindre's job. Whether this was because she was asked the
inevitable question "What do you need to join?" and she replied "Gindre's job",
or because Diamond was desperate to poach her from Deutsche's grasp, is not
known.

<P> <B>On death row</B>

<P> Gindre was on holiday in France at the time. On the evening of Wednesday
August 7, he received a call. Diamond told him his job had been given to the
woman he had interviewed a fortnight before. The next morning Gindre's team was
informed.

<P> He returned from holiday a week later. By 2pm a group of BZW removal men had
arrived and he was moved out of his office, to another BZW building,
affectionately known as "death row". The next month he joined Commerzbank, as
global head of debt capital markets.

<P> Gindre's dismissal was unusual: the normal practice was to wait for staff to
return from holiday before asking them to leave. On August 19, Nick Carter the
head of swaps marketing got back from vacation. Late that afternoon Alan Wood,
the head of sales, and swaps head, Constantin Thanassoulas, told him he was to
go. That same week, Paul Ellis, the head of the 28-person structures group, and
who last year earned a quarter of the whole derivatives group's profits, also
decided to go. Jolliffe, who had been in talks with Goldman Sachs, went on August
23.

<P> Shira Cornwall, head of bond credit research, also went, this time to UBS,
where she was hired by Bob Harding, the senior fixed-income director, who
previously worked for BZW &#173; and who came over from Kidder Peabody with Sam
Marrone in 1987. She had joined BZW in 1988 and was in tears as she left.

<P> Peter D'Mario also left. D'Mario, the global head of repo marketing and
sales, was also vice-chairman of ISMA's repo subcommittee, an alternate member of
the Bank of England's stock borrowing and repo committee, and a member of the
Bank of England's code of best practice committee for gilt repo. He arrived last
year from Goldman Sachs and was considered something of a star.

<P> "He was very good at getting things done, explaining issues and following
up," says one of his clients. He was instrumental in arranging the World Bank's
repo facility on the Deutschmark global bonds.

<P> At this stage it became evident that Diamond was putting his FOBs (friends of
Bob), as they were called at CSFB, in place. Robert Morrice was named head of
credit business in Europe. This gave Morrice, 33, control of syndicate,
origination and secondary trading operations &#173; although not in sterling
which was ringfenced under former Marrone aide-de-camp, Tony Smith. Morrice had
already moved with Diamond from Morgan Stanley when he joined CSFB. At CSFB
Morrice had been promoted six months earlier to head European sales but, like
Diamond, his background was in repo.

<P> The new head of Tokyo fixed income, Patrick Lin, also knew Diamond from
Morgan Stanley. Mark Dearlove, head of repos and short-dated Japanese government
bonds, also has the Morgan Stanley connection.

<P> The cocktail party which took place in London on Thursday September 12 was
revealing. It was organized to allow new chief executive Bill Harrison to meet
the markets team. According to one onlooker: "Diamond and Morrice were like war
buddies, telling old war stories. Only Abigail Hofman approached them in
buddiness. Everyone else looked like they had a different colour skin."

<P> The decision to split London into the Morrice area and the sterling area is
bizarre. Diamond would probably not have opted to do so, unless he felt very
keenly that there was a danger of BZW's very successful gilts traders and
salespeople leaving and taking a lot of revenue out the door with them. To
prevent this, Tony Smith was given a ringfenced sterling area.

<P> <B>Bringing in new blood</B>

<P> Sterling specialist Richard Mann is looking after the whole syndicate desk
for the moment, aided by Antony Barklam, the head of MTNs. Two young MTN traders,
Marc Falconer and Hugo Varney, are managing MTNs until this situation is
resolved.

<P> The most senior member of the old guard still remaining is Alan Wood, the
former co-head of debt capital markets, who is now head of sales. But Wood has
health problems and has agreed to retire as soon as Diamond finds a replacement.

<P> If Diamond didn't feel in control in London initially, there can be no
mistake he is now. Moreover his appointments outside London are evidence of his
ability to bring high ranking personnel from US investment banks. The new boss in
New York is Tom Kalaris, a JP Morgan veteran of 18 years, who former JP Morgan
head Dennis Weatherstone says has some of the characteristics of the late David
Band. "The first thing that springs to mind when I think of Tommy is his
integrity," says Weatherstone.

<P> Lin in Tokyo is very excited by the opportunities for BZW in the Japanese
market. He hopes to have built the operation to 90% of its eventual size by
March. His team will trade Japanese government bonds &#173; something BZW has not
done before &#173; and use this platform to move into Euroyen.

<P> Two other key hires underline Diamond's strength as a business manager. His
first recruit was Mike Keegan, who arrived from CSFB's New York office within 48
hours of Diamond himself. An accountant by training, he will act as Diamond's
administrative head, responsible for auditing and monitoring internal controls.
The second recruit, equally vital, was John Brock, the former head of
fixed-income research at Morgan Stanley. He will head fixed-income systems
development, a key role since an estimated &#163;100 million will be spent to get
the technology right when BZW moves to Canary Wharf in April. Nobody who has ever
worked in BZW's markets division has much praise for its systems, so this is an
area where Diamond's experience will be particularly useful.

<P> In his modest office at Ebbgate House, Diamond is itching to move to Canary
Wharf &#173; ironically the London base of his two former employers &#173; where
the BZW trading floor will be unified for the very first time. Diamond will have
his office amid the 700 trading positions. "You can have as many squawk boxes as
you like but it doesn't compensate for not being in the same room," says Diamond.

<P> BZW's businesses are not close together as in the American style. There was
one day in his first fortnight, when Diamond spent a whole day in internal
meetings, and had to go to five buildings. His secretary Caroline had to give him
a street map and draw where the buildings were.

<P> One of the surprises that greeted him was the number of buildings the markets
division occupied. More surprising still was the slightly unconventional decision
his deputy, Alex von Ungern-Sternberg, made to move the swaps desk out of Ebbgate
House, where it was next to bonds. It is now beside foreign exchange and money
markets in the Tower Hill office. According to one source, Diamond had never seen
the likes of this before. Fortunately the trading floor in Canary Wharf will
sandwich the swaps desk between the two thus solving this problem.

<P> Diamond's challenge is to ride out the turbulence of these hiring and
firings, put the pieces in place to make BZW a credible force in international
bonds and, at the same time, make some money.

<P> Diamond began his career with Morgan Stanley after gaining an MBA from the
University of Connecticut where he ranked first in his class. He joined Morgan in
1979 as administrative director of management information systems and became
assistant to the chief financial officer. His first fixed-income role was in repo
but, by 1988, he was responsible for all fixed-income trading in Europe and Asia.

<P> He joined CSFB in 1992 where his rise was even more meteoric. He was
initially based in Tokyo, as chief executive of CSFB Pacific and, by the time he
left CSFB, he had risen to vice-chairman, head of the 1,200-strong fixed-income
group, and was a member of the main executive board and of that of derivatives
arm, Credit Suisse Financial Products.

<P> Diamond already talks like a BZW veteran. He uses the pronoun "we" to refer
to events that occurred five years ago, such as Barclays' decision to move all
international businesses to its investment bank. "Our goal is to be a first-tier
securities firm in three to five years,"  he says, but adds, "I would never set
five-year goals by league tables. If we are important to a client in a sector
they will know it."

<P> He intends to be mobile. "Quite frankly, I will spend a lot of time in the
US," he says. "I will be out with clients." Diamond doesn't have a house in
London yet. In fact, he is staying just behind the Dorchester, in the discreet
Albert Roux-run hotel, 47 Park Street, where the corporate rate is about
&#163;200 a night, and guests have small private kitchens. The hotel restaurant
is Le Gavroche.

<P> His style is described as "nice guy", and he is said to be a great motivator
who likes to make big, vague speeches around the theme of winning &#173; thus his
nickname "the coach". His principle expertise is in repos &#173; he built Morgan
Stanley's European repo desk in 1985 &#173; and in government bonds, both of
which make up the low-margin, high-volume side of the business.

<P> <B>In to lunch</B>

<P> He does not find lunches with clients very productive, preferring meetings in
the office. This is arguably, from a relationship standpoint, a more American
than European way of doing business but, since BZW hired Diamond to Americanize
it, that's probably good.

<P> "Some of the early changes," he comments, "were just obvious changes. I could
figure out pretty quickly we were not in the JGB market. I know some terrific
people. So we got that up and running." In the US he is happy to have netted
Kalaris who "grew up in the treasury market". He adds that he was sorry to lose
Jolliffe and Hones.

<P> Clearly Diamond needs to find revenue wherever he can. One area where BZW's
fixed-income effort has been traditionally weak, if not invisible, is in emerging
markets. Diamond is in the process of hiring an emerging markets team. Philippa
Rose, the headhunter, is working on the job along with colleague Amy Rousseau,
who was formerly Sally Bott's number two in the human resources department at
BZW. Diamond's critics suggest he knows very little about emerging markets. But
the Diamond style is to hire people that do, and let them run with the ball.

<P> Diamond's most important judgement call is Abigail Hofman, the new global
head of debt origination. She is widely regarded as one of the best coverage
officers in the market, but she has no management experience, and about
two-thirds of her London-based team came from UBS with her predecessor, Yann
Gindre. Many are loyal to him still, and those that aren't are filled with
uncertainty about what the future holds.

<P> A former barrister, Hofman began her career at Merrill Lynch, and built her
reputation leveraging Deutsche Bank's relationships with supranational borrowers
such as the World Bank, with which she is particularly close. If she could clinch
a mandate for a dollar global from this borrower she would more than vindicate
her boss's judgement.

<P> "The bottom line," says Hofman, "is that Bob is attracting people of the
highest calibre and these are very exciting times. Bob and Bill Harrison are
inspirational."

<P> Asked about Abigail Hofman taking the origination effort to a new level,
Diamond pauses. He leans back in his chair and puts his feet on his desk. About a
minute or so later, presumably after deep thought, he says, "Within fixed income
there will be a separation between the government bond and the credit businesses.
Abigail Hofman will run origination for fixed income." The reply is Delphic.
Diamond clearly doesn't want to give away too much of his strategy.

<P> He adds a little later: "I can't tell you how excited I am about working with
Abigail. We've done some great transactions." The UK floater is clearly one of
them, but this comment is made prior to the UK deal's launch. When asked to say
which particular transactions were great, Diamond declines to comment because it
would be unfair to single out specific deals and clients.

<P> Diamond is slick, but EOBs (enemies of Bob) suggest his master-plans are a
little short of detail. Bearing in mind the problems Diamond faced with the CSFB
bonus pool this year, attention will no doubt focus on how he handles it at BZW.
"You need an MBA to understand the complexities of the CSFB bonus calculation,"
comments one banker. "At BZW you need a slide rule."

<P> The markets division began calculating this year's bonuses in October last
year. The process took about three months &#173; with offsites and horsetrading
being the order of the day rather than algebraic equations that apportion costs
to individual areas. A concern of long-time staff is whether (the suspected)
guaranteed bonuses offered to new recruits will creep into the bonus pool thus
sapping theirs.

<P> Diamond, however, is sensitive to the whole question of pay &#173; most
particularly to the readily drawn comparison with Edson Mitchell, Diamond's exact
counterpart at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. But what is clear is that Diamond,
unlike his predecessors at BZW, has a mandate from Barclays' chief executive,
Martin Taylor, to build and spend, not dissimilar to that Mitchell has from
Deutsche chief executive Hilmar Kopper. At stake? A place in investment banking's
much-heralded global league.

<H3> COVER STORY </H3>

<H2> <B>Bill Harrison: A man in a hurry</B> </H2>

<P>
<a href="em.96.10.1.html"> BZW's new coaches play it rough</b></a>
<P>



<P> <B>Bill Harrison is
not the most orthodox chief executive you will come across in the City. The new
boss at BZW speaks with a strong Birmingham accent and refers to telephoning
people as "giving them a bell".  </B>

<P> <B>Harrison, 48, is part of a new breed of fortysomethings in charge at BZW
&#173; a departure from the over-50s hierarchy that prevailed before. The new
head of equities, Steve Harker, whose department employs 1,700 of BZW's total
headcount of 7,500, also fits this mould. "What you see is what you get with
Harrison and [Barclays' chief executive Martin] Taylor," says Harker who doesn't
have any problems with that approach. </B>

<P> <B>Harrison is bold. His first few days in his new position were a
<I>blitzkrieg</I>: he started on Tuesday, fired acting chief executive Donald
Brydon on Wednesday, and restructured the management committee on Thursday. Not
one to conform to convention, he "upsized" the latter &#173; to 10 people from
eight &#173; and included, for the first time, the head of human resources. Only
four existing members are left from the previous management committee. </B>

<P> <B>Energetic and bustling, Harrison's management style, he says, is
characterized by a player-coach approach. He supports the struggling English
football club, Birmingham City.</B>

<P> <B>He is not a banker's banker. He spent the early part of his career working
in the no-nonsense oil industry, first for BNOC, then Tricentrol, finally joining
j Henry Schroder Wagg in 1983. He then worked at Lehman Brothers for seven years
rising to head of European investment banking, before becoming chief executive of
investment banking at Robert Fleming in 1993.</B>

<P> <B>His style is described as mid-Atlantic. At Flemings, he encouraged the
concept of cold-calling clients. According to former colleagues, he is more a
deal-winner than an administrator. To alleviate this, he has promoted Patrick
O'Sullivan to handle day-to-day administration as his chief operating officer.
</B>

<P> <B>Perhaps the most visible example of the new style is the new-look morning
coffee meeting which is held for senior managers at 9am each day at Ebbgate
House. Under David Band, who had run BZW since 1988, these were a 10-minute
formality. Nowadays the duration is less predictable. One senior executive missed
an appointment because the morning coffee meeting lasted 55 minutes. But once
Harrison has been in office for eight years &#173; like his predecessor &#173;
maybe the meetings will have become a 10-minute formality again. Or maybe
not.</B>

<P> <B>When did you first meet Martin Taylor?</B>

<P> A while ago. I got approached for this job back in February.

<P> <B>How was the approach made?</B>

<P> Directly.

<P> <B>Was it over a lunch?</B>

<P> No.

<P> <B>A telephone call?</B>

<P> Yes.

<P> <B>He's pretty direct isn't he?</B>

<P> Very direct, yes. But I'd say thoughtful, and direct. A lot of thought went
into the process of deciding what would be the next phase of BZW's life,
involving Andrew Buxton [Barclays chairman], Martin, Sir Peter Middleton [BZW
chairman] and David Band [late BZW chief executive].

<P> <B>You share an industry background with Taylor.</B>

<P> I was in the oil industry. I found that experience extremely helpful.

<P> <B>Do you get on better because neither of you are out-and-out bankers?</B>

<P> I wouldn't read too much into it. But Martin is the sort of guy who takes
these things into consideration. But I also think &#173; I've talked to him about
it &#173; that Martin has a healthy respect for senior bankers.

<P> I'm a big believer in having industry knowledge within the firm. It helps us
to come up with good ideas for companies, to develop strategies and add value.

<P> <B>How often will you see Taylor?</B>

<P> Oh, a lot. But it won't be a forced thing. There are weekly group executive
meetings. I'm on the board of the bank and there are a lot of meetings associated
with that. And our paths will cross, with clients, for example. From my side
that's something I welcome, and I think he does as well.

<P> <B>So it won't be ad hoc?</B>

<P> Much of it will be ad hoc. We will use the telephone and, though I won't push
it, I'll take my chances getting in to see him [laughs]. I like to try to deal
with issues there and then, through personal contact. That's my style.

<P> <B>Isn't BZW just a second-tier firm?</B>

<P> No, I don't think we are. Our equities business is a major one, as is our
structured finance business. And we are working to build our business in the
markets area. We've been able to attract some good people to the firm in
corporate finance. We're moving up the league tables fast. I won't use the
hackneyed phrase "global" but we certainly do have a very significant
international operation.

<P> <B>When Taylor approached you, what gave you the impression he was really
behind making this an important investment bank?</B>

<P> We've seen a pretty good manifestation of that already. One of the driving
issues was that we needed to be firing on a number of cylinders. I said I thought
the markets/fixed-income business was very important. Of course, since then we've
put words into practice and we've seen its practical manifestation in terms of
bringing Bob [Diamond] in and giving him an opportuntity to build a team. That's
probably the best practical answer I can give. I firmly believe we are doing the
right things, and that this is a very important part of the [Barclays] group and
I hope to improve that position still further.

<P> <B>Is there a line in the sand where he's said, "Look, you've got three years
and you can spend this much money"?</B>

<P> No. There isn't a line in the sand. It's quite difficult for anyone to do
that, and I don't think he needs to. If this relationship works, as I believe it
will, we can develop a sensible strategy for BZW without false time-frames. This
is an unpredictable business. The best-laid plans can be blown out of the water
by market events. We need to have a strategy which is workable, where you've got
the people in place to make it work, and where you can create a culture where
people can work together. I know integration has become an overused phrase, but I
do believe that businesses feed off other businesses.

<P> Obviously I want it to happen quickly. But I think it's quite dangerous to do
it by formula.

<P> <B>You're hiring people such as Diamond and Tom Kalaris [new president of BZW
Securities]. They cost money.</B>

<P> I don't want it to be thought I'm not systematic. I am a believer in budgets
and business plans, and factoring in the costs of businesses. I don't mean to
give the impression that I'm going to turn up one morning, and say, "By the way,
I'm going to sign up Alan Shearer" <I>[an English footballer recently signed for
the record sum of &#163;15 million]</I>. It's not like that. We have a clear view
of what we want to achieve, which businesses we want to be in, where we want to
be in them, and whether we have the resources or whether we need to upgrade.

<P> Please don't think it depends which side of bed we get out of. We are
building a business here. I hope for the long term. And I want to be profitable.
I don't need Andrew [Buxton] or Martin to tell me this.

<P> <B>Is the high-profile hiring you did over the summer unusual, or will you
continue hiring in this way for the next few months?</B>

<P> The important thing is to put in the components of leadership. The next phase
is to develop the businesses. We're not going to go on an all-out hiring binge.
We have some very good people internally. Hopefully we'll be able to hire people
of the quality we've already brought into other parts of the business and bring
on internal talent. This will be a catalyst for the rest of our staff. My job is
to discover where we have a leadership issue, or a quality issue. I'm very
encouraged by what I see.

<P> <B>Was Diamond a Martin Taylor hire?</B>

<P> Diamond was a Harrison-Taylor hire. It was our joint view that we needed to
strengthen that side of our business, and we were fortunate that Bob's
circumstances were such that we were able to have an amicable conversation with
him at the time.

<P> <B>What made you think he would be good for BZW?</B>

<P> He's a good all-rounder, and it's helpful that he's worked in London for a
significant part of his career, and very helpful he also knows the emerging
markets business. He's good with people and he's hard working and he'll work well
with other businesses. He'll form a good partnership with Steve Harker [head of
equities].

<P> <B>Have you heard the analogy that he's the Edson Mitchell and you're the
Michael Dobson?</B>

<P> I don't like those analogies. I'm not Mike Dobson. I don't think Bob is Edson
Mitchell, though I can't speak for Bob [laughs].

<P> People ask me, "who do you want to be like?" I want to be BZW. We're not
Goldman Sachs. We're not Citibank. We are who we are.

<P> <B>But there are similarities. You and Dobson are both English and investment
bankers, Diamond and Mitchell are both Americans and from markets.</B>

<P> Yes, but it doesn't change my view. I think it detracts from what the
strategies of individual firms are.

<P> <B>Both Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and BZW have commercial bank parents.</B>

<P> But they're very different. I wouldn't pretend to try to articulate the
Deutsche Bank strategy. This is an industry going through significant change.

<P> <B>What makes you think BZW will get into the global club?</B>

<P> We have the resources, the geographical presence, and the products to give us
a very good opportunity. That allows us to have that sort of aspiration. Quite
frankly there's another factor in all this called profitability. It's not just a
case of getting to the big boys' table. I'm interested in profitability and
return on capital. I believe we have the credentials and the raw materials to do
all of those things.

<P> <B>Is the US investment banking style the way forward?</B>

<P> I don't think of it that way. If you look at the corporate finance business,
which is very much cross-border, a lot of capable people come out of essentially
the UK market. It's not a question of being American or British or whatever. It's
more a question of how you position yourself to do the business rather than a
particular style. I am completely unselfconscious. But I do my best, I work hard.
I have a background that happens to have taken me into UK merchant banks,
industry, and bulge bracket American investment banking.  I've tried to be the
best I can be in a job and to take with me all of the good habits.

<P> You should not take your eye off one key ball, the client. You can appreciate
client-focus as much with a UK merchant banking background, as from an American
investment bank.

<P> <B>How do you see your role as chief executive?</B>

<P> An important component for me is to make sure we all work together as a firm,
and that we develop a team approach. I hope I can make a contribution to the
morale and motivation of our people, and I believe in being quite hands-on in
that respect. It's important to lead from the front. I believe that part of my
job is to face the outside world and to provide my full commitment to the firm in
situations we are very interested in winning. So it's really a broad mixture of
strategy, motivation, implementation of a team approach, and to interface the
bank.

<P> <B>Martin Taylor said when he hired you that the one area you've missed out
on is markets.</B>

<P> I'm not sure what he actually said. We had a pretty big fixed-income business
at Lehman Brothers, and I ran the European investment banking business. No doubt
about it, in terms of actual practice I've done more M&amp;A deals. But I'm not
uncomfortable with this. I think I have a background which covers quite a lot of
our businesses one way or another.

<P> <B>How important is the management committee in the way you manage?</B>

<P> It's going to be very important. We've got a good set of people on the
committee. We've created a collegiate group. This is critical because I want to
develop our businesses in a way in which we they feed off each other. That's the
bottom line.

<P> <B>It will meet every week?</B>

<P> Yes.

<P> <B>Will you appear on the trading floor?</B>

<P> Yes, I'll wander around there.

<P> <B>Are you the sort of person who likes to get on first-name terms with
people?</B>

<P> Yes. But not "Hail fellow, well met" just for the sake of it. I won't force
it. After the Bank of England deal [a $2 billion floating-rate note] I got a real
buzz out of being down on the trading floor. We had the first meeting at 5.45am,
when the sales team was briefed. Great.

<P> But I'm just as happy walking on the corporate finance floor at nine at
night, where there are often people sitting around, banging out spreadsheets,
presentations and the like.

<P> I intend to see as many of the offices overseas as I can. With Flemings, I
used to go to Asia a lot. But I won't be visible just for the sake of being
visible.

<P> <B>When the restructuring was announced you said the new management was going
to take the firm onto the next level. What is the next level?</B>

<P> I mean the next stage of our growth. Let's not take anything away from the
fact that we've had a really exciting 10 years. But we must steepen the gradient
of our client service and our overrall performance. We need to encourage the next
generation of management and, in the case of markets, to develop a business where
perhaps we were not firing on all four cylinders. So it's a combination of being
very keen on profitability and to fulfil our potential. I think with our product
base we have a marvellous opportunity. I don't have a crystal ball, but I'm quite
optimistic about what we can do.

<P> <B>When you arrived, you didn't mess around. Donald Brydon went very quickly,
for example. Is that your philosophy? Get things done fast?</B>

<P> I had a real opportunity to think this through. Quite carefully. Having
thought it through and having tested my views on colleagues, I believed that I
needed to move on those views. There's never a perfect time, but I think its
fairer and easier in many ways to implement it quickly. But a tremendous amount
of thought went into that process.

<P> <B>A lot of the time it's easier to  leave things as they are.</B>

<P> It is.

<P> <B>Is this a signal that for bold decisions there'll be no more dithering at
BZW?</B>

<P> Let's be careful what we mean by bold decisions. It's important to be clear
about what you're trying to achieve and how you get there, and therefore be
decisive. But thoughtfully decisive. That's how I put it. All these things are
important and require a lot of thought about their implications. I just think
that's the right way to go. If you call it bold, maybe it's bold. I just try to
be clear and decisive.

<P> <B>Are you a new broom with a new culture?</B>

<P> It's not new broom for the sake of a new broom. There's a real purpose to it.

<P> I think a culture comes out of common purpose and teamwork. Actually there's
more of an underlying culture here than sometimes seems apparent outside the
firm. My job is to make this an effective cohesive firm. Being clear helps to
create that, because it gives people a clearer sense of direction.

<P> We've just appointed our graduate intake. We had 95 graduates in here. I saw
as many of them as I could. They're very bright. And that's the next part of
building the culture. The clarity of thought and management these guys see is
going to be very important.

<P> <B>That's a lot of trainees.</B>

<P> It's not really, and our plan is for that to increase slightly going forward.

<P> <B>Were they not intimidated when they met you?</B>

<P> No, not these guys today. They read the news, they ask you questions: "By the
way, what's your view of that bank, or so and so? I read this story about them
the other day." These guys are pretty sharp. They're on the ball.

<P> <B>Martin Taylor is consistently talking about shareholder value. But
investment banking has traditionally been a business which is better for
employees than shareholders. That must put a lot of pressure on you.</B>

<P> I think Martin's dead right to put an emphasis on shareholder value. I've not
got any argument with that. There are inevitable choices to be made in businesses
like this about resources: how much you commit to individual parts, to research
and development, for example. You've got to get the balance right. At the end of
the day, there is pressure to perform, and meet shareholder value criteria.

<P> <B>British industry has always been very short-term in its investment. You
have the chance to reach the big league. But investment is required. Will Martin
Taylor invest or will he decide the returns are not good enough?</B>

<P> What you've seen in the recent past is sensible investment. I am all for
that. What we're paid to do is to use our capital in the right businesses in as
effective a way as possible.

<P> I believe Martin is behind a sensible strategy for this firm. We've got to
use capital sensibly, and profitably and balance the short term with the long
term. If I had an open cheque I would probably find it more difficult.... I'm not
saying I want to climb Mount Everest without ropes, however. But I certainly feel
that prudent investment is the right way to go. I don't have any trouble with
that.

<P> <B>Do you think league tables are important?</B>

<P> Yes, they are. Companies read them. Being credible whether by league tables
or some other qualitative measure is important. But it's no good being top of the
league tables and being unprofitable. That combination doesn't work.

<P> <B>Do you have to be top five?</B>

<P> No. But I accept that the need to be there or thereabouts is
important.

<H3>RESEARCH</H3> 
<H2>Who is pulling the strings? </H2>
<H4>No-one believes that investment bank research is fully independent.
As competition and costs escalate, the pressure on analysts to hawk deals
and withhold negative views is intensifying. While some analysts get rich
in the new environment, many have quit, and investors have turned to their
own and third-party research. Michelle Celarier reports </H4>
After 15 years spent working as a Wall Street analyst, &quot;the tremendous
conflict of interest&quot; Joyce Albers felt between her responsibility
to investors and the demands of her firm's investment banking clients finally
convinced her to leave. Although Albers was a top-rated analyst at CS First
Boston, covering pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, she claims much
of her time was spent following a handful of companies that were the firm's
banking clients, not those who she thought offered exciting investment opportunities.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's the hand that feeds you&quot;, she says of the corporate clients,
whose fees at CSFB paid an estimated 50% of her bonus. Forced at one point
to quit covering a company because of &quot;some strange internal reason
on the banking side&quot;, she was further disheartened by a culture in
which investment bankers were allowed to go ahead with deals that analysts
begged them not to do. When such business goes sour and investors call to
complain, &quot;it is the analyst who is left with the problem&quot;, she
recalls. Albers switched last year to the buy side and now works as an analyst
for the US institutional investment firm Deerfield Management, where she
views Wall Street research with a healthy dose of scepticism. <BR>
<BR>
Albers is only one of scores of analysts who have abandoned - voluntarily
or otherwise - the mega salaries and public profile of major investment
banking firms, as the pressure on analysts to hawk deals and withhold negative
views is intensifying. The two most celebrated leavers in recent years were
former London-based Union Bank of Switzerland analyst, Terry Smith, whose
best-selling book, <I>Accounting for Growth</I>, infuriated several British
companies (most of which are now troubled if not bankrupt), and former US
gaming companies analyst Marvin Roffman, at the regional firm of Janney
Montgomery Scott. Roffman's critical commentary brought down the wrath of
US real-estate tycoon and casino owner Donald Trump. After lengthy legal
battles, both analysts received hefty settlements from their firms after
corporate pressure, which allegedly got them fired in the first place, was
applied. <BR>
<BR>
Other analysts, such as Morgan Stanley's former star global strategist in
London, David Roche, left of their own accord. Roche, who started his own
firm, Independent Strategy, says he quit in 1994 after coming under &quot;continuous
pressure to change opinions and not to voice opinions in all theatres of
the world&quot;. Roche adds that he even received angry threatening telephone
calls in the middle of the night from anonymous Morgan Stanley investment
bankers upset about his position on the French franc. In his view, the privatization
business &quot;marked a watershed&quot;, with countries carrying considerably
more clout than individual companies. &quot;Major houses kow-tow to governments
and crush their analysts,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Independence</B> <BR>
<BR>
Analysts at retail-based houses say that in the past they were more immune
to the heat. But, especially in today's lucrative equity issuance and IPO
market, that appears to be the case no longer. Merrill Lynch entertainment
analyst Harold Vogel, who is reputed to have a more objective analysis of
Hollywood than many of his peers, opted to leave the giant institution to
work at a small but well-regarded research-oriented investment banking boutique,
Cowen &amp; Co. Cowen is unusual in that it allows analysts to veto deals
they don't like, and Vogel has already done so. &quot;I have more flexibility
and freedom here,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Some analysts contend they were dismissed before they knew what had hit
them. US bank analyst George Salem says he was edged out at Prudential Securities
last year after bad reviews in which investment bankers claimed he was &quot;uncooperative&quot;
and a &quot;hindrance&quot; to their efforts. Salem, who had been fired
from Prudential in 1983 after being the only analyst brave enough to predict
the effect of the LDC debt crisis on banks, was re-hired in 1987 by a new
research director at the firm. He believes he got into trouble most recently
by correctly anticipating the 1994 downturn at Banc One, a US regional bank
that he claimed was using derivatives excessively. Although it turned out
Salem was right in his assessment, he did not know that Banc One was a big
customer of Prudential's mortgage-backed securities. <BR>
<BR>
After a couple of publicized cases at Smith Barney last year, when there
was a flap because analysts voiced negative views, research director Jack
Rivkin changed jobs, going to the parent company, Travelers Group, to manage
money. Rivkin's move is noteworthy, as his reputation for standing up for
his analysts was renowned at Lehman Brothers, his former employer, where
he built a highly regarded research team. At Lehman, Rivkin was reportedly
incensed about the Roffman case, insinuating such a thing would never happen
on his watch. <BR>
<BR>
Still, the analysts who have left in disgust, or whose fierce independence
has got them fired, are in the minority. &quot;The whole system is geared
to corrupt the analyst,&quot; claims Salem. &quot;On the one side, analysts
are sucked in by lucrative compensation. On the other, they are fearful
of being fired, fearful of being cut off from management of companies they
are covering and fearful of a low bonus. To me, it's wrong. I believe there
should be some integrity in the business.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most agree that the economic incentives to be friendly to corporate clients
make the pressures subtle and often internalized. &quot;Who knows what's
real and what [pressures] you put on yourself,&quot; adds Curt Rohrman,
who also left CSFB for the buy side at Texas-based USAA Investment Management.
&quot;There's no reason to punch a client in the stomach. The reality is
if you're an analyst and you want to make a million dollars, you're not
going to do it by pissing off clients. You make it by doing banking business.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Most investment banks insist their research is untainted. A Morgan Stanley
spokesperson, declining to comment on Roche's departure, says that &quot;despite
occasional debates, we think we manage extremely well the inevitable tensions
that exist within any full-service brokerage firm. We work very hard to
keep the research independent&quot;. As proof, firms often point to the
so-called Chinese walls separating research from investment banking. But
former employees note that this only means analysts follow the letter of
the law and don't publish research on an underwriting client during the
required blackout period. Generally, the positively-slanted research report
will come out well ahead of the offering, they add. <BR>
<BR>
The argument that these Chinese walls free the analysts of conflicts is
&quot;absolute junk&quot; insists Roche. &quot;People think because of the
laws, research is some sort of truth. It's not. The problem is pretending
it is anything more than advertising.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most firms proudly admit that their analysts are working closely with bankers
and, those that haven't already done so, are scurrying to reorganize their
investment banking divisions to make sure they get the two functions together
to capitalize on the strategic M&amp;A deals they claim underpin today's
boom. Since analysts understand the industry and know about competitors,
they are best placed to advise bankers on deals for clients. And since analysts
are closer to companies, often having the chairman's ear, they are also
expected to suggest to bankers types of financings the firm might successfully
market. In fact, many say the current trend is giving analysts their long-deserved
due; they are finally being recognized as the intellectual capital of the
investment bank. <BR>
<BR>
But it's no ivory tower existence. &quot;Investment banks also need analysts
to flog their stuff. Analysts are becoming high-powered salesmen,&quot;
says Richard Green, chief investment officer at Daiwa Capital Management
in London. He thinks their research is biased. Glenn Fogle, a portfolio
manager at US-based Twentieth Century Investors, which manages $50 billion,
adds: &quot;Everybody in this business has the opportunity to enrich themselves
at someone else's expense.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Critics claim analysts often ignore their legal responsibility to serve
investors - a fact manifested in the price of offerings they endorse, in
the unrealistic earnings estimates and in the buy recommendations flooding
the market. &quot;Clearly, analysts haven't been too good on forecasts,&quot;
says Green. &quot;There have been a lot of surprises in the markets.&quot;
As for mergers, former Lehman Brothers' chief European economist Gerald
Holtham notes that historical evidence suggests these aren't such good investments
either. &quot;More than half are worse off after a takeover,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<BR>
Some analysts go so far as to suggest that the real issue here is white
collar crime. &quot;But you might as well indict the whole Street,&quot;
says one analyst. Even if not criminal, the practices are unsavoury to some
people. Terry Smith, now an analyst at the London research boutique Collins
Stewart &amp; Co, says he found the idea that he would change his views
to appease companies &quot;demeaning&quot;. He argues that the manipulation
of research is &quot;almost a crime against society&quot;. Financial resources
are being diverted to those with the most influence, he says, not those
whose businesses are, in themselves, deserving of investment as independent
research suggests. Looking at the big picture, Smith argues that it is nothing
less than the savings of the industrialized world that are at stake. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, many argue that today's overheated market has been fed by the trend
and is bound to blow up eventually. &quot;How many issues should really
come to market?&quot; asks Salem, who takes no issue with analysts supporting
deals &quot;they believe in, with their full hearts and souls&quot;. But
many times this isn't the case. &quot;It's money that buys the deal. You
bring the analyst in and it gets peddled.&quot; One research director adds,
somewhat sardonically: &quot;At worst, it's organized prostitution.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Those analysts who go along with the game, however, profit handsomely. Gary
Goldstein, a Wall Street recruiter at the Whitney Group, claims that a number
of top analysts are now earning between $3 million and $5 million a year.
The hot areas, such as telecommunications, media and entertainment, and
technology and banking, are where the big bucks are to be made. In London,
the salary levels are lower, but still are believed to be close to $1 million
a year. <BR>
<BR>
Such high levels of compensation are only possible because of the analysts'
contribution to M&amp;A and equity issuance, says Goldstein. In some firms,
such as Lehman Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, analysts are
reputedly compensated on a per-deal basis. They might receive between 5%
and 25% of an IPO's fees, and between 10% and 15% of those on an M&amp;A
advisory, says Goldstein. Analysts that don't work on investment banking
deals say they earn salaries in the region of $300,000 to $400,000. <BR>
<BR>
And at any firm, say those who have left the job, there are always some
analysts known to be &quot;in the investment bankers' pockets&quot;. A few
make the switch to investment banking. Keith Brown, a former bank analyst
at Morgan Stanley in London, is now an investment banker, as is Montgomery
Securities' former bank analyst Richard Fredericks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Deregulation</B> <BR>
<BR>
Just as economic considerations - some would say greed - drive analysts'
work, economic forces are responsible for the marrying of research with
corporate finance. Analysts pine for the good old days when research was
dominant and, according to Steve Balog, research director at US brokerage
firm Furman Selz, &quot;unadulterated&quot;. That situation existed during
the 1960s and early 1970s. But ever since May Day 1975 in the US and Big
Bang in London in 1986, the deregulation of commission rates has turned
research into a cost-centre. Today, institutional commissions are down to
less than a nickel a share in the US, and as Rohrman notes, &quot;you can't
even turn the lights on with that&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Institutional investors grouse about the research. But some think they have
no one to blame but themselves. Says Smith: &quot;If you pay peanuts, you're
going to get monkeys.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To support their huge teams of analysts, firms are forced to charge other
parts of the business. The late 1970s' development of block trading, which
catapulted into the proprietary trading of the 1980s and early 1990s, helped
pay part of the freight. In that environment, analysts say they were sometimes
asked to orient their views to help the trading desk unload its inventory.
But when trading profits evaporated in 1994, firms looked elsewhere - to
corporate finance and M&amp;A, two areas that were heating up again. The
across-the-board earnings dive in 1994 seemed to accelerate the trend, as
competition intensified and cost pressures continued. &quot;It's harder
to be an honest analyst,&quot; says one ex-Wall Street analyst who has gone
to a research-oriented boutique. &quot;In the past two years, it's been
the worst I have ever seen in the 30 years I've been in the business and
it's continuing to deteriorate.&quot; He says he left his previous firm
&quot;to save&quot; his reputation. <BR>
<BR>
The view from London is similar. In the UK, it is the big integrated firms,
led by the Americans but tailed by the Swiss and German banks with their
hefty pocketbooks, who, post-Big Bang, have charged into the city. They
are the ones credited with changing the environment. To stay in the game,
one must pay big salaries, and, says James Capel research director Lin Moran,
that can only be done with corporate finance income. Capel, which is owned
by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), is just now integrating
its staunchly independent research effort with HSBC's investment banking
arm, Samuel Montagu, and Moran says she is trying to have &quot;the best
of both worlds&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Integrity</B> <BR>
<BR>
Until now, at least, there's been no question that Capel's research was
in the driver's seat. &quot;There is no mileage in allowing our research
integrity to be undermined,&quot; Moran insists and, so far, the bankers
have had to respect that. As evidence, she cites a Turkish deal that the
research department turned down.&quot;We were asked to provide a valuation
for a company that wanted to go to market to list, but there was no way
we could get the $50 million valuation they wanted. We thought if we stretched
it, maybe it would be worth $32 million. They said they wouldn't talk to
us unless we got it up to $45 million.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It was only after the Turkish market collapsed that the company came back
- but by then it wasn't even worth $32 million. &quot;The bankers were disappointed,&quot;
she says, &quot;but they are aware that we don't act like some of the houses
where they have worked before. They know there's no point in trying to pressure
us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But how long can James Capel hold out against the trend? Take the case of
Deutsche Bank. After its image was sullied by insider trading scandals several
years ago, Deutsche Bank tried to appease the international markets by making
its research arm a separate subsidiary to ensure integrity. But the tighter
integration of Morgan Grenfell into the bank last year scuttled DB Research
and most of its analysts left. Now Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's research is
being organized like its competitors. &quot;What happens now is that the
bank's latest deal is praised to the skies,&quot; a former analyst told
<I>Euromoney.</I> <BR>
<BR>
Other banks are making similar moves in this direction. Some appear to be
quietly getting rid of analysts who don't contribute to investment banking.
At Merrill, for example, a number of analysts who were long-term employees
but who didn't cover areas of investment banking interest, have been abruptly
let go. Among them were the analysts covering gold stocks and utilities.
&quot;They tend to get rid of analysts that don't bring in banking,&quot;
says one former Merrill analyst. &quot;If you don't bring in banking business,
they don't want you.&quot; A slew of Merrill analysts has quit in London,
including many from the newly-acquired Smith New Court, where they were
used to having some autonomy. Merrill has declined to comment. <BR>
<BR>
In Europe, the move at Goldman Sachs to sack its country analysts on the
continent and revert to a pan-European approach centred in London was, in
a competitor's words, &quot;a statement that their interest is only the
banking business&quot;. The move to dump non-finance-oriented analysts strikes
some old-timers as particularly appalling. &quot;It means the cycle has
become even tougher and research is bastardized something incredible. Customers
should not believe anything they read,&quot; says a 25-year Wall Street
veteran, an institutional salesman who left a large firm recently for a
money management boutique. <BR>
<BR>
Another symbol of the changed environment is the oft-derided analysts' ratings
system. In recent years, the move away from &quot;buy, sell and hold&quot;
recommendations, to such euphemisms as &quot;outperform, underperform, neutral,
aggressive buy and accumulate&quot;, seems to suggest the intention is to
avoid offence. &quot;The word 'sell' is a difficult word to use on Wall
Street,&quot; says Raymond Soifer, a bank analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman,
a firm with no investment banking but which focuses on money management,
brokerage and research. The only justification for the convoluted rating
system that has taken over, he says, &quot;is a corporate finance influence&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
To Roche, it's all a little ridiculous. &quot;As an investor, I'm either
long or short,&quot; he notes. Shortly after he left Morgan Stanley, the
firm changed its rating system to get rid of sell recommendations altogether.
Unlike many firms that now boast five or six levels of ratings, mostly biased
on the positive side, Morgan Stanley limits itself to three ratings - outperform,
neutral and underperform. A spokesperson insists: &quot;The change was done
to streamline the process and make it more independent. We changed the rating
structure specifically to look at price outlook instead of the management.
A lot of firms have done that to make the research more quantitative.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
At the moment, most of the stocks Morgan Stanley covers worldwide are rated
neutral or underperform. That would appear to set Morgan Stanley apart from
the norm; according to several academic studies, analysts' recommendations
are biased towards &quot;buy&quot; recommendations, with &quot;sell&quot;
recommendations seldom being issued. The academic literature notes that
analysts at firms with underwriting relationships with companies issue more
favourable investment recommendations and forecasts than unaffiliated analysts.
<BR>
<BR>
Those firms that maintain their &quot;sell&quot; recommendations find they
do suffer with these issues. Capel's Moran recalls the tiff that occurred
when its European banking analyst issued a sell recommendation on a major
German bank. Since Capel is owned by HSBC, the complaint went from bank
chairman to bank chairman. &quot;In Germany, it's a new idea for a company
to put a sell on their shares,&quot; says Moran who had to explain that
it was not a statement about the management, &quot;just a comment on relative
share prices over a 12-month period&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>External pressure</B> <BR>
<BR>
There's little dispute that one of the reasons for the analysts' optimism
is their fear of retribution from the companies they cover, either directly
or through their firms' investment bankers. &quot;You don't want to be too
negative so you won't lose access,&quot; says Rohrman. &quot;Anytime you're
negative on a company, 90% of the time they're less likely to talk to you.
They just don't return your phone calls.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Pressure from companies can come in a variety of unusual ways, as former
UBS analyst Smith must have discovered when writing his book. As soon as
some of the companies got wind of his publishing project, they began to
apply the heat. One of them, Grand Metropolitan, wasn't a UBS banking client.
But a call to UBS to stop publication of the book did come from one of Grand
Metropolitan's non-executive directors, Colin Marshall, the chief executive
officer of British Airways - one of UBS's biggest clients. <BR>
<BR>
A similar situation occurred at UBS with an analyst covering Eurotunnel.
Just as long-term Eurotunnel bear, Richard Hanna, was about to publish another
negative commentary, UBS got two phone calls asking it to pull the report
- one from Robert Scoley, the chairman of UBS client British Steel, a non-executive
director of Eurotunnel, the other from Eurotunnel's top banker, David Scholey,
then SG Warburg's chairman. Scholey added, presumably as an incentive, that
UBS might be chosen to be the Swiss lead manager of the UK's first Ecu bond.
<BR>
<BR>
Big corporations aren't the only ones that attempt to throw their weight
around. Countries are some of the most imperious, it seems. One European
research director remembers being told by the firm's corporate finance department
that Italy, where it was hoping to get a slice of the privatization business,
wanted the company's research department &quot;to write some positive articles
about Italy in the press&quot;. The director refused. Given Italy's well-known
problems, &quot;I said it would look silly&quot;, he says. <BR>
<BR>
Not long after, the director says he saw a positive story on Italy in a
British newspaper quoting analysts at a competing firm. Italy also managed
to get a written apology from Morgan Stanley chairman Richard Fisher when
David Roche's successor wrote an unflattering view on the nation's prospects.
<BR>
<BR>
A similar apology was recently obtained by the Czech Republic after a report
by Nomura Research Institute predicted a devaluation of that country's currency.
Kleinwort Benson even pulled a report on Malaysia, derisively entitled &quot;Noddy
Economics&quot; after the children's storybook character, because it was
considered to be in poor taste. <BR>
<BR>
Yet it appears that most of the pressure comes from within investment banking
firms. Roche now considers his life at Morgan Stanley &quot;a monied form
of hell&quot;. Looking back, he says, the end of his seven years was &quot;like
coming out of a tunnel&quot;, with the complaints by investment bankers
a &quot;constant grinding noise behind your back&quot;. Although Roche protested
to his bosses, who tried to fix the problem &quot;umpteen times&quot;, in
the end it was an unsatisfactory situation for him. One of their last offers,
he says, was a proposal that his research would be reviewed by the Hong
Kong office, which was upset about his China views, and one person in corporate
finance. It wasn't that they wanted him to change his opinion, Roche says
caustically, &quot;they just wanted to make sure it didn't offend anyone&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
His experience is not unlike those of other analysts who say that it is
the bankers who bring in the money and thus win battle after battle in the
firms where they have worked. Analysts are particularly miffed about bankers
going ahead with deals that they - the analysts - have argued against. &quot;They'd
always say they wanted your input, but in the end, if it was a good piece
of banking business they'd do it,&quot; says a former Wall Street analyst.
<BR>
<BR>
Another analyst remembers being the research representative on a capital
commitment meeting of 19 individuals when the analyst for the industry recommended
against the deal. &quot;The vote was 18 to one and you can guess who the
lone dissenter was,&quot; he says. &quot;The deal went ahead and it was
a mess. They had to get all sorts of help with the marketing, but the banking
fee was $60 million.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although retail investors may bear the brunt of the system, the more sophisticated
institutional investors understand how it works. With regard to the new
rating system, Soifer says: &quot;They follow the direction. Is the analyst
upgrading or downgrading the stock? And the most sophisticated don't even
care about that. They want the information and they'll make the decision.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Former CSFB analyst Rohrman says his new colleagues on the buy side &quot;are
more cynical and sceptical about the process than anyone. Every time you
leave a meeting with a Wall Street analyst, they'll say 'that guy is just
a deal hawk'. To think that buy-siders are getting sucked in by this farce
implies that they are idiots. They know what's going on.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rohrman thinks it would be better if investment banks did away with recommendations
altogether, since investors say it is the last thing they look for from
sell side analysts. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Alternative sources </B><BR>
<BR>
To counter the perceived bias at investment banks, institutional investment
firms are hiring more of their own analysts and have access to a wide variety
of third-party research, including electronically disseminated information
from such sources as Reuters and Bloomberg, and other data which is available
on the Internet. Grudgingly, they are beginning to pay for it. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If there wasn't a need for independent research, we wouldn't exist
today,&quot; says Roche, whose firm has a London and Hong Kong office. &quot;In
one year we reached where we thought we would be in three years' time,&quot;
adds John Armstrong, one of Roche's partners. &quot;The idea of independence
is more and more the best selling ploy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As for the argument that the puny commissions institutions pay won't finance
the research, the independents say that is only true at the big firms since
these have such a huge and broad research application. By directing their
commissions from brokers in soft dollar arrangements, investors can target
precisely which type of research they want to receive if they buy third-party
research - instead of being spoon-fed the &quot;banal information&quot;
the bigger firms tend to offer. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the biggest investors can also speak directly to companies, and
some are invited to sit in on telephone conference calls, which brings them
into a loop previously reserved for analysts. <BR>
<BR>
Because of this increased access and alternative research, investors say
they don't need the brokerage analysts as much as they did before. Says
Twentieth Century's Fogle: &quot;I've disconnected myself from analysts
over the past six months or so. Their job is to create revenues and profits
for their firm; their job is not to pick stocks for me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, recommendations are unlikely to disappear because the investment
bank sales teams need to say something when they ring clients. Moreover,
not all institutional investors agree that they are useless. &quot;Analysts,
who are prepared to give a sell recommendation after a buy, are worth their
weight in gold,&quot; says Daiwa's Green. <BR>
<BR>
However, sell recommendations aren't what the investors are likely to find
much of these days. So, they look to investment bank analysts for industry
trends, to fundamental analysis and to whatever type of inside information
they assume analysts possess from being involved in the corporate finance
business. As a buy side analyst, Joyce Albers now talks to some of her former
competitors on Wall Street. Describing one analyst she thinks is totally
corporate finance-driven, she says: &quot;He's plugged in. I use him for
information, not for stock picking.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although it would be illegal for analysts to divulge any legally-defined
inside information or to breach the Chinese wall rules, investors and former
investment bank analysts say that analysts walk a pretty fine line. &quot;The
lawyers, the compliance people, they look at things in such a different
way,&quot; says one former Wall Street analyst. &quot;They'd come in and
talk to us and we'd say 'hello, do you know what we're doing every day?'
Get serious. When you call an investor, they want to hear something.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Yet in spite of the analysts' ever-closer ties with the companies they follow
and the deluge of quasi-inside information, investors say they find that
the research, more than ever before, uninteresting and bland. Some blame
market conditions. &quot;We've had bull markets for a such a long time now
that analysts can get away with less intensive and in-depth work than they
were able to do in a bear market,&quot; says Green. <BR>
<BR>
Another reason for the decline in quality may be the shifting of basic research
duties to less experienced, junior analysts. Since the more senior analysts
are needed for banking businesss, day-to-day reports are turned over to
the assistants. One analyst recalls a company calling to complain because
its models, which had been plugged in by a junior analyst, were incorrect.
<BR>
<BR>
With the tremendous changes sweeping through investment banking research,
perhaps, like David Roche, it's best to be philosophical about the job's
promotional role. Given the economics of the situation, he argues, it's
just capitalism at work. &quot;I came to the view that the real job of these
firms was to run an assembly line from the issuer to the investor, with
the margins at the issuance.&quot; While firms were pushing telecom deals
because of the huge fees they earned from the privatizations, Roche viewed
them as bad investments - commodities that wouldn't be able to compete in
the future but which needed money now. Such controversial positions made
Roche a television personality and Morgan Stanley's most visible spokesperson.
But over time, he grated. &quot;The last thing Morgan Stanley needed,&quot;
muses Roche, in retrospect, &quot;was a poet standing in the middle of the
assembly line saying every car had five wheels and should have had four.&quot;
 <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>Don't shoot the analyst </H3>
Fund managers think research provided by investment banks is of reasonable
quality, but few take it at face value. A <I>Euromoney</I> poll suggests
that two-thirds of fund managers think investment banks' research is slightly
biased; 21% describe it as self-serving. Only 12% describe bank research
as objective. They do however take notice of individual analysts who they
trust regardless of the firm they work for. Other trends to note are: <BR>
<BR>
- Fund managers use broker/bank and in-house research much more than independent
research. <BR>
<BR>
- In the equity and emerging market sectors, broker/bank research is more
favourably rated; whereas in the Eurobond and currency/FX sectors the three
types of research are rated fairly evenly. <BR>
<BR>
- 60% of respondents don't trust the research of a firm which is underwriting
a deal related to the research provided. <BR>
<BR>
- Most fund managers are unwilling to pay more than $10,000 per year for
independent research. <BR>
<BR>
- Funds rate their own research most highly; other types of research are
usually rated good or average. <B>Research by Dylan Drummond</B> <BR>

<H3>CORRUPTION</H3>



<H3> <B>The search for the smoking gun</B> </H3> 
<H4> <B>Watch out! A hit squad
of World Bank auditors could be making a surprise visit to a project near you.
This is the Bank's first serious attempt, led by president James Wolfensohn, to
address corruption head on. But nailing the culprits &#173; some of them
dictators and governments &#173; is not so easy.  By Michelle Celarier</B>
</H4> 

<P> An internal report sent to the World Bank's board of directors earlier
this year was one of the first indications of a sea change. In it, the Bank's
operations evaluation department (OED) used the word "corruption" for the first
time ever, citing two projects &#173; the Sixth Highway Project in Haiti and the
Natural Gas Technical Assistance Project in Nigeria. These projects, it explained
in its April report, were "among many" which were "severely hampered by lack of
transparency, spurious accounting practices, and non-compliance with Bank
procurement rules".

<P> If that wasn't enough of a blow, a June memo from Bank president James
Wolfensohn announced that henceforth there would be spot audits of countries'
programmes &#173; apparently sending shock-waves throughout the institution.
Wolfensohn had learned during his first year of office that thousands of projects
and billions of dollars have slipped through the Bank's oversight procedures.
Accordingly, he made the unprecedented decision to do surprise audits on projects
in the Bank's major borrowing countries. First on the list are  Poland, Kenya and
Pakistan.

<P> "We want to put the fear of God in them," says Raghavan Srinivasan, the
Bank's chief procurement adviser.

<P> In the past, the World Bank preferred to refer to corruption somewhat
obliquely as "misgovernance". Now Wolfensohn is making it a public issue. Bank
officials say he has been listening to the critics &#173; and reading the news.
For when a big borrower and US neighbour like Mexico is riddled with corruption,
they note, the subject becomes too big to ignore. The pressure has come from a
variety of quarters, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) &#173; such
as the Berlin-based anti-corruption lobby group Transparency International (TI)
&#173; and corporate officials, notably General Electric's Fritz Heimann, who
heads TI in the US. Even former World Bank president Robert McNamara has hopped
on the bandwagon, suggesting that top corporate executives be asked to sign a
public statement they will not engage in corrupt practices. The Bank's board of
directors declined to endorse that proposal.

<P> The recognition of corruption as an issue of development is "deepening in the
Bank", says Mike Stevens, the public sector management adviser who is the
point-person in the Bank on governance. The five files labelled "corruption" on
his bookshelves attest to the growing consideration the Bank is giving the topic.
When governments perform poorly, he explains, "corruption is often part of the
pathology." He notes that the Bank's method of dispersing loans to recipient
countries, which then are in charge of managing the procurement process, "is
inherently a higher-risk way of doing it than if you control it yourself", There
are "tens of thousands of individual contracts being let across the world, and
there's no way Bank staff can check on every one of them", he says.

<P> An ulterior motive for the World Bank's  unprecedented attack on corruption
is to help snap the world out of what one Bank official calls "aid fatigue". Last
year, public flows to the developing world were down 9%, to $72 billion, with the
US cutting its aid by a third and big donor countries like Germany, France and
the UK slicing aid budgets by 4% to 6%.

<P> In today's post-Cold War environment, where aid appears to have lost much of
its political imperative, such disbursements are under increased scrutiny. As one
measure of extreme protest, the US has decided not to contribute to the 1997-99
funding of the International Development Agency (IDA), the World Bank programme
for assistance to the poorest countries, chiefly in Africa, arguing that the
assistance has only lined the pockets of the African ruling elite. For in spite
of tens of billions of dollars and decades worth of aid, World Bank officials
admit, corruption has been rampant in Africa at the same time as many of these
countries' economies have virtually collapsed. "There's nothing to show for that
aid at all," says Frank Vogl, a former World Bank executive who is now
vice-chairman of Transparency International. Some $30 billion of that aid has
ended up in Swiss bank accounts, TI has claimed, quoting Swiss banking sources.
"It was used as part of the Cold War game of winning friends," says Vogl.

<P> <B>Corruption on the increase</B>

<P> The World Bank is not the only institution trying to improve the value of aid
dollars. At the bilateral level, industrialized countries are looking critically
at another issue: tied aid &#173; the practice of granting aid with the proviso
that the proceeds must be used to buy goods and services of the donor's country.
"It all comes down to value for money," says a member of the Development
Assistance Committee of the OECD, which is in the process of reviewing tied aid
(see box page 50). Tied aid and corrupt practices can both be costly for
developing countries and often for donors as well. At a time of constrained aid
budgets, cost-effectiveness is a top concern. However, highlighting abuses could
be used as another excuse for donors to pull out altogether, fears Robert
Picciotto, who heads the OED, the Bank's independent review agency.

<P> But the facts cannot be ignored. In the OED's most recent internal
evaluations report, it judges that only two-thirds of ongoing projects are
"satisfactory", down from 90% of disbursements in 1980, but up slightly from the
nadir of 63% in 1992. Karl Ziegler, a former commercial banker in Kenya and now a
consultant, notes that at the time the World Bank's loan book was ballooning, the
number of staff to supervise them was drastically reduced: "Many projects were
under water from day one."

<P> At least part of the cause has been traced to what World Bank officials agree
is an upsurge in corruption tainting virtually every country in the developing
world (not to mention a few of the industrialized countries). "Corruption has
been going up geometrically over the past 10 years," says Srinivasan, who argues
simply that "economic development brings more money into play". The OED noted
recently that project performance "tends to be less satisfactory in countries
where the implementation environment is negatively affected by corruption".

<P> In recent years, the Bank radically switched direction away from mammoth
infrastructure projects to such social concerns as education and health and
technical assistance. In large part, the change was designed to meet the growing
criticisms of environmentalists and advocates for the poor. It was combined with
efforts to steer private investment into big project co-financings. That has
meant, ironically, that the World Bank's ability to monitor the projects big and
small to which it has lent its name has been vastly reduced, possibly opening the
door to even more corruption than before.

<P> Previously a handful of heavily-scrutinized giant public works projects
dominated World Bank lending. Even in its heyday during the 1980s, structural
adjustment lending (itself a reputed source of corruption) garnered only 25% of
the money. But now the big contracts comprise just two-thirds, or about $15
billion a year, of Bank disbursements, or 40,000 contracts. The Wappenhans<B>
</B>report of three years ago, named after the board member who headed an
internal study, indicated there was virtually no review of these operations, once
begun. However, all contracts with a value above $25 million were approved and
reviewed by a high-level World Bank committee chaired by the head of procurement
<I>before</I> being granted. Moreover, as the Wappenhans report revealed and
Wolfensohn learned upon joining the Bank last year, a host of smaller contracts,
from consulting to technical assistance to public health and education, along
with the new financial tools such as the partial risk guarantees, are entirely
ignored by the system of oversight that had been in place since the late 1980s.

<P> "Fifteen years ago [this area] was small money," says Srinivasan. "Now it's
the big thing. And it's all disbursed locally; all the papers are kept there and
we don't monitor it."<B> </B>These smaller contracts now account for $7 billion
in World Bank money a year, or 30,000 contracts. The $2 billion of that which
goes on consultancy contracts for banks, accountants and others is among the most
open to abuse. Consultancy contracts are not subject to the Bank's vaunted
international competitive bidding procedure, and in fact some are tied to donor
countries in a fashion usually reserved for bilateral aid. Also, the Bank does
not supervise the procurement procedures on projects financed in the private
sector that depend on its guarantees, and it  scrutinizes only its portion of the
$151 billion in co-financings or parallel financings with others.

<P> The random audits that are being instituted could go a long way to close that
loophole. Wolfensohn believes the Bank needs more than routine checks &#173; even
for the smaller contracts, which he referred to in his internal memo:
"Disbursements are often made on the basis of statements of expenditures, without
the supporting documentation. We depend on our borrowers to have handled these
contracts with due diligence and according to the agreed procedures... As a
public institution we are accountable for helping our borrowers to see that the
money allocated under Bank-financed operations is being spent on what it should
be spent on and that our borrowers are getting good value for what is being
spent. Annual financial audits alone are not enough, nor is routine supervision
by the Bank."

<P> <B>Targets &#173; Poland, Kenya, Pakistan</B>

<P> Wolfensohn said he had hired the independent accounting firm of
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Surveillence (SGS) of Switzerland
to handle the first set of audits. The three countries announced after the memo
was circulated were Poland, Kenya and, most recently, Pakistan. Only countries
comprising a portfolio of at least $1 billion and 20 ongoing projects are being
selected. Officially, the Bank has not stated that it suspects corruption in the
countries being targeted. But it has chosen some countries that illustrate
particular problems. In Pakistan, for example, the $1.8 billion Hub Power Project
ushered in a new era of private financing for the type of megaproject that the
multilateral institution had previously financed alone or with other governmental
agencies. Aided by a partial guarantee and co-financing from the Bank, the
innovative financial structure drew in over 40 private banks and led to a boom in
private and public investment. The mix of public and private monies that has made
Bank oversight minimal on may of its projects, combined with the country's
reluctance to embrace procurement reform, has apparently made the Bank edgy.

<P> Donald Strombom, the former World Bank procurement chief who now runs a
Washington-based consultancy, International Development Business Consultants, is
working on procurement reform in Pakistan through a World Bank contract. "A lot
of what the rest of the world thinks is corruption the Pakistanis see as
standard, even though bribery is illegal in Pakistan," he says. "It's perfectly
normal for people in public office to seek payments to see that things happen.
They argue that it's just an extension of a tribal custom." Pakistan ranked
third-highest in a Transparency International index of corruption, as measured by
a survey of corporate executives, which, however, excluded African and former
communist countries from its ranking. As for Kenya, a country beset by scandals,
Strombom notes that the Bank ceased lending there during the late 1980s, but
after three years started up again. "They're now questioning the wisdom of that;
they might turn it off again," he says.

<P> Full reports from the three audits are not expected until the end of the
year, but Bank officials expect some preliminary results to be discussed at the
annual World Bank/IMF meetings, where the topic of corruption is likely to figure
prominently in Wolfensohn's address. The World Bank's new vice-president and
controller, Jules Muis, who joined in 1995 from Ernst &amp; Young, is starting
his own audits. According to Srinivasan, Muis' staff have targeted Russia "where
doubts have been raised" about dealings between government officials and
consulting firms, for example.

<P> In addition to audits, Bank procurement rules are being revised to include
specific anti-corruption language. Its international competitive bidding
procedures already require "internationally advertised, public bidding with
public bid opening, pre-disclosed evaluation criteria, and prohibition of
negotiations". Such transparency is designed to avoid corruption of the
practices. But recently the Bank's board of directors approved tougher language.
One crucial change is that bidders will be required to "disclose all commissions
payable or paid to agents, within bids". Such agent fees are generally the means
used to pay bribes. It is unlikely that someone paying a bribe in such a fashion
will disclose it, says Srinivasan. But if the Bank discovers that someone has not
met the disclosure requirement, that will provide the rationale to censure them.

<P> The new language adds: "If the Bank determines that a
bidder/contractor/consultant is engaged in bribery or fraud, it will deny the
award to the bidder, withdraw funds from ongoing contracts if already awarded and
'blacklist' the firm from future participation." Significantly, the new rules
allow the Bank to make the judgement that the borrower was engaged in corruption,
instead of waiting for judicial authorities to make a ruling, which can pose
difficulties if those authorities in the country are also corrupt. "If timely and
satisfactory remedial action was not taken by the Borrower, [the Bank] will
cancel loan proceeds allocated to the contract," the new rules state.

<P> Dissatisfied bidders often register allegations of extortion and bribery.
Srinivasan says that about 20% of all contracts are challenged and, when
investigated by the Bank, "99% of the countries change the procedures to satisfy
Bank requirements". Recently there have been two cases of alleged misprocurement
in China, leading the Bank to believe it had been misled and to cancel projects
before they began. In one case, says Srinivasan, the Chinese government chose a
US supplier to build a train system even though, as an Italian competitor pointed
out to the Bank, the US company did not meet the specifications of the original
bid document. The Chinese pleaded ignorance, and no charges of corruption were
made. However, three cases involving consultants were more dubious and caused the
firms to be blacklisted by the Bank. Two cases involved allegations of fraud, and
another was an alleged attempted bribe by a Canadian firm which was a consultant
to a contractor. In all cases the contract was suspended before any money had
been disbursed.

<P> "Consulting is a big area for corruption," asserts Srinivasan. And it is also
a big growth area at the Bank. There are many types of consulting projects,
including those that advise on financial systems or privatizations and are
handled by the big global investment banks. One field most open to bribery is the
drawing up of project specifications: consultants can write specifications that
suit one particular country or contractor.

<P> Consultancy contracts for Bank-financed projects are not subject to
international advertisement and competitive bidding. Instead, borrowers generally
invite proposals from a shortlist of "three to six qualified and experienced
firms", according to the Bank's guidelines. Srinivasan says this is because the
choice of consultants is much wider than the choice of potential contractors for
any infrastructure project, for example. Moreover, while the competitive bidding
rules require borrowers to choose the lowest bid, evaluation of the costs of
consulting services is much more subjective. But, as part of the anti-corruption
drive, the Bank will soon be changing its guidelines for consultants, Srinivasan
says. To meet the new procurement rules, borrowers are already required to
specify fees paid to them.

<P> Despite all the newly-stated good intentions, the question remains: Will the
Bank cancel ongoing contracts, or stop lending to governments known to tolerate
corruption? Even within the Bank there is some debate on how much will be done.
"All governments have got a problem with corruption," notes Mike Stevens. "It
doesn't mean we will stop lending to them." He notes that some countries known to
tolerate corruption, particularly in east  Asia, still have strong and growing
economies, which makes it difficult for a development bank to censure them. But
if the Bank perceives that corruption is undermining development in a country,
then it is likely to raise the issue with the government and insist that changes
be made. If the corruption is in a direct project, it can lead to a suspension,
he says. But Stevens, like others at the Bank, is hard pressed to name a case
where the drastic step has been taken of cancelling a project in operation.

<P> <B>Finding the evidence</B>

<P> Proving corruption is a difficult task. Finding the "smoking gun" is the
tough part, says OED director Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa, who is an attorney by
training. "You can't go around accusing people right and left without any proof."
Indeed, some board members fear the new procurement guidelines could have serious
legal repercussions, as they might be challenged for superseding the rule of law
in any recipient country.

<P> Aguirre-Sacasa, who has spent years in several African countries, including
five years in Zaire, says the Bank quit lending to Zaire in 1993 because it
suspected extensive corruption by the country's military dictator of over 30
years, President Mobutu Sese Seko &#173; reputed to be one of the five richest
men in the world. "There were too many cases for us to ignore," says
Aguirre-Sacasa. He cites the deterioration of the state-owned copper company,
Gecamines, which had been one of the greatest sources of foreign exchange. "Those
monies were being siphoned off," he says. And as the economic performance slid,
the country that had been one of the wealthiest in Africa was unable to meet its
tiny portion of the financial commitment to World Bank programmes. "We didn't
have any direct evidence," he says, "but public investment programmes were not
being put to appropriate use." For example, Zaire received funding for "forest
projects that didn't exist". In spite of all the suspicions, the Bank never
publicly stated that corruption was the reason it quit lending to Zaire.

<P> Mobutu is one of the world's longest-reigning leaders, a brutal dictator
supported by the west since 1965. The decision to stop lending to Zaire was
perhaps the surest sign of the end of Cold War concerns that had kept so many
nations in Africa and elsewhere awash in World Bank money. But political issues
still drive the countries recovering from communism. "The Bank is very serious
about helping these countries make the transition to a market economy," explains
one Bank insider. "But we also recognize that corruption has been a problem."

<P> Russian president Boris Yeltsin's ability to use $5 billion of multilateral
funds for his re-election campaign this summer against a strong Communist Party,
without any censure thus far from those institutions, is just one sign that
political considerations are still at work. World Bank consultant Strombom, who
is also working with the Russians on public sector reform, says changing that
country is "a real challenge".

<P> "Obviously the Bank would not like to shut down operations in Russia," says
Strombom. "But at a project level, we are very concerned about procurement. There
is an expectation of influence in contract awards." Strombom is working with
Russia's ministry of economy, which is the agency the Bank has chosen to write
procurement law for the country instead of the more obvious contact, the ministry
of foreign trade. The latter ministry has been riddled with corruption in Russia,
and many former high ranking officials have been forced to resign in recent
years. The World Bank's auditing of Russian operations is an indication of
heightened concerns in what is unarguably its most critical country.

<P> The rise of corruption has forced the narrow market-based economic analysis
that for years drove the economist-dominated World Bank and other development
agencies, to give way to a broader understanding of what makes economies
function. Despite the embracing of free markets by many countries, "the rule of
law gives way, and the primacy of parliament, civil service, a critical clergy
and the free press are suppressed," notes Ziegler, who runs the Centre for
Accountability and Debt Relief in London.

<P> He argues that debt relief for the African nations should be tied to
anti-corruption reforms. The Bank hasn't gone that far, but it is now working
with many developing countries on institutional reforms.

<P> The World Bank may not be able to police the world, as many argue it should,
but Transparency International believes that assuming political leadership, as
the Bank is doing, is a major step in the right direction. Vogl comments:
"Wolfensohn is saying that we want to make our aid projects more effective and
cost-efficient, and to do so we have to make a point of ensuring that the
pervasiveness of corruption is reduced." &#009;*

<H2> <B>To tie or not to tie</B> </H2> <P> Hand in hand with corruption &#173;
which robs aid recipients of value for money &#173; goes the phenomenon of tied
aid, which forces them to buy goods and services under an aid programme from the
donor country.

<P> There are few good arguments in favour of tied aid. It's costly, often leads
to unnecessary projects, and can be a source of corruption. But most aid
officials concede that tied aid is better than no aid at all. And at a time when
aid budgets are so constrained, ensuring that aid benefits the donor's business
community is widely viewed as the only way to get funding. "Countries no longer
have the stomach for [untying aid]," says one UK aid official.

<P> Even the World Bank, which prides itself on its international competitive
bidding rules, isn't immune from the political pressures that result in tied aid.
The institution is tying procurement contracts for its soft-lending arm, the
International Development Agency, saying the US will no longer be eligible for
them if it doesn't contribute to the programme for assistance to the poorest
countries of Africa. In addition, countries contribute $1.1 billion to the World
Bank in the form of separately managed trust funds, about 25% of which are tied
to contractors, especially consultants, from donor countries.

<P> Tied aid is an even bigger issue for bilateral agencies, and is under
investigation at the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD, which
has been undertaking internal country reviews of members' aid programmes this
year. "A lot of aid is simply an export credit," says one DAC member studying the
issue. In such cases, the only beneficiary is the business community of the donor
country. The DAC has argued that tied aid should not be used to finance
commercially viable projects.

<P> But that is not the only problem. Critics argue that recipient countries end
up with so-called "white elephant" projects which they don't need, such as, for
example, the sophisticated radar detection system which Siemens hopes to build in
Tanzania. And there's the problem of imported machinery which the countries can't
operate because "they don't have the service level to keep it going", says Loes
Lammerts, deputy head of procurement at the ministry of foreign affairs in The
Netherlands, the country leading the charge to untie bilateral aid.

<P> A World Bank official points to lack of standardization. In Kenya, for
example, finding replacement parts for wells is a nightmare, since they were dug
by companies from many different nations. And occasional scandals have erupted,
such as the Pergau Dam project in Malaysia, built by UK companies during the
Thatcher era with UK aid and linked to an arms sale.

<P> A recent World Bank report on "strengthening the effectiveness of aid" quotes
academic studies that estimate the excess costs of tied aid at between 10% and
30% for recipient countries. "It's a tremendous waste of scarce resources," says
Transparency International vice-chairman Frank Vogl. He adds that the lack of
oversight in tied aid also makes it more prone to corruption, particularly since
no country, except the US, outlaws the bribery of foreign officials.

<P> Despite all these issues, the DAC has never made a public statement in
support of untying. A September 17 meeting of OECD member country aid agencies
was scheduled "to see if there's any common ground to move untying forward",
according to one DAC member. But many countries are sceptical of the possibility.
"It's like going into a desert," says Lammerts, who says The Netherlands is
facing stiff opposition from its business community. Dutch firms claim they
cannot compete in an international climate of tied aid, since most Dutch aid is
already untied. She claims the greatest resistance to untying comes from the
French and the Americans.

<P> According to DAC figures for 1993, 53% percent of French bilateral aid is
tied, much of it going to the former French colonies of Africa. In the US, 41% of
bilateral aid was officially tied, according to the 1993 DAC numbers. Partially
tied aid accounted for 14% of French bilateral aid, and 21% of US bilateral aid.

<P> A recent report by the UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) gives
little hope for much change, either. The study, which was precipitated by a
critical DAC review and the Pergau scandal, agrees that tying aid restricts
competition and raises costs. The 1993 DAC numbers indicate that 64% of UK aid
was tied, with half of that for technical assistance. The ODA report says that
54% of UK aid was tied in 1994, the latest figures available.

<P> The British report &#173; the first any donor country has undertaken on the
subject &#173; argues that aid tying "is bad for UK exporters other than those
benefiting from the aid directly, and reduces incentives for efficiency and
growth. The UK would benefit in the long term from unilateral untying". But the
ODA argues that the gain would be "very small". The UK would benefit most if all
countries untied their aid programs, it concludes, but says the prospect for
multilateral untying is unlikely. As a result, the UK will continue to tie its
aid as long as other countries do so.

<P> Other countries considered among the worst offenders are Spain and Austria.
Much of Spain's aid is administered by the department of commerce and given to
Latin American countries. Austria's approach is similar, except that the money
goes to the former Eastern Bloc countries which are its neighbours. Among the
countries that get high marks for untying aid are The Netherlands and Norway.
Japan is widely rumoured to engage in tied aid, even though officially much of
its aid is untied. The DAC says its recent review of Japan's practices does not
support these rumours.

<P> One big offender is the US. At US Aid, for example, one programme, called DFA
(Development Fund for Africa), purports to be untied. But the DAC review found
that only US companies are allowed to bid on projects financed through it. After
being criticized for this policy by the DAC, the OECD group received a visit from
White House staff member Ira Magaziner who told the DAC it was investigating the
inconsistency. US Aid says that DFA is exempt from tying requirements, but admits
that US companies still get 70% of the contracts.

<P> The DAC is looking at ways of improving tied aid by degrees and making sure
that aid which is said to be untied is truly open. For example, one DAC official
says that ensuring a competitive procurement process within a country's tied aid
programme, or advertising internationally for untied projects, could help
recipient countries get better value for money. <B>&#173; <I>MC</I></B>

<H2>Decisions on the information edge </H2>
<H4>With the power of workstations doubling every year or so, traders and
investment managers can have the world at their fingertips. Typically, news
and market reports are being complemented by back office information on
exposure and risk. The problem is picking from a mass of data the precise
facts needed to make a decision. James Essinger reports on how technology
is transforming both the front and back office and is forcing the two together
</H4>
If you want to outscore your rivals, you need to make sure your front office
technology is better than theirs. Front office technology - technology on
the trading floor and in those parts of an investment manager's offices
where the big decisions are made - is nowadays as much a part of trading
and fund management as money itself. <BR>
<BR>
What gives one trader or investor an edge over another is, and always will
be, information. Inevitably, the technology which feeds that information
to the user and enables him to manipulate it and reconfigure it in the way
that best suits his purposes is bound to be as important to the front office<B>
</B>as the information itself. <BR>
<BR>
Is it reasonable to lump together the front office requirements of traders
and investment managers? Five years ago, it might not have been but today
increasingly it is. <BR>
<BR>
While many investment managers still work in sedate comfortable wood-panelled
rooms and regard a computer screen with the sort of suspicion Shakespeare
might have shown towards a typewriter, others have responded to the huge
increase in competitiveness within their industry by seeking out opportunities
to win all-important marginal advantages. They have found that competitive
edge can be gained by identifying arbitrage opportunities and developing
more efficient approaches to cash management and securities lending, as
well as by monitoring their investments more closely. <BR>
<BR>
Consequently, they spend more time hunched over screens than ever before.
Leonard Fricker, European sales manager of Thomson Financial Services, which
supplies the front office portfolio management system Portia, says: &quot;Investment
managers, particularly those working with index funds and similar investment
instruments, are trading more rapidly, holding positions for a shorter time,
using simple and complex derivatives, and in many respects behaving more
like traders. This trend seems set to continue.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In view of the clear role which front office systems play in winning competitive
advantage for a trader or investment manager, it is hardly surprising that
banks, trading houses and investment management organizations are not at
all interested in revealing any details of how they use their systems. You
might as well ask a lottery winner to give you his ticket or beg Bill Gates
to reveal in detail what Microsoft will be doing over the next five years.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite this wall of secrecy, it is still possible to gain an accurate picture
of which front office systems are being used right now and which ones are
likely to be used in the future. From talking to vendors of information
feeds and software systems, information consultants, and users who are prepared
to talk off the record, it is clear that a dynamic fast-moving front office
system industry has emerged, in which the vendors and consultants are jostling
for top position as much as the bankers, traders and investment managers.
As Kevin Merz, president of the New Yorkbased financial technology consultancy,
Enterprise Technology Corporation, explains: &quot;No user is going to want
to end up with a rigid system that would prevent them from gaining the benefits
of a new type of software, analytical product or feed that became available.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, users of front office systems are always looking beyond their current
system to see whether anything more attractive might be available. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Everything boils down to having the right quality of information,&quot;
says Martin Mitchell, a director of the London-based IT consultancy Citisoft.
&quot;Senior management want to know their overall exposure and a wide range
of other risk management information. Traders and investment managers want
to have instant screen-based access to information which will help them
meet their performance targets. In a scenario where the general quality
of information supplied to front offices is increasingly high, a marginal
improvement in this quality can often mean all the difference between success
and failure.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Front office systems can be divided into two categories: those which supply
price, market, broker and fundamental information, and on-line news; and
those which supply decision support services which assist with the making
of crucial trading or investment decisions. <BR>
<BR>
One major trend in the provision of raw data is its widespread availability
in real time (i.e. its immediate publication), with prices and news updated
on a second-by-second basis as long as the market is open or the news service
is available (often 24-hours a day). Another important trend is the increasing
availability of fundamental information (such as valuations, p/e ratios
and so on) in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Keeping up with the news</B> <BR>
<BR>
News, by definition, has always tended to be available in real time. The
problem for users has been the daily barrage of news stories covering the
widest range of economic, political and financial affairs. What users really
want is a means of automatically selecting only the news stories that are
relevant to their needs and interests. <BR>
<BR>
In the late 1980s, some vendors of artificial intelligence (AI) systems
devoted considerable time and money (usually their clients') to investigating
ways of programming a computer to &quot;read&quot; news stories intelligently
and match them to the specific interests of a particular trader or investment
manager. But these ambitious projects, which achieved little apart from
gaining revenue for the AI houses, have now largely been overtaken by powerful
search facilities which enable a computer to select stories according to
a range of key-word and key-phrase guidelines. <BR>
<BR>
One state-of-the-art news story search system is NewsPlatform, supplied
by leading financial information vendor ADP. NewsPlatform is compatible
with Reuters' Triarch and Teknokron front office dealing systems. According
to ADP's UK general manager, James Lascelles, it &quot;has so sophisticated
a search facility, it is in a real sense able to read each story as it comes
in, and send it immediately to the user or users who have specified that
key word or phrase.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The world's major vendors of raw data are Reuters, Dow Jones Telerate, Bloomberg,
ADP<B> </B>and Knight-Ridder. Japanese organization Quick and Swiss-based
Telekurs also deserve mention: Quick is the market leader in the supply
of prices from the Japanese financial markets, and Telekurs has an important
worldwide presence and a significant share of the market in continental
Europe. <BR>
<BR>
While Reuters is undoubtedly number one in terms of both the size of its
overall client base and the sheer number of terminals in place, the precise
positionings of Reuters' main rivals is impossible to determine, as different
vendors assess their market share according to different parameters - when
they do disclose this information at all. Straight comparisons are rarely
possible. <BR>
<BR>
Hand-in-hand with the trend towards the supply of raw data in real time
is an increase in the number of digital datafeeds available compared with
analog (also known as video) feeds. <BR>
<BR>
Digital feeds are relays of data in computer-readable format. They can be
fed into a proprietary screen supplied by the information vendor or any
screen that employs a suitable communications standard. The advantage of
digital feeds is that the user can remain &quot;hardware-independent&quot;;
they are not be obliged to buy the specific (and often expensive) hardware
which the vendor supplies with the feed. Such independence allows the user
to avoid the financial commitment - and possible restriction of its competitive
potential - that being tied in to a vendor can result in. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, digital feeds are configurable by the user into a wide range
of screen-based formats, and several feeds can be integrated and displayed
on one screen. Most important, digital feeds can be fed into powerful analytical
systems that are designed to provide users with a wide range of decision
support information. <BR>
<BR>
Analog feeds can only be relayed to dedicated analog terminals which are
almost always sold or leased by the vendor. They offer little flexibility
in terms of integration with other sources of information or customization
of screen displays: users are restricted to the vendor's own specification.
Similarly, decision support systems based on analog feeds are mostly designed
by the vendor and are unlikely to be either ambitious or powerful. <BR>
<BR>
The drawback of being tied to a particular vendor is that, in most cases,
the vendor will be more interested in making a tidy profit than in understanding
the client's specific needs. In the past, Reuters and Quick came under heavy
fire for persisting with analog systems - and effectively holding on to
what was a captive audience - when most information vendors were switching
to, or at least offering customers the option of, digital datafeeds. However,
Reuters - and to a lesser extent Quick (analog feeds still dominate Japanese
front offices) - now offer customers digital feeds of information. <BR>
<BR>
Few traders and investment managers rely totally on raw data: they also
require easy and immediate access to analytical information with which to
make informed trading and investment decisions. <BR>
<BR>
Glenn Bedwin, associate director of research products and marketing at Datastream
International - which supplies Datastream PreView, a front office decision
support and analytical system - makes the point that there is a world of
difference between data and information: &quot;The trouble is that people
in the front office are being overwhelmed with data, when what they want
is information.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In this sense, data refers to the constant stream of prices and news which
appear on a trader's screen; information refers to the data once it has
been analyzed and interpreted. <BR>
<BR>
Vanessa Johnston, investment operations manager of Hill Samuel Investment
Management in London, also draws a distinction between data and information.
She sees performance attribution as increasingly important in the investment
management industry, and suggests that this is already an essential analytical
resource and, ultimately, an important element of decision support. Performance
attribution differs from performance measurement in that the source of the
better-than-average performance is what matters, rather than the performance
itself. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If an investment manager knows where that crucially important better-than-average
performance came from,&quot; she says, &quot;there is all the more likelihood
that he will be able to repeat it, or do even better next time.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Johnston is also a keen believer in decision support systems. &quot;Investment
management is a sophisticated skill,&quot; she says. &quot;Technology isn't
a substitute for that skill. However, I believe maximum competitiveness
can only be achieved if you have a decision support system in place which
accommodates the styles of different fund managers and the requirements
of the portfolios they manage. It must also allow the integration and fully-customized
screen display of the widest range of information.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Decision support systems can be categorized by the extent to which they
contribute to the decision-making process. <BR>
<BR>
This hierarchy is not an indicator of how effective each decision support
service is at making money for the trader or investment manager. With the
exception of full indexation replication, whichever service a user chooses,
it simply provides assistance: it does not make the decision. But clearly
the quality of the decision depends on the quality of information upon which
it is based. Once an approach to investment has been chosen, it is essential
to have the best technological support. <BR>
<BR>
The problem is keeping abreast of the latest developments. John Perry, product
marketing manager of Dow Jones Telerate - which in addition to being a major
supplier of financial information also sells an integrated front office
trading platform, the Telerate Trading Room System - sees three main trends
for the future of the front office. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Firstly, on-board computing power will continue to increase at the
same pace as it has in the past,&quot; he says. &quot;PC workstations are
already powerful enough to run most decision support systems. I expect the
power of these workstations to double every couple of years or so, giving
traders and investors access to ever more powerful systems. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Secondly, digital feeds will score a complete victory over analog
information. Thirdly, we will see much more integration of front and back
office functionality, with front office players winding up having screen-based
real-time access to all the back office information they need to carry out
their tasks with maximum efficiency - particularly information relating
to the current status of the transactions they have initiated. Similarly,
front office price information will be instantly available to back office
staff.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The day is fast approaching when the separation of the front and back office
information systems will be regarded as inefficient - particularly, as traders
and investors continue to streamline their activities and make more and
more use of their in-house decision support information. <BR><BR>
<H3>The decision support hierarchy </H3>
<B>Historical price displays in tabular form</B> <BR>
<BR>
This is the lowest level of decision support. Historical price data are
simply presented chronologically in tables. Many users download this type
of information into spreadsheets where it can be manipulated and analyzed.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Historical price displays in graph form</B> <BR>
<BR>
Graph displays allow users to see at a glance how prices have fluctuated
over a period of time. <BR>
<BR>
There is a wide range of graph displays available, as well as a broad range
of colours and plottings. <BR>
<BR>
The world's major vendor of historical information is Datastream International,
although most real-time vendors also offer historical information - sometimes
bought in from Datastream. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Multi-window configurations providing customized information displays
</B><BR>
<BR>
One of the most significant developments in decision support systems during
the past five years has been the rapid growth in the availability of windows-based
systems. Microsoft Windows is the most widely used software, although this
is by no means the only windows product available. Windows-based systems
allow a number - usually no more than 10 - of windows of information to
be displayed on a screen at any one time. The windows can contain different
types of information, such as real-time and historical price information
and news, from different sources, in different formats (tabular, text or
graph). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Risk management systems</B> <BR>
<BR>
The potential for winning a competitive advantage by integrating front and
back office functions is one of the most important issues currently facing
financial institutions' IT directors. It is widely recognized that one area
(but by no means the only one) where such integration is of particular importance
is that of risk management. <BR>
<BR>
Information which contributes to an organization's risk management profile
is inevitably a combination of front office information (such as the current
valuations of portfolios, the spread of holdings and the positions across
various industry sectors) and back office information (such as the credit
position of various clients, the up-to-date clearing and settlement situation
on transactions and the institution's overall exposure). <BR>
<BR>
It is perfectly acceptable for a front office decision support system to
provide only the risk management information which originates in the front
office. However, if this type of system is to have maximum effectiveness,
it should ideally give the front office player (and senior management) access
to risk management information that originates both in the front and back
offices. <BR>
<BR>
Several vendors supply powerful risk management packages. One of the market
leaders in this respect is the Chicago-based David Bruce &amp; Company which
supplies products for the risk management of equity, fixed-income and currency
holdings, and to support trading. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Technical analysis systems</B> <BR>
<BR>
Technical analysis is based on the theory that future price and index movements
can be predicted by analyzing the historical performance of investment instruments
and financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
Despite sounding like financial astrology, technical analysis systems are
becoming an increasingly respectable form of decision support. The trouble
is that there are numerous technical analysis systems and choosing between
them is difficult. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What is absolutely essential&quot;, says Fred Stafford, managing director
of the UK-based Investment Data Services, &quot;is that you stick to what
you choose and have faith in it. What you mustn't do is waver between different
systems. After all, if you mix together different colours, you get a dull
shade of grey that is not at all special and nobody wants a technical analysis
that is not special.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Quantitative analysis systems</B> <BR>
<BR>
These are decision support systems based on one or more of a wide range
of theories relating to portfolio diversification, such as the risk and
return accruable from individual financial and trading instruments and entire
portfolios. <BR>
<BR>
Quantitative analysis draws on both fundamental and technical analysis.
In that it looks carefully at the expected returns from (and risk of) owning
an instrument, it makes use of fundamental factors. In that it assumes that
future returns and risks can be extrapolated from previous returns and the
risk involved in obtaining those returns, it can be said to draw on technical
analysis. <BR>
<BR>
An increasing number of organizations, known as &quot;quants&quot;, supply
data for quantitative analysis, or manage funds according to quantitative
principles. Among the best known are the international organizations Barra
and Barr Rosenberg, both of which were formed by Barr Rosenberg, a leading
US financial markets expert. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems</B> <BR>
<BR>
AI systems make use of special computer programmes which are designed to
replicate the human decision-making process. The majority of AI systems
make use either of rule-based programmes (which aim to embody the logical
&quot;rules&quot; governing some elements of the human decision-making process)
or neural nets (self-teaching programs which once taught to match one set
of inputs to a set of outputs, can create a new set of outputs for each
new set of inputs). <BR>
<BR>
Although AI systems promise a high level of decision support power, they
have suffered something of a setback in recent years. There was a great
deal of hype in the mid to late 1980s but a history of failed or abandoned
systems has not endeared AI to users. It is doubtful whether there are more
than a few working decision support systems in traders' and investment managers'
offices which make sole use of AI. However, AI is used fairly widely to
fortify other decision support services with a dash of simulated human decision-making.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Indexation systems involving weighting or tilting or full index replication</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Indexation is a different type of trading and investment strategy to active
trading and investment. Indexation involves basing a portfolio on a given
market index. Indexation clearly represents the highest level of decision
support power because in the indexation process, by definition, human decision
making skills are not needed. However, this only applies where full index
replication is used. Where weighting and tilting are used, there is still
some residual decision making.<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
<H2>Forward-thinking back offices </H2>
If you think back office systems are boring, then think again. Earlier this
year, Salomon Brothers was reported to have incurred accounting losses of
$278 million. Sources close to Salomon Brothers - the investment bank does
not return phone calls regarding this matter - blame the losses on an antiquated
back office accounting system which has since been greatly improved. <BR>
<BR>
The $1.1 billion loss recently incurred by Daiwa is also believed to have
been due to an inadequate back office system which em-bodied decentralized
accounting procedures that prevented the institution from getting a complete
overview of its risk position. Daiwa's activities in the US have been terminated
by the US government. The Japanese government is also applying pressure
on the institution, although Daiwa has the financial muscle to survive the
catastrophic loss. <BR>
<BR>
Not every bank is so lucky. Whatever part Nick Leeson played, there is little
doubt now that Barings' collapse was substantially due to its losing control
of its overall risk management position: control that could have readily
been provided by an efficient back office system that provided senior managers
with detailed information about the true position. <BR>
<BR>
This lack of information meant that the scale of Barings' losses went unnoticed
until it was too late. The segregation of front and back office responsibilities
and stricter back office reporting procedures could have helped prevent
the crisis. <BR>
<BR>
And don't forget Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank whose demise was
substantially caused by a lone trader who got away with reporting - and
earning vast commissions on - profits he had not made. Once again, effective
back office monitoring could have saved Kidder Peabody. <BR>
<BR>
What these cases show is that, quite apart from its essential role as the
administrative and accounting heart of an institution, a properly managed
back office can be an effective weapon in detecting fraud or rogue trading.
It is true that not every back office problem leads to disastrous losses,
or the collapse of a long-established financial institution, but in an increasingly
competitive environment, any loss resulting from back office inefficiencies
could compromise an institution's competitive edge. <BR>
<BR>
A front office may have the best traders in the business, access to raw
financial data and decision support information from every key market in
the world, but if the back office is inefficient, the skill and intuition
of the traders is undermined. The front office can only be a profit centre
if the back office support is so reliable that traders don't spend their
time worrying about whether their trades will be properly reconciled and
managed. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, there are still too many institutions which underestimate
the importance of their back office operations. This is partly because of
the unglamorous nature of back office activities, when compared with the
frenetic cut and thrust of the dealing room, and partly because of the perception
that the back office does not make money for the organization. <BR>
<BR>
Chris Rees, a senior partner in financial services at management consultancy
Touche Ross, says: &quot;An institution's top management can readily relate
to the need to provide traders with the technological tools that help them
make money, but they tend towards the view that all you can achieve in a
back office is that it does its job properly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At one level, this view is understandable. Traders and clients expect a
back office to do what it's supposed to do, and aren't inclined to give
it any credit when it does. After all, you either settle on T+5 or you don't.
<BR>
<BR>
However, the notion that there is no competitive edge to be gained from
the routine activities undertaken by the back office is at best questionable
and at worst absurd. Institutions - and IT managers - who dismiss the importance
of back office operations fail to understand two fundamental points. First,
it is often in the back office that the first telltale signs of fraud, or
disastrous trading, are detected. Second, because of the broad scope of
activities undertaken in the back office, it provides the institution with
as much financial and competitive muscle as the front office. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from the negotiation and execution of trades, every other function
belongs to the back office. Some institutions have raised certain back office
activities to what they call the middle office, but this still does not
recognize the fact that administrative functions can be a potential source
of competitive edge. <BR>
<BR>
Typical back office activities include: <BR>
<BR>
- calculation of realized gains and losses <BR>
<BR>
- cash handling <BR>
<BR>
- clearing and settlement <BR>
<BR>
- client accounting <BR>
<BR>
- credit limit monitoring/credit scoring <BR>
<BR>
- custody <BR>
<BR>
- fixed income amortization <BR>
<BR>
- general accounting <BR>
<BR>
- general ledger <BR>
<BR>
- income processing <BR>
<BR>
- position-keeping (typically carried out on a cost/market value basis)
<BR>
<BR>
- reconciliation <BR>
<BR>
- financial, management and statutory reporting <BR>
<BR>
- risk management <BR>
<BR>
- sales/management information <BR>
<BR>
- taxation <BR>
<BR>
- trade recording/tracking status of trades <BR>
<BR>
A quick glance at this list reveals how the back office can offer more than
just operational efficiency. The straightforward processing of transactions
may offer little scope for customization, but other activities, such as
custody and risk management, provide a real opportunity for differentiation.
The plethora of value-added services which custodians offer their clients
nowadays is proof of this. <BR>
<BR>
As for risk management, Kevin Merz, president and founder of New York-based
consultancy Enterprise Technology Corporation (ETC), comments: &quot;It
is essential an institution has an accurate and complete picture of its
total exposure to market and credit conditions. Without this, complete disaster
can easily occur, as the cases of Barings and Daiwa have shown. The only
way to do this is to work off a centralized asset and liability database
located in an efficient back office.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On closer examination, the back office starts to look less like a dull repository
of accounting and administrative information and more like a place where
critical decisions can be made. <BR>
<BR>
Marc Earl, who has a wide-ranging project management responsibility at Paribas
Capital Markets in London, is adamant that back office activities - in particular,
risk management - offer real scope for achieving competitive edge. &quot;As
soon as a trader completes a transaction, it becomes part of the bank's
entire risk management matrix,&quot; says Earl. &quot;At Paribas, we have
a policy of organizing support resources such as risk management across
the whole organization. The back office ... must be a flexible and dynamic
business centre in its own right.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So how do you build a back office system that has any chance of living up
to those great expectations? Obviously, you need to automate, but automating
the back office is easier said than done. One thing is clear from the outset:
the range of functions undertaken in even the most straightforward back
office means that no single computer system will have a chance of doing
the job. What is needed is a centralized system which efficiently integrates
and links a range of single-function systems. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bespoke or off the shelf?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The idea of developing a system from scratch may be intimidating, but hardly
more so than the cost involved. A multi-currency, real-time, fully-integrated
system for a large back office could cost as much as $50 million. Even a
system for a medium-sized bank could cost up to $10 million. <BR>
<BR>
The alternative to building a bespoke system is to buy an off-the-shelf
solution. The major vendors of back office systems offer integrated packages
which are constantly being updated and are built on open computer platforms
that allow updates to be plugged in and operational within tight time frames.
<BR>
<BR>
The cost of these packages is considerably less than the cost of building
a system from scratch. Few packages cost more than $2 million, even for
a very large bank, and a medium-sized bank could obtain a comprehensive
package for about $500,000. <BR>
<BR>
Off-the-shelf packages can be customized and, in practice, the vast majority
are, but a customized system is never as exclusive as a bespoke system.
The decision whether to develop a bespoke system or use a package is one
of the most important technology decisions facing an institution. Not only
the operational costs but also the level of competitive advantage attainable
- quite likely for many years to come - will depend on the outcome. <BR>
<BR>
Peter Robin, general manager of European financial services at IBM UK, believes
that the days of the back office package are coming to an end. &quot;If
you look closely at most package vendors' operations, what you notice is
that while they have a large installed base - which on the whole they tend
to serve with efficiency and commitment - they're finding it difficult to
win new clients and aren't selling many new systems. I think the reason
for this is clear: institutions have come to realize that back office packages
are by no means always as suitable for the institution's needs as the vendors
are fond of claiming.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another drawback of packages, according to Robin, is the frequent inability
of individual elements of the system to &quot;talk&quot; with one another
effectively. &quot;All too often&quot;, he says, &quot;what should in effect
be a discussion between system elements that all speak the same language
is in reality a Tower of Babel.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For Rees at Touche Ross, the decision to go for a package or a bespoke system
depends primarily on the size of the institution. Larger organizations generate
a level of complexity which a package may not be able to cope with. &quot;Bespoke
systems are so expensive nowadays that they are really only suitable for
the largest institutions - by which I mean those in the top 20% or so of
the sector by turnover. Smaller institutions should certainly look seriously
at packages.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, many institutions which do opt for packages have difficulty
achieving the level and breadth of functionality they require and by the
time they realize this, they are often committed and it isn't easy to extricate
themselves. It is advisable for institutions to trial packages first and
be ruthless about discarding them if they fail to perform to expectations.
<BR>
<BR>
Is it always worthwhile customizing? Only if the unmodified package already
meets 80% of the desired functionality, says Rees. &quot;If the package
isn't able to provide this 80% of functionality before any modification
has taken place&quot;, says Rees, &quot;it isn't worth taking the trouble
to modify it, or going to the expense of doing so.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Not all consultants, however, accept that bespoke systems are necessarily
extremely expensive and, therefore, only suitable for the largest institutions.
&quot;At ETC, we pride ourselves on being able to bring in complex, integrated,
bespoke back office systems at a fraction of the generally accepted cost,&quot;
says Merz. &quot;We keep our team small, focused and only use chiefs, not
Indians. We ensure we have a clear and precise specification of the final
system at every stage of the system development life-cycle and where a process
needs re-engineering, we re-engineer it before we start to think of how
that process could be turned into computer code.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He insists that most bespoke system projects take too long, cost too much,
have no clear vision of how the final system should perform, and suffer
from a fatal flaw - that processes are not carefully re-engineered before
the automation process starts. <BR>
<BR>
It was the lack of re-engineering of the antiquated London Stock Exchange
procedures that was blamed by many observers for the collapse of what was
arguably the most ambitious bespoke back office system ever built: the London
Stock Exchange's automated clearing and settlement system Taurus. <BR>
<BR>
The Taurus project cost &#163;200 million before finally collapsing under
the weight of its own ambitions. Taurus is a warning to any institution
thinking of developing its own bespoke back office system - not only is
it extremely expensive, but there is a risk that the system may not be completed.
<BR>
<BR>
For Martin Regan, head of research and marketing at package vendor MTI Abraxsys
Systems, this is a principal reason for using a package. &quot;A substantial
proportion of bespoke systems get abandoned during the development stage,&quot;
says Regan. &quot;On the other hand, the institution can adopt a package
with several levels of confidence: confidence that the package will be implemented
rapidly; that it will have been in effect tried and tested by other customers
and will do the job it is supposed to do, possibly after subsequent customization;
that it won't contain bugs or program design errors that can be damaging;
and that it will come with a reasonable price tag.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
While it is advisable to adopt a healthy cynicism when evaluating the effectiveness
of a package, it should be borne in mind that once a vendor has designed
a system, it will continue to develop and improve it. <BR>
<BR>
Vincent O'Toole, sales director of Kindle, which sells a wholesale banking
back office system called Bankmaster, explains: &quot;Bankmaster is not
a static entity but a package which has been evolving continuously for 15
years. It is designed by a process that interprets an institution's functional
requirements in terms of a set of programme elements which can readily be
enhanced to accommodate the institution's changing requirements. For example,
an institution might start by trading a relatively small number of instruments
and need back office support for those activities. Later, as its trading
business broadens, it will be trading more instruments and need support
for those, too. If it had built a bespoke system to trade the smaller number
of instruments, the system would have required extensive and expensive modification
when the institution's trading parameters widened. If the institution had
chosen Bankmaster, however, the enhancement process would have been rapid,
painless and relatively inexpensive.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
David Carruthers, marketing and international director of International
Banking Information Systems (IBIS) adds: &quot;An institution which is adamant
about building its own bespoke system has to ask itself how many ways there
are of handling the vast majority of activities which have to be handled
in the back office. The answer is that in most cases there is only one way
of handling them. Package vendors have designed effective systems for automating
this handling process: why bother spending far more money than is necessary
- incurring the risk of non-completion - in order to reinvent the wheel?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Ultimately, the package-versus-bespoke debate is more straightforward than
it first appears. In most cases, the bespoke system is best suited to the
very largest institutions. Otherwise, customized packages do the job perfectly,
cost less and are easily enhanced. <BR>
<BR>
When the central and eastern European banks needed to rapidly convert the
focus of their back office operations from planned economy to market economy,
they did so - and continue to do so - using packages rather than bespoke
systems. IBIS, Midas-Kapiti's Equation, Midas's Bankmaster, and MTI's Abraxsys
have proved popular in these burgeoning financial centres. <BR>
<BR>
Alex Dembitz, founder of international IT consultancy IDOM Consultants,
says: &quot;Before opting for a particular packaged solution, we carry out
a stringent vetting process to match the bank's needs to the right package.
We regard our task as to provide our clients with competitive advantage,
and it is a mark of the quality of the packages available that we can achieve
this with a customized package rather than with a fully bespoke system.&quot;
(The Geneva-based consultancy nowadays has more than 350 consultants implementing
packages in central and eastern European banks, and is a market leader in
providing IT consultancy to Hungarian banks). <BR>
<BR>
Where are back office systems heading in the future? According to IBM's
Robin, new types of state-of-the-art technology - including voice recognition
in identity checking, closed Internet groups and improved database technology
- will be implemented in the back office as soon as the technology becomes
reliable and cost-effective. &quot;Front and back office integration in
real time will undoubtedly become increasingly important in the future.
The point is that much of the information generated by the back office -
management information, all types of reporting information, position information
and risk management information - is as useful to front office traders as
it is to general management. Front office traders will often be able to
do their jobs better if they have access to it. Some institutions are already
starting to put this integration into practice. Other major future developments
will be increased dematerialization of documentation and records. Taurus's
successor, Crest - which is a fully dematerialized system - will inevitably
speed dematerialization further when it comes on stream in 1996.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As well as providing a competitive edge, improved management information
can also reduce one of the biggest risks facing any financial institution:
the danger that a rogue trader - or even a fraudster - could hide a worsening
position until disaster strikes. Worried senior managers hoping that official
legislation will minimize the chances of their institution becoming another
Barings or Daiwa would do as well to look closer to home and ensure that
their back office systems are as effective as possible. <p>

<H3>INTERVIEW</H3>
<H2>Lord Trichet of Maastricht </H2>
No-one is more closely associated with the fortunes - and misfortunes -
of European monetary cooperation than Jean-Claude Trichet. As director of
the French treasury from 1988 to 1993 and then as governor of the newly
independent Banque de France he has above all else embodied the policy of
a strong French currency, the <I>franc fort</I>. Now he believes that France
is firmly on track to meet the Maastricht criteria on economic convergence
(1) by the end of 1996, and that Europe's economic and monetary union (Emu)
as projected in the Maastricht treaty will go ahead on January 1 1999. <BR>
<BR>
For Trichet the treaty is paramount. It doesn't need fixing, only interpreting,
in order to bring all the snags and obstacles to Emu under its copious and
flexible umbrella. Trichet's view is fundamentalist and orthodox. He also
has confidence that the markets - as they are fed decisions and information
- will achieve, without panics and upsets, a smooth transition to fixed
exchange rates. <BR>
<BR>
For his critics, however, Trichet embodies something else - the elitist
arrogance of the &eacute;narque (graduate of France's top academy, the &Eacute;cole
Nationale de l'Administration). One of his severest critics - former European
Commission employee Bernard Connolly - accuses Trichet of bad economics,
using &quot;competitive disinflation&quot; with the aim of undercutting
France's rivals in Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM). In fact, argues
Connolly, this competitive disinflation was &quot;a recession-creating juggernaut
that imposed crushingly high real interest rates on low-inflation (virtuous)
countries and inevitably led to an explosion of the budget deficit&quot;.
Trichet, according to Connolly's analysis, is a leading apologist for what
he calls a &quot;doomsday machine&quot;, set in motion in 1983 and still
rolling. Trichet talked to David Shirreff, applauding the robustness of
the ERM and insisting that the Maastricht treaty is well designed and equipped
with every necessary tactical weapon. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>
<B>Hasn't the EU'S exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) proved ineffective as a glidepath to monetary union?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
No. The exchange rate mechanism has been much more robust than is generally
assessed. Seven of its currencies have not been realigned between themselves
for more than eight-and-a-half years, many of them turbulent ones. At this
very moment, 10 currencies out of 15 - two-thirds of the EU - are in the
exchange rate mechanism and have remained in it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Would you say that the ERM needs an anchor, a guiding currency?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The exchange rate mechanism in our eyes is a multilateral system which is
based on a convergence on the best performance and the best performer whoever
it is. <BR>
<BR>
<B>With the transition from the ERM to the single currency, won't there
be a lack of financial instruments, particularly hedging instruments, in
the new currency at the moment of its birth, meaning there will be a very
thin market?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It seems to me that the essence of the market is as always to solve practically
all problems which are posed. Of course it is a transition of the first
magnitude that consists of converging a number of currencies in the single
currency, but I don't see any difficulty for an enlarged market to perform
satisfactorily in its new environment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>At some point before monetary union, the central banks are practically
going to have to make that commitment, aren't they? They will have to announce
what that exchange rate will be.</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is not the central banks' sole responsibility. It would be one of the
major decisions taken by the governments and their central banks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you think they will take the central parity rate of the ERM at a time
before monetary union and say this is the rate and we will support it absolutely,
or would they be more likely to say that we will take the rate at midnight
on December 31 1998?</B> <BR>
<BR>
That is a good question. One spontaneous response would be that of course
it would be the simplest way. And I would say that I have a strong preference
for that solution. Anyway the matter will be raised in due time and I don't
expect any major difficulty. <BR>
<BR>
<B>As soon as a date is announced, won't there be speculation against that
date?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The date is already announced of course. January 1 1999. <BR>
<BR>
<B>But as we get closer to that date isn't there likely to be extreme speculation
just before the final fixing?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I know that there is a lot of meditation on this particular question. My
personal feeling is that it will again be a problem that is solved very
easily. Because what appears to be theoretical and abstract today will appear
more and more clear and likely when we approach the deadline. And what I
expect is an easy crystallization - the market itself going in the appropriate
direction. <BR>
<BR>
<B>At the moment of transition to a single currency, some of the ERM currencies
will be left outside. Won't there be pressure on those second-tier currencies
as we reach that date?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is a very important question. And it is an open question, because the
treaty doesn't say in detail what would be the appropriate relationship
between the single currency itself and the other currencies within the EU
within the single market. My own understanding is that when you belong to
a single market you should normally be part of an exchange rate mechanism.
A single market must have some kind of monetary arrangements. The Treaty
of Rome was very clear on that: in Article 107 it said that exchange rate
relations are a matter of common interest. Now you can see that we have
not given a definite solution to the problem. But when we have the single
currency we will have to confirm that approach. If you are in the single
market you belong to some kind of exchange rate mechanism of course, while
waiting to get into a single currency area, when the criteria are met and
everything is on board for those who would be what you call the second tier.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some think there should continue to be a basket Ecu, with the single
currency as a block inside the basket.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Yes, it is always possible to continue to have a basket Ecu, if it is a
construction of the market itself. <BR>
<BR>
<B>It could not be the legal successor of today's basket Ecu?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The legal successor to the Ecu will be the single currency. <BR>
<BR>
<B>If Britain is outside monetary union, could you see London banks, say,
leading French government bond issues from London?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I would not like to make the working assumption of the single currency starting
without Britain, or to ask myself what would be the position of the London
marketplace. It seems to me that it is not a question to be put to me. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Let's assume that the UK is in. Would you be happy if the French government
bond market and all the major issuing houses and trading houses moved to
London?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Certainly not. With or without the single currency, it seems to me nothing
but natural that the base for issuing the French government bond is Paris,
and Frankfurt for the German government bond. All the conceptual framework
of the Emu (economic and monetary union) is based upon a constellation of
financial marketplaces. And we are not in favour - it seems there is a consensus
on this - of a concentration on a single marketplace of all the liquidity
and all the financial activity of Europe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Won't there be a disruption as member countries with outstanding high-coupon
bonds are tempted to refinance them in the lower-coupon single currency?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
It seems to me by definition that the value of the bonds will take account
of the market interest rates of the Ecu denomination, so I don't think it
will change anything. Maybe they could refinance their debt with lower nominal
interest rates but they will have to buy back their bonds at a higher price.
The list of the currencies that will be in the single-currency area would
be set approximately a year before the effective merging of the currency.
That period of time will suffice to avoid a brutal transition. A problem
of the kind you are mentioning is solved very easily by the market itself.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>It might force the market towards short-termism. If there is uncertainty
about which currencies will be in and what the final exchange rates will
be, it may be difficult to refinance beyond January 1 1999?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The market functions permanently by assessing situations. The idea that
there is a brutal moment and a brutal transition is not necessarily the
appropriate working assumption. Since there are objective criteria and since
we're living in a world of global transparency it will become more and more
clear who's likely to be out. As time passes it will be clearer what is
likely to happen. A decision is taken which crystallizes something that
has already seemed probable. A rabbit isn't suddenly going to be pulled
out of a hat. This is likely to happen more smoothly than perhaps has been
forecast. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are there some instances where consumers could claim they have been hit
unfairly by monetary union - for example, holders of seasoned fixed-rate
mortages in a national currency whose coupon was once much higher than that
of the single currency? <BR>
<BR>
</B>It seems to me that it is exactly the same hazard that would lead mortgage
holders in a certain unnamed country to protest against their government
because it has been more disciplined than expected, had a much better fiscal
behaviour, and had put the country in a very strong and solid position.
I can't see that you can sue your government because it's behaving so properly
that the currency becomes a very good and solid one. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Some bankers have asked for a guarantee from governments or national
central banks to neutralize the risk that their currency will devalue and
pull out of monetary union after the event. Would you agree there is a need
for that kind of guarantee?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I would say there is absolutely no point. As soon as we are in the single-currency
area we have an irrevocable exchange rate between the various national currencies
and the single currency - there will be no problem exchanging the various
national currencies between themselves or with the single currency. It would
be the duty of the ESCB [European System of Central Banks] precisely to
take care of all that. I see absolutely no problem according to my understanding
of the treaty itself. <BR>
<BR>
<B>If I was in Austria and I had some French francs, presumably a bank might
charge me to change them into Austrian currency. Would there be sanctions
to stop a quasi-exchange rate differential from developing?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The central banks everywhere would exchange the national currencies without
any limit and with the exact parity that will be decided. May I quote article
52 of the ESCB statutes: &quot;Following the irrevocable fixing of exchange
rates, the governing council shall take the necessary measures to ensure
that banknotes denominated in currencies with irrevocably fixed exchange
rates are exchanged by the national central banks at their respective par
values.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>How much supervision and how much control should the European Central
Bank (ECB) have over the liquidity and the health of banks in the various
countries? <BR>
<BR>
</B>The subsidiarity principle has been the rule of the game for supervision,
given that the systems of supervision are not the same in London, in Berlin,
or in Paris, not to mention all the other places. So it is not designed
in the Maastricht treaty that we have to change the supervision. Banking
supervision remains the responsibility of the national central banks or
other national entities. Of course the ESCB will have to perform its duty
in terms of liquidity and overall surveillance. More generally the ESCB
may offer advice to the competent authorities on matters relating to the
prudential supervision of the financial system. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you think that national central banks are going to have quite an argument
about what monetary instruments the European Central Bank should use?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
It is one of our very important work topics - to agree on the appropriate
monetary instruments for the ECB and to be sure that we have the best use
of the best instruments possible. The EMI [European Monetary Institute]
is doing a very good job, with the help of all the central banks of the
EU. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are minimum reserves likely to be included?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I think they must be there as a potential tool. Of course, where you draw
the line, and where you put the level of reserves is another question. But
the minimum reserve requirement must be present as a possible tool. It is
in the treaty itself. <BR>
<BR>
<B>So, they will be there and they could be zero?</B> I will not comment
on that. <B>The British and Danes have an opt-out of monetary union, and
the Germans have a vote in the Bundestag, which could be seen as an opt-out.
Is France totally committed to monetary union, or does it, like the UK,
Denmark and Germany with their opt-outs, have a political escape route?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't say the Germans have an opt-out. I don't think that is the way
they look at it; but it is not for me to respond in their place. The UK
and Denmark are the two countries which have an opt-out. As for France,
it is for the government to respond to that question. But France does not
have any opt-out and France will apply the rules and see that the criteria
are very well met - as the president of the Republic said himself - and
will go along with the single currency when the time comes, namely January
1 1999. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are the Maastricht criteria, requiring convergence to a fiscal deficit
of 3% of GDP, and a gross debt of 60% of GDP, absolutes or are they negotiable?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
All the central bankers would respond to you that the treaty must be implemented
and the criteria must be met fully and according to the treaty itself. And
they will tell you that one has to read the treaty carefully and see exactly
what it says regarding the 3% criterion and the 60% criterion. I am only
sure of one thing: that France meets the 60% criterion without any problem
and that we <I>will</I> meet the 3% criterion. But the wording is not exactly
the same for the 3% criterion as for the 60% criterion.<B><I> </I></B><I>[Note:
The Maastricht treaty (article </I>104C<I>) is firm on the 3% ratio of budget
deficit to gdp but for the 60% ratio of gross government debt to gdp it
allows for a &quot;subtantial and continuous&quot; movement downwards.]</I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you think that the funding of state pensions will become a discussion
point when measuring how prepared countries are?<BR>
<BR>
</B>I think it is a very important matter for all countries concerned, and
it is a key element of economic policy, but I don't think it is incorporated
in the Maastricht criteria. The Maastricht criteria don't cover everything
- that goes without saying. There are a lot of other elements, and it seems
to me fortunate that the criteria do <I>not</I> cover everything. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are the various sanctions foreseen in the treaty, to punish countries
that are not sticking to the Maastricht criteria, enough, or should some
other market-driven mechanisms be devised?</B> <BR>
<BR>
In the treaty we have a number of tools to ensure that all the economies
in the single-currency area behave properly. The treaty not only calls for
strong public recommendations regarding bad behaviour but it also permits
interruption of the payments of, for instance, structural funds. It also
calls, where appropriate, for non-interest-bearing deposits when an economy
is behaving improperly. And finally it permits the imposition of fines.
<BR>
<BR>
So there are a lot of instruments that are very important and do not exist
in the present federations - Germany, the US, and Switzerland, to quote
three exemplary federations. There are no such weapons at the disposal of
the federations regarding the cantons, the states or the L&auml;nder. In
the eyes of the treaty negotiators those tools were indispensable in a structure
in which the pseudo-federation would have a very small budget, but the budget
of the states, and the public entities of the states, would be enormous
by comparison. <BR>
<BR>
The problem we have still to work on is how do we utilize those tools, and
what would be the doctrine for their use? We can't be too specific at present
because it would be the responsibility of those in the single-currency area,
not the 15 [members of the EU]. The discussion on the doctrine is a major
responsibility for those governments. The real question is not whether the
treaty was well designed - it seems to me that it was very well designed
- but what will be the necessary doctrine for implementing the treaty. This
&quot;stability doctrine&quot;, which is often called a &quot;stability
pact&quot;, is embodied in the spirit and the letter of the Maastricht treaty
and will have to be clearly worked out. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Would banning the use of a country's bonds for discount or repo transactions
work as a punishment?</B> <BR>
<BR>
I don't think that is in the treaty. It seems to me that we have all the
weapons in the treaty, and the treaty does not say to what extent you could
impose fines, so you would have very large possibilities to exert maximum
pressure on the potentially badly behaved. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Could you see expulsion as an ultimate sanction?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Expulsion was not in the treaty. It does not seem to me that it is in. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>

The Maastricht convergence criteria are: <BR>
<BR>
1) Inflation should not exceed that of the three best-performing member
states by more than 1.5%; 2) The nominal long-term interest rate must not
exceed that of the three best-performing member states by more than 2%;
<BR>
3) The fiscal deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP; <BR>
4) The gross government debt must not exceed 60% of GDP; <BR>
5) The exchange rate must have respected the normal fluctuation margins
in the ERM for at least two years, without unilateral devaluation from the
central rate.<p>

<H3> <B>Eat or be eaten</B> </H3>

<H4> <B>The great shake-out in European banking has barely begun. But driven by
poor returns, overcapacity and fierce competition, a major consolidation in the
banking sector is inevitable. First it will happen within country borders and
then more slowly across them. Peter Lee reports on the coming turmoil</B> </H4>

<P> "Every bank in Europe is contemplating its strategy right now, which is a
euphemism for saying they are all thinking about either buying other banks or of
being bought themselves," says Keith Brown, head of the financial institutions
group (FIG) at Morgan Stanley International in London.

<P> Morgan Stanley's FIG team is the largest group of investment bankers within
the firm devoted to any one industry sector. That's typical of the major
investment banks. Partly because there are so many banks in Europe, partly
because banks are such active issuers of debt and equity, investment banks
traditionally have had more people covering banks than any other industry sector.
But, increasingly, it is also because of the prospects for M&amp;A deals.

<P> Dozens of would-be M&amp;A deal-makers are scurrying around Europe, pitching
all manner of acquisitions, sales and mergers to their commercial and retail
banking clients. These are touted as the solution to a series of serious
challenges which are preying on the minds of Europe's top bankers: low economic
growth and weak loan demand which will make it hard for banks to grow their
earnings; the requirement for massive investment in technology; strong
competition from other banks and non-bank financial services providers; the
imminent creation of a single currency bloc. The need to face up to these
challenges, the poor returns which so many publicly-quoted banks have provided to
their shareholders and the industry's notorious overcapacity in many countries
all suggest that a considerable consolidation should take place over the next few
years.

<P> The process is already well under way among the continent's smaller, weaker
banks, especially in the countries that are most over-banked, and have been
hardest hit by recession and bad-loan problems such as Switzerland. Its banks
found themselves over-exposed to a crashing domestic property market in the early
1990s. The number of financial institutions in Switzerland fell from a peak of
631 in 1989 to 494 by 1994. Most of the casualties have been small regional and
cantonal banks, many of which have been bought by the big three private banks in
virtual rescues. Swiss Bank Corp has acquired 13 such banks since 1991, UBS nine
and Credit Suisse seven. In Germany, a similar process of mergers between the
country's small savings and cooperative banks is proceeding.

<P> At the opposite end of the scale, investment bankers have kept themselves
busy on a number of much larger deals announced over the last 18 months, such as
the UK purchases by Lloyds Bank of TSB (worth $15.315 billion) and Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester Building Society ($2.87 billion); Cr&eacute;dit Agricole's
acquisition of Banque Indosuez ($1.22 billion); Credito Italiano's purchase of
Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo ($2.34 billion); Unitas's purchase of
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki ($827 million); G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque's
purchase of Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Bank Nederland ($731 million); and the
forthcoming deal between Cr&eacute;dit Local de France and Cr&eacute;dit Communal
de Belgique.

<P> One top-ranked analyst of the American banking industry detects symptoms of
the M&amp;A fever that has gripped US banks, breaking out in Europe. In 1994, his
team covered 48 major bank holding companies in the US. By the end of this
century, he expects that to be down to 11. "Eventually, the forces shaping US
banking will hit Europe. For the moment, American banks have a greater appetite
for cost savings from mergers than Europeans. But everyone wants cost savings.
And what we learned in the north-east of this country last year was that as soon
as one big deal happens, others quickly follow. Within a few months there were 16
transactions worth $40 billion." He concludes: "As soon as you dislodge one big
bank in Europe, everyone else is up for grabs."

<P> For the foreseeable future, European banks face slow economic growth in their
home markets, low inflation and low interest rates, all making it difficult to
grow assets. And because they find it hard to contain costs, margins will likely
contract. Banks might improve their reported earnings by taking back bad debt
reserves as their asset quality improves. But they can pull that trick off only
once or twice, and many already have. This means they must look to one or more of
their cost structures, their market share or their product lines to generate
earnings growth.

<P> Germany, like Switzerland, has large numbers of very small banks. The
<I>sparkassen</I>, or savings banks, have one or two branches in small towns
across the country with a typical balance sheet of perhaps Dm2 billion ($1.35
billion). Customers are surprisingly loyal to these. One bank consultant recalls
being shocked to discover that the chief executive of one of Germany's largest
banks still has his own account at the small savings bank in his home town near
Stuttgart: the bank offers him very personal service and all the employees know
him. But there is a limit to what such banks can offer sophisticated customers,
who may demand international money transfer or savings and investment products
beyond the scope of the local savings banks.

<P> These banks are busily merging with each other. In 1993, there were 703
<I>sparkassen</I> in Germany. By the end of last year there were 626. At this
rate, analyst Claire Gouzouli of London-based First Consulting, who recently
reviewed the sector for a merchant banking client, expects there to be only 250
to 300 left by 2005. German credit cooperatives have survived with similar
old-fashioned loyalties: for example, butchers used to bank with the butchers'
cooperative bank. Cooperative banks, too, have consolidated at a steady rate. In
1989, there were 3,221. By the start of this year, the number had fallen to 2,600
and Gouzouli projects 1,000 to 1,200 will remain by 2005.

<P> <B>Unannounced marriages</B>

<P> Among the smaller banks, mergers happen out of the public gaze and rarely
make national news. A savings bank might retain tax advisers and lawyers, or seek
some help from its central landesbank in completing a merger, but it won't retain
a merchant bank adviser. The motive of most of these small banks in seeking a
merger or being acquired is simple: to ensure their survival.

<P> In most other countries in western Europe the number of banks is falling. In
France, the number of banks fell from 801 in 1990 to 626 in 1994; in the
Netherlands they declined over the same period from 153 to 127; in Italy from
1065 to 1,003; and in Spain from 362 to 314. In Belgium, the number actually grew
over this period, from 122 to 147, partly because of the entry of foreign banks
establishing a foothold in Europe. But the country has still seen some
consolidation. The number of bank branches has declined from 13,500 to 9,600.

<P> According to Andrew Chisholm, executive director in the financial
institutions group at Goldman Sachs: "Activity levels are up considerably over
several years ago. There was a flurry of Scandinavian, Spanish and Dutch  deals
in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Recently we have seen, and continue to expect,
a more consistent level of activity across markets."

<P> It's not hard to trace the reason for that activity. In recent years the
banking business in many countries in Europe has become less and less profitable.
In Germany, the average return on equity across the banking industry was 21% in
1984. Today it stands at 11.8%. Gouzouli at First Consulting has collated
statistics from central banks across Europe, focusing on the broad measure of
return on assets for each national banking industry. Using a 1% return as a
reasonable benchmark target, the statistics reveal an alarming decline.

<P> Philippe Sacerdot, executive director at SBC Warburg, agrees that banks are
having to adjust to a new reality: "Previously, banks have always assumed that
they were in a cyclical business in terms of costs. But now they must realize
that with a more volatile revenue line and no growth (in the best case), then,
like any other manufacturer, they must develop an awareness of costs." He adds:
"They do not have 10 years left in which to do this. I detect a new sense of
urgency."

<P> In Germany the big three banks have held up reasonably well, with an ROA of
0.95% in 1991 falling to 0.79% in 1994. But the ROA for the whole German banking
industry was 0.49% in 1994; the average was brought down partly by struggling
foreign banks, and mainly by landesbanks and other public banks that have not
been operated to maximize profits.

<P> In Spain the ROAs of the commercial banks have fallen from 1.53% in 1990 to
0.69% five years later; the average ROE has fallen from 10% to 5%. In Italy the
average ROA for commercial and savings banks was 0.58% in 1990 and turned
negative in 1994. Its banking industry appears to be the most backward among the
larger European countries. While banks elsewhere in Europe have been closing
branches, Italian banks have been opening them. Those mergers that have taken
place have been driven by the desire to acquire branch networks rather than to
cut overlap and save costs.

<P> Revealingly, in the Netherlands, scene of the biggest in-market
consolidations in Europe, average banking profitability has increased, with ROAs
rising from 0.38% in 1990 &#173; the year of the ABN Amro merger &#173; to 0.49%
by 1994. ROEs increased from 9.4% to 11.6% in the same period.

<P> Banks have already shown a propensity to try to buy their way out of this
problem. Last year, leading European commercial banks Swiss Bank Corp and
Dresdner Bank bought British merchant banks in an effort to build up their
revenues from capital markets and investment banking, while Deutsche Bank
undertook a massive build-up largely under its own steam. Commerzbank tried to
buy Smith New Court but was beaten to it by Merrill Lynch.

<P> In the jargon of M&amp;A advisers, these were product extension transactions:
wholesale and universal banks expanding into a business close to their own. But
that round of investments will not solve the banking industry's profitability
problem. HansPaul B&uuml;rkner, head of the Frankfurt office of the Boston
Consulting Group, points out that investment banks have grown their capital at
around 15% each year since 1990, while their top-line revenue growth has varied
from 7% to 12%. Meanwhile, partly because of the strong competition to hire
staff, their costs are growing. "So even to keep return on equity at today's
level, never mind grow it, something else has to give. In most other industries
&#173; consumer, investment goods &#173; the number of competitors is getting
smaller," says B&uuml;rkner.

<P> Banks have to strive to grow market share and cut costs. Around Europe, there
are signs that the level of takeover activity is set to increase. In-market
mergers are likely to predominate &#173; that is mergers and takeovers of banks
within the same country. In the UK, the country's old mutual building societies
&#173; most now either converted into banks or preparing to float publicly &#173;
are at the centre of this consolidation wave.

<P> Lloyds Bank struck a clever deal by buying Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the
most efficient, lowest-cost mortgage processor in the country. Now bankers wonder
whether the Halifax &#173; itself enlarged following merger with the Leeds
Building Society and likely to be valued at $10 billion when it floats next year
&#173; may become an acquirer. The Woolwich, Abbey National (now incorporating
the old National &amp; Provincial) and Northern Rock building societies may also
be takeover targets.

<P> The two big Scottish banks, Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland, are
perennial takeover possibilities, although strong nationalistic lobbying has been
mobilized against previous takeover threats. When Scottish life company Standard
Life came to dispose of a 32% holding in Bank of Scotland this summer, it chose a
widespread equity placement. That surprised some investment bankers who had
imagined a trade sale.

<P> In Germany rumours of possible deals are rife. Despite the powerful image of
the big German banks, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank combined have no more
than 12.8% of the German banking market. It is still one of the most fragmented
in Europe. Many banks operate on modest market share.

<P> It would make most sense for the large German private banks to acquire
savings banks and, with them, build larger retail networks, providing less
volatile earnings and fatter margins. Sadly, this is almost impossible. The
<I>sparkassen</I> typically carry a guarantee from the local municipality. The
municipalities argue that if the banks are privatized, they should not retain the
name of the local <I>sparkassen</I> because this carries with it the suggestion
of a guarantee to depositors that would no longer exist. But a large part of
these banks' attraction for potential acquirers is in their brand names and
customer relationships.

<P> There are other problems. The savings banks do not have paid-in capital. They
have guarantee capital. It is open to debate who actually owns them and who
should receive the proceeds of any sale to private banks: the local municipality,
the state or the federal government.

<P> Combinations involving the country's top five private banks &#173; Deutsche,
Commerzbank, Dresdner and the two Bavarians, Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypo-Bank
&#173; are more likely. Speculation heated up in July on the stock market and
within Frankfurt financial circles when Deutsche Bank announced it had
accumulated 5.2% of the shares of Bayerische Vereinsbank. It seems likely that
Deutsche's investment (of Dm500 million on which it will probably make a modest
single-digit return) was undertaken more to mark out its territory than to
prepare a takeover bid. By buying shares beyond 4.9%, it deliberately stepped
over the threshold requiring disclosure.

<P> A full acquisition would be difficult, with Bavarian politicians likely to
obstruct a Frankfurt takeover of a Munich bank. The same issue might arise if
German insurance giant Allianz ever tried to put together the two banks in which
it holds 25% stakes: Dresdner Bank and Hypo-Bank. To date, Allianz has been a
passive shareholder, and its board members and Dresdner's are on friendly terms,
particularly now that Deutsche Bank, which is encroaching on the insurance
sector, has become a common rival. But Allianz is coming under pressure itself to
show better performance, having lagged many of its European peers. It may feel
pressure to squeeze some greater value from its holdings of bank stocks.

<P> <B>Germany's suitors</B>

<P> One German banker concludes: "What Deutsche Bank is doing with this stake is
saying to the world that there will be no big moves in the German banking sector
without its say-so. It is sending a strong signal to Switzerland that it will not
be easy to take over a German bank." But rumours persist. Most bankers in
Frankfurt expect BHF-Bank to be bought, perhaps by a Swiss institution
(previously-rumoured buyers include Paribas and JP Morgan), and many wonder
whether Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais may sell its German bank BFG as part of a general
dismantling of its doomed European banking empire.

<P> Commerzbank has long been touted as a takeover target for another German or a
foreign bank. Earlier this year, there was talk in Frankfurt that Bayerische
Vereinsbank was preparing to sell off its large holdings of stock in Allianz and
Munich Re &#173; those stakes are the largest known part of the hidden reserves
that probably make it the second wealthiest bank in the country after Deutsche
&#173; to build a war chest with which to bid for Commerzbank. Credit Suisse has
taken two good looks at Commerzbank in recent years and so, according to rumour,
have ABN-Amro and Swiss Bank Corporation. Today, according to J&uuml;rgen
Ackermann, head of investor relations at Commerzbank, its largest known
shareholder is Spain's Banco Central Hispano with around 4%, while Banca
Commerciale Italiana and Mediobanca each own 2%. More intriguingly, 15% of the
bank's stock is held in Switzerland in various accounts.

<P> Because its banking market is so highly fragmented, Germany is something of a
centre for takeover gossip. Meanwhile Switzerland, where the big three have
clearly saturated and even outgrown the domestic market, is seen as the home of
potential acquirers. But consolidation will spread across Europe.

<P> In Spain the banking industry has already been through a considerable
consolidation in recent years. But some deals may still be made. Banco Popular,
the smallest and most profitable of the country's leading banks, has made no
secret that it is considering acquisition as a possible means to grow.

<P> It may be casting its eyes over Banesto, Banco Herrero and the much larger
Banco Central Hispano which is the subject of the most persistent rumours. Other
medium-size banks, such as Banco Zaragozano and Banco Pastor, are possible
takeover targets in Spain. As the Spanish government continues to divest bank
holding company Argentaria, it may be open to takeover and break-up.

<P> In France consolidation within a troubled banking sector is well under way.
The number of French banks and other credit institutions has fallen by a third in
the past 10 years, from 2,170 to 1,445, according to a recent report of the
Credit Establishments Committee. It also found that 184 of the 400 conventional
shareholder-owned banks have changed hands in the past 12 years, although these
were mainly of modest size. In January, Cr&eacute;dit National, a traditional
long-term lender to French industry, took over BFCE, a commercial and trade
finance bank. Together they hope to have greater critical mass and the chance to
grow more profitable business. It's a large deal, worth over ffr3 billion ($600
million). As well Cr&eacute;dit Agricole is buying Indosuez (see separate
article) and the French government has retained advisers to find a buyer for
regional retail bank, CIC. Eventually, it must decide how to privatize
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais.

<P> The greatest challenge to banking consolidation in Europe is the difficulty
of making staff redundant. Bizarrely, the cost-cutting plans of some European
banks are driven mainly by demographics. In France certain large banks which
expanded rapidly in the 1960s are only just beginning to have mid-level managers
retire. They can now base future cost-cutting on the basis of not replacing staff
who retire. Most cost-cutting European banks lose staff only at their natural
rate of annual attrition &#173; around 10% as a rule of thumb. They simply don't
replace staff that leave. The problem is that turnover is highest among junior
staff. One investment banker mentions the strange example of the continental bank
with fewer than 3% of its employees under 30 years of age.

<P> In the US the process of consolidation is a comparatively simple numbers
game. Until the late 1980s the key indicators for an American bank's value were
its price/earnings per share or price/book ratios. Today, banks are valued
according to cost economics. If a professional acquirer thinks it can squeeze
<I>x</I> amount of annual cost savings from a target bank by cutting its head
office staff, integrating its back-office systems and reducing overlap with its
own branches, then it will pay <I>y</I>  for that bank. At an acquisition machine
like NationsBank or Wells Fargo, the whole procedure is standardized. Typically
an acquirer will take out up to 40% of a target's annual costs within two or
three years of a merger.

<P> Ewen Stevenson, a vice-president in the financial institutions group at CS
First Boston, says: "As a rule of thumb, I would say that mergers produce half
the cost savings in Europe that they might produce in the US." Even that sounds
ambitious. Following the merger of Banco Bilbao and Banco Vizcaya, the new BBV
management eliminated several thousand jobs, but only by transferring many staff
to be employed in menial tasks within the personnel division.

<P> In Europe the savings are less and come more slowly. ABN Amro took five years
to deliver its promised cost savings. Today, the managers of many European banks
must wonder whether they have five years in which to resolve their profitability
problems. But even in countries where labour law is not restrictive, such as
Switzerland, the prospect of large-scale job losses from the suggested merger of
Credit Suisse and UBS still caused a public outcry. In Greece buyers have backed
away from potential bank acquisitions when  sellers have insisted on post-merger
undertakings not to lay off staff.

<P> In many countries the public sector owns large parts of the banking system.
In France over 50% of bank revenues flow into publicly-owned entities and labour
laws are tight. One banker is working with a potential buyer for a banking
network employing 5,000 people in France. The seller wants to sell; it has
provided all manner of representations and warranties to the buyer, but the deal
is stuck because, to make it work, the acquirer will have to eliminate 2,000
jobs, and this seems impossible.

<P> This shapes bankers' views of likely M&amp;A activity within the country.
Sacerdot says: "We will see more deals where a retail bank combines with a
wholesale or capital markets bank like Cr&eacute;dit Agricole and Indosuez. These
will be deals of complementarity, rather than deals based on cost-cutting." Don't
expect BNP to merge with SocGen.

<P> Even those complementary deals don't happen as often as they should. It's a
surprise   that Cr&eacute;dit Local de France &#173; a specialist local authority
lender with no retail deposits, reliant on bond market funding and, as a result,
overcapitalized with 14% tier 1 equity to protect its high credit rating &#173;
did not merge with a French retail bank which might provide cheaper deposits. Of
the deal with Cr&eacute;dit Communal de Belgique (see separate story), which
retains dual holding companies, one French banker says: "It's hard to see what
value shareholders get out of that."

<P> <B>Ego-driven alliances</B>

<P> If economic sense does not drive consolidation in Europe, other less tangible
factors, such as ego, might. "You can talk all you want to about overcapacity,"
says Steven Davis, managing director of Davis International Banking Consultants,
"but it doesn't have anything to do with actually making mergers happen. People
&#173; individual CEOs or major shareholders &#173; make mergers."

<P> In France, where large egos and civil servants still populate the upper ranks
of bank management, one major deal might have a knock-on effect. Size for its own
sake matters. If a bank chairman finds his institution has slipped down the
rankings because two others have merged, that might make him seek a merger.

<P> Elsewhere in Europe politicians and banking supervisors are very impressed
with the concept of creating national bank champions. The theory goes that each
country ought to have at least one sizeable bank, in order to block out foreign
competition and to retain a loud voice in any European Commission debate on
banking matters. Whatever the merits of such thinking, it means that large bank
mergers have not been blocked on competition grounds. Regulators are especially
docile when there is a near-rescue element to a deal. So large bank combinations
are allowed in Scandinavia, where the banking system has undergone severe crisis
&#173; and even nationalization and re-privatization.

<P> In the UK, Lloyds was widely known to be preparing a bid for Midland, until
HSBC tabled a knock-out offer. Lloyds received no indication that a merger of two
out of the country's largest four banks would be blocked.

<P> In the Netherlands the mergers of ABN and Amro, and of ING with NatNed
created banks which were then large enough, and strong enough, to invest across
products and across borders. Shareholders in ABN Amro have benefited considerably
from the merger. In a recent report Goldman Sachs banking analyst Neil Crowder
draws several comparisons with Deutsche Bank &#173; all are flattering to the
Dutch side.

<P> ABN Amro's ROE is 14.7%, compared with Deutsche's 8.1%. The Dutch bank is
two-thirds Deutsche's size but still generated higher net income last year. Over
the last five years its shares have easily outperformed Deutsche's. Five years
ago ABN Amro embarked on a merger predicated on reducing domestic costs by 10% a
year for five years, while Deutsche bank was side-tracked into an ambitious
expansion in the eastern part of Germany.

<P> Between 1991 and 1995 the Dutch bank reduced domestic branches by 28% and
domestic staff levels by 12%. Deutsche increased its domestic branch network by
12% and has only recently tried to trim staff levels, cutting its domestic
headcount by 3.8% in the last two years, so Crowder estimates. The Dutch bank's
domestic cost/income ratio stands at 65%, Deutsche's stands at 75%. The Dutch
bank's management focus on cost control, efficiency and profitability seems to
have begun with the domestic merger. That gave it the scale and the
self-confidence to pursue other ambitions. Since 1990 it has grown through small
acquisitions, expanding into the US by adding five new purchases since 1992,
making it the biggest foreign bank there. It has also built up investment
banking, mainly in Europe and Asia, with nine modest-sized purchases.

<P> This example may inspire more activity, in Belgium, for example. Until
striking its deal with Cr&eacute;dit Local de France, Cr&eacute;dit Communal de
Belgique had looked to be a likely partner for Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) in
which it held a 12.4% stake. ING also holds a sizeable stake in BBL. The idea has
been floated that BBL should merge with Generale Bank. Generale itself had
explored a merger with one of the two Dutch giants, before they merged with each
other (see separate story).

<P> In Scandinavia, a series of mergers has transformed the banking sectors of
countries which were devastated by recession and bad debts. In Finland there has
been a huge in-market consolidation with the merger of Union Bank of Finland and
Kansallis-Osake-Pannkki to create Merita, a bank with a market share of over 40%
in key areas of domestic lending and deposit taking.

<P> In Sweden it seems likely that there will be at least one further combination
among the top four banks &#173; SE Banken, Handelsbanken, Nordbanken and Swedbank
&#173; potentially creating a bank with over 40% of corporate lending and a
similar share of retail deposits.

<P> Ask almost any FIG investment banker what pattern they expect for bank merger
activity in Europe over the next two or three years and most will draw the same
outline. First will come more mergers of banks in the same country, as they move
towards the Dutch or Scandinavian model of two or three banks dominating 60% to
70% of the banking market. Then will follow a period when these large banks build
market share across Europe.

<P> What might drive this process is the single currency, which will make it much
easier for a customer in France to open an account in Germany or the Netherlands,
assuming that basic tax equalization runs in parallel with currency union. The
customer will then pick and choose his bank according to the rates and quality of
service offered by banks in any of the countries within a single currency block.

<P> Whether this happens depends on how fast old ties between customers and
traditional banks are broken. There are some who doubt that these will fade and
question whether the single currency will have much impact. Steven Davis, a
consultant who has done much analysis of European banks and banking mergers for
American brokers Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, says: "Retail and small
business banking remains a fragmented and local business, where banks do business
with customers who look primarily to them for financial services." In the late
1980s and early 1990s advisers such as McKinsey convinced a lot of banks that,
even if they had high market share in their home country, this was still a tiny
market share in the whole of Europe: they told them that they had better raise
themselves to a European scale or risk losing out to foreign banks expanding into
their home markets. "That simply hasn't happened," says Davis. "If I am the
biggest bank in Ireland with a 30% to 40% market share and Ireland joins the
single currency, that might devastate my forex trading or bond dealing profits.
But I will continue doing business with those same retail and small business
customers."

<P> Davis argues that the oddity in Europe is not that so many banks exist,
burdening the industry with overcapacity, but that more banks are not regularly
created to serve small local areas, like the community banks which spring up in
the US.

<P> The contrary view is that the McKinsey vision will inevitably be realized,
that there is nothing special about banking products, that customers are more
fickle and more discerning than ever before, and that therefore the only
competitive advantage banks can hope to muster is in superior distribution
technology, more efficient processing and lower operating costs. "The end of
credit rationing &#173; of the days when people went cap in hand to the bank for
a mortgage or a business loan &#173; has changed customer behaviour towards
financial institutions," says Alastair Walton, a director of FIG at CS First
Boston. "There are now so many more ways to obtain credit."

<P> One disturbing development for banks has been the growth of branchless,
telephone banks, such as First Direct in the UK, where customers open accounts
and transact business without ever meeting a bank employee. Many banks are now
pondering investments in such projects. For example, Deutsche Bank has Bank 24, a
telephone bank manned by staff in an industrial park on the outskirts of Bonn.
Customers of these banks don't care whether the representative at the other end
of the phone is sitting in Leeds, Bonn, Glasgow or Dresden. Why should these
customers care whether the owner of the bank is German, French or Spanish?

<P> According to Sacerdot at SBC Warburg: "I'm not sure that banks have taken
this threat seriously yet, but First Direct might just change the banking world.
The equation of labour and capital is very different for such a direct bank. It
relies on just two things: outstanding computer support and a well-trained
flexible work-force. That's very different from the traditional bank."

<P> <B>Towards a bankless society?</B>

<P> Non-bank entrants are a distant threat: AT&amp;T in money transfer, Visa and
Fidelity in providing credit to retail customers, British supermarkets offering
interest on retail deposits. Any company with a strong brand name, good data
processing and which is close enough to customers to obtain information on their
spending patterns might be a threat to banks, if regulation allowed it. "Banks
have to look for a <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I>," says B&uuml;rkner. "It's no
longer taken for granted. In many countries the return on investment in bank
shares has been less than in government bonds. And unless banks become very good
specialist advisers, financiers, asset managers, risk managers or processors, it
is possible to imagine, within 30 years, a bankless society."

<P> That is an extreme view. Banks still enjoy a special status. Any threat to
their existence is deemed a threat to the entire financial system. So failures
are rare and capital does not disappear from the system. Only the most
enlightened banks hand it back to shareholders through special dividends or share
repurchases, when they can find no better way to invest it themselves.

<P> Governments don't want angry depositors losing all their money. The only
failure of a large retail bank in recent years has been BCCI. Nor do European
governments seem to welcome foreign takeovers of large domestic banks. HSBC's
acquisition of Midland was an exception. It was regarded as essentially a British
acquirer and is now domiciled there.

<P> The obsession with headquarters location is an obstacle to the creation of
European super-banks. Without full European political and legal union, there is
no such thing as a European plc. A bank has to be based in one country or
another.

<P> The limited evidence suggests that keeping ownership of a country's leading
banks in domestic hands is not a matter of vital national interest. But New
Zealand is the only country in the world fully to accept this. Following
financial crisis in the 1980s, the country emerged from a series of bank
takeovers and rescues with over 90% of banking assets owned by foreigners. That
has scarcely impeded its economic progress. The government is now paying down its
foreign currency debt out of annual budget surpluses and it boasts the highest
growth rate in the OECD. Walton at CS First Boston, an Australian, argues:
"Banking is regarded in the same way as the steel industry in the 1950s. Then it
was deemed vital for every country and every region to have its own strong steel
industry because it was important for success in manufacturing industry. But as
technology changed, steel became less and less of an obsession. Now, nobody cares
very much about who owns steel-makers. So it is with banking. It is an industry
declining in its relative importance as its products are becoming commoditized
and low value-added. As a result the banking industry faces massive changes."

<P> Those changes do no necessarily translate immediately into M&amp;A
transactions. First banks need to resolve their ownership and guiding
philosophies and then decide which markets they will be in. As to ownership, the
clear trend in Europe, where state ownership has been high, is toward
privatization of banks. With this comes growing adoption of the principle of
maximizing shareholder value. So Deutsche Bank has indicated its willingness to
unwind its industrial shareholdings, on which it earns below-market returns, and
re-deploy capital into more productive investment. It has found ways to do this,
even though the German stock market could not absorb huge sales of stock: for
example, through its issue of bonds convertible into its holding of stock in
Allianz.

<P> Shareholders are exerting greater influence. The US has Michael Price who
badgered Chase management until they sought a merger. Europe has Martin Ebner.
Recent reorganizations at CS Holding and at Deutsche Bank have been designed
partly to unbundle businesses and make them easier for shareholders to
understand.

<P> In the process, banks are accepting the inevitable need for job losses, even
though still emphasizing natural turnover. The CS Holding reorganization was
accompanied by plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs mostly in domestic retail banking.
Six months after its takeover of BFCE, Cr&eacute;dit National has begun to talk
about reducing head-count. All three big German banks have quietly put in place
programmes to reduce staff levels in domestic banking.

<P> There is still a long way to go. One banker recalls two years ago quizzing
the CEO of a soon-to-be-privatized Italian bank about his performance benchmarks.
Did he simply use return on equity? "No," came the reply, "we don't bother about
ROE. We think it is unrealistic." End of conversation.

<P> Such attitudes will change. The Italian government now faces the same
predicament as eastern European governments did with their industries when
emerging after communism: should the state fix it first and then sell it, or
privatize quickly and hope new owners make the needed improvements? The Italian
government cannot fix the country's banking system. It will have to push
privatization and that will mean forcing banks to acknowledge the demands of
outside shareholders.

<P> Meanwhile, many banks are refining their business strategies. Ten years ago
Deutsche Bank was probably the model for most ambitious European banks. It was a
universal bank with huge industrial holdings, competing in a broad array of
retail and wholesale businesses, and expanding across Europe, for example, with
its acquisition of Banca d'America e d'Italia (one of the only successful large
cross-border acquisitions in European retail banking). Other banks tried to
follow its lead and failed miserably &#173; Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais most
spectacularly. Now even Deutsche Bank has disavowed any ambition to build a
pan-European retail bank.

<P> <B>Demergers a possibility</B>

<P> European banks are more choosy about which businesses they are in. Improved
management techniques and information systems allow them to analyze themselves in
terms of profitability per business, per location and per customer type. Some
banks are more attracted to one type of business, geographical area or customer
than others. That may lead to demergers. The future shape of bank and insurance
combinations is unclear. Some banks in the UK and France have been reasonably
successful in selling life assurance and general insurance. But the insurance
industry has growing numbers of niche players, specializing in certain segments
of risk and competing on price. Banks with large insurance businesses face the
choice of either growing in scale, driving down overall costs and selectively
fighting back on price, or perhaps breaking up their insurance businesses.
Midland considered demerging its life insurance business, prior to its
acquisition by HSBC.

<P> Only after they have mapped out their strategy does it make sense for banks
to seek the acquisitions they may need for it to succeed. "In the past, a lot of
acquisitions by financial institutions appear to have been opportunistic and
experience has shown that opportunistic transactions have a higher risk of not
achieving expected performance than those which are clearly part of a
pre-determined strategy," says Graham Taylor, chief manager, strategic planning
at Lloyds/TSB Group. Inside the new group, business heads now devise favoured
strategies (plus other choices) to fulfil the group's promise to maximize
shareholder value. When the bank's senior managers endorse a strategy of building
market share which may require an acquisition, then Taylor's group will execute
it. It regularly reviews suggestions from investment bank FIG teams, recently
politely listening to a pitch for a French bank, before rejecting it as not
meeting certain basic requirements of scale and value creation.

<P> Interestingly, Lloyds did not reject the idea out of hand, though it is
generally regarded as a bank with little interest in banking overseas, other than
in New Zealand. Banks are pragmatic right now. Richard Boath, a managing director
at Salomon Brothers, says: "If you suggest a cross-border deal, the typical
bank's response is, 'Not now', or 'Yes, providing it is an insurance company or
an asset manager that brings new products to my clients, or if it's a savings
bank based 100 miles away where I can reduce systems costs and cut branches. And,
by the way, can you find a buyer for my small, not wonderfully performing retail
bank in Spain?'"

<P> For the moment, banks in Europe seem to be too busy sorting out their
strategies and their core domestic businesses to consider cross-border deals. If
anything, they are cutting back on earlier modest expansion across the continent.
NatWest has sold its Spanish bank, NatWest Espana, to Banco Sabadell.
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais has sold up in the Netherlands. Barclays seems less
interested in continental deals than in the past. Its acquisition of German
private bank Merck, Fink &amp; Co has proved a poor investment.

<P> Sources in the French treasury expect that CIC will be sold to a French bank,
but no foreigners seem interested. Five years ago the first calls would have been
to Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro or Barclays. In 1993, when the Italian government
privatized Credito Italiano, it retained a US investment bank to search across
Europe for a bank buyer. None was found and the privatization proceeded as an
international share offer. As the effort drags on to sell off Creditanstalt in
Austria, with Allianz and Credit Suisse initially expressing interest, advisers
suggest that the only resolution will come with an Austrian buyer.

<P> When FIG teams pitch foreign acquisitions, bankers generally lose interest.
"Culture is the main problem," says Michael Baughan, managing director at Lazard
Brothers. "The cultural difficulty of running, say, a French bank from the UK is
enormous. And if you buy a bank in another country and simply leave it alone, as
a pure investment rather than a true merger, what do you really get out of that?"

<P> That portfolio approach has been the strategy for some cross-border buyers,
such as National Australia Bank (NAB) which, in an effort to diversify out of
Australia, bought four regional UK banks in the late 1980s: Ulster Bank,
Yorkshire Bank, Clydesdale Bank and National Irish Bank. It left their names
unchanged. According to one banker: "NAB never put in one of its own senior
managers to run those banks, although in each case, it sent one senior officer to
their credit departments. NAB had the advantage of a common language. It would
never have bought in France."

<P> It seems unlikely that banks will ignore cross-border deals indefinitely. The
advent of a single currency and the turn of the century may be milestones which
will point bank executives towards grander strategies and more ambitious deals.
Already bankers talk about the large market shares of a few banks in several
Scandinavian countries and say that creation of a pan-Nordic bank is the next
logical step.

<P> <B>Dangerous liaisons</B>

<P> Some executives may be tempted into deals to establish their credentials as a
leading European bank. "It is not beyond the imagination to see a large Dutch and
a large British bank coming together, a Belgian and a Dutch bank merger, or a
French or Swiss bank combining with a bank in another European country," says
Chisholm at Goldman Sachs. "It is unlikely to be a wave, but potential exists for
large cross-border mergers or acquisitions.  Nevertheless, large-scale mergers
are tremendously difficult to get right. Banks know they  have to have a plan to
make it work, not just do it because other banks are or because it is
conceptually interesting."

<P> Already investment bankers suggest that some quite bad deals &#173; from a
shareholders' view &#173; are likely to be cobbled together over the next few
years, perhaps with banks swapping large shareholdings in each other and blocking
out other acquirers, with only a vague notion of ever fully merging.

<P> Some European banks are dusting off old alliances forged in the late 1980s,
when it seemed that the creation of a single European market in 1992 might herald
a wave of cross-border deals. Executives at Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de
Paris would probably admit that their alliance has been nowhere near as
significant or meaningful as they hoped five years ago. The two banks have a
number of joint ventures in peripheral markets such as Turkey and central Europe.
In the capital markets they are always invited into each others' bond deals and
have to accept.

<P> Big deal. But, as one German banker points out: "What they have &#173; two
banks in the heartland of Europe &#173; may be interesting after the single
currency. They have looked behind the curtain in some detail at each other's
systems, organization and personnel matters, such as contracts and pension
arrangements. They are like fianc&eacute;s who may one day marry."

<P> It's a striking claim. But neither bank will rush to give up its independent
identity. Any deal would probably preserve each bank's place in its home market,
probably with a large share swap. The banks might then pursue more important
joint ventures and projects. One obvious area of potential overlap would be in
capital markets, especially government bond trading. If Dresdner's Bund trading
operation and BNP's OAT traders are both faced with adapting to a new European
government bond market denominated in Euro, why have two huge dealing desks?

<P> Beyond that it's not clear how two such giant banks might move closer
together or what example they might provide to other European banks. But one
banker says: "Dresdner is not big enough to build up a large international bank
on its own cost base. And BNP has come to the same conclusion." The same
realization must be dawning in the minds of senior bankers all across Europe.

<H3>PORTFOLIO THEORY</H3>
<H2>The human factor </H2>
<H4>Computers can do a lot to process today's explosion of information in
financial markets - but they're only a tool. The ultimate processor and
user of the information is man. Man is the subject and the object of financial
analysis. Markets are a theatre of human behaviour. More and more quantitative
analysts are redirecting their study of markets to the study of man. David
Shirreff reports </H4>
The study of markets is still in its infancy. We know that, when only three
or four people gather together to trade, there is already a recognizable
market. At that level, game theory can explain a lot, as participants take
account, not only of the fundamentals governing the commodity traded, but
also of each other and the views they might take. But even at this level,
game theory might explain behaviour, but it cannot predict market outcomes.
<BR>
<BR>
As the size of the market increases, so does its complexity. Factors other
than fundamentals and gamesmanship come into play - time horizon, liquidity,
experience of traders, entry of new traders, reactions to past gains and
losses, influence of analysts. Perhaps the most complex existing market
is the market for US equities. <BR>
<BR>
Some humans can understand intuitively a great deal about markets. They
can scan the complex factors governing a market far more efficiently than
any computer. They may not process as much information, but they don't need
to. They can select information with more agility than any computer has
yet been taught to do. <BR>
<BR>
The human brain can &quot;appraise things faster than you can blink&quot;,
says Arnie Wood, president of Martingale Asset Management, Boston. His example
is the instant reaction of most people to the name Lee Harvey Oswald. &quot;Your
opinion [of the man who killed John Kennedy] is already formed,&quot; says
Wood. A computer might recognize the name but it would take some time, and
a huge amount of programming, to make a judgement. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, each year the US government summons various research establishments
to a competition on natural-language recognition. The task is to get the
researchers' custom-built computer programmes to scan a body of text - newspaper
articles, wire agency reports, news bulletin transcripts - and from the
collection of English text, extract the relevant facts on, say, international
terrorism or trade embargoes. So far, the computer wizards have been delighted
with a 60% success rate. <BR>
<BR>
Computers have been set to work on the US stock market in a quest to make
excess returns. The image that springs to mind is that of the mouse climbing
an elephant with intent to rape. <BR>
<BR>
But computers have had some success, especially those which find small arbitrages
between the price of a stock and its implied option value or its intrinsic
value, based on some mechanical calculation. Usually these computers are
applying some genetic or learning algorithm which works for a while then
loses step after some structural shift in the market. The algorithms make
a little money but it seems they do not get nearer to any fundamental truth
about the working of markets. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Theory vs practice</B> <BR>
<BR>
Then there are the market theorists who reject almost everything the computers
are doing. They have a different agenda, which is to understand more about
markets. Putting their theories to work to make money is only a secondary
goal, if they think of it at all. Charles Darwin's <I>On the Origin of Species</I>
may have explained the ascent of man, but it didn't predict what the next
evolutionary step would be, says Woody Brock of Strategic Economic Decisions,
Menlo Park, California. Einstein's general theory of relativity, on the
other hand, anticipated many subsequent developments, but it didn't predict
the timing or human behaviour. <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, any new general theory of markets may help to explain the phenomenon,
without enhancing anyone's returns. <BR>
<BR>
The theorists don't like time series. They don't like finding data to fit
hypotheses or vice versa. Mordecai Kurz, professor of economics at Stanford
University, is continuing work on his theory of rational beliefs equilibrium
(RBE). The theory seeks to explain mathematically the phenomenon that investors
with self-consistent rational beliefs about the future nevertheless have
views which diverge from each other and so collectively will make many forecasts
that don't come true. The volatility caused by this he calls endogenous
uncertainty. <BR>
<BR>
Brock, who is a James Boswell to Kurz's Dr Johnson, says the theory will
take another 10 to 20 years to develop and prove. Investors may fear the
market will go away from them if they wait that long. <BR>
<BR>
Somewhere in the middle, between the extreme computer-driven methods and
the students of market behaviour, a lot of practical work and testing is
being done. David Leinweber, managing director at First Quadrant in Pasadena,
having developed a computer tool called MarketMind (now marketed with some
success by Investment Technology Group as part of Quantex, which also executes
trades), is using genetic algorithms to help optimize investment strategies.
<BR>
<BR>
Several algorithms for investment strategies are designed, then chopped
up and reassembled in different combinations. Those combinations are tested,
the successful ones kept and the less successful thrown out. The new winning
combinations are jumbled again into new combinations until some optimum
algorithms are found. <BR>
<BR>
The model algorithms are not arbitrary. They are put together as a synthesis
of many people's ideas, says Leinweber. The inputs might come from studying
earnings revisions, equity factors or industry models. &quot;We apply a
lot of judgement in the models,&quot; says Leinweber. And the selling point
of the strategy is &quot;disciplined contrarian investing. You tend to do
better when taking contrarian positions&quot;, Leinweber says. <BR>
<BR>
The bottom line is a 3.5% to 4.7% return above the portfolios which do not
use genetic algorithms to optimize performance, according to First Quadrant
literature, although the examples given are rather selective. <BR>
<BR>
State Street, which for several years has used an aggregate of analysts'
earnings revisions to guide investment decisions, has started to look at
signals given by individual analysts. There is less value in an analyst's
earnings revision, says Peter Stonberg, chief investment officer at State
Street Global Advisors, if he is simply changing his estimate to catch up
with the herd. <BR>
<BR>
An analyst's revision is more significant if it was higher than the mean
and goes up, or was lower than the mean and goes down. For historical data,
State Street bought the Sachs database of analysts' revisions. It found
that it first had to clean up &quot;enormous errors&quot; in the database,
says Stonberg. Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors - recently bought by
Barclays and renamed BZW Barclays Global Investors - is also looking quantitatively
at the effect of individual analysts' revisions. Chief investment officer
Blake Grossman says &quot;systematic biases [among 2,500 analysts analyzed]
can be very revealing in telling us how to find misvalued stocks&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Richard Morris of Cursitor Management, London - recently bought by Alliance
Capital - offers some warnings to scanners of market data. First: &quot;Choosing
the information to monitor is as important as the way we monitor it.&quot;
And secondly: &quot;You can never attribute market changes to any specific
set of data.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The late Fischer Black, a partner at Goldman Sachs, was renowned for his
suspicion of data-mining. In his final book, <I>Exploring General Equilibrium</I>,
he warns that using a model of even 200 variables won't help with understanding
the volatility of financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
Black also notes: &quot;We kid ourselves when we say that one variable helps
to 'explain' another. This sounds like causation, but really means only
correlation.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
Quantitative research, having explored the avenue of pure data-mining and
variations of it, is coming back to the <I>primus motor</I> of the market
phenomenon - man. The study of man, and his behaviour in markets, both sophisticated
and primitive, is the theme of the following two examples. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>In the heat of battle </H3>
The tank commander's squadron has come under heavy and accurate rocket fire.
He assesses the terrain and sends a pair of his M1 battle tanks on a flanking
movement over a grassy knoll. Two miles away, an identical battle commander
sums up the situation, hulls his tanks down and radios for support. Unfortunately,
the first squadron is wiped out, though it did everything by the book. The
enemy commanders, equipped with exactly the same tactical skills, simply
occupied a better position. <BR>
<BR>
This isn't a history of the Gulf War. It's a video game being played out
at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California. And it's deadly serious.
By 1997 Hughes has to be ready to field its simulated armed forces in full-scale
defence department trials called STOW (simulated theatre of war) 97. <BR>
<BR>
The simulations use artificial intelligence (AI) to provide the battle with
the confusion and uncertainty that is nevertheless the interaction of expert
decisions and military hardware. Each tank commander, each fire platoon
leader, reacts and makes decisions according to thousands of rules downloaded
from the brain of a real-life professional who is expert at his particular
job. Welcome to MKAT (modular knowledge acquisition technology). STOW, if
it succeeds, will be a lot cheaper than committing real tanks and troops
to field exercises when testing war strategies. <BR>
<BR>
To log the decision-making processes of these military men, researchers
at Hughes spent months with a tank commander, and a rifle platoon leader,
questioning their responses to battlefield situations and encoding them
for the computer. It was a fascinating exercise with occasional cultural
stand-offs. For example, shortly into session number one, the tank commander
stood up and snapped: &quot;Okay, I'm going to the john for 10 minutes and
when I get back I want a <I>clear</I> definition of fuzzy logic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There's less of a culture gap between Hughes researchers and another of
their subjects, Christine Downton, chief investment officer of fund manager
Pareto Partners, London. Downton has a PhD in monetary economics from the
London School of Economics and worked at the Bank of England before becoming
an investment manager. One of her passions is economic history. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992, Hughes Researchers spent several
months encoding Downton's investment decision-making processes. They built
a library of around 1,500 rules which Downton applies and then acts on when
running a bond portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Live project</B> <BR>
<BR>
The objective was to create a computer programme that could process far
more information than one economist, looking at many more variables and
markets, yet which made decisions consistent with that of this single experienced
investor with her proven track-record. &quot;Human beings can process only
about seven chunks of information at one time,&quot; says Downton. <BR>
<BR>
Hughes and Pareto have a joint venture - Hughes Pareto Research Partners.
In September 1994 the project went live with Pareto running fixed-income
portfolios for two clients, together totalling more than $100 million. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, it was fortunate for Pareto and its clients that the start of
the live experiment came after one of the worst bond sell-offs in history.
Downton, for reasons of client confidentiality, won't give direct results
of the live investment returns, but she suggests that the model can be hit
by shocks that aren't value-related: &quot;In February 1994 the extent of
the rate increase and the market reaction were hard to predict. If you have
60% to 70% accuracy, it means that 30% of the time you're wrong, and sometimes
you can be badly wrong.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Back-testing the model over the last 10 years, however, Pareto has seen
indications that &quot;there is a potential to outperform the index by 4%
to 5%&quot;, says Downton. <BR>
<BR>
The rules are simple judgements based on the relationships between fundamental
economic indicators. The model applies them to decide whether bond prices
are out of line, taking into account a country's main economic figures -
inflation, GDP, government debt, budget deficit, etc - and the risk of a
change. Fuzzy logic is applied to fill the grey area between the broad conclusions
drawn by the weighted values of the numbers - for example that Italy's debt
situation is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;very bad&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The portfolios are re-balanced every month, strictly according to what the
model decides. Downton reviews the model's output monthly - &quot;checking
from a due-diligence perspective&quot; - but, she adds, &quot;we implement
exactly what it says, we don't second-guess it. Usually, if I second-guess
it, I'm wrong. And that's probably because I got out of bed the wrong side.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The beauty of models, says Downton, is that they aren't emotional about
their decisions. Her philosophy of markets is that the winners are those
with consistent long-term views, losers are those who have no view and change
their mind on recent data. &quot;Most research into cognitive bias,&quot;
says Downton, &quot;suggests that investors tend to overweight recent information.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But in the Hughes Pareto case, it would be wrong to say that the computer
has taken over. Exactly the opposite. The computer is being used to duplicate
a very human decision-making process. It is as if Christine Downton had
cloned herself many times and set each of her clones to watch a humanly
manageable amount of information. The Hughes Pareto global fixed-income
model watches 12 major markets and computes the optimum portfolio balance
taking at least 12 variables into account in each country. Even with those
simple numbers, there are many millions of possible outcomes. <BR>
<BR>
Many clones of herself are better than an investment committee, says Downton:
&quot;There's no one truth but there are plenty of feasible workable hypotheses.
Everyone on a committee has his own internal model. But that produces a
sort of soup which doesn't have much flavour.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Self-consistency</B> <BR>
<BR>
As with the tank commander and the rifle platoon leader, the knowledge-based
system MKAT needs an expert brain to download. Not only that, it helps if
the mind is as consistent as possible and if the subject knows why he or
she reached a certain decision. Downton appears to have these qualities.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most experts are self-consistent,&quot; says Charles Dolan, project
manager at Hughes Research Laboratories. &quot;But Christine is also pretty
knowledgeable about how she reaches a conclusion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For Dolan, who has a PhD in artificial intelligence from the University
of California, Los Angeles, this project is &quot;more fun than most of
the things I've done in science&quot;. There is not only the curiosity of
devising a tool to outsmart the markets, there is also the clear indication
of success or failure. &quot;The rubber really meets the road,&quot; he
says. <BR>
<BR>
Dolan is also a convert. His initial view was that learning algorithms,
another area of Hughes research, were going to be the right technology for
running a bond portfolio. Learning algorithms build models by seeing patterns
in the raw data of the market. In the early stages, both learning algorithms
and the knowledge-based approach were applied to the Hughes Pareto project.
But as Dolan worked with Pareto, he saw that &quot;Christine's insights
kept helping the learning system, giving consistently positive results.
So I jumped ship.&quot; This doesn't mean that learning algorithms have
been rejected for modelling other areas of the market. Hughes Pareto is
developing other techniques to run a global asset allocation model including
equities. &quot;I still believe that eventually the learning approaches
will achieve something,&quot; says Dolan. <BR>
<BR>
A knowledge-based system suits the fixed-income portfolio because bonds
are governed more by fundamentals than by short-term volatility and trader
sentiment. &quot;Market participants can increase the volatility of returns,&quot;
says Downton, &quot;but that doesn't change the reality that, if there's
value in the market, you will make money over time - although the timing
isn't clear.&quot; The currency risk in the bond portfolio is handled completely
separately by Pareto's traders who can intervene 24 hours a day to adjust
exposures. &quot;This reduces the volatility of returns,&quot; says Downton,
&quot;contributing perhaps 1% to the overall result.&quot; The currency
activity is to reduce, not to increase risk. Currency risk management, says
Downton, &quot;allows you to be more aggressive in the bonds - you have
a safety net&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Political risk is also ignored by the model, although the volatility caused
by political uncertainty is picked up. &quot;The impact of political events
is unpredictable,&quot; says Downton, &quot;especially the timing. You'd
never have invested in Italy if you counted political risk. You can't put
a value on it. But you can identify that risk is increasing [by the increase
in volatility] and reduce your exposure.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Downton - not a power-dresser, thoroughly down-to-earth - underlines the
point that there is no magic or mumbo jumbo in what the fixed-income model
does. &quot;Finance is about analyzing information and managing complexity.
There has been an information explosion. The capacity to analyze it has
increased and costs have plummeted.&quot; The fixed-income model does no
more than apply tried and tested concepts, but in a rigorous and comprehensive
way. Downton believes there is no evidence that the exploitable inefficiencies
in the markets are diminishing: there are always different groups of investors,
domestic and global, short-term and long-term. <BR>
<BR>
What about the changing structure of the markets? Doesn't that mean the
model must constantly be adapted? &quot;We designed the software three years
ago,&quot; says Downton. &quot;I'm not expecting to modify it significantly.
I don't think the rules of the game change that much.&quot; Dolan says there
is scope for fine-tuning, country by country, what the model considers to
be &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;. For example, an inflation figure
that looks high in Germany might look low for Italy. But he believes, &quot;with
one caveat&quot;, that the fundamental assumptions of the model don't need
to change. &quot;If the inefficiency that Christine believes is there is
bid away, then we'd have to improve the model. You can never say you've
got absolutely everything.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Downton seldom finds the model doing things she wouldn't. For example, in
the January 1995 sell-off, &quot;I wanted to do what the model did - buy
into weakness. I'm a value investor.&quot; But she cautions: &quot;If I
had intervened, the whole philosophy of the organization would have opposed
it.&quot; <BR>

Human laboratory </H3>
The auditorium at the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, is wired for quadraphonic
sound. On the big screen is a graph, with the &quot;x&quot; axis representing
time and the &quot;y&quot; axis price. Bid prices appear as red blobs, offer
prices as blue and actual transactions are logged in yellow. <BR>
<BR>
The market opens. For a while, the traders hesitate, then a few offers appear
high up the graph and a handful of bids lower down. Each offer is accompanied
by a high electronic blip whose pitch varies with the level of the price.
For each bid, there's a blop at a suitably lower pitch. <BR>
<BR>
What the audience can see, but the traders can't (although they have the
information), is a line sloping down and to the right which represents the
theoretical minimum value of the commodity being traded; and another line,
higher and farther to the right representing the theoretical maximum. <BR>
<BR>
As the seconds tick by, a few yellow blobs (transactions) appear between
the minimum and maximum lines, then more as the market gets into its stride.
Traders are getting the measure of each other and developing a feel for
where the price should be. It travels tentatively upward as the bids begin
to outnumber the offers. Clearly, the market believes the commodity is underpriced.
The blops exceed the blips and the blues the reds. The quadraphonic sound
conveys a sense of rising frenzy. And sure enough, the frenzy takes the
yellow blobs (transactions) higher and higher until they are well beyond
the theoretical maximum. Then they hesitate. The audience of sophisticated
investors knows there's going to be a crash as surely as if they were watching
a Disney character who had just run over a cliff. The bids dry up, the offers
scream into a steep dive and the price drops by 50% in three seconds. The
sophisticated investors clap and cheer with delight. They themselves have
felt this fear and greed, but for once they are seeing it happen to the
other guy. <BR>
<BR>
Charles Plott, professor of economics at California Institute of Technology
(Caltech), has been running artificial markets in laboratory conditions
for over 20 years. But it is only recently that the investment community
has begun to show much interest in his work. Maybe the trigger has been
advances in computer graphics which allow him to show vividly and dramatically
how closely his artificial markets parallel real markets. They parallel
real market dynamics but they show markets stripped of all noise, complexity
and extraneous detail. They demonstrate how, in relatively free markets,
information is communicated rapidly through the price mechanism. In laboratory
conditions, Plott and his colleagues can study, with some hope of accuracy,
the effect of introducing a derivative or a new regulation, or of seeding
a trader or group of traders with inside information, for example. Regulators
and lawyers are naturally interested. In fact, they were quicker than the
investment community to spot the potential of artificial markets. <BR>
<BR>
The basis of a laboratory market is as follows. Plott induces Caltech students
or other groups of participants to spend an evening trading in his lab situated
in the basement of the humanities and social sciences building. The incentive,
apart from curiosity, is that they can earn real money, perhaps as much
as $200. They sit in cubicles at computer terminals and trade for a series
of sessions, typically seven minutes long, according to rules and incentives
provided for that particular market. They might be buying or selling a security
whose dividend is uncertain but might pay out 200, 400, 600 or zero units
(see example below). They might be trading six securities of which only
one or two are expected to pay a dividend. There may be an option in the
market which puts a floor of 200 on the dividend payout. <BR>
<BR>
However artificial the conditions, it is quickly apparent that, even with
as few as three players, a market has been created in which trading skills,
psychology and sentiment play as big a role as fundamentals. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The people who caused that bubble [beyond the theoretical maximum]
and the subsequent crash were not stupid,&quot; says Plott. &quot;They were
playing against each other as much as they were watching the fundamentals.
Their mistake was to think they could get out before the others.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To date, the real-world applications of Plott's markets have been more in
the bidding auction and anti-trust area. For example, his simulations of
&quot;smart&quot; markets - in which bids for, say, packages of cable TV
licences or airport landing slots are made contingent on other bids - have
helped anti-trust bodies or governments to find the optimum outcome. &quot;It's
like fitting together a jigsaw whose pieces are constantly changing shape,&quot;
says Plott. <BR>
<BR>
For years, Plott has accepted stoically that Wall Street traders think they
know more about the real market than he can teach them in a lab. &quot;Fish
aren't interested in hydrodynamics,&quot; he philosophizes. In the 1970s,
after contacts with Chicago theorists such as Eugene Fama, it was clear
that the market academics were preoccupied with the US stock market, whereas
Plott was looking at the dynamics of any market anywhere. In the early 1980s,
bond brokers Cantor Fitzgerald tried to apply some of Plott's findings to
real trading, &quot;but it wasn't very successful&quot;, says Plott. <BR>
<BR>
Most support for Plott's lab has come from General Motors, Hewlett-Packard,
Pacific Bell, IBM and General Electric. The government's National Science
Foundation has funded him for years and has just agreed to put in another
$1 million. For Wall Street firms, setting up such a lab would be pin-money.
The hardware and software would cost around $100,000 and a series of experiments,
including incentives for the traders, would need perhaps $20,000. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the number of similar labs worldwide is growing. The first one
ever was set up by Vernon Smith, professor at the University of Arizona.
Now there are labs in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Bonn, Bielefeld, Grenoble,
Siena, Turin, Stockholm, York and Zurich. The lab in Bielefeld is the creation
of Reinhardt Selten, co-winner of the Nobel prize in 1994 for his work on
game theory. Game theory is eminently testable in these artificial market
conditions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Applications</B> <BR>
<BR>
At the end of December, Plott was due to run his first artificial market
globally, via the World Wide Web, with participants in Sweden, the Netherlands,
France, Australia, New Zealand, and &quot;a couple in the States&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
For him, this is a shot across the bows of real-world practitioners. Why
not have a real market on the World Wide Web? Up to now, the technology
has been too slow for real-time trading, but Plott foresees that computerized
custom-built markets could be set up on the web for specific commodities
or franchises such as time-share on space stations. A handful of competitors
could set up a market for almost no cost. The only problem might be regulation.
<BR>
<BR>
For the financial community, many possible applications are offered by artificial
markets: <BR>
<BR>
1 By comparing artificial market dynamics with those of real markets, it
may be possible to cut out much of the irrelevant complexity and noise -
perhaps establishing where the true market sentiment is leading. (Many theorists
might say this is impossible, arguing that it is the noise that makes the
market.) <BR>
<BR>
2 Learning much more about &quot;cognitive bias&quot; among market players.
This refers to the tendency for investors to be influenced by factors other
than price information - such as overreaction after suffering a loss, feeding
frenzy as the market rises, overweighting of recent data, myopic following
of market sentiment and reaction to arbitrary posted prices. <BR>
<BR>
3 Artificial markets might give a better understanding of how derivatives
and hedging mechanisms affect overall price discovery and market volatility.
(One problem with laboratory markets is that, while students like to win
money, they're reluctant to lose it, and collecting debts from them is difficult.
So it has been hard for Plott to create conditions in which traders short
the market or otherwise leverage their bets.) <BR>
<BR>
4 It might be a cheaper way to train or classify traders than letting them
loose on real markets. Plott has occasionally got professionals to trade
his markets and says that &quot;the greed is still there&quot; even if the
sums at stake are paltry by professional standards. Plott finds he is easily
able to put the traders he employs into one of two categories: wolves and
rabbits. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The rabbits are very myopic, risk-averse but impulsive,&quot; says
Plott. &quot;The moment they see something to their advantage - bang - they
hit it. So market information goes screaming past them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The wolves, on the other hand, understand the rabbits and they're
watching the market. They set traps. The professional market-makers are
really good at that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Applications for financial lawyers and regulators might be: <BR>
<BR>
1 Evidence from artificial markets to help prove or strongly suggest the
presence of insider dealing. Plott's experiments show that, when information
is seeded to a single insider dealer, within seconds, the market seems collectively
to acquire that information even if individuals don't see it. &quot;You
are made aware that rationality is not common knowledge,&quot; says Plott.
<BR>
<BR>
2 Ways of structuring new markets could be tested in the lab before expensive
mistakes are made. This might include markets where parameters such as minimum
prices or interest rate levels are set by the authorities. A lab might also
be a testing-ground for modifications to existing markets such as the New
York Stock Exchange's specialist market-maker system. <BR>
<BR>
Plott's audience in Phoenix on November 2 were institutional clients of
New York fund manager Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark. Scudder president Ed
Villana is an economist with more than a passing interest in Plott's work.
Phil Fortuna, a managing director at Scudder, believes there are &quot;some
real applications for Dr Plott's experiments&quot;. He suggests it would
cost next to nothing for a Wall Street firm to supply Plott with tick data
from the market, so that real-market bubbles could be overlaid on artificial
bubbles and compared in detail. Musing why this hasn't happened already,
Fortuna says: &quot;The trouble is he doesn't have the tick data and we
don't have the patience.&quot; Another turn-off for the financial community,
suggests Fortuna, is the sheer simplicity of Plott's experiments: &quot;The
quants want fractals and neural networks. His stuff comes from a different
discipline.&quot; But Fortuna is convinced that Plott's experiments would
merit further study by Wall Street. <BR>

Homage to Fischer Black </H3>
&quot;Fischer Black is a nihilist!&quot; was one of the more colourful insults
Black invited on himself for his distrust of market data as the raw material
of quantitative research. &quot;Time itself is a suspicious variable,&quot;
Black once told this magazine. <BR>
<BR>
But perhaps his natural opponents will not be so emotional about his final
work, published last year, which is an attempt, almost biblical in its simplicity
and clarity, to rewrite the basics of utility theory and general equilibrium.
<BR>
<BR>
Black, a partner of Goldman Sachs from 1984, and former professor of finance
at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, died in August. Together
with Myron Scholes, he developed the widely used Black-Scholes formula for
option valuation, published in 1973. Here are some passages from his last
work, <I>Exploring General Equilibrium</I>, The MIT Press, 1995 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Volatility</B> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Given the volatility of expectations, I'm surprised that asset prices
aren't more volatile than they are. We see asset volatility for the same
reasons that we see variation in growth rates across countries and through
time, and for the same reasons that we see business cycles. The questions
are different, but the answer is the same. Asset prices vary because we
make highly specific investments while looking far into the future; as time
goes by, we change our beliefs about the future along many dimensions, which
makes our investments seem more relevant - or less relevant - and thus changes
the values of claims on those investments. Sometimes asset prices change
because we become more patient - or less patient - and sometimes they change
because we become more tolerant of risk - or less tolerant of risk - but
we don't need those sources of volatility to understand why prices often
change for no apparent reason. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The details matter. We can't understand the powerful role of varying
expectations without looking at outputs that range from peanuts to spaceships,
and at inputs that range from truck driving skills to experience in doing
coronary bypass operations. We just can't understand volatility using a
model that has two inputs and one output, or even one that has 200 inputs
and outputs. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Prices will continue to change in response to forces that we can't
easily measure, and people will continue to claim that markets have 'excess
volatility'. To me, the volatility in market prices seems normal and consistent
with the volatility in national growth rates and in cyclical measures of
business activity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Econometrics</B> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I feel that econometric studies of time-series data tell us very little
about the economy ... <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Econometric studies can tell us about variances and covariances, including
auto- covariances. They can tell us about correlations, including partial
correlations. But they can't tell us anything direct about cause or effect,
impact or influence, structure or meaning. We kid ourselves when we say
that one variable helps to 'explain' another. This sounds like causation,
but really means only correlation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Financial intermediation</B> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a country grows, it invests in more and more elaborate forms of
financial intermediation. In effect, its markets become more complete. Its
residents can diversify better, or hedge the risks they take, or align ownership
and control for the investments they make. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In general, this reduces the price-of-risk part of the cost of capital.
It increases the expected payoff for taking more risk, as with added specialization
or more roundabout production. Increasing the payoff means the economy takes
more risk. Expected growth increases, asset volatility increases, and average
unemployment increases. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Financial intermediation improves the terms on which people take risk,
but it actually increases the risk we measure in the economy.&quot;<p>

<H3>INVESTMENT BANKING</H3> 
<H2>Virtue in virtuality </H2>
<H4>It's so lean it doesn't have an office. It's so flexible it has no capital,
no balance sheet and no settlement staff. If it moves, outsource it. This
is the virtual investment bank. <BR>
David Shirreff reports </H4>
Lhasa, December 2001. Shell-holes still ventilate the Potala Palace - the
official residence of the Dalai Lama and his new social-democrat government.
The week-old Buddhist Republic of Tibet is open for business. <BR>
<BR>
And here, ahead of the pack, at the Lhasa Hilton - a crumbling Maoist guest-house
- is Alec van Till, virtual investment banker. With his laptop and satellite
communications he's already selling down the Tibetan Republic's first jubilant
Eurobond. <BR>
<BR>
Van Till isn't talking to head office, because he doesn't have one. With
power of attorney as signatory for the Tibetan Republic, he's placing the
issue directly into the market. Lapsang Doso, the finance minister, is at
his elbow - they happened to be at Harvard together. The 4 1/4% yen bonds,
offered at a discount of 96, are already trading in the grey market at 98/99.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nice work, Till,&quot; says Doso. &quot;This calls for some buttered
tea!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Okay. I'll just pass the book to Bob.&quot; Bob Feigenbaum, one of
Till's partners, is somewhere up the Amazon, negotiating a hydropower contract.
Bob has some time on his hands before the 10am meeting shown in his diary.
Since the time is 8am for Bob and 6.30pm for Alec, Bob should be able to
hop from clearing to clearing, avoiding the parts where the rain-forest
canopy is thickest, to sell the bonds into European and US institutions,
and to private clients on the Internet, right through the Tibetan night.
By tomorrow morning, barring some bad figures out of Tokyo, Alec should
be able to tell Doso that his bonds are safely away. <BR>
<BR>
Buttered tea is an acquired taste - the butter is peppery and rancid. Alec
and his old room-mate chew the fat for 18 minutes and 47 seconds, then Alec
shows Doso the door. &quot;Sorry chum, it's back to work.&quot; He has a
conference call lined up with Bob in Brazil and Cindy in Beverly Hills.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The plot's good,&quot; says Cindy, &quot;boy meets girl, girl meets
alien, alien eats boy. But we'll have to work on the script.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Can you do that?&quot; asks Alec. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll do it this evening.&quot; Cindy, an MBA and English major, solves
such problems in her spare time. But her main task is putting together the
financing for Thompson studios. She and Emma have never worked together
before, but Emma just knows she has met Cindy in another life. Once the
script has a little added credibility Cindy should be able to raise senior
and mezzanine finance through her contacts in London, Berlin and New York.
<BR>
<BR>
The fourth member of the partnership interferes little with day-to-day developments.
He used to be one of the best - a soft-voiced corporate financier who worked
his way through two of the finest firms in the City before throwing in his
lot with a would-be global investment bank. It took him two years to conclude
there was no such thing nor could there be while investment banking was
weighed down with so much baggage - management committees, product groups,
risk controllers, credit and account officers, internal auditors, in-house
lawyers and consultants. With their meters running every second of the day,
they heaped up costs and slowed decision-making with meeting after meeting.
No wonder the financial sector was pricing itself out of business. <BR>
<BR>
Chester Black (for it is he) consigned himself to the wilderness for three
years, gathering information, pondering the meaning of finance and, occasionally,
of life itself. Distilling corporate finance to its essence, Black concluded
three elements were indispensable to a stripped-down investment banking
operation: <BR>
<BR>
1) Partnership - you can't do this stuff alone because people don't trust
you. <BR>
<BR>
2) A call on unlimited resources - but for limited amounts of time, perhaps
only milliseconds. <BR>
<BR>
3) Access to all available information - and inside information where possible.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite rule 1, he had to start on his own and do his first deal - to give
the thing credibility. He called his old friend at the World Bank, whom
he much admired, and said: &quot;Jim, you owe me one.&quot; <BR>
&quot;Chester, me old mate. Ask not what I can do for you, but what you
can do for <I>me</I>?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can save you millions of dollars in agency fees on your commercial
paper, Euronotes and medium-term notes. I can undercut any investment bank
in the world. Every risk you take with me is fully collateralized. The United
States of America will go bust before I do.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't <I>say</I> that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Black placed the first negative-coupon World Bank notes in Japan. But it
was short-term stuff - 21-day commercial paper. Then he did some for the
Asian Development Bank and the EBRD. His fees were a few thousand dollars
- another resolution he'd made in the wilderness: don't be greedy. <BR>
<BR>
Feigenbaum and van Till were figures from his previous incarnation - hard-working,
fast on their feet and, as far as he knew, totally honest. They didn't take
much persuading to join their former boss. Feigenbaum had been through a
messy divorce and welcomed the cut in pay; van Till was a wanderer, determined
to cover every forgotten corner of the planet before he died. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm running this as a non-profit-making organization,&quot; said Black
- another surprise. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Isn't that a contradiction in terms?&quot; said Feigenbaum. &quot;Or
are you following the Barings model?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're providing a service,&quot; said Black. &quot;Sooner or later
the financial sector has to stop gouging the rest of the economy. We'll
pay ourselves enough money to keep body and soul together. The rest goes
towards undermining the competition.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said van Till. &quot;Let me get this straight.
We work as investment bankers, provide value-added, then give up part of
the hard-won proceeds?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If they're excessive, yes. My god Alec, you look like someone just
tried to take your virginity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I feel a bit like that.&quot; But Alec came round to the idea. In
a few months he saw the wisdom of Black's cut-price policy. Business was
rolling in. In fact they were turning clients away and could select the
deals they wanted. <BR>
<BR>
The secret of their low fees is the minimal cost base. They have no offices.
True, they have computers, mobile phones, fax machines and modems, but they
carry them around. When Black, van Till and Feigenbaum travel, each takes
his office with him. The trio have face-to-face meetings in hotels, or video-conferences,
PC to PC, wherever they are. And van Till and Feigenbaum go to some weird
places - Lhasa is maybe the weirdest so far, but, with China set to balkanize
some more, van Till has opposition leaders in Urumqi and Kunming already
downloaded into his personal organizer. <BR>
<BR>
The beauty of the virtual bank is the absence of capital, or liabilities
of any sort in the accounting sense. It uses the balance sheets of its closest
clients and allies but only for the few minutes it takes to complete a transaction.
It is a broker but without being the markets' whipping-boy, because it relies
not on volume but on careful engineering of one-off structures. If there's
any repeat business, it's offered straight to a competitor. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're the poets of finance, the troubadours of treasury management,&quot;
says Black. The secret of the bank is access. Black operates best behind
closed doors, over late-night sandwiches and coffee, when his persuasive
powers go to work on the great and the good: they feel privileged to be
sharing his thoughts. <BR>
<BR>
But Black doesn't operate in a vacuum. His back-up is the young team who
constantly feed him ideas and information, and out-source specialist services.
For example, when Black was holed up in Bohemian Grove with Hafez Assad,
Dick Branson, Colin Powell and 100 other notables, putting together a world
market for fresh-water futures, Feigenbaum, van Till and Cindy were feeding
him documents and opinions by the hour on topics as diverse as water rights
in ancient Mesopotamia and the cost of delivering 100,000 tonnes of water
fob by road tanker to Baghdad. Feigenbaum had hooked up 33 specialists on
the Internet and was running a symposium. Cindy was already handling the
publication rights with 40 news agencies. This was instant history in the
making. <BR>
<BR>
Cindy Desjardins came to the party later than the others. She had a flair
for networking that initially attracted her to Black. But her skills have
developed beyond that into the legal and technical field. Now she is the
hub of a comprehensive outsourcing operation. <BR>
<BR>
Services - legal, financial engineering, deri-vatives pricing and structuring
(they could do this themselves, but it consumes valuable time and computer
power), credit assessment and market research - are bought as required.
Almost all these services can be sourced from the Internet. The trick is
to know where to search and how to extract the nuggets. The VIB's most valuable
tool - outsourced naturally - is the AI (artificial intelligence) bureau
in Clearwater, Florida, run by a crazy gang of alumni from the Santa Fe
Institute. They are a product of Black's wilderness years. Their learning-networks
find opportunities, not in the traded markets - that's too simplistic -
but in the political-economic landscape thrown up by the world's news services.
Every wire service, every serious newspaper, every analyst's report, is
scanned for ideas of value and the emerging picture plotted on a three-dimensional
screen. The opportunity in Lhasa, for example, had been earmarked three
years earlier when New China News Agency denied rumours of a nuclear accident
in Tibet. <BR>
<BR>
Black &amp; Co, as the bank is becoming known, has only an Internet address.
But it is regulated - by the banking authority in San Marino. Its capital
is its credibility and vice versa. It has acted as adviser to the Russian
government on renationalizing financial ser-vices. It did the first global
satellite insurance lottery, a huge operation which it masterminded from
the New York offices of Merrill Lynch. (Merrill charged nearly as much for
the office space as Black did in fees). Nobody won the jackpot, as the satellite
exploded, but having been shown the way, the UK's Camelot is working on
the next deal. <BR>
<BR>
There's no intrinsic reason why Black &amp; Co should do a better job than
the competition. But it charges less. And its total independence is a rare
virtue in the age of the global conglomerate (often the result of the triple,
even quadruple, financial mergers of the 1990s, and still being digested).
Black &amp; Co has a reputation for &quot;extremely focused, state-of-the-art
transactions&quot; - at least, that is what its bullshit-board on the Internet
says. <BR>
<BR>
Most focused perhaps was the Albania-Microsoft debt/equity swap, in which
the US software giant converted all the republic's outstanding debt into
a 30-year bond fully collateralized with MS paper, in exchange for a nationwide
telecommunications and cyberspace franchise. (Monopolies, properly regulated,
are back in fashion.) <BR>
<BR>
Many people apply to join Black &amp; Co as partners or hedge-fund investors.
But Black turns them down. He wants the operation to stay lean and mean.
He wants clients and potential clients to continue clamouring for attention.
And there is no desire to play the financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The markets,&quot; says Black, &quot;are a Dante's <I>Inferno</I>
of emotions. The only way to be master of them is to cultivate absolute
indifference to any outcome. Of course, you sympathize with the fortunes
of your clients and you want them to prosper, but it's not the same as living
and dying each day with your positions. I did enough of that in the 1990s.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Black &amp; Co belies the popular belief that a financial intermediary must
supplement its margin income by trading on the deal-flow it sees and trying
to get the best order-fills. &quot;That isn't why we're here,&quot; says
Black. <BR>
<BR>
Why <I>are</I> you here? ask his critics. You don't appear to be fulfilling
the functions expected of an investment bank. You farm out every useful
task on which you could make money. What service can you possibly be providing
- apart from flattering the egos of your so-called clients - that they couldn't
get from 50 other international investment banks? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We hold up a mirror,&quot; says Black. &quot;We're like psychiatrists.
We show the client that ultimately he doesn't need us: once we've stripped
away the trappings and paraphernalia of financial intermediation, he finally
sees the emperor has no clothes. He can go out there and do it himself,
for the cost of a link to the Internet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
<H3>Living with zero capital </H3>
<I>Extract from a paper delivered by Chester Black at the </I>XVI<I>th annual
meeting of the Internet Securities and Derivatives Association, Reykjavik,
July 2001.</I> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I would like to describe to you how, with zero assets and zero liabilities,
we are able to operate as a bank. This would not have been possible a few
years, even 18 months, ago. Now via the Internet we have not only armies
of tele-workers placing and trading securities on a freelance basis - according
to a strict code of practice - and a virtual back office somewhere in cyberspace
processing and settling trades and keeping accounts, we also have access
to virtual capital. Some of you sitting here may be among the generous providers.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our virtual capital is a standby facility, like a standby credit facility.
We have standby capital facilities with 17 leading international banks giving
us a possible total capital base at any time of $10.3 billion. (I hasten
to add we've never yet drawn down anything like that amount.) When the capital
is drawn down, for a bond or equity underwriting, or some other financial
risk, the return to the provider is not fixed interest but a share of Black
&amp; Co's final profit on the transaction - this pleases Islamic bankers.
Also, very important, the provider is reimbursed the cost of a deep out-of-the-money
option which we recommend it buys to hedge the market risk. The longer we
utilize the capital, the bigger the provider's share of the profit. That
gives us an incentive to turn the transaction round as fast as we can. Sometimes
it takes a few electronic milliseconds, while our tribe of tele-freelancers
transmit confirmations back to us. Occasionally it takes a little longer,
because of technical breakdowns, unresponsive counterparties, and even human
error. Yes, we are human. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've often been asked: 'Why <I>not</I> have capital? Capital is a
cushion. You need its protection for when things go badly wrong.' I agree.
Capital <I>is</I> a cushion. That's its problem. It's too bloody comfortable
(pardon my French), and it sends you to sleep. Absence of capital gives
us the adrenalin we need. We buy it in when we need it, from those who are
happy to share the risk with us for an hour or two. Their reward for that
moment of risk is usually worth it. And with downside protection it's a
better risk than, for example, the daylight risk that banks used to accept
- and some still do - on foreign exchange transactions with counterparties
in a different time zone.&quot;<BR>

<H2>DEMOCRACY AND REFORM </H2>
<H4>The deputy head of the IMF, Stanley Fischer, has proved to be <BR>
a quiet but influential force behind the Fund's strategy. Interview by Francis
Harris </H4>
Stanley Fischer has been with the International Monetary Fund for little
over a year and is widely viewed as having had considerable influence in
his role assisting managing director Michael Camdessus with strategic and
policy matters. Zambian-born Fischer was one of three deputy managing directors
to join the IMF last year, along with colleagues Alassane Ouattara and Prabhakar
Narvekar who are there largely to lift the administrative load. <BR>
<BR>
Brought in especially for his credentials as an economist, which are impressive,
he combines the theoretical experience as head of the economics department
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the practical experience
of his time as chief economist with the World Bank. He also built an impressive
network of personal relationships with leading financial figures during his
days at MIT. <BR>
<BR>
Fischer took time out at Davos to talk to <I>World Link</I> and expand on
issues in east-central Europe and in Africa, including the economic benefits
of democracy for reforming economies and the effects of corruption. <BR>
<BR>
<I>You have said that in the '80s, it was fashionable to suggest that reforming
economies had to be dictatorships. Is this still true now?</I> <BR>
<BR>
It was argued in the '80s, based largely on [the case of] Chile. I remember
having this argument at the World Bank and saying 'What about Mexico?' and
'What about Israel?' and people said 'Oh, those are special cases'. The
policies needed for reform are frequently quite difficult [to implement]
and people thought you needed a Pinochet to do it. Well, in the '90s we
have seen country after country reform as democracies. This is particularly
so in Argentina and Brazil and the extraordinarily powerful example of transitional
countries [in the former socialist bloc] where those which moved most rapidly
on democracy have also moved most rapidly on the economy. I think there
is a lot of evidence that, at the very least, having a democratic government
is not bad for reform. I was asked [recently] why we do not emphasise democracy
instead of growth and I said I did not see them as alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
In the South African case we have seen a government with broad popular support
following very responsible policies: it has maintained a stable macroeconomic
programme, it has succeeded in getting inflation down [and in getting] the
balance of payments under control. So the notion that you cannot have a
pro-growth strategy with democracy strikes me as wrong. Nor are there very
many Pinochets or reforming dictators you can point to. <BR>
<BR>
In the Latin American context, the question was phrased the wrong way. If
you asked whether dictatorships achieved higher or lower growth, the answer
was almost certainly &quot;lower&quot; once you take into account the countless
failed dictatorships. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Is this issue buried now? Surely many people still believe dictatorships
are good for business?</I> <BR>
<BR>
It has certainly been raised as an issue in Russia, where some believe that
you need a Pinochet to push things through. It is hard to push through harsh
measures but the sort of dictatorship that can really do that is very rare.
The lesson from eastern Europe is that although reform measures were harsh
and although governments that implemented them often lost power, their successors
have not changed those reform policies. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Some commentators suggest that the imf is being pressured by members
to lend money to keep Russian President Boris Yeltsin in power.</I> <BR>
<BR>
There is one fact: in 1995 Russia stuck exactly to the programme [agreed
with the IMF]: not many countries have performed in this way. On that basis
it would be quite hard to say no to Russia. You cannot do it on the basis
of rhetoric, since almost every government facing elections says all sorts
of things. The Russians will doubtless argue that they should be judged
on their record, not their words. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Despite continuing reforms in east-central Europe, there are a number
of governments like that in Slovakia which seem instinctively opposed to
their own reform programmes. Might not a backtracking Russia spark a wider
reaction against market reforms?</I> <BR>
<BR>
It is possible they will backtrack but that won't help: it is still going
to be very hard for them. After all, what happened in eastern Europe? The
old communist system was not a disaster - people were not starving,
they had roofs over their heads - it was just that after 40 years of
watching what was happening across borders, people realised that they were
going to fall further and further behind. It is going to happen again if
they backtrack. The way the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and Slovenians are
moving will make it very hard for other countries to backtrack for long.
When and if they do it, I do not see them making it work: no one ever has.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>That is a rational argument, but the desire to backtrack is often romantic
rather than rational. </I><BR>
<BR>
Look, there are things which lie deep within people. Somebody once challenged
a colleague to name something in economics which was not obvious and he
came up with the theory of comparative advantage. I think the fact that
everyone can benefit from free trade is also not obvious. Protectionism is
more intuitive. Many people believe they should protect their industries:
American congressmen say it, British MPs say it no doubt. Will they go for
protectionism for a while? They may, before they realise the trouble they
have created. But we should not exaggerate [the trouble]: there are varying
degrees of state ownership around the world, quite a lot of it in Europe.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Can we move on to Africa, which seems to take a back seat to other parts
of the world? Judging by news reports, the continent is in a mess. Why should
one be optimistic about Africa?</I> <BR>
<BR>
I don't think anyone should be optimistic: they should be realistic and
recognise that there are many Africas, countries which are doing well under
very difficult circumstances. You can go through a litany of troubles which
apply to Africa in general: per capita income has fallen; there have been
terrible civil wars, Aids is a problem. That is the undifferentiated picture
of Africa, but it is the wrong one because there is reason to think that
the situation can be turned around with the right policies. <BR>
<BR>
Look at Uganda, where growth has been above 7% for a long time, or Botswana
which had the highest growth rate in the world in the '80s. The reaction
in Senegal and Ivory Coast to devaluation of the region's CFA franc is very
encouraging. So you should look around Africa and see countries which are
beginning to do the right things. Africa does not have the broad-based education
or infrastructure to operate at east Asian rates of growth, but it can certainly
grow faster than it has been. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Is the sheer scale of poverty there not fearsome?</I> <BR>
<BR>
The population problem is no joke, the sheer weight of young people. The
African problem is that the population is too small but is growing too fast.
There are not many markets there. Often, when you hear people complain of
migration from the interior to Dakar or Abidjan, you look at the interior
and ask whether migration isn't a good thing. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Corruption seems to be mentioned more often in Africa than elsewhere.</I>
<BR>
<BR>
It does exist there. There are two [problems about] governance: one is corruption
and the other is sheer inability to govern. In the latter case, the writ
of government does not run very far even if it is honest. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Corruption exists elsewhere of course. Is it just a difference of scale?
Does corruption send successful economies off the rails?</I> <BR>
<BR>
I think it is a difference of scale relative to the economy. What some people
have done in Africa impoverishes the system. The donors have been pretty
effective at limiting the damage, but the issue is how to train people to
worry about honesty. While you can think of systems largely free of corruption
which still run badly, and corrupt systems that run well, the IMF and the
World Bank do try to help put proper systems in place. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Do you foresee a time when this will cease to be an issue because free
market institutions are working and the government can be bypassed?</I>
<BR>
<BR>
It is far more likely to stop because people get fed up with it. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The imf has been criticised for being too soft on some governments, approving
ineffective reform strategies and so opening the door prematurely to private
lending. What is your reaction to that?</I> <BR>
<BR>
It's not something I discount. There is an argument that... as long as you
try to help some countries you preserve them from the consequences of what
they are doing. There are occasions when I am tempted to think that the
lifeline does stop some people swimming, just as there is research to suggest
that having a car seatbelt makes some people drive faster. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Are there governments which think they are so important that you would
never cut them off?</I> <BR>
<BR>
I do not know who you are thinking of. In the case of Zaire we did [cut
them off], in the case of Nigeria we've stopped [funds] and we've held up
disbursements for other important countries. Nonetheless, there may be a
sense that the international community will [still] rescue struggling countries
somehow or other. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Of course that has happened several times, when donors gang up to tell
the imf a tough course of action is impossible.</I> <BR>
<BR>
Donors have also been good on the other side. There have been many times
when they have been very supportive. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Is there any difference in approach between the imf and the World Bank?</I>
<BR>
<BR>
When I was at the World Bank they used to tell me the difference between
us and the Fund was that we would decide how much money was needed for the
country to grow, and then go and get it, whereas the Fund would see how
much was available and tailor the programme to fit. There's something to
that. But in the end you had better tailor the programme to fit the amount
of money. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Has pressure on the imf grown in recent years? Are the major players
more likely to exert pressure on behalf of friendly states?</I> <BR>
<BR>
I have only been with the IMF for a little over a year and I am more struck
by how much they leave us alone. <p>

<H3><B> JAPAN BOND ISSUE </B></H3>



<H2><B>Breaking out of bondage</B></H2>

<H4>
<B>Japanese bond issuance sharply increased in the first nine months of this year as borrowers rushed to raise funds before interest rates rose. But the revival might fade next year. Charles Olivier reports from Tokyo on changing attitudes to capital-raising</B>
</H4>
<P>
It had to come. After years of disappointingly low issuance, the Japanese domestic bond market has at last begun to bloom. Japanese companies issued more than &#165;6,950 billion ($69 billion) of bonds and &#165;189 billion of private debt placements in the first nine months of 1996, according to the Bond Underwriters Association of Japan. Total issuance for the year could be as much as &#165;10,000 billion, nearly double the &#165;5,046 billion that was issued in the whole of 1995.

<P>
Local bankers believe the spate of issuance will continue as more electricity utility companies begin to tap the market. "We have seen historically high levels of issuance this year," says Noriyki Ushiyama, deputy general manager of capital markets at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. "And I think we will see similar amounts next year." Capital expenditure increased by more than 7% in the first half of 1996 and corporate investment levels are rising.

<P>
International issuance by Japanese borrowers has also increased, although at a less spectacular rate. Between January and September 1996, more than $38.4 billion of debt was issued by Japanese borrowers according to Capital DATA Bondware, close to the $44.6 billion raised in the whole of 1995. In addition, there was a queue of corporate borrowers considering Eurobond deals, including Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), Kansai Electric and NTT, which are all reported to be considering launching Eurobond deals in the next two months. Chugu Electric is believed to be considering a EuroFrench franc issue. 

<P>
The dramatic rise in issuance, particularly in the domestic market, has raised hopes that Japanese companies at last might be breaking free from the banks that have provided the bulk of local financing needs for the past 50 years. Of all external financing for companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 46% is now believed to come from the capital markets, up from 24% in 1974. "Issuers are definitely moving away from bank loans to the capital markets," reports Keiichi Mitake, general manager of capital markets at Yamaichi Securities.

<P>
The rise in domestic issuance has occurred for three reasons: low interest rates, the de-regulation of Japanese capital markets and the changing relationship between banks and borrowers.

<P>
At 0.5%, Japan's official discount rate has never been lower. This has encouraged investors, both institutional and retail, to move out of bank deposits and bank debentures into the bond market. Corporate bond yields have dipped from 4.52% in May 1995 to 2.8% in October 1996 as a result. The decline in bond yields has not been smooth. The bond market fell sharply in the early months of the year after strong growth figures raised fears that an interest rate rise was in the offing. However, most local economists now believe that interest rates will remain at 0.5% until the middle of next year. On October 21, the central bank governor announced that rates would not be increased this year.

<P>
<B>Broken bonds</B>

<P>
The close ties that have linked banks and borrowers in the past, to the detriment of the local capital markets, have also begun to weaken. Having taken big write-downs on bad loans, Japanese banks are lending less. In July 1996, outstanding bank loans to corporates fell to around &#165;11 trillion, a marked decline on the &#165;31 trillion figure for December 1994. Many are now demanding tighter covenants on the loans that they do make in an attempt to avoid the mistakes of previous years.

<P>
The three big banks lending to corporates &#173; the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), the Long-Term Credit Bank and Norinchukin &#173; which were allowed to underwrite bond issues for the first time in 1993, are now encouraging corporate borrowers to refinance their loans in the bond markets in an attempt to provide more business for their fledgling securities operations. "The balance of power between banks and corporates is definitely changing," says Hiro Suzuki, executive director of Morgan Stanley's Tokyo office. 

<P>
"In the past, many banks encouraged companies to remain on bank borrowing, that is, to roll over their loans. Now, the parent bank is suggesting that they refinance the loan with a bond issue using their securities arm. It's like a deal between the borrower and the bank."

<P>
The recent deregulation of the Japanese capital markets has increased the delay on issuance, more so than these previous factors, but its long-term effects are likely to be of increased significance. In January 1996, non-investment-grade companies were permitted to issue domestic bonds for the first time. Regulations on the amount of collateral required, such as promises on future dividend ratios, and the total size of issuance, have also been removed. In February 1996, the government announced that it would allow asset-backed deals. Two months later, the regulations stifling the repo market were also lifted.

<P>
The removal of restrictions has yet to have much impact on debt issuance. However, there are signs that it will. Fuji, a supermarket chain from northern Japan, is planning an equity-linked bond, the first non-investment-grade bond issue in the Japanese domestic market. Ushiyama at Nomura believes that there will be more junk issues in future. "Most Japanese investors don't like to buy non-investment-grade issues. However, they are finding it very difficult to find good investments. So they are becoming more conscious of [the possibilities of] higher-yielding paper. Securities companies are putting more emphasis on promoting the junk bond market," he says.

<P>
<B>Less godly MoF</B>

<P>
In April, Daiwa Securities lead-managed the first asset-backed deal, a &#165;20 billion receivables-backed for Orico, a local consumer-credit company. Rival bankers allege that Daiwa may have been forced to hold on to most of the paper after mispricing the deal. But many senior bankers, such as Hiroshi Suzuki, managing director of IBJ Securities, believe the market will grow in time. "I think we will see more asset-backed deals in future," he says.

<P>
Significantly, the influence of the ministry of finance, which has exerted near god-like control over local debt issuance, shows signs of fading. In February 1996, prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced the launch of a study into the possible break-up of the ministry, which has responsibility for tax, budgets, financial supervision and management of state-owned assets. 

<P>
The majority of issues have been fixed-rate bonds in maturities of three to five years.  But with interest rates unlikely to move lower, many borrowers are keen to extend the maturity profile of their debt; however, many have been put off issuing longer-dated bonds by the steepness of the yield curve over five years. Hiro Suzuki at Morgan Stanley believes this is unlikely to change in the near future. "Most banks have been able to stay profitable by taking deposits on the short term, and lending on the long term. 

<P>
"If the yield curve suddenly became flatter, a lot of the banks would go bust. This is something the ministry of finance is obviously keen to avoid." 

<P>
But with investors hungry for higher coupons, some of the top-rated companies have been able to extend their maturity profiles considerably by issuing so-called super-long bonds. Tepco and Chubu Electric have both brought 20-year deals to the market, and in October, Nikko Securities did a &#165;30 billion 10-year deal for NTT, the state-owned telecoms company.

<P>
Significantly, it appears the problem of poor pricing is being overcome. In the past, top-rated companies have been deterred from issuing in the domestic market because AAA-rated bonds were priced at almost the same level as A-rated bonds. Most bonds were priced on a coupon basis according to perceived investor demand. Local securities firms are, however, beginning to price more bonds on a spread to Japanese government bonds. In February 1996, Nomura launched a 10-year deal for Hitachi using this method. At &#165;2,000 billion in size, it was also the largest bond issue completed by a private-sector Japanese corporate in the domestic market. 

<P>
According to Hiroshi Suzuki, of IBJ Securities, pricing is now more transparent that in past years. "Spreads between the different credit ratings have widened considerably this year. The spread between a triple-B-rated issuer and a single-A rated issuer, for example, is now between 30 and 40 basis points. Between double-A and triple-A it is around 15bp," he says.

<P>
The increased use of spread-based pricing is indicative of a trend among corporate borrowers to take a sophisticated approach to debt issuance. Some have begun to offer gifts in order to attract retail investors. Orix, Japan's largest leasing company, for example, announced that it would offer lottery tickets and telephone cards to investors who bought its five-year &#165;10 billion issue. Tokyo Dome, operator of Tokyo's largest sporting and entertainment venue, is offering lottery prizes on its &#165;20 billion issue.

<P>
One of the most striking developments in the local market has been the increase in structured deals. A number of foreign issuers have come to the market with highly structured bonds targeted at yield-hungry investors, such as dual-currency bonds, callable notes, swaption callable notes and reverse dual-currency bonds. Many of these borrowers have been able to achieve extraordinary low funding costs in this way. Some dual-currency bonds, for example, are believed to have a post-swap cost of 60bp under Libor. 

<P>
Japanese borrowers have begun to warm to the advantages of structured deals. Nissho Iwai, for example, launched an Australian dollar-denominated domestic bond in 1993. Marubeni did a dual-currency bond in October 1995. Several firms have completed callable bonds, including Itochu, Nippon Steel, Nissho Iwai and Sumitomo Metal Industries. Mitsubishi has even done an exchangeable bond that can be converted into Japanese government bonds. A number of foreign firms, such as Merrill Lynch (which arranged the first callable bond deal for Itochu), are now putting more resources into marketing these structures to Japanese corporates, but Keni Kawashima, managing director of debt capital markets at Merrill's Tokyo office, admits that it is a slow process.

<P>
Most companies remain wary of jeopardizing their relationship with local investors by issuing a bond that goes wrong. "Dual-currency bonds have a currency risk for investors," says Masayoshi Okamura, manager of the debt division at Nikko Securities. "Japanese companies are unwilling to put their investors at risk."

<P>
<B>Equity-linked hope</B>

<P>
With the stock market showing negligible gains for most of the year, issuance of equity-linked domestic debt has been lower than straight debt. In the first nine months of the year, convertible bonds, for example, accounted for only &#165;2,450 billion of the &#165;6,950 billion of total debt issued. However, there are hopes that it will increase in the fourth quarter. "Equity-linked issues are becoming more popular," says Suzuki at IBJ. 

<P>
"The stock market is showing a steady recovery and most investors now believe it is on an upward path. Some issuers have been able to achieve very low costs with coupons as low as 0.5%."

<P>
With the local markets offering such low-cost rates of funding, international debt issuance by Japanese corporates has not shown such a high level of growth. Nevertheless, figures for the first six months show that overseas financing is rising. A total $38.44 billion of debt was issued by Japanese borrowers in the first nine months of the year, compared with $44.67 billion in the whole of 1995. The bulk of issuance was by private companies, which accounted for $22.16 billion of the total raised, although utilities ($3.02 billion) and private banks ($7.2 billion) also issued significant amounts. 

<P>
As in previous years, the most popular currencies were the yen, which accounted for $15.4 billion of issuance, and the US dollar ($13.3 billion). However, the Swiss franc market continued to provide significant amounts of equity-linked funding for lower-rated companies ($5.05 billion).

<P>
However, there has been a greater variety of issuance than before. Following the Japanese Export-Import Bank's EuroFrench franc issue (a Ffr1.5 billion 11-year deal via Banque Paribas), French franc issuance by Japanese borrowers has reached record levels. Four French franc Eurobonds have been launched so far this year, raising a total of $1.96 billion. In July 1996, Toyota Motor Credit Corp (Japan's answer to GECC) launched the first Swedish krona deal by a Japanese borrower: a Skr500 million ($75 million) five-year deal via Deutsche Bank. The following month, it tapped the New Zealand dollar market, the first Japanese issuer to do so since 1989.

<P>
Almost all the Euroyen issuance was by overseas finance subsidiaries of large Japanese corporates and banks. With the yen beginning to rise against the dollar, Euroyen bonds have been particularly popular, with a range of international institutional investors looking to make currency gains. However, most Japanese Euroyen issues continue to be bought by Japanese investors. 

<P>
Eurodollar issuance has been driven by municipal issuers, such as the City of Yokohama and the Metropolis of Tokyo, both of which did 10-year Eurodollar deals in September 1996. Bank borrowers and top-rated corporates from the utility sectors have also been active. However, a number of lesser-known issuers have also tapped the market, such as IG Kogyo, Tampopo, NGK Spark Plug and Royal Ltd, a fast-food restaurant chain. 

<P>
With so many firms, Japanese and international, issuing Euroyen deals, the swap opportunities for Japanese borrowers issuing dollar-denominated debt are increasing. Suzuki at Morgan Stanley notes: "There has been a record amount of Euroyen issuance this year, which has been swapped back into dollars. This has had a one-way effect on the swap rate, which is 15 or 16 basis points over the basis swap. 

<P>
"So a Japanese issuer that does the exact opposite, that is, issues in dollars and swaps into yen, can achieve very attractive all-in costs."

<P>
Significantly, Japanese borrowers are starting to do bigger deals. In February, Chubu Electric issued a $550 million, five-year deal. This was followed by a $750 million, five-year bond issue by the Export-Import Bank of Japan, the biggest non-yen Eurobond by a Japanese government-backed borrower. It also had the distinction of being one of the first Japanese deals to be marketed simultaneously in Asia, Europe and the US. However, this has since been eclipsed by East Japan Railway's $800 million 10-year deal via Goldman Sachs and IBJ in September.

<P>
<B>Striking a new path</B>

<P>
In 1996 Japanese borrowers have become more adventurous in the types of issues they are willing to bring to the international markets, a move that coincides with the increasing number setting up MTN programmes. There have been a lot of so-called repackaged bonds, which incorporate currency swaps into standard equity-linked deals. The currency swap concept allows issuers to pay foreign currency coupons in yen.

<P>
This structure was first introduced into the Eurodollar market by Nomura in 1995 when Katakura Chicory, Sega Enterprises and Kuraya all launched fixed-rate dollar bonds with warrants. The zero-coupon and deep-discount bond have also made a return to the Japanese Eurobond market: Morgan Stanley has arranged a number of zero-coupon deals for Japanese borrowers, including a &#165;1.2 billion, five-year deal for Ricoh Finance Nederland. Morgan Stanley's Suzuki is reluctant to reveal the investor base for these bonds although he insists that it is all "perfectly legal".

<P>
Can the rise in debt issuance continue? All the evidence suggests that companies do not need to raise additional funds. In 1994, non-financial corporations ran an excess of savings over investment for the first time in the post-war period. Although capital spending is expected to rise through most of the year, corporate cashflow is expected to cover virtually all of the demand for capital spending and operating funds until late 1997. Suzuki at IBJ  says that "80% to 90% of the debt issued has been refinancing existing bank loans rather than new debt".

<P>
Moreover, corporate attitudes to debt-raising remain as conservative as ever. Many borrowers remain reluctant to refinance all their bank loans in the debt market for fear of alienating their relationship banks. Government financial institutions still provide loans and investment of 30% of GDP versus 0.42% in the US and 0.86% in the UK. Too many still insist on launching equity-linked debt rather than straight debt because it reduces outward cashflow even though it dilutes the value of existing equity.

<P>
There is also the danger that the domestic market might become flooded with government paper, making it difficult for corporates to raise funds at these rates for long. In September 1996, the government announced a &#165;3,000 billion spending package, and there is talk of another supplementary budget.

<P>
International debt issuance is still restricted to a very small group of companies, mainly the electric utilities, municipalities and government-backed issuers. Many Japanese firms remain little known outside Japan and urgently need to improve their overseas marketing campaigns. Recent talk of the tax break on Eurobond issues being removed has also raised fears that international issuance may fall. 

<P>
Despite the moves towards deregulation, the domestic market remains plagued by poor liquidity, slow settlement and the tendency of local investors to hold on to bonds until maturity, a habit that restricts the growth of the repo market and secondary market trading. Local rating agencies continue to grant high credit ratings to too many companies.

<P>
Local security firms remain wary of new market practices. The fixed-price re-offer mechanism introduced to the domestic market by Morgan Stanley in 1991 remains rarely used. Syndicate groups are still too large at 25 to 30 banks an issue, even on small deals, while bond pricing continues to be arbitrary. US bankers working in the Japanese market complain that spreads in the secondary market remain artificially wide; one US bank is reported to have left its prices unchanged for two weeks to see if anyone noticed. Nobody did. 

<P>
This is not to deny that progress has been made. Local retail investors, who have a mind-boggling &#165;1,131 trillion ($11 trillion) in assets, are becoming more adventurous and are now willing to buy bonds issued by sub-investment-grade sovereign issuers, such as Brazil. Many may soon be persuaded to buy a greater range of corporate issues.

<P>
The recent shift towards a more deregulated pension fund market may also encourage more firms to raise funds overseas. In February 1996, the government announced that it was lifting many of the restrictions on the use of foreign asset managers: since April trust banks have no longer had to invest over 50% of their assets in fixed-income investments and institutional investors are taking a more professional approach to fixed-income investment. Earlier this year, the Japan Welfare Corporation of pension funds shifted some of its money from the trust banks to outside investment managers with the instruction that the new fund managers should start to evaluate returns on a spread to JGB basis. This is expected to iron out some of the absurd inconsistencies on pricing.

<P>
But it is still too early to suggest that Japanese borrowers have fully embraced the concept of capital market funding. Many companies still aim to have at least 60% of their funding in bank loans. 

<P>
Meanwhile, international funding is likely to remain restricted by the low level of domestic interest rates. As in politics, financial change is likely to come slowly to the land of the rising sun.&#009;*

<P>
<I>Japan's Export-Import Bank rules out no source of funding outside Japan, but it's being conservative about structured deals, </I>MTN<I>s and when to do its first global, says director of international funding Mosato Ari</I>

<P>
We issue between three and four bonds a year in the international markets. We are not allowed to issue in the domestic market. For the fiscal year ending March 1997 we have a funding need of about $1.8 billion in the capital market. So far this year we have issued a Ffr1.5 billion [around $300 million equivalent] 11-year bond and a $750 million five-year bond. So we will be looking to raise up to $750 million.

<P>
<B>What funding benchmarks do you use?</B>

<P>
We don't have any specific cost targets. Recently, we have swapped most of our funds into dollars, so you could say we use a US dollar benchmark. This is because the proceeds from bonds are utilized for our foreign-currency denominated loans. Although we'd like to maintain access to cost-effective sources of funding, cost is not the only factor. We consider investors' demand, maturity they are looking at, and so on. If the market conditions are not good, we would not issue. For example, our first French franc deal was issued to meet investors' strong demand in the 11-year sector with our reasonable cost of funding.

<P>
<B>What new markets or instruments are you looking at?</B>

<P>
We have already tapped most of the major markets. But we are looking at all the others. We don't want to reject any possibility. There are some smaller markets where it will be difficult to issue because we need to issue bonds of a certain size. Because we have only a limited amount of human resources, we tend to do only three, four or five deals a year. We are prepared to decrease the issue size if the terms are attractive, however. We are also interested in doing a global bond. Medium-term notes are another instrument we would like to study.

<P>
<B>What about structured deals?</B>

<P>
In general we have to be careful with structured deals because we have to maintain future investor demand, and our reputation. We have done some in the past, but we are now concentrating on plain vanilla deals.

<H2>
<B>Tepco thinks big </B>
</H2>
<P>
<I>Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) can't mess around with small issues such as dual-currency bonds. It has come to the market more than 30 times since 1980, raising $8.2 billion. Now it's moving out of loans further into domestic bonds, and foreign bonds provided the swap works, says senior manager of finance Akira Takahashi</I>

<P>
Our borrowing requirement is likely to increase since we see domestic demand for power rising by 2% a year. Our main strategy is to move from the bank to the bond market. We are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle so we are looking at fixed-rate rather than floating-rate deals.

<P>
<B>Will you be looking to refinance most of your bank loans in the bond market?</B>

<P>
That would present us with too much risk. After the oil shock of the 1970s the bond market was fairly small and it was the banks and life insurance companies that helped us out. We are not saying that it won't happen but it is difficult to say when it will happen. We are aiming to have half our debt in bank loans and half in bonds.

<P>
<B>What impact has the rise in private-sector corporate debt issuance in the domestic market had on your access to funds? </B>

<P>
Not much. We are triple-A rated; most of the other companies are only double-A rated or single-A rated. We also tend to do bigger issues: &#165;150 billion a time, compared with the &#165;25 billion issues common at other firms. We try to issue when market conditions are right, so we try to avoid issuing at the same time as the government. But smaller companies don't make much difference.

<P>
<B>What kinds of bonds do you prefer?</B>

<P>
We always do straight bond issues. We are not interested in dual-currency bonds because you can't issue &#165;150 billion deals in that market.

<P>
<B>What about doing more targeted issuance?</B>

<P>
The size tends to be too small. We have been approached to do some &#165;20 billion <BR>
10-year deals but we said no. We might consider it if the cost were significantly lower than a public deal.

<P>
<B>What about asset-backed deals?</B>

<P>
We aren't looking at that market since most of our customers pay by automatic bank transfer. We only have receivables of &#165;280 billion, so it is normally better to issue commercial paper.

<P>
<B>You have tapped the international markets twice this year, A sfr300 million 10-year deal and a <BR>
ffr4 billion deal. How cost-effective have these been compared with domestic funding?</B>

<P>
The international market has been cheaper on occasions. For example, the French franc deal was 10 basis points cheaper than we would have been able to get in the local market. It varies according to the swap rates.

<P>
<B>Do you intend to increase the proportion of funds raised overseas?</B>

<P>
Our outstanding international bonds are now about &#165;671 billion, while the total is &#165;5,226 billion. So it is about 12%. We don't have a clear idea of how much we want to do internationally. But roughly speaking we would like to have between 20% and 30% of international debt. But the market timing needs to be right.

<H3>COMMODITIES</H3>


<H3> <B>Crashes and diamonds</B> </H3> <BR>
<H4> <B>A diamond bubble is forming, so
slowly that people haven't noticed it yet. When they do, prepare for a crash. The
crash will come when a dazzled public recognizes the precious jewel for what it
is &#173; a lump of carbon that can be built by the ton in laboratories. Very
soon the predicted volume of future mass production will affect today's price,
which is kept artificially high and stable by a cartel. Now is the time to go
short, if only you could, argues Mark White</B> </H4> 

<P> Price bubbles persist
on the expectation that greater fools will come along. That's why price
manipulators find it profitable to start bubbles. However, bubbles inevitably
burst when the supply of fools runs out.

<P> Over the last few years, De Beers &#173; the owners of the Central Selling
Organization, which runs the diamond cartel &#173; kept on buying as the Russians
unloaded just about their entire diamond hoard. No-one knows whether the
Russians, desperate to turn domestic assets into foreign cash, sold off their
huge holding out of plain dumb luck, or if their massive sales rested on inside
information about new mines or diamond-synthesis technologies. Either way, De
Beers clearly bet big on future diamond prices. But current technological trends
make it very likely &#173; viewed from the near future &#173; that the Russians
pulled off a major financial coup and that De Beers committed a major blunder.

<P> De Beers blundered by greatly overpaying for what are, in essence, just tiny
lumps of carbon. Admittedly, diamonds are unusual lumps of carbon and until now
even small ones have been found very rarely in nature. However, geologists have
begun to learn that diamond is much more common in nature than they ever
suspected. Furthermore, materials scientists are beginning to explain that much
wider prevalence as they discover ways of synthesizing diamond without the high
temperatures and pressures previously thought necessary. With this new
understanding of how diamonds are created, geologists could find a lot more
natural sources. But this prospect isn't the principal threat to De Beers'
high-priced bet. The real danger is that scientists are rapidly improving
processes that will turn cheap carbon into diamond by the ton. A diamond may
still be for ever, but soon it will be for everywhere as well.

<P> In 50 years, when the diamond industry is making transparent kitchen worktops
and wall-size video monitors, you won't expect a couple to pay a thousand dollars
for a fine 0.75 carat diamond ring any more than you expect them to pay a hundred
dollars for an aluminium wedding ring today.

<P> De Beers will try to salvage its position by spending $200 million a year on
persuading lovers and investors that a diamond is a girl's best friend. The
synthesis of diamond by the ton probably won't start for several years, so
consumers may go on believing this to be true. Consumers might keep diamond mines
operating profitably until they see 50mm diamond lenses in a pair of $60
binoculars. But if De Beers still has a chance to liquidate its mountain of
Russian gems, it has nevertheless already abandoned its traditional price support
for so-called Indian goods &#173; consumer-oriented smaller stones like those
common in the Argyle mines of De Beers' former Australian associates. That's a
major pullback, since consumers have long been De Beer's mainstay, paying far
more at retail for their diamond chips than they could ever hope to recover from
jewellers or pawnbrokers if they resold. Fortunately for their peace of mind,
consumers typically live in ignorance of this, since most are buy-and-hold
investors.

<P> <B>Collector's item</B>

<P> By abandoning the Indian goods market, De Beers is taking the future value of
its own diamond hoard out of the hands of those reliable consumers and placing it
squarely with wealthy collectors. De Beers is betting that they will be as
reliably foolish about those luxury goods as consumers have been about Indian
goods. De Beers may be giving up any chance of liquidating its mountain of
Russian gems at a profit. Collectors won't wait until they start seeing diamond
lenses in binoculars.

<P> Collectors differ from consumers in that they buy diamonds for the returns
&#173; a portable store of value backed by De Beers' promise of perpetual capital
gains. De Beers has to reassure them that prices will keep rising. It's currently
trying to sell the line about rising demand worldwide, that growing Asian
populations can barely wait for their incomes to rise enough to buy large
diamonds.

<P> Rustum Roy of Pennsylvania State University, dean of the world's diamond
synthesizers, reckons that over the next 50 years diamond synthesis will almost
certainly repeat the history of aluminium production &#173; from precious
commodity to ubiquitous and economical engineering material.

<P> Diamond is a top engineering material in terms of its hardness, transparency,
refractivity, thermal and electrical conductivity, electronic emission and many
other properties that will generate demand for industrial quantities. The biggest
demand will probably be electronic &#173; diamond semiconductor chips will bypass
the thermal conductivity limitations of silicon, allowing yet more
miniaturization. Some demand will still persist for diamond jewellery but it will
be a mere fraction of overall diamond production.

<P> If diamond will be cheap and ubiquitous 50 years hence, that implies cheap
diamond in 49 years. Cheap diamond in 49 years must then imply cheap diamond in
48 years and so on. According to what economists call backwards induction, cheap
diamond in 2046 implies cheap diamond in 1996.

<P> Unless diamond-synthesis stops in its tracks, the price that collectors enjoy
today should be the best they'll ever see. Diamond gems will lose their
connotations of wealth and privilege, and diamond mines will become expensive
holes in the ground.

<P> Natural-resource cartels have often succeeded for years, even if they
inevitably lose because their high-price policy invites technological innovation
and substitution. But no process or product is inviolable for ever. Bolivian tin
miners and Opec oil producers held out for years before they were bypassed.
Natural resource markets, like all markets, can occasionally sustain price
bubbles for a good long while. Today's diamond price stability makes it harder
for analysts to perceive the price bubble growing as diamond synthesis costs fall
relative to slowly rising luxury goods prices or slowly falling Indian goods
prices.

<P> De Beers can take some heart from experimental markets, which indicate that
bubbles with stable prices over falling values last much longer than bubbles with
upward spikes over falling or even stable values. Today's slowly rising diamond
price seems so normal and unobjectionable that markets have failed to react to
the advance in diamond synthesis.

<P> Roy's Penn State diamond-synthesis team was recently able to draw the first
single large diamond crystal from a boule. With persistence they should be able
to increase crystal size and lower costs incrementally. In another advance led by
Pravin Mistry, Detroit's QQC Corporation's tool-coating team made a breakthrough
when a technician accidentally substituted carbon dioxide for nitrogen in a
coating process, instantly increasing the best diamond film deposition rate by a
factor of a thousand.

<P> <B>Spotting the sell-off</B>

<P> Future economic historians will wonder why these developments failed to
trigger a run on diamond gem prices. Bubble theorists will simply note that
securities analysts and diamond dealers continued, irrationally, to concentrate
on new diamond-mining prospects in Canada and depleting mines in Australia, while
ignoring the prospect of industrial-scale production.

<P> But sooner or later the crash will come. The new perception will probably
prompt most collectors, not just a few, to try to dump their hoards. If that
happens, prices will collapse immediately. However, even if most collectors were
to remain irrationally passive at the prospect of a price fall, the crash would
still come. That's because most diamond miners, dealers, cutters and retailers
depend on external debt financing for their inventories and operations. In the
face of a potential price crash, risk managers in banks with a major exposure to
the diamond industry, such as ABN Amro, would insist on raising the premium for
financing risky diamond inventories. As financing costs skyrocketed, dealers and
cutters would trim inventories, and the resulting sales would trigger a price
fall that would scare many collectors into selling.

<P> Don't cry for De Beers, however. It has diamond-synthesis technologies among
its assets and, even if the bubble bursts some day soon, it can hope to get out
wholesale by touting those assets in the bubble that will inevitably accompany
the rise of the new industry. One day the run will start, and if you have any
diamonds today, the fact that you are reading this article increases the
likelihood that you too will short diamonds. It may be hard to short the
underlying, but publicly held diamond companies aren't so hard to short. From
there the battle between diamond bulls and bears will spread to dealers, cutters
and retailers. If skyrocketing financing costs don't put them out of business,
collapsing stock prices will.

<H3>JAPAN</H3>

<H2> <B>The teacher who invested $15 billion</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The world's big
borrowers have found a new source of super-cheap funding. In the past year, a
group of small, hitherto almost unheard of Japanese institutions &#173; most
famously the Teachers' Pension Fund &#173; have bought as much as $100 billion of
structured Euro-MTNs. So desperate are these investors for certain types of
securities that a top-rated borrower can raise funds via a private placement in
Japan for as little as Libor minus 60 basis points. Garry Evans explains how</B>
</H4> 

<P> Last year the international capital markets were heavily influenced by
the arrival of a new investor: Mrs Watanabe, the mythical Japanese housewife.
Japanese retail investors like Mrs Watanabe bought about $20 billion<B> </B>of
Eurobonds in the second half of 1995. The pace has slowed but Japanese
individuals still put about $16 billion into foreign securities in the first six
months of 1996.

<P> And now for this year's big new investor: Mr Watanabe. But Mr Watanabe is no
myth. Hiroshi Watanabe is deputy manager of the investment department of the
Public Teachers' Pension Fund. Watanabe has invested, according to market
estimates, $15 billion in Euro medium-term notes (EMTNs) in the 12 months since
mid-1995 when the institution &#173; Japan's third-largest public pension fund,
with assets of &#165;61.9 trillion ($590 billion) &#173; decided to bring the
management of a portion of its funds in-house. Watanabe invests mainly in highly
structured securities such as reverse dual-currency bonds (where the principal is
in yen, but the coupon is paid in a foreign currency).

<P> Buying is on an enormous scale. Watanabe has been known to invest as much as
$1 billion in a single week. The whole EMTN market (excluding public, syndicated
deals) was worth $134 billion in 1995 and $97 billion in January to August 1996,
according to MTNWare, a new database produced by Euromoney affiliate Capital Net.
In other words, Watanabe buys about 10% of all EMTNS. Some bankers in Japan have
taken to calling him "Mr 10%" &#173; after the infamous Yasuo Hamanaka of
Sumitomo Corporation, the "Mr 5%" of the copper market.

<P> Because of these large volumes, and because the credits he is allowed to buy
are severely restricted (mainly double A or triple A sovereigns and
supranationals), Watanabe has often been forced to take securities at almost any
price. After swapping the proceeds into floating-rate dollars, issuers can
usually obtain funds at Libor minus 40 basis points or lower. In the most extreme
case, bankers say, the International Finance Corporation earlier this year
achieved Libor minus 60bp on a private placement it sold to the Public Teachers'
Pension Fund.

<P> And Watanabe is not the only Japanese investor buying EMTNs in large sums.
London-based MTN specialists reckon that 70% or 80% of private placements issued
off MTN programmes are sold into Japan &#173; in other words, between $90 billion
and $100 billion during the whole of 1996. The Japanese institutions which buy
EMTNs are not the familiar names, such as the life insurance companies, which
have been buying foreign securities for years. Rather they are a mixed group that
includes small local banks, such as <I>shinkin</I> banks, credit associations,
and agricultural co-operatives; the central banks of these institutions, such as
Zenshinren and Zenkyoren; investment trusts (similar to closed-end mutual funds);
industrial companies; government bodies such as the Trust Fund Bureau of the
ministry of finance; and private and public pension funds.

<P> A combination of factors has caused this surge in MTN buying. Small banks
find that their customers don't want to borrow any more, so they are forced to
buy more securities. As the pension fund system is deregulated, more funds are
being run by aggressive, less hidebound fund managers. But, most important,
institutions lack attractive investment opportunities: yen interest rates are low
(10-year Japanese government bonds yield little over 3%, for example), and the
stock market has yet to show that it can sustain its recent mini-recovery.
Investors, therefore, are desperate for yield. Pension funds, in particular, are
required by law to obtain a current yield on their investments of 5.5% a year.
The only way they can achieve that sort of return is by taking foreign exchange
or interest rate risk &#173; in other words, by buying structured instruments. In
effect, they are risking their capital to boost artificially their return in year
one.

<P> If this sounds foolish, that is exactly what it is. Consider how Watanabe of
the Public Teachers' Pension Fund has shifted his strategy over the past 12
months. (Watanabe declined to meet <I>Euromoney</I> for this article saying, in a
15-minute telephone interview: "I tell my trustees what I am doing, but I'm not
able to reveal my strategy to the public". However, by talking extensively to the
investment bankers who sell MTNs to Watanabe, <I>Euromoney </I>has pieced
together with a high degree of accuracy the details of how he invests.)

<P> <B>Bonds at a price</B>

<P> In the summer of 1995, the Public Teachers' Pension Fund made the decision to
bring a portion of its assets in-house. Watanabe, assisted by three junior fund
managers, began to buy 10-year reverse dual-currency bonds. The coupon was 5.5%,
paid in US dollars. In effect, Watanabe was playing the forward foreign exchange
curve &#173; taking a bet that the differential between Japanese and US interest
rates would not be wiped out over the life of the bond by a depreciation of the
dollar against the yen. If he was wrong, the yen value of his 5.5% coupon in
dollars would be worth less and less each year until the bond was repaid. In
other words, he was taking the risk of sacrificing future annual returns to beat
the important 5.5% target in year one. His capital, though, is not at risk: the
bonds are paid in full at maturity in yen. In that sense, his investments are
less risky than buying dual-currency bonds, where the (high) coupon is paid in
yen, but redemption is in a foreign currency.

<P> As the yen fell against the dollar during the second half of 1995, Watanabe's
plan looked highly successful. He could have sold his bonds in the secondary
market for a profit (although bankers say he has chosen to hold onto them). The
snag, though, was that both yen and dollar interest rates continued to fall. It
became harder and harder to hit the 5.5% target on new purchases &#173;
particularly as Watanabe's internal rules severely limit the range of credits he
can buy. He extended the maturity of the bonds he was buying to 15 years, and
then to 20. Rates continued to fall. He switched the coupon to Australian
dollars. By the middle of 1996, to achieve a 5.5% coupon, he was having to buy
bonds with a maturity of 33 years, with the coupon payable in US dollars,
Australian dollars or Deutschmarks at the choice of the issuer.

<P> Watanabe's next puzzling move, around the start of this year, was to begin
buying reverse duals with a 10-year put. The put, however, is nothing like a
conventional bond put option, which typically specifies a fixed price (usually as
a percentage of par) at which the bonds can be put back to the issuer. The puts
Watanabe bought allow him merely to sell back the bonds at a "market rate", minus
a fee, 10 years after issue and then on one date each year until maturity. The
market rate is determined by a complicated formula that refers to swap rates and
the price of equivalent credits in the secondary market. "The structure itself
doesn't have a very clear meaning," says the syndicate head at one of the big
four Japanese securities houses in Tokyo. Indeed, Watanabe is the only investor
who buys bonds with this sort of put.

<P> This syndicate head's explication is simple: "After Mr Watanabe starting
buying 30-year bonds, his bosses got a bit nervous. They wanted a warranty that
there was some way of getting out of the bonds." In other words, the put is
little more than a guarantee that Watanabe can sell the bonds back to the lead
manager (which has structured the deal with derivatives, so that the issuer
itself doesn't have to buy back the bonds).

<P> But the effect of the puts is to make the bonds even more expensive for
Watanabe. This is clear from the way the puts work for the borrower: the bonds
become 10-year money at, say, 40bp below Libor and, subsequently, a flow of
one-year money at 60bp below Libor, according to syndicate managers who have
arranged these deals. Add to these cheap funds for the borrower, fat fees for the
arranger of the structure and the swap provider, and it becomes clear that
Watanabe is not getting a good deal.

<P> Indeed, buyers argue that much of what Watanabe buys is mispriced. "When he
buys his reverse duals [with the coupon in a currency other than yen]," says one
London-based investment banker, "he is selling a call on the currency at far too
cheap a price. He simply doesn't understand the mathematics." As an example of
how richly priced the derivatives embedded in these deals are, this banker cites
an issue which he had subsidized, at a loss, to win the mandate from the
borrower. To help his bank break even, he asked AIG (which handles much of the
long-dated swaps business necessary for these structured products) to reduce its
charge for the swap by $1 million. "It was unbelievable," the banker recalls.
"AIG came back within 10 minutes and said 'yes' without any hesitation. That's a
sign of how much money they're making on these deals." Rumours in Tokyo suggest
that Merrill Lynch which, through subsidiary Merrill Lynch Derivative Products,
also handles a lot of long-dated swaps business, made $100 million from
Japan-targeted MTNs last year, much of that from business with Watanabe. (Merrill
in Tokyo was unable to provide an executive to respond.)

<P> Other fund managers have become upset with the way Watanabe buys at very high
prices. "Mr Watanabe has become quite famous," says Morimasa Nakata, a fund
manager in the international investment division of Zenkyoren, the insurance arm
of the agricultural cooperative movement. "But what he's done has not exactly
been welcomed by other investors. He's had quite an impact on the level at which
we can invest. Borrowers expect to get their funds much more cheaply now."

<P> <B>Buying frenzy on MTNs </B>

<P> The way Watanabe picks which deals to invest in is also treated with derision
by bankers. He has evolved an auction process whereby once or twice a week he
asks for quotes. Usually, about 15 banks put in bids. In total, maybe 30 or so
banks have dealt with him. At each auction, Watanabe will typically buy five
separate issues of &#165;10 billion  each. But the criteria for his choice are
unclear. What sort of credit does he want? What is his target level? Bankers fret
whether to show him a double A corporate at Libor minus 15bp or a strong triple A
sovereign at Libor minus 40bp: his preferences seem to vary from week to week.
Some houses suspect that Watanabe buys from banks on a rota basis, but they are
not sure. The auction is a conundrum for borrowers, too. Only a dozen or so names
are able and willing to sell to Watanabe. Should they bid the same price to each
of the five or so MTN houses that approach them?

<P> The splurge of the Public Teachers' Pension Fund seems now to be over.
Bankers report that Watanabe has bought little over this summer. Some argue that
he believes the yen to be undervalued, but would start to buy again if it rose
above &#165;105 to the dollar.

<P> But bankers believe that other pension funds could soon start to buy MTNs in
big volumes too. "Other funds are actively thinking of moving the same way as the
Teachers," says Tsutomu Sato, manager of fixed-income sales at Goldman Sachs in
Tokyo. So far, a few, including the Policemen's Pension Fund, have made
experimental investments. Says an official at the securities operation of one of
the Japanese banks: "Public pension funds' preferred investments would be 10-year
JGBs at, say, 5% yields. However, given that such rates are some 200bp below
these targets, they are forced to consider other credits, structured notes,
longer maturities and, reluctantly, currency risk."

<P> But pension funds are not the only big MTN buyers. One syndicate head
estimates that about 50% of MTNs go to <I>shinkin</I> banks, agricultural
cooperatives and other small financial institutions, 20% to corporates, 20% to
pension funds and 10% to investment trusts.

<P> At Zenshinren, the central bank of the <I>shinkin</I> banks, Ikuo Sawada,
deputy general manager of the securities investment department, says total
holdings of Euroyen bonds by his institution are just below &#165;1 trillion. Of
that, 70% or 80% are EMTNs, and that percentage "has increased quite a lot in the
past few months". Sawada likes MTNs because "they are very flexible. We can find
exactly the sort of cashflow that meets our needs."

<P> Zenshinren, however, buys only fairly plain-vanilla paper, he says: "We don't
buy structures that distort the cashflow or take foreign exchange risk because
this makes it difficult to handle the liability management." But Sawada has
recently experimented with buying callable notes and swaption callable notes.
Swaption callables work as follows: on an eight-year deal, the first three years
will be at an attractive floating rate, perhaps Libor plus 40bp. There is a call
after three years, with the remaining five years at a fixed rate if the bonds
aren't called. In effect, the option premium for the call is used to provide the
pick-up in yield.

<P> Some of the 140 individual shinkin banks are considerably less conservative.
"I get the feeling that quite a lot are buying MTNs in substantial amounts now,"
says Sawada. Shinkins buy some of the riskier paper available: anything from
dual-currency bonds to samurai bonds issued by sub-investment-grade issuers. Few
buy reverse duals &#173; they view these as too low-yielding and uninteresting.
Indeed, Zenshinren thinks the structured-note market has so much potential that
it will set up its own securities subsidiary in September to originate and sell
MTNs to the shinkins.

<P> Zenkyoren, the insurance arm of the agricultural cooperatives, which has
&#165;27 trillion in assets, began buying yen MTNs as an alternative to yen
loans. "We've being making yen loans to foreign sovereigns for some time," says
Naruto Takahashi, assistant manager in the international finance division. "But
the trend is for these borrowers to use their MTN programmes. To cover that, we
have moved to buying Euroyen bonds and Euro-MTNs. The proportion has grown quite
a lot." Zenkyoren owns about &#165;800 billion in foreign securities, mainly yen
instruments. To increase the return, Takahashi has recently been buying reverse
dual-currency bonds and callable bonds. "We have increased our assets in these
securities quite a lot, and we're thinking to increase it further," he says.

<P> Another important buyer of MTNs is the investment trust industry. "Investment
trusts started buying in a big way in April this year," reports Mikio Sugihara,
head of the global capital markets group at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. "They
typically buy reverse dual-currency bonds." At Nikko Securities Investment Trust,
Hiroshi Uchiyama, general manager of the fixed-income department, says: "We are a
big investor in MTNs. We have increased our investment a lot in the past year or
two." For him, the key advantage of an MTN is that he can buy a newly issued
security with a current coupon. "We like the flexibility of the instrument so
that we can buy what we want, when we want." Uchiyama, though, buys few MTNs with
complicated structures, although he adds: "if we find something with a structure
that suits us, then we will buy it".

<P> Another advantage of MTNs for investment trusts is that they can produce
cosmetic effects on investment returns. Nobue Sato, general manager of
fixed-income sales at Sanwa Securities, points out how investment trusts, needing
to produce results every three months, "use MTNs to help their quarterly
results". They can, for example, buy a step-down floater with a high, early first
coupon &#173; in effect, taking a large chunk of the cashflow from the security
at the beginning.

<P> The beauty of the structured MTN product is that it can be used in a variety
of ways like this to distort &#173; sorry, customize &#173; cashflow. It is
noticeable, for example, that there is always a flurry of MTN issues around the
end of the Japanese financial year in March and half-year in September as banks,
corporates and institutional investors seek either to enhance or dampen their
results. "We use MTNs to smooth out the yearly cashflows," admits Daisetsu Muso,
a fund manager for pension fund money at IBJNW Asset Management. Some corporates
have even started to buy three-year structured MTNs as an alternative to hedging
foreign exchange exposure, and to avoid relying too heavily on the credit risk of
their Japanese relationship banks. But most of the MTN buying is concentrated on
boosting year-one returns at the risk of seeing returns fall in later years.
Reverse duals do this. So do the capped floaters that smaller banks buy.

<P> The signs are that purchases of MTNs by Japanese investors could get even
bigger. A number of other investors &#173; besides the pension funds mentioned
earlier &#173; are poised to start buying. Recently, insurance companies (with
total assets of &#165;213 trillion) have started to increase their holdings of
foreign bonds again, after six years of decline. For example, the proportion of
Nippon Life's portfolio invested in foreign securities rose to 7.1% last year, up
from 6.2% a year earlier. Currently, most life companies are highly conservative,
buying only US treasuries and Bunds. But Fukoku Life, for instance, is reported
to have bought reverse duals in March to<B> </B>take its<B> </B>foreign exchange
profits early, and is looking at other structured trades.

<P> Huge changes in the corporate pension market will also boost MTN buying.
Until recently, only trust banks and life insurance companies could manage
pension money. Deregulation has allowed companies to move funds to independent
investment managers, including foreigners. Moreover, from March, life companies
reduced the fixed return they guarantee on pension money from 4.5% to 2.5%. This
prodded many companies to withdraw their funds from life companies and move them
to independent investment managers. The total of pension money with the
independents had already risen 41% in the year to March 1996, to reach &#165;6.8
trillion. The independents are more innovative and aggressive investors than the
life companies. So bankers expect a shift of this money into MTNs, foreign
securities and equities.

<P> The biggest hope for investment bankers comes from the government sector.
This includes the national public insurance funds &#173; managed by the Trust
Fund Bureau of the ministry of the finance (with &#165;369 trillion in assets)
and Nenpuku (&#165;119 trillion) &#173; and the postal system, Yucho (&#165;213
trillion) and Kampo (&#165;90 trillion). (Some of these asset figures are
duplicated because, for example, Yucho deposits 85% of its money with the Trust
Fund Bureau.) Until recently, these institutions were highly regulated and bought
little other than Japanese domestic bonds. But recently, they have begun to open
up. The Trust Fund Bureau has tentatively started buying Euroyen bonds from
top-rated sovereigns and supranationals. Yucho and Kampo have done the same:
Kampo, for example, has &#165;409 billion in foreign securities.

<P> The most stunning sign that things are changing is that, in January this
year, Nenpuku shifted the management of no less than &#165;5 trillion from life
companies to independent managers. It now invests the money via a series of
limited partnership vehicles based in Delaware and the Cayman Islands. Why the
limited partnerships? "Because Nenpuku is part of the government, it was
difficult for us to buy company shares [directly]," says Yasunori Usui, deputy
general manager of the fund management activities department. Under the new
arrangement, Nenpuku will be able to look at a wider range of investments &#173;
including MTNs.

<P> The next stage for the MTN market in Japan, says John Muros, associate
director at Daiwa Securities in London, is simple: "To get more investors to do
it. And that will push the current investors to become more sophisticated." More
sophisticated, perhaps, than    Mr Watanabe.&#009;*

<H3>SWITZERLAND</H3>


<H3> <B>Digging up the past</B> </H3> 
<BR><H4> <B>Jewish organizations have long urged a full search for orphan funds deposited in Switzerland by victims of Nazi
persecution. Right after World War II many accounts were located. But Swiss
bankers, with their obsession for secrecy, have failed to convince the world that
they have tried hard enough since. Now they've signed an agreement that may clear
more of the fog. Stephanie Cooke reports</B> </H3> 

<P> Fifty years after the end of World War II, the ghosts of the Holocaust still stalk the corridors of Swiss
banks &#173; surprising banks too. A year ago last June, Hans Baer, then chairman
of Switzerland's best-known Jewish-owned bank, Bank Julius Baer, read a<I> Wall
Street Journal</I> article alleging his bank had mistreated heirs of victims of
Nazi persecution. The article was in part accurate. After receiving a request in
1987 from the daughters of former client Moses Blum for a search for missing
funds they believed to be held by the bank, the bank had replied &#173; "icily"
the newspaper claimed &#173; that there were no records of such funds within the
past 10 years. Under Swiss law, the bank's letter was quoted as saying, the bank
was not obliged to keep records dating any further back. (The law in fact applies
only to records of accounts that have been closed.) The bank had reportedly
charged the Blum daughters Sfr100 ($82) for this information.

<P> Crucially, the story (repeated a week later in an Israeli magazine) reported
that the daughters believed Blum had deposited money in the bank before being
interned in the Dachau concentration camp in 1938. This turned out to be untrue.
After reading the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> account, Baer ordered an inquiry. In
spite of the bank's previous claim, records were discovered &#173; Swiss banks
frequently wheel out the 10-year rule when records of previously held assets are
being sought, but in fact they often hold onto records of closed accounts much
longer. These showed Blum had indeed opened an account, but not until the
mid-1950s. He died in 1957 and the records indicated that in the early 1970s his
widow closed the account and disposed of a relatively small balance. The last
correspondence between the bank and Blum's daughters was in 1988, says a bank
spokesman, and the bank's impression was that it had dealt purely with
inheritance, not with a Holocaust claim.

<P> Bank Julius Baer may well have other unclaimed deposits made by foreigners
who subsequently died of natural causes or while imprisoned, or were executed
&#173; or were too embarrassed to claim them &#173; but it's ironic that it
should have been picked out in the press for failing to return Jewish money.
Because of its Jewish origins, the bank itself had suffered discrimination, being
effectively excluded from dealings with official Germany during World War II.
Baer, who says he didn't know of the original request from the Blum daughters,
attributes the bank's initial bungling to bureaucratic incompetence. And the fact
is it is often extremely difficult to trace dormant accounts and assess
claimants. But this wasn't the whole story.

<P> The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article appeared at the height of 50th
anniversary celebrations of the end of World War II and in the midst of a
concerted campaign by the World Jewish Congress (WJC) to put the ghosts of the
Holocaust to rest. That included trying to force Swiss banks to open their books
so that heirs of Holocaust victims could discover, once and for all, whether they
were still holding orphan Jewish assets deposited by family members before the
end of the war &#173; or assets looted by the Nazis. It is still not clear why
Bank Julius Baer, among 400 or so banks in Switzerland alone, was the focus of
two major articles at the time. "It was a well-orchestrated attack by the World
Jewish Congress," says Baer. "It got me mad because it was against our bank."
Elan Steinberg, executive director of the WJC, says the organization had nothing
to do with the articles. "The point is not an individual case which may or may
not be justified. The issue is the process, which must be transparent and open so
that Holocaust survivors and others can see that justice, as best as it can be
achieved, can be achieved."

<P> Like most Swiss banks, Bank Julius Baer has in the past willingly accepted
deposits from foreigners without asking too many questions. This approach to
banking secrecy has led to many international allegations that Swiss banks have
been helping citizens of other countries avoid tax, break exchange controls and
hide the proceeds of criminal activities. But with globalization and
international treaties on money-laundering, Swiss banks have adopted a more
discriminating approach to accepting deposits from banks. As a Jewish bank,
Julius Baer was quite willing before and during World War II to accept Jewish
money from Germany and other occupied countries, even though it knew its
customers were breaking German regulations. These depositors were taking
substantial risks and no-one today would criticize the bank for helping them.

<P> Apart from that, while many Swiss banks were heavily and profitably engaged
in financial transactions with official Germany throughout the period, Julius
Baer was effectively ring-fenced by the Germans because its owners were Jewish
&#173; to the extent of having its weekly bulletin on politics and economics
banned from circulation in Germany from 1936 onwards. In charge of a relatively
small private bank in 1945 (with only a few employees and a balance sheet of
Sfr13 million), the partners, Baer told a congressional committee in the US last
year, "personally knew the bank's clients and their families, and sympathized
with their fate, which is demonstrated in many personal correspondences of that
era".

<P> The WJC, set up in Geneva before World War II and now based in New York, has
lobbied for decades for banks in many countries to search for funds of Holocaust
victims, and to identify and return assets looted by the Nazis from Jewish
citizens. It has also campaigned for public admissions of complicity with the
Nazi regime from supposedly neutral countries like Switzerland. The 50th
anniversary celebrations provided a unique opportunity to further these causes.

<P> <B>Safer havens than Switzerland</B>

<P> The collapse of communism led the WJC to set up a separate body, the World
Jewish Restitution Organization, to identify Jewish assets confiscated by
communist governments after World War II, and either return them to their
rightful owners or donate them to Jewish charities. With the opening of communist
archives in eastern Europe and the availability of previously classified post-war
Allied documents in Washington, the trail frequently led to Switzerland,
Steinberg says. But Norway, which was occupied by the Nazis, also came under the
searchlight, as did Sweden.

<P> Some experts believe Sweden was a far more important haven for Jewish money
before and during the war than Switzerland, and that it should therefore receive
more attention than Switzerland when it comes to locating missing Jewish assets.
This is because northern European Jews were, as a rule, geographically closer to
Sweden. Furthermore, Swiss banks were in some disrepute, having suffered a wave
of collapses in the 1930s, and Switzerland looked more vulnerable to Nazi
invasion.

<P> But it is the insular Swiss who have faced most criticism over the issue.
That Bank Julius Baer was singled out may be coincidental &#173; these days it is
more closely associated with the "gnomes of Zurich" than with its Jewish origins.
But it is a different matter for the Swiss banking community in general. After
cooperating closely with the Nazis during the war, Swiss banks closed ranks
post-war, resisting Allied &#173; in particular US &#173; efforts to locate Nazi
assets and return them to their rightful owners. "If the Swedes were stubborn,
the Swiss were the cube of stubbornness," Dean Acheson, then an assistant US
secretary of state, later recounted.

<P> The result is that Swiss banks are still bearing the brunt of resentment,
having failed to satisfy the world Jewish community that they are not sitting on
millions &#173; some say billions &#173; of unclaimed Jewish assets despite a
legally mandated search in 1962 which supposedly uncovered all remaining assets.
The issue is so emotive it is not surprising facts get twisted and that unlikely
targets, such as Bank Julius Baer, are picked out. "They [the bankers] react out
of their heads and their law, and the others react out of their guts," says Rolf
Bloch, head of the Swiss-Jewish Association, the Swiss affiliate of the WJC.
"There are two worlds. They are acting and reacting out of their separate worlds.
This is one of the problems which is creating mistrust on the one side and very
formal behaviour on the other." Finally, though, as Bloch points out, "the banks
are prisoners of banking secrecy".

<P> Baer knows this only too well. Around the time the newspaper article
appeared, he had been hearing rumblings from Swiss diplomats abroad. "Somebody
had to invent something," he says. "We had to get moving and do something. This
warfare with the World Jewish Congress was certainly getting ridiculous."

<P> Baer began work with members of the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to find a
solution, in September 1995. The result was &#173; after a somewhat stormy
passage &#173; an agreement on May 2 between the WJRO, the WJC and the SBA that
an independent auditor should be allowed "unfettered access to all relevant files
in banking institutions regarding dormant accounts and other assets and financial
instruments deposited before, during and immediately after the Second World War".
The auditor would be appointed by a committee of "eminent persons" representing
both sides and an independent chairman who is expected to be Paul Volcker, former
chairman of the US   Federal Reserve. Baer is one of the seven signatories to the
agreement. Among the others are Edgar Bronfman, chairman of the WJRO and the WJC,
and Georg Krayer, head of the SBA.

<P> These negotiations were, however, paralleled by more generalized attempts to
solve the problem of dormant assets. They sprang from an initiative by the Swiss
parliament in 1994 to clean up the image of Swiss banking abroad. But the SBA's
response to this initiative was destined to lead to conflict with the Jewish
organization, which felt that the SBA might be attempting to pre-empt its
separate negotiations.

<P> The SBA was worried about the parliamentary initiative because the
legislators were calling for the establishment of an external registry with the
power to require the banks to report on all accounts that had been inactive over
a specified period. Unobtrusive as this might sound to an outsider, Swiss bankers
regarded it as tantamount to a violation of banking secrecy &#173; even within
Swiss borders government interference seemed to threaten their well-protected
world.

<P> The SBA immediately launched its own initiative, designed to keep such
matters in its own hands, announcing in January 1995 that as a result of the
parliamentary proposals it had asked a committee to review the issue and to
propose solutions. In September the association announced new guidelines, which
included a requirement that banks should identify any accounts that had been
inactive for 10 years or more. Instead of setting up an external registry, the
SBA proposed the creation of a central contact office attached to the banking
ombudsman in Zurich (whose office is supported by the SBA). This was reckoned by
the SBA to overcome worries about breaches of banking secrecy because, as SBA
secretary Christoph Winzeler put it, the "contact office is under banking secrecy
obligations from both sides (meaning the client and the bank)". The central
contact office would pass on to the banks the names of "legitimate and identified
claimants" of dormant assets. The banks would be required to deal with these
requests.

<P> It was the role of the quiet, unassuming Bloch, who is a director of Bank
Leumi (Schweiz) and runs a chocolate factory near Berne inherited from his
father, to tie the separate but related strands together. In the light of the new
SBA approach to dormant assets, he asked it to make a special effort to look for
unclaimed Jewish assets. In particular, he was concerned about relatives of
victims of Nazi persecution resident in eastern Europe, who before the collapse
of the communist bloc were unable to make claims.

<P> In September 1995, when the SBA initiatives were announced, formal
negotiations with the WJC also began. The WJC wanted an independent external
review of the process of checking for dormant assets in which the Swiss banking
establishment was now engaged. In addition, though, it wanted searches to be made
for assets that derived from Nazi looting and in this case not just dormant
assets (inactive for more than 10 years). The WJC also wanted the process widened
to include insurance companies and other non-banking financial institutions, and
this point was eventually tacked on to the May 2 agreement. As part of the
process, the two sides agreed to maintain contact and, claims the WJC, to agree
the text of any public statements on Jewish assets.

<P> The question remained: how much was left? Through a post-war entity called
the Swiss Clearing Agency, a total of Sfr697 million in German assets had been
identified by 1952 and of this Sfr16,538,612 was, according to the SBA,
identified as belonging to people persecuted by the Nazi regime and was returned
to appropriate beneficiaries. This did not include Swiss assets of Sfr4.6 billion
frozen in the US during the war. According to the SBA the proportion of that
which belongs to victims of Nazi persecution can no longer be established.

<P> In 1962, under pressure from the World War II Allies, the Swiss passed
legislation requiring banks to identify unclaimed funds held by them for
foreigners "persecuted for racial, religious or political reasons". But the law
was flawed, not least because there was no outside supervision and because some
names of account-holders were not readily identifiable as Jewish. And although
the law did not exclude the identification of eastern European claims, the banks
apparently felt that this would risk the funds passing to communist governments
rather than the beneficial owners.

<P> After this legislation was passed, the Swiss government received some 7,000
responses to an appeal for victims' relatives to lay claims if they believed they
had family money in Swiss banks. However, only 961 accounts were identified, with
total deposits of Sfr9.5 million. Three-quarters of that was returned to its
rightful owners, and the rest to a Swiss-Israeli association and a refugee
organization.

<P> Even the SBA concedes that this sum "seems paltry" by today's standards, but
it argues that it was in line with the then estimates of the Swiss Jewish Society
which, in 1947, had spoken of unclaimed assets "worth only a few million francs".
Furthermore, it says the banks adhered to the conditions set out in the decree
"diligently" and with "due care". The SBA says one of the large banks even
employed two rabbis to scrutinize all accounts and deposits.

<P> The Swiss banks considered the matter closed after the 1962 exercise. But
because there had been no independent confirmation of the bank searches, the WJC
felt there was still room for doubt about their completeness and accuracy. Bad
feelings were allowed to fester for another 30 years. "The handling of these
cases has been wrong," says Bloch. "They [the banks] handled it in a very
technical way. They gave it to the lawyers to handle. It was very correct but it
was very remote and cool. There was no empathy. People felt misunderstood, that
they weren't being listened to."

<P> <B>Outside assistance</B>

<P> Although there has been progress, it's not clear that the Swiss banks have
learned from their earlier diplomatic errors. For example, even before
negotiations with the WJC began, the SBA, pursuing the initiative begun in
January 1995, conducted its own preliminary survey of 20 of the largest Swiss
banks, showing scant regard for outside approval of the way it was doing this.
The very month that the SBA began talks with the WJC, it published the results of
its survey. According to this, there were 440 foreigners' accounts opened before
1945 that had been dormant at least 10 years. Their total value was Sfr35
million, Sfr9 million of which originated in Germany and eastern Europe.

<P> With the talks with the WJC still under way, a more thorough survey &#173;
once again conducted unilaterally by the SBA &#173; was carried out. This
involved contacting 400 financial institutions in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
This February, the SBA announced final figures on the basis of this second
survey. There were, it said, 36 banks which had deposits dating from before the
end of the war and these totalled Sfr38.7 million.

<P> To the WJC this looked like pre-emption of investigations carried out
according to mutually agreed procedures under negotiation between the WJC and the
SBA but yet to be settled. "The [February] press conference was in complete
breach of our agreement with them [the SBA]," says Steinberg. "I heard through
the BBC that they were holding a press conference. We warned them that if they
did, we would reject their findings." And although the WJC refused to accept
Sfr38.7 million as a final figure, in itself it proved that there was still money
that had not been returned to its rightful owners. "It shows that they have not
returned all the money in dormant accounts," says Steinberg.

<P> The refusal of the SBA to pay heed to Steinberg's warnings &#173; the SBA's
Winzeler says the SBA had "domestic" considerations to deal with as well &#173;
led the WJC to seek influential help outside Switzerland. It contacted New York
Republican senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the Senate banking committee,
whose local constituency in Long Island has a large Jewish population, and he in
turn organized Senate hearings.

<P> Baer of Bank Julius Baer testified in Washington in April, reiterating the
results of the SBA survey and reporting the progress of the banking ombudsman who
had been collecting names since January and had hired two extra officials to
speed the search. Baer encouraged prospective claimants to write or fax the
ombudsman. He downplayed the likelihood of there being vast undiscovered amounts
in Switzerland, deposited by Holocaust victims. Even before the war started, he
pointed out, Switzerland had been regarded as unstable, nearly surrounded by
fascist states. Baer told the senate committee: "Between 1938 and 1940, in
response to fears concerning the safety of Switzerland, an uninterrupted flow of
capital fled Switzerland to the safest haven, the United States. Indeed, not only
did clients have their assets sent here, the Swiss banks themselves transferred
much of their own assets to the United States."

<P> By then the WJC had reason to believe it was making progress in pressing for
a supervised approach to the investigation of dormant assets. In May, Swiss
president Kasper Villiger publicly admitted that his country bore "a considerable
burden of guilt" for its treatment of Jews during the Nazi period. And agreement
was finally reached between the SBA and the WJC on the establishment of a special
committee and an independent auditor.

<P> The ombudsman, Hanspeter Hani, an energetic lawyer, has now received
approximately 1,600 requests for help, about 80% of which are from Jewish
families. Switzerland being Switzerland, this doesn't come cheap: applicants must
pay a fee of Sfr300 with their letters, which may at least discourage dishonest
opportunists. Hani is going about the business with Swiss efficiency, but also
sympathetically. He has accepted two-thirds of the applications as being suitable
at face value for further investigation; the rest are being followed up with
further questions. With each application he lists all the names the applicant
considers might be on the account and has not rejected applications for lack of
information. "What I have to avoid is rejecting a request that could be solid
because the applicant doesn't know enough," he says.

<P> The list is in two parts: 50 pages involve accounts opened before the end of
the war; the rest accounts opened subsequently. At the end of May it was
distributed to 400 banks. Since the banks have now theoretically earmarked all
dormant funds, they should each have lists they can check against Hani's.
Typically, for security reasons, Swiss banks do not keep centralized records, but
some have centralized lists of dormant accounts. Those banks that don't are
expected to circulate Hani's list to all their branches. If this seems a
duplication of effort, it is the price of the highly secretive Swiss banking
system.

<P> There are major imponderables for the Jewish community. There is the problem
that third parties were often used to deposit the money because of the
principals' dangerous position. Family names may therefore not tally with names
on bank files. This was of course as true in 1962 as it is now, but there remains
the possibility that the committee may find a solution. The other imponderable is
funds looted by the Nazis. "This is where, in the minds of people who speak of
millions, it may come from," says Bloch. "They [the Swiss banks] can't find this
because most of the Nazi accounts have been moved to other places &#173;
Argentina and Spain, for example." But the WJC hopes the commission will come up
with a more satisfactory answer.

<P> Politics and, no doubt, a few cheats aside, it is clear that, half century
after the war, the relatives of Holocaust victims are still trying to find traces
of whatever they think may remain of their family wealth &#173; be it in the form
of bank deposits, insurance policies, gold, art or real estate. The letters to
Hani's office in Zurich come from all over the world and recount the most tragic
experiences.

<P> "I wish to verify an account ... of my family who did not survive their stay
in Auschwitz," reads one.

<P> "My complete family, father, mother, two sisters, one brother, died in a
concentration camp. At 16 I was left behind without my family," recounts another.

<P> A third says: "I believe that my father had deposited [money in a Swiss bank
account]. I guess it could have been in the name of my father, grandfather, my
mother, my sister..."

<P> Says Hani: "I read letters that say all of my family had disappeared. They
are not so easy to read."

<P> Eventually an independent auditor will be appointed by the committee to
ensure that banks and other financial institutions have conducted proper
searches. "They [the banks] will not come up with a lot of money," predicts
Bloch. But, he says, at least with a bipartisan committee and an independent
auditor there will be "truth, transparency and a belief in what we are told".
That is the hope, at least. The shame is that it had to wait half a
century.

<H3>INTERNET CRIME</H3>


<H2> <B>What a tangled web</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>That financial fraudsters will
practise to deceive is a big worry as the World Wide Web and other Internet
services proliferate. And when electronic cash is commonplace what will become of
the traditional monetary system? Michelle Celarier reports on criminal bugs in a
promising-looking system and the solutions proposed by regulators and
law-enforcers</B> </H4> 

<P> The bright-blue starry sky depicted on an Australian
web page for Fortuna Alliance offers an enticing proposition: "Make your income
soar like the space shuttle." But a click of the mouse is enough to bring World
Wide Web surfers down to earth. A web press release by Fortuna acknowledges that
its US home page was shut down by the US Federal Trade Commission in May, after
the company had been accused of running an illegal pyramid scheme. Operating for
just six months out of a small town in the US Northwest, Fortuna, the FTC
alleges, bilked tens of thousands of investors in dozens of countries out of an
estimated $9 million. By value, it is the biggest Internet fraud to date.

<P> The Fortuna case has opened the FTC's eyes to the vast potential for Internet
crime &#173; and has taught it something about the complications of international
law enforcement that can be involved. "The Internet makes it possible to
perpetrate such a crime anywhere," says Charles Harwood, FTC regional director in
charge of the case. After receiving warnings from authorities in Australia,
Canada and from the local police before being shut down, Fortuna's operators
disappeared offshore, as did most of the money they had collected. Communicating
via web pages still going strong from an Australian server, its operators have
denied the allegations. Undaunted, they continue to offer new schemes. They've
also started an on-line defence fund and have vowed to fight the FTC, which has
obtained an injunction to freeze assets in the US and in Antigua, where more than
$5 million had been directed from the company's US bank.

<P> An FTC civil suit seeks to return the money to investors, but it may be too
late. The FTC isn't sure what kind of extradition treaties (if any) exist with
Belize, the Central American country where the Fortuna leaders are living and are
rumoured to have purchased a skin-diving resort. And Antiguan bank-secrecy laws
make it impossible to know how much money is still there, and not already in
another offshore haven. "It's hard to get effective relief," sighs Harwood.
Nonetheless, he believes the success of the FTC in pursuing Fortuna is critical
to the development of financial services on the Internet. "We'd like to avoid
having the Internet viewed in the same light as 900 telephone numbers," he says,
referring to the pay-for-porn numbers that proliferate in the US.

<P> The borderless nature of the Internet is one of the characteristics that
makes it so susceptible to crime. But that isn't the only headache for regulators
and law-enforcement agencies everywhere as they struggle to get a handle on the
World Wide Web before a calamity undermines confidence in this major
technological development. For the things that make the Internet attractive to
legitimate business are as readily available to criminals. "The Internet is
cheap, it's easy and it's fast," says John Stark, special counsel for Internet
projects at the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. Many government
officials acknowledge being in the dark, only admitting to a suspicion that the
Internet is likely to challenge their traditional methods and legal frameworks.
"We haven't got a clue what to do," says one high-ranking law enforcement
official.

<P> <B>Virtual instruments</B>

<P> The US still dominates Internet activity, and as a result, most regulatory
action has occurred there. In addition to the FTC action against Fortuna, the SEC
has shut down six Internet-based scams. In one case, the SEC says, about $3.5
million was raised by two men offering "prime bank" securities &#173; instruments
that don't even exist. Another involved a company called Pleasure Time, Inc that
attracted $2 million selling unregistered securities offering huge profits to be
made from a telephone lottery.

<P> The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which
regulates the over-the-counter market, are now investigating market manipulation
involving the bulletin board services and Internet chat rooms that have been
instrumental in many small stocks' rise during the past year's frenzy. The SEC is
also deliberating whether proposed Internet stock exchanges will fall under its
regulatory jurisdiction, just as other regulators are eyeing proposed commodities
and currency exchanges.

<P> A further layer of complexity and opportunity for electronic crime springs
from the development of Internet-based payment systems. None of the Internet
crimes thus far investigated has involved exchanges of money via cyberspace.
However, once secure methods of transferring money are widely accepted &#173;
which could be much sooner than many observers predict &#173; a whole host of
other issues will arise, from monetary control and federal insurance to tax
avoidance, counterfeiting and money-laundering.

<P> Directed by the Group of 10 industrial countries, the Bank for International
Settlements in Basle is beginning to analyze the subject. So far European and US
regulators have taken diametrically opposed positions. The Europeans, as outlined
in a recent report from the European Monetary Institute (the institution
developing the European central bank), are proposing that regulated banks should
be the only entities authorized to conduct financial business over the Internet
or through prepaid smart cards, which contain a microchip that stores value and
are planning to use the Internet for their transactions. The EMI proposal has
been adopted as policy by the German finance ministry.

<P> <B>Beyond national control</B>

<P> So far, most US regulators and law enforcement officials have concluded that
such tight regulation is unnecessary &#173; and perhaps not even practicable.
"What the Germans are doing is probably irrelevant," says Stanley Morris,
director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a division of the
US Treasury that administers the US money-laundering statute. "They can order
that," Morris says, but any German citizen "can do his banking [online] in
Antigua, thank you very much."

<P> Few in the field expected the explosive growth in web usage that has already
occurred. In the US, where Internet penetration has gone furthest, some 37
million people are estimated to have access to the World Wide Web, according to
Nielson Media Research, a consumer survey organization. The SEC reports that
online investment services have about 800,000 to 900,000 accounts; 20% of
discount broker Charles Schwab's accounts are online. Global Internet usage is
expected to grow from 100 million to 500 million users by 2000.

<P> "Developments are taking place very rapidly," says Martin Hollobone, an
executive dealing with enforcement and legal issues at the UK's Securities &amp;
Investments Board (SIB). He is also involved with the International Organization
of Securities Commissions (Iosco) groups that are tackling some of the
secondary-market and enforcement questions the Internet poses. Hollobone says
that a year ago finance on the Internet was not a significant issue for UK
regulators because they saw use of the Internet as a little eccentric. But now
major UK retail banks such as Barclays are "close to doing money transactions" on
the Internet. "Once you start seeing financial transactions taking place, linked
with its international nature, the prospect of people's money disappearing into
cyberspace becomes a significant concern." Hollobone believes regulators will get
more concerned than they already are once big institutions start doing
transactions over the Internet.

<P> One regulator who is trying to get on top of the issue is Mary Schapiro,
president of the US National Association of Securities Dealers' (NASD) new
regulatory unit. Schapiro began looking into potential Internet fraud when she
was chairman of the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission a year ago.
Shapiro is convinced more enforcement and regulation has to be undertaken and has
pushed the NASD to the forefront. The NASD suspended trading in one OTC stock,
Comparator, earlier this year when it noted that dramatic price and volume
activity was preceded by a flurry of Internet advocacy and discussion of the
stock. Similar activity occurred in half a dozen other stocks still under
investigation.

<P> Even so, Shapiro says: "It's impracticable that regulators are in a position
to be monitoring or surveilling the entire Internet or to bring enough meaningful
cases to make a difference." Like her counterparts at the SEC and elsewhere, she
believes education of Internet users is crucial. "The Internet is a terrific tool
for getting information but users need to understand that people can be sharing
information for wholly their own purposes ... It can be a very cost-effective way
to disseminate fraudulent information."

<P> "You don't know the credibility of the source," adds the SEC's Stark. "You
might have an idea who the person is, but you don't know if it's a short seller,
a promoter, a broker or an analyst. He might not be disinterested and you have no
way of knowing other than from his own disclosure." Insiders could be touting
stocks they want to dump, says Schapiro, noting that the anonymity of the web
means that potential investors have no way of verifying the quality of the advice
given by many online stock promoters, or even if they are who they claim to be.
Even if an individual knows who the user is, cautions Stark: "You can't be sure
when reading the posting that it isn't someone who used a package sniffer, or a
stolen user name."

<P> If an individual is using an alias, NASD doesn't have authority to find out
who is behind the activity. Such cases would be turned over to the SEC, whose
powers to subpoena could extract information from Internet access suppliers such
as America Online or CompuServe.

<P> Since the NASD is a self-regulatory body that covers brokerage firms and
their employees, Schapiro is trying to get the firms to agree to mail a new NASD
brochure to all their accounts with warnings about the Internet. "We're trying to
walk people through in a catchy way to the possibilities and pitfalls of using
the Internet as an investment tool." Ten brokerage firms have already signed up
for this initiative. The warning is also now being displayed on the American
Association of Individual Investors' web site, and on the Motley Fool, a popular
stock investment service provided by America Online, which is reputed to have a
great influence on OTC stocks. Motley Fool clearly wants to keep its reputation
clean. "Everyone will see the warning as soon as they sign on," Shapiro says.

<P> The SEC's home page on the web, set up this summer, links users to a detailed
educational page entitled "Investment fraud and abuse travel to cyberspace". It
cautions investors to be on the alert for offers peppered with such words as
"guarantee", "high return", or "risk-free". And it suggests: "Watch out for
offshore scams and investment opportunities in other countries. When you send
your money abroad, and something goes wrong, it's more difficult to find out what
happened and to locate your money."

<P> A web site run by a group of US agencies, called the National Fraud Center,
has links to home pages for other US government agencies such as the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the FTC, and international ones run by
Argentina's justice ministry, the Australian attorney general's office, Canada's
justice department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the justice
ministries in Peru, Singapore and Sweden. In the UK, the SIB hopes to have a web
page by the year-end.

<P> The Internet has become a high priority for the SEC's enforcement unit, which
has a team stalking the Internet to sniff out fraud. Like any other user, the
agency is tapping into the benefits of fast and cheap technology. Its home page
also enables prospective investors to email it tips about potential frauds. "The
response has been unbelievable," says Stark, who notes that after being online
for only a month and a half, the SEC was receiving 30 to 40 complaints a day via
its new web site. He has also been impressed by the "detail and sophistication"
of the messages. "People start their own investigations. If they have received a
spam (the Internet equivalent of a cold call), they will do an analysis of the
header to figure out where it came from. Some complaints even list the securities
violations and do a legal analysis."

<P> The self-policing seems to be part of what Stark calls the "culture of
benevolence on the net". Web surfers and users of email-based news groups are
accustomed to posting questions about virtually everything from aardvarks to
zymurgy and getting responses from knowledgeable and friendly sources. And
although such a culture of cooperation may have induced a naive trust in the
accuracy of information among some users, it can also prompt positive attempts to
stamp out misuse from those who feel the Internet is being used nefariously.

<P> <B>International cooperation</B>

<P> As well as promoting education of Internet users and seeking their assistance
in tracking down and limiting cyberfraud, regulators are trying to foster
international cooperation. Securities fraudsters already work cross-border, but
the Internet makes that easier. Internet criminals can disguise who and where
they are and may also be able to exploit nuances regulators haven't even
considered.

<P> "Jurisdiction is a big issue," says the SIB's Hollobone. Iosco has just set
up two working groups, one on secondary markets and another on enforcement and
the exchange of information. But as the SEC's international chief Paul Leder
notes: "It's hard to reach an international consensus until you see where people
want to be domestically." As far as the SEC is concerned, undecided questions
include whether Internet exchanges should be regulated, and whether brokers and
issuers trading on the Internet should be registered with the SEC.

<P> Hollobone says the SIB already has memoranda of understanding with, for
example, the SEC, to try to coordinate action. "We're working on ensuring that
they work as well on the problems raised by the Internet as they do in other
areas." He says the SIB is "trying to ensure that people using the Internet do
not take advantage of any potential loopholes in our regulations." Because the
UK's Financial Services Act was not worded with the Internet in mind, he
explains, there is inevitably some opportunity for "people to carry on
unauthorized activities on the Internet and not get caught." The SEC, he notes,
has already issued interpretative releases about the application of its rules and
regulations. The UK's approach is to make sure electronic information follows the
same rules as printed matter.

<P> A number of Internet exchanges are being developed, including
currency-trading services offered by London's Currency Management Corp, and 1st
Money Garden in New York. Whether or not these are ultimately regulated,
Hollobone believes they will not succeed unless there is a minimum of certainty
in a number of areas. "Someone could try and do it without the necessary clearing
facilities, but people dealing with them will want certainty of execution in
their contracts. They will want to be certain of the legal standing, they'll want
to know the jurisdiction in which it is operating, the insolvency legislation it
falls under and what legal redress exists." Essentially, he continues, investors
will want to know: "What happens if a counterparty goes down? Who settles the
contract? Whose bankruptcy laws apply? Can you protect them?"

<P> A perception that electronic money transactions are secure is the first and
critical step to unlocking the potential of the Internet for a broader range of 
financial transactions. But it also opens the way to much more crime. Industry
lawyers and even some government officials point out that there are good reasons
why powerful encryption systems have been developed relatively slowly. Above all
it's because such systems not only keep information secure from hackers but can
also prevent detection of fraud by law enforcement departments. In the US, such
agencies as the FBI and the Justice Department have been so worried about
terrorists and participants in organized crime using the web to communicate
internationally undetected that they've declined to give approval to export
licences for strong encryption software.

<P> "The government has purposely slowed down [encryption software] development,"
says Internet law specialist Charles Merrill of McCarter and English, a New
Jersey law firm. Legislation introduced in Congress to force the government to
get rid of these exports controls has prompted the US administration to propose
some relaxation, but industry attorneys say it hasn't gone far enough. For
example, Netscape has received permission for 128-bit encryption to be included
in the next version of its popular web-browser software, though weaker versions
will be distributed outside the US. By contrast, Russian encryption software uses
280 bits. The more bits, the more difficult it is for both hackers and government
officials to penetrate an encoded communication.

<P> Today many online financial services rely on a direct modem link between a
user and, say, a bank. Internet transactions, by contrast, are on an open system.
Because it is difficult to make this secure, most Internet financial business
today is solicitation, information and advertising. "People aren't using the
Internet to transfer money unless they're nuts," says Merrill. Encryption in such
software as Netscape, he says, "is not really secure from the standpoint of
telling who can log in." Without such security, he asserts, it's impossible to
make binding legal contracts, the key to the expansion of Internet financial
business.

<P> What has been lacking, Merrill explains, has been the ability to authenticate
the user's identity via an impenetrable digital signature. Recently, though, Visa
announced an alliance with VeriSign, a software company that has developed such
signatures, and MasterCard has agreed a similar deal with another software
provider.

<P> <B>The paradox of security</B>

<P> Digital signature technology is being tested in various smart-card systems,
the UK's Mondex, Cybercash in the US and DigiCash in the Netherlands. All such
cards move money from a bank account to a card that can then be used in place of
cash. But the confidentiality required throws up what the money-laundering cops
at FinCEN call the "paradox of security". Once the money leaves the banking
system it has to become anonymous in order to be secure enough for transmission
over the Internet.

<P> "Any highly efficient anonymous payment system operating outside of the banks
is going to be attractive to organized crime," says FinCEN's Morris. To combat
money-laundering, for example, the US government has required banks to file
reports and maintain paper trails. This and the "know your customer" rule that
banks are now supposed to follow could become meaningless even if such
transactions were done through them. And encoded communication on the Internet
could render traditional phone-tapping techniques redundant.

<P> FinCEN is just one of the US treasury agencies that has been reviewing the
topic over the past year. That's because treasury secretary Robert Rubin has
singled out the Internet as an area of top concern, and recently announced the
formation of a task force to look at the issues raised by electronic money.
Various bank regulators will be involved in the effort, which will address the
extent to which currency regulations and laws cover electronic money, and try to
propose "innovative and non-regulatory" methods of plugging any loopholes.

<P> Morris has concluded that government is ill-equipped to deal with this
fast-developing technology, which can lead to software packages changing every
three months. So FinCEN is trying to work with the industry. "We know you're not
going to tell us all your trade secrets," Morris has told encryption experts. But
to avoid the government coming in with draconian measures after major investments
have been made, he suggested instead, "Tell us where you're headed and let us
examine the ways in which the good guys win and the bad guys don't."

<P> Besides the opportunities encryption offers for money laundering, central
bankers have identified other concerns about money swirling through the Internet
unregulated, notably the fact that electronic transactions broaden the definition
of money. "It is not really a complete flight of fancy to foresee central bank
money becoming insignificant in the domestic economy," says Jerry Jordan,
president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,
Ohio. "In time the public may find commercially provided electronic money
attractive as a replacement for currency." Creating another form of money &#173;
call it M8, some joke &#173; would complicate monetary policy for central bankers
and mean a loss of some of the income that derives from issuing currency.

<P> In a speech to a congressional committee last year, former Federal Reserve
vice-chairman Alan Blinder raised some relevant questions. "Whose monetary
liability is the particular form of electronic money? If an issuer were to become
bankrupt or insolvent, what would be the status of the claim represented by a
balance on a card or other device? In such a situation, when and how would funds
be made available to the holder? Who is responsibility for the clearing and
settlement mechanism?"

<P> In addition to these structural issues, such unresolved questions as
counterfeiting, liability and theft led to the European proposals to restrict the
issue of prepaid cards or the offering of financial services via the Internet to
regulated banks. A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry says that "immense
damage could result if the legislative bodies were to delay until large-scale
abuse of electronic funds held in computer networks had occurred". For instance,
she says that "the falsification of electronic units of payment cannot be
demonstrated by virtue of physical notes and coins and there are no restrictions
on dissemination throughout computer networks. Legislative action must be taken
without delay."

<P> Such a heavy-handed approach is not to Americans' liking. The FBI may be
concerned about encryption but technological innovation has been a powerful motor
of US development. And the Internet has largely been developed in the US, where
market innovation generally takes precedence over regulation.

<P> The US Federal Reserve Board has so far adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
Blinder's  speech last year concluded that "the uncertainties regarding the
future of 'electronic money' are so overwhelming that we mainly suggest patience
and study rather than regulatory restrictions". This summer, board member Edward
Kelley put it more bluntly in a speech to the Digital Commerce Conference in
Washington: "The Federal Reserve has not subscribed to the European view that
only banks should issue prepaid cards, or by extension other stored-value
payments products." Currently under legislative debate is whether such cybercash
would be subject to regulations currently in place that limit the liability of
credit card holders for fraud.

<P> <B>Quick, efficient and global</B>

<P> One reason the US regulators are reluctant to take the European approach is
because they fear that the Internet is such a jurisdictional tangle that current
legal and regulatory mechanisms will not be able to cope. The growth and success
of largely self-regulated international financial markets makes many
theoreticians wary of advocating the regulation of another global medium. Some,
like Villanova University law professor Hank Perritt, who is also an attorney for
Netscape, argue that the World Wide Web is bringing average consumers the type of
quick, efficient and global transactions already available in the wholesale
international capital markets. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland economist Ed
Stephens argues: "If there's another way to do it and it's cheaper, that's the
way things are going to go. You can't expect the supervisory process to be
monitoring the whole world to make sure everything going right."

<P> Some US regulators expect &#173; and hope &#173; that many Internet schemes
will seek the seal of approval that regulation offers, without it being
mandatory. A case in point is Security First Network Bank, which claims to be the
first US federally regulated bank on the Internet. SFNB sought Fed approval to go
online and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance for deposits, meeting
all the necessary capital and reserve requirements to do so. After reviewing
SFNB's encryption software, which it hopes to market to other financial
institutions, the Fed cautioned that the security measures the bank had developed
did not provide "absolute protection". But, it added, "the nature of these risks
is not different from those to which more traditional banking operations are
exposed in other forms." Consumers apparently agree. SFNB &#173; previously a
sleepy savings and loan based in Pineville, Kentucky, and part of the Cardinal
Bankshares Holding Group until it was spun off in an IPO this spring &#173;went
online last fall. By the end of March it had garnered $6.2 million in deposits
over the Internet.

<P> In the US at least, where the federal courts recently ruled that Internet
communication was protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech,
Big Brother-type fears of interference in the right to communicate have taken
precedence over pre-emptive regulation. For the stronger encryption software the
financial world is clamouring for can indeed work both ways. "The same technology
that [allows] you to operate in total secrecy also permits the government to
collect every bit of information about you," says FinCEN's Morris. "We could
mandate that a record be kept of every transaction, and that it be downloaded
every week." But, he says, "we're not going to do that." On the other hand, he
says, the US Treasury, whose Comptroller of the Currency regulates banks with the
Fed, doesn't want to see "infinite amounts of money outside the financial
institutions".

<P> What is needed is a whole new way of looking at the Internet, argues David
Johnson, who heads Counsel Connect, a group of lawyers who focus on
Internet-related issues. "Current legal structures are tied very closely to
geographic territorial jurisdictions, but now we have a phenomenon that isn't
tied to that. We have to look at the possibility of creating a new kind of legal
order that more closely fits to the new environment."

<P> Self-regulation may be the only real solution, Johnson argues. "The
limitations faced by national governments ... don't mean that the net can't or
won't develop some basic ground rules of its own. It is important for the growth
of electronic commerce that there be some effective constraints on fraud. "If
not, he suggests, "people just won't go there."

<P> That may be little consolation to the thousands who lost money on the Fortuna
pyramid. The FTC's Harwood says most of the complaints he has received from
Fortuna investors were directed at the agency, which they begged to back off so
that they could recoup their investments as the scheme progressed. But according
to FTC economist Peter Vander Nat, who analyzed the formula being used to promise
huge returns, millions of newcomers would have had to buy into Fortuna's plan in
order to pay off those who had already invested. It appears, though, that the
FTC's message has hit home. As of the end of September, Fortuna's surviving web
pages have received a little under 1,200 hits. How many of the curious have done
more than read the page is not known.&#009;*

<H3>SECURITIZATION</H3>



<H2> <B>Will NatWest's deal backfire?</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Britain's leading
corporate banker needs a drastic solution to the problem of low margins. Rolling
up 200 of the best loans and selling them as bonds is certainly that. But it has
invoked a ferocious response from corporate treasurers and competitors. Brian
Caplen reports on the controversy surrounding the deal </B> </H4> 

<P> At first
glance NatWest's new securitization deal is the perfect panacea to Europe's
banking ills. Banks have complained long and hard that big-ticket corporate loans
do not bring proper returns and are heavy users of capital. Securitizing $5
billion of them &#173; as the British bank plans to do later this month &#173;
will free up credit lines and capital as well as generate risk-free income.
Martin Owen, the chief executive of the bank's investment banking arm, NatWest
Markets, describes it as a "golden scenario".

<P> But that is only in theory. As news of the plan spread through the markets,
it became clear that the practice may turn out differently. The NatWest deal, the
first to include such a large number of high-quality corporate loans &#173; some
200 &#173; has come under fierce attack from corporate treasurers, competitors
and academics.

<P> Corporate treasurers complain the deal alters the basic relationship between
a bank and its customers. A major difficulty is that while NatWest will continue
to service the loans, it will now be doing so on behalf of bondholders, argue the
treasurers. As a result it will be less sympathetic to a borrower in
difficulties, they say. In the worst case, the investors could even replace
NatWest with another loan administrator and "you would find yourself negotiating
with strangers", says one treasurer.

<P> Among a long list of grievances, corporates say that if banks securitize
their loans, the companies might as well go direct to the capital markets.
Treasurers feel that if there is money to be made out of securitization their
companies should be entitled to a slice. And unrated corporates fear their
financial secrets will leak out as the deal is pored over by rating agencies and
investors.

<P> Banking critics question whether the structure can make money for NatWest
given the thinness of loan spreads and the bank's lack of experience in pricing
these types of bonds. "By itself, the deal is unlikely to make money and very
likely to make losses," says Naik Narayan, assistant professor of finance at the
London Business School. "Unlike with mortgage-backed deals, the historical data
on prepayment of corporate loans necessary for pricing the various tranches is
not readily available. That raises the risk of mispricing and also makes
investors nervous."

<P> Brandon Davies, who is treasurer, UK banking services, for NatWest's rival
Barclays, says that securitization by itself will not provide the answers to
banks' problems with large corporate loans. "Securitization is a technology not a
strategy. The critical issue is knowing what [bank assets] you want to keep and
what you want to sell. Unless you have a portfolio management strategy, you end
up selling a lottery. You have no idea whether an asset is worth selling or not."

<P> <B>PR pride turns coy</B>

<P> Even as a flag-waving exercise, the scheme appears to be falling flat.
Initially, NatWest scored a public relations coup by giving the story exclusively
to the <I>Financial Times</I> &#173; a move that set other papers scurrying to
provide matching coverage. The result was a press bonanza. But as the publicity
blaze began generating heat where NatWest least wanted it to &#173; among its
customers &#173; the bank began running for cover. The bank turned down requests
by <I>Euromoney</I> to interview a NatWest corporate customer about the scheme
and to attend the deal's roadshow promoting the joint Euro/144A offering. Also,
there was no response to requests to interview NatWest Markets chief executive
Martin Owen or to see a copy of a letter the bank sent to its customers informing
them of the deal. After setting the ball rolling, NatWest suddenly became coy
about giving away too many details.

<P> But by interviewing other market players, <I>Euromoney</I> has been able to
discover the likely structure that will be used, to assess costs and pricing and
to hear a full range of views on the deal.

<P> The idea was first proposed internally 18 months ago by NatWest's
securitization team and has been worked on in earnest since early this year. The
driving force behind it is the bank's head of securitization, Bruce Bantz, a
controversial, larger-than-life American, who formerly worked at Citibank during
the pioneering days of selling credit card debt into the market. To hear Bantz
tell it, he practically invented securitization and his brash self-promotion has
ruffled feathers in the City.

<P> As others recount Bantz's career, he was fortunate enough to be in the front
line when the cream of US investment banks were pitching their ideas on
securitization to Citibank. "If Bantz invented securitization, why has he ended
up at NatWest?" asks one competitor. Says a close associate: "He does have his
head a bit in the clouds. He comes up with a lot of ideas but he needs to be
surrounded by practical people who can sift out the good ones."

<P> In any case, say critics, the structure of NatWest's new deal is not original
in itself. Technically, it is like a collateralized loan obligation (CLO)
repackaging a pool of loans into bonds. The NatWest deal will consist of "a
rainbow of tranches", says Bantz, with differing credit quality, maturity and
possibly currency.

<P> But whereas the typical CLO is backed by between 20 and 40 high-yielding
loans, the NatWest structure uses a larger pool of 200 loans made to companies in
the UK, the US and Europe. The loans, amounting to 30% of the bank's big-ticket
corporate lending, are of investment-grade quality or what the bank describes as
the equivalent. Only one-third of the loans have external ratings, two thirds
have been rated by NatWest's own internal system and all of them have a bank
grading score. The task of the agencies rating the bonds is to satisfy themselves
that the bank's internal credit systems are adequate for the agencies' purposes.
In this, Duff &amp; Phelps has an advantage since one of its analysts, Martin
Squires, used to do credit rating for NatWest.

<P> Putting unrated corporates into the pool helps improve the economics of the
deal because their loan yields will be higher. In fact, Bantz says the deal could
be done only in Europe where there are sufficient unrated corporates still
relying on banks for borrowing. In the US, most large corporates go direct to the
bond or commercial paper markets for money and don't need to borrow from banks.
In this sense, securitizations of this kind may speed the process of
disintermediation &#173; corporates missing out the banks and going to the
markets.

<P> Bantz prefers to describe the process as "reintermediation". "We are
reinventing the way corporate loans are made, taking it from a business most
banks would rather not do but get pushed into, to a business where we can hold
our heads high to shareholders and still maintain our client relationships," he
says. Says Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of the UK rating agency, Ibca:
"I don't think this hastens disintermediation. The trend is there and banks have
to learn to live with it."

<P> A more serious issue than whether unrated corporates are persuaded to rate is
the negative reaction from companies which have consciously avoided the rating
agencies' gaze. "Unrated corporates are terrified of information about them being
given to outsiders," says Fabio Salvalaggio, a securitization specialist with
Citibank. "They dread the idea of information going to rating agencies and
investors."

<P> <B>Treasurers on the warpath</B>

<P> With the NatWest format of using a large pool &#173; allowing agencies to
analyze it on an actuarial rather than a case-by-case basis &#173; investors will
not get information about which companies' loans are in it. Indeed, NatWest has
told customers only that the deal is happening and is not specifying the loans
being used. But this has not calmed the fears of treasurers, in both rated and
unrated companies, that securitization is against their interests.

<P> "Could banks act with the same freedom in dealing with a troubled borrower,
if they have the interests of a [bond] trust in the background?" asks Stephen
Crompton, director of treasury for SmithKline Beecham, which deals with NatWest
but does not borrow from it.

<P> Other corporate treasurers are even more forthright, though reluctant to put
their comments on the record. "If the bank is going to securitize our loans, then
why the hell don't we go to the capital markets in the first place," is a common
riposte. "Many of us would rather die in a ditch than have transferable debt,"
says another, while acknowledging that NatWest's sub-participation structure
(technically, the selling of an interest in the loan rather than the transfer of
rights) strictly does not fall into this category. Another objection is that
securitization alters a corporate's borrowing strategy. Having decided to raise
so much in loans and so much in the capital markets, securitization changes the
proportions without a corporate's agreement.

<P> NatWest argues that securitization of loans does not change the bank's
relationship with its customers. "Our fiduciary responsibility is no different,"
says Bantz. "Normally we have a fiduciary responsibility to our depositors not to
throw good money after bad; in this case we must do the same for the bondholders.
Either way the bank is motivated to make good judgement calls on credit for the
benefit of the bank, the shareholders and the customers." But Bantz will not say
whether NatWest loan officers will know if customers' loans are securitized or
not when making decisions on poor performers.

<P> Bob Blower, assistant director of the British Bankers' Association (BBA),
says that with securitization banks could turn out more rather than less patient
with slow-paying customers. "If you are interested in cashflows, you will be more
patient with a slow payer because realizing the assets is of no use to you," he
says.

<P> With large corporates reducing the number of banks they deal with from
hundreds to tens, NatWest says it is under pressure to make bigger loans. Only by
freeing up credit lines through securitization can it meet this demand, say
officers. An illustration of how this might work out came just a week after the
deal first made the headlines. NatWest announced a &#163;796 million ($1.24
billion) financing and refinancing facility for the UK's Humber Power which the
bank said would not have been possible without securitization.

<P> But if securitization of large corporate loans does take off, borrowers are
likely to have two responses. First, they will want to tighten loan covenants so
they have greater control over whether securitization of their loans takes place.
Second, they will want some of the financial benefits, either in the form of
reduced arrangement fees or still lower spreads. "Why give somebody a free
option?" asks Citibank's Salvalaggio. "Corporates will want something out of it
for themselves."

<P> BBA's Blower is unusual in thinking that securitization could be a winner for
all sides. "When banks talk about lousy rates, they mean their return on capital
is low. If you make a quantum leap in rates of return [through securitization],
you can pass some of that on to your customers," he says.

<P> But most of NatWest's competitors &#173; both commercial bankers and rivals
in securitization deals &#173; think making money out of the deal will be
extremely difficult.

<P> "It's a close call as to whether you would end up with any money left," says
a senior executive with one of NatWest's competitors. Says a securitization
specialist with a London-based investment bank: "Whether NatWest will make any
money is the $64,000 question. The margins are very thin."

<P> The likely structure of the deal will include a large top-rated tranche of
double-A floating-rate bonds, NatWest's own rating, to be issued via a Cayman
Islands-registered special purpose vehicle, Rose Funding. (In a
sub-participation, bonds cannot rate higher than the issuer's own rating and, if
NatWest were downgraded, the bonds would be too. Also, if NatWest were to go
bankrupt, bond investors would not get direct access to funds but would have to
join the queue of unsecured creditors to the administrator's door.)

<P> Without a triple-A tranche, the spread between the bulk of the loans and the
bulk of the top-rated tranches might be as little as five to 10 basis points (see
table on page 40). Spreads will be better on the mezzanine tranches and could
rise to several hundred on the unrated tranche which is expected to form 2% of
the issue and will provide credit enhancement. Bantz says NatWest plans to sell
off the entire issue but may end up holding part of the unrated portion. These
bonds are most at risk in case of default or late payment by borrowers. If the
bank does end up holding them, it has to set aside capital equal in value to the
bonds, so reducing the capital-freeing effects of the securitization.

<P> <B>Returns not reserves</B>

<P> Bantz stresses that the deal is about improving return on capital rather than
capital adequacy. This makes sense since NatWest, like other UK banks, is awash
with capital. The securitization, says Bantz, is designed to make profits in its
own right and there are five ways in which this is possible, including running a
commercial paper programme off the back of the floating-rate bonds and
arbitraging the difference in the spreads (see table). But setting up the scheme
will also involve considerable expenses such as lawyers' fees, the set-up costs
of a commercial paper programme as well as the underwriting of the issue. NatWest
Markets will probably do most of the underwriting but is expected to be joined by
at least one other bank.

<P> Critics argue that the instant effect of the deal will be to raise NatWest's
cost of funding and lower its return on capital. The deal will release $400
million &#173; the 8% that regulators stipulate must be held against the $5
billion of loans &#173; so enlarging the capital base. With most profits from the
loans flowing to bondholders, returns on this larger capital base will fall.

<P> "The immediate impact is that you have this capital but you have raised your
funding costs," says one market watcher who wishes to remain anonymous. "NatWest
through its MTN [medium-term note] programme could borrow more cheaply than
through securitization if you just look at the marginal costs." He adds that if
the bank "invests this capital at Libid it's not very satisfactory".

<P> Ibca's Monro-Davies thinks the NatWest deal is "the intelligent thing to do
and will be copied by others". He points out that a lower return on capital with
reduced risk, say 15% rather than the current 20%, might be attractive to
shareholders. But he agrees that with a capital adequacy ratio of 12%, NatWest is
not motivated by capital shortage.

<P> "NatWest doesn't need the deal for capital, they probably want to have more
flexibility," says Monro-Davies. "It's a good time to do it when you don't have
to, that way if anything goes wrong you are not in trouble."

<P> Alan Brown, director of group credit policy for Barclays, says there are four
possible reasons why a bank would want to securitize &#173; to control capital
growth without saying "no" to customers wishing to borrow; to control growth in a
particular asset class that is unattractive because of low spreads; to adjust the
portfolio to get a better risk/reward mix; or to send a signal to the market that
a bank does not want to be in a particular type of corporate lending.

<P> "Securitization is one way, but not the only way, of altering the
consequences of writing business at the large end of the market," says Brown.
"Securitization brings genuine elements of novelty and, if it works, it will open
up new possibilities."

<P> But competitors cannot resist speculating that NatWest is keen to do this
deal because of past expansion of the corporate loan book at low margins. NatWest
is the UK's largest corporate banker and has made much of this in recent
advertisements. Why did they take all these loans on in the first place, ask
competitors.

<P> Says Brown: "Barclays doesn't feel uncomfortable about its big-ticket lending
because of what we have done in terms of syndication and risk reduction over the
past few years."

<P> <B>Come on down</B>

<P> NatWest's Bantz is sensitive to criticism of the deal. "There will always be
naysayers and critics of innovation," he says. "There will always be people who
will throw things onto the pitch at the players. I say they should come down and
play against us."

<P> In fact, those competitors who play against Bantz rate his team quite highly
in third-party securitizations. In February, for example, NatWest Markets
structured and arranged a &#163;1 billion mortgage-backed offering for Birmingham
Midshires Building Society. At the time, this was the largest-ever asset-backed
deal issued in the Euromarkets.

<P> Ultimately, though, the success or otherwise of the NatWest securitization
will be determined in areas of the bank far removed from Bantz. If relationships
with customers deteriorate, then it's because commercial bankers have either
failed to get the securitization message across to clients or to advise
internally of its harmful effects.

<P> Ibca's Monro-Davies believes customers will come round in time. "When things
change, people always start fussing," he says. "But I doubt whether it's a
significant problem. Banks are having to change pretty dramatically. Since we are
urging them to be more aggressive, we can't really complain when they are."

<P> Most crucial of all will be what NatWest does with the capital the scheme
releases. Will it take the low-risk strategy currently in vogue among UK banks of
buying back shares? Or will it make further acquisitions &#173; the US-based
M&amp;A firm Gleacher, the fund manager Gartmore and the US government bond
dealer Greenwich Capital have all been added to the NatWest portfolio over the
past 12 months. If so, how astute will NatWest be in boosting the returns of the
purchased assets? Long after the hue and cry about loan securitization is over,
these issues will still be haunting the bank's corridors.&#009;*

<H3>LDC DEBT</H3> 
<H2>Tied in knots </H2>
<H4>Take $250 billion of developing country bond debt. Spread it thinly
among banks, brokers, fund managers and retail investors across the world.
Next, pack the debt with legal explosives. Bind all parties together tightly,
light the touchpaper and stand back. What might happen if these bonds defaulted?
Disaster, say the economists. But is anybody listening? By Ben Edwards </H4>
Much to his surprise, Bill Rhodes finds he has a little time on his hands.
The Citibank vice-chairman and veteran debt negotiator has recently returned
from his last major tour of duty south of the border. On October 27, the
Peruvian government and its foreign creditors announced an agreement to
restructure $4.4 billion of external debt in default since the early 1980s.
The long era of negotiations between Latin American governments and their
commercial bank creditors has finally limped to a close. <BR>
<BR>
From the comforts of his third floor office in mid-town Manhattan, Rhodes
relaxes into his chair and remembers the time when he joined the bank as
a fresh-faced recruit in the late 1950s. &quot;There was this little guy
with a green eye-shade sitting in the corner of the office,&quot; he says
with a smile. &quot;I asked what his job was. The answer? He was still sorting
out sovereign bond issues which had defaulted a quarter-century earlier.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It seems an odd reflection from a man who has spent the best years of his
career battling through sovereign debt negotiations in turn tedious, obscure
and acrimonious. It seems odder still when you recall he has spent the 1990s
busily converting defaulted sovereign bank loans into Brady bond debt. Yet
Rhodes seems blissfully unaware of the irony. The last major wave of sovereign
bond defaults took more than two decades to resolve. The next, thanks to
the legacy of the Latin American debt crisis, could be worse still. Many
Brady bonds have been specifically designed to make the consequences of
default extremely messy. <BR>
<BR>
This should be worrying for bondholders too. On the contrary, they take
a perverse delight in the situation. &quot;The market takes great comfort
from the fact that these instruments will be extremely difficult to restructure,&quot;
says Peter West, a director of West Merchant Bank in London. <BR>
<BR>
A handful of academics, officials and bankers are searching for imaginative
solutions to the problems. Some have argued for bankruptcy codes for countries
which get into difficulties servicing their foreign debt. Others are pushing
forward more modest proposals. Both want a better deal for both debtors
and creditors. It is worth recalling that those who lent to Peru, for example,
will get only a little over half their money back. <BR>
<BR>
But the reformers are up against it. Those bondholders who have not buried
their heads deep in the sand stand accused of intellectual laziness. They
are simply not thinking big enough. Some are pathologically hostile to any
suggestion of reform. <BR>
<BR>
It is time to think again. The hapless Citibank official with the green
eye-shade may belong to another generation of bankers, but his problems
are contemporary ones. Cross-border capital flows to the developing world
are once again dominated by private finance. Likewise, much of this is in
the form of bond debt. According to World Bank estimates, for example, in
1980 the total stock of all developing country bond issues outstanding stood
at $19.12 billion. By 1993, this had grown nearly twelve-fold to $224.19
billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some clues to what the next debt crisis might look like can be found in
the past. Following the first world war, many governments in Latin America
raised finance via foreign bond issues in the US. The great depression of
the 1930s then triggered a wave of bond defaults across the continent. Subsequent
negotiations were messy and protracted. Bolivia, the first country to default
in 1931, did not settle its bondholders' claims until 1958. <BR>
<BR>
The reasons are several. In many cases, the number of creditors involved
proved unmanageably large. In the US, for example, some 40 different - and
competing - bondholders' committees to represent creditors' interests had
been established by 1934. Delinquent debtor governments found they could
play off the interests of these committees with relative ease. In turn,
creditors found that each individual committee had little leverage with
which to negotiate. <BR>
<BR>
Different classes of creditors also squabbled. Those who had subscribed
to stabilization loans endorsed by the League of Nations, the United Nations'
predecessor, claimed seniority over the bondholders for example. <BR>
<BR>
What might happen next time around? &quot;A disaster, a catastrophe, a mess,
total confusion,&quot; says Richard Portes of the London Business School
who argues eloquently for reform. <BR>
<BR>
Sheer numbers again militate against any rapid resolution of competing claims.
&quot;You've first got the problem of how to convene the bondholders,&quot;
says Joyce Chang, director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers
in New York. &quot;Let's say Brazil defaulted on $45 billion of external
bond debt. There must be tens of thousands of creditors involved. What will
we do? Hire a football stadium?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But even if all parties could be persuaded to attend the game, there would
be a bewildering number of teams competing. Sovereign balance sheets once
again contain a complex mixture of foreign liabilities, with banks, governments,
multilateral development institutions and bondholders all providing large
chunks of debt. <BR>
<BR>
Even bondholders themselves are a fairly disparate bunch. According to Salomon,
a little over half of all emerging market bond issues are held by banks
and brokers. The remainder is split between general and specialist mutual
funds, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, high net-worth private
investors and retail investors. High-yielding emerging market paper is particularly
popular with German and Japanese retail investors. The next finance minister
who dares default on his bonds might find himself faced with an angry <I>Hausfrau</I>
from Munich. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Unanimity versus majority rights</B> <BR>
<BR>
The $180 billion market in Brady bonds carries its own special horrors.
Although bond covenants vary considerably from deal to deal, many have been
structured to make negotiations in the event of default extremely difficult.
Most require unanimous approval from all creditors to change the terms of
principal and interest payments. In addition, 100% agreement is needed to
cede this principle of unanimity. If she's angry enough, the German housewife
could in theory hold any restructuring negotiations to ransom. <BR>
<BR>
Cross-default clauses ensure that, should a debtor nation default selectively
on its external liabilities, the contagion will spread to Brady bonds and
other instruments. With the odd exception, most governments that concluded
Brady bond deals also waived their rights to sovereign immunity. Such rights
protect national assets from seizure in the event of default. <BR>
<BR>
Even without this waiver, sovereign immunity protection has weakened considerably
since the second world war. Both the British State Immunity Act of 1978
and the US Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 limit claims of sovereign immunity.
&quot;Increasingly,&quot; reads a recent report from Moody's, the US rating
agency, &quot;defaulting sovereigns will face determined legal challenges
from bondholders...the legal immunity of a sovereign who defaults on foreign
currency bonds has become considerably more problematical than it once was.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The result, says Jim Hurlock, a sovereign debt specialist at lawyers White
&amp; Case in New York, could be a tangle of law suits that might take decades
to unravel. &quot;A lot of creditors won't want to be identified,&quot;
he believes. &quot;They'll start legal actions in Switzerland. My question
is: where do we go from there?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some of these covenants differ little from those attached to the bank loan
agreements that went into default in the 1980s. Many loan agreements, for
example, also embedded the principle of unanimous approval for any alteration
in the terms of payment. But this is not the whole story. Most sovereign
bank loan agreements also contain a sharing clause, requiring any creditor
receiving disproportionate payment from the debtor as a result of litigation
to share the proceeds with other creditors on a <I>pro rata </I>basis. As
a result, the last debt crisis produced remarkably little litigation. This
experience is unlikely to be repeated. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, as the financing of sovereigns has moved from the bank loan
markets to the international capital markets, so too have governments increased
their exposure to this sort of creditor action. &quot;What might happen
if a government defaults on its bonds?&quot; asks Vincent Palermo, a quantitative
analyst with Salomon Brothers. &quot;The emerging market debt specialists,
whose job is specifically to analyze and trade sovereign credits, will sell
to investors whose particular skill set is taking people to court. They'll
sell to the vulture funds and other distressed specialists whose only mission
in life will be to force their claims for par payment through the legal
system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hurlock, who spent much of the last decade advising debtor governments who
got into trouble, is in little doubt why this situation has arisen. &quot;I
sat through countless negotiations,&quot; he says. &quot;Most were conducted
in a highly accusatory environment. The banks sent low-grade people who
were only interested in accusing my clients of profligacy. The instruments
that have emerged from this crisis - the so-called Brady bonds - are not
market instruments. They are crisis instruments.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, investors take great comfort from the tough and inflexible
covenants attached to Brady bonds. &quot;Why have these clauses been put
in place?&quot; asks Jerome Booth, head of emerging markets debt research
at ANZ Grindlays in London. &quot;Because it makes any future debt restructuring
extremely difficult. The chances of default are therefore slim.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The argument does bear some scrutiny. Sovereign analysts, for example, stress
that one of the principal differences between corporate and sovereign credits
is that countries almost always have the ability to repay their debts. Rarely
does a government find itself truly insolvent. A country's creditworthiness
can therefore be more accurately described in terms of its willingness to
pay. Make the pain greater should a government decide to default on its
bond obligations, and it will be less willing to do so. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The need for arbitration</B> <BR>
<BR>
But this is a perverse sort of comfort. Governments may never have to face
insolvency, but they do have to deal with liquidity problems that, in the
most extreme cases, make the servicing of foreign currency debts impossible
in the short term. And because bond financing has become such an important
component of the capital accounts of so many developing countries, they
are unlikely to be able to pick and choose which debt they default on. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't buy the argument that, because nobody defaulted on their bond
debt in the 1980s, it is therefore safer,&quot; says Chris Huhne, a sovereign
analyst with the European credit rating agency IBCA. &quot;Bond debt was
then insignificant compared to bank debt. These days this is no longer true.
It is hard to see any country getting into problems servicing its debts
without its bond obligations being affected.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, argues Huhne, the inflexibility of bond contracts is not necessarily
something to be welcomed. &quot;Bond debt is like a girder bridge built
out of cast iron,&quot; he says. &quot;It doesn't move in the wind. But
if something really heavy comes along, it shatters.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This begs the question of who will be there to reassemble the pieces. Without
the official arm-twisting provided by the US treasury department and the
Federal Reserve Bank, the creditor banks of the 1980s would probably still
be at the negotiating table. &quot;One of my tutors in crisis management
was Paul Volcker [the former chairman of the Federal Reserve],&quot; says
Rhodes. &quot;He taught me a couple of things. The first was that, in a
crisis, you need leadership.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The institutions we do have to negotiate on behalf of creditors - the Paris
Club of official creditors and its commercial banking counterpart, the London
Club - increasingly belong to another era of international capital flows.
Even the IMF, which has played a crucial role behind-the-scenes during many
debt negotiations, looks outdated and out-of-touch, at least according to
its critics. &quot;The IMF suffers from a certain intellectual superiority,&quot;
says Charles Dallara, head of the Institute of International Finance (IIF)
and a former IMF executive director. &quot;There's an institutional arrogance
there that prohibits them from seeing that their position in the world has
changed. They have a superficial understanding of the forces at work in
the markets today.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But even if there were an obvious candidate to lead creditors through future
debt negotiations, it is unclear whether they will submit to such leadership.
&quot;Until recently,&quot; argues David Levey, managing director of the
sovereign risk group at Moody's, &quot;cross-border capital flows were dominated
by either official creditors, or by highly-regulated financial institutions
subject to a lot of official influence. Regulatory forbearance simply does
not apply to mutual funds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What's to be done? The first step is to recognize the nature of the problem.
Part of the reason why creditor banks didn't get a better deal out of the
Latin American debt negotiations can be explained by what economists label
a collective action market failure. <BR>
<BR>
The principle is simple enough. Imagine a group of spectators at a football
match. After a dull first half, the game hots up. Collectively, it is in
the interests of all to remain seated. Individually, spectators get a better
view standing up. Everyone therefore stands, and ends up worse off. <BR>
<BR>
When the debt crisis struck in 1982, for example, it was in the collective
interest to broker a quick solution. Existing debt could have been rescheduled
or partly written off, fresh working capital provided, and each country's
ongoing capacity to service its outstanding debts preserved to the fullest
extent possible. <BR>
<BR>
In the event, each creditor bank held out for full repayment. Debtor governments
endured years of crisis management and restricted access to international
capital. Creditors wasted valuable resources untangling the mess. Ultimately,
they were also forced to swallow substantial losses. In theory, both sides
could have done better. <BR>
<BR>
As the Mexican debt crisis in January demonstrated, collective action problems
involving securities traded in an environment of highly-deregulated capital
flows can be much more severe. &quot;Both economic theory and practice tells
us that the first thing any creditor wants in the event of a debt crisis
is to get hold of the assets,&quot; says IBCA's Huhne. &quot;Because it
is always in the interests of the individual to get his money out first,
a creditor grab race develops. In terms of sovereign debt crises, essentially
creditors are looking to claim official foreign exchange reserves from the
central bank.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The main lesson that fund managers learned from Mexico,&quot; agrees
Valerie Chang, an emerging markets research analyst with Salomon Brothers,
&quot;is that you should take the bid and ask questions later.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In mature market economies, institutions have evolved to deal with this
collective action problem. Financial systems have lenders of last resort.
Bank creditors are less likely to make panic withdrawals on bad news, hence
fuelling a self-fulfilling run on deposits, when banks are backed by the
explicit or covert support of a central bank or a deposit insurance scheme.
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, companies enjoy the protection of bankruptcy codes when they run
into difficulties servicing their debts. Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy
code, for example, provides three key provisions for companies undergoing
a restructuring. To prevent the creditor grab race for corporate assets,
the code provides for an automatic stay on creditor claims against the debtor.
This applies until a restructuring plan has been drawn up. <BR>
<BR>
Second, short-term liquidity financing is provided to keep the concern running.
The court grants the company the ability to attract this debtor-in-possession
financing by assigning seniority to any fresh debt raised. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, unanimity is not needed to agree to the terms of a restructuring.
If a minority of creditors reject the package, the court has the power to
force the plan on rogue creditors through a cramdown. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code has led some academics
to suggest that an equivalent system be established for sovereign debtors.
Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard University and a well-known adviser
to countries in trouble, is one notable champion of this idea. <BR>
<BR>
A sovereign bankruptcy code is an appealing suggestion. By providing an
automatic stay in the event of default, it would defuse attempts to seize
sovereign assets through the courts. Enforced cramdowns of restructuring
plans on a minority of dissenting creditors would short-circuit another
potential source of obstructive litigation. <BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, the procedural framework of a bankruptcy code might give
debtor governments a little breathing space and a little more time to get
the domestic policy mix right. This would work to the benefit of both creditors
and debtors. &quot;If there had been an automatic stay in place during the
Mexican crisis,&quot; says Huhne, &quot;the Mexican economy would not have
taken such a hammering. It is an incredible macroeconomic adjustment to
go from an 8% current account deficit into surplus in the space of a few
months. There is now recession on a scale no industrial country has experienced
since the war. This inevitably damages the productive apparatus of the economy,
and Mexico's ability to service its debt payments.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sachs' ideas have won a handful of converts, notably at the IMF and within
the US administration. But they are fraught with difficulties. Sachs envisages
that the private sector will provide short-term liquidity financing in the
event of a crisis. This seems unlikely, at least on a voluntary basis. <BR>
<BR>
Corporate bankruptcy codes work because they are legally enforceable. There
is no equivalent body of international financial law. And national governments,
wary of infringements to their sovereignty, are unlikely to agree to one
in a hurry. <BR>
<BR>
Even if there were an international bankruptcy code or treaty, it is not
clear whether governments would adhere to it. China, for example, is a signatory
to the United Nations' International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes, which provides for arbitration proceedings when foreign direct
investment contracts break down. &quot;China has violated the terms of this
legally-binding treaty several times,&quot; says one sovereign analyst.
&quot;What do you do? Take them to the world court?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sachs believes that a revamped IMF could mimic the role of administrator
in corporate bankruptcy cases. Again, the obstacles are severe. &quot;Part
of the problem a bankruptcy court has to rule on is how to regulate burden-sharing
between creditor and debtor to provide an equitable solution,&quot; says
the analyst. &quot;This is a moral problem which the IMF is ill-equipped
to judge on. It would be difficult, for example, to rule on what sort of
cut in calories the population of Mexico must take to repay a certain proportion
of its foreign creditors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>The hazards of reform</B> <BR>
<BR>
In addition, many are hostile to any sort of reform because of the perceived
threat of moral hazard. Make it easier for a country to default, so the
argument goes, and it will be more likely to do so. Bank of England governor
Eddie George for one believes that any official assistance or guidance should
of necessity be conducted in an <I>ad hoc</I>, extemporaneous fashion after
the crisis has struck. &quot;What might happen in the event of default?&quot;
asks Booth of ANZ Grindlays. &quot;We don't know. And it's right not to
know.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Huhne says this argument is a weak one. &quot;Moral hazard applied to
policy makers is nonsense,&quot; he says. &quot;They do not willingly engineer
the sort of crisis that Mexico has gone through.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, if correctly designed, sovereign bankruptcy procedures could provide
a solution to the moral hazard problem. Economists first identified the
dilemma in the insurance industry. By taking out fire insurance, for example,
a policyholder might be less likely to protect his property from the risk
of fire. The solution was coinsurance. Policy holders are not fully indemnified.
<BR>
<BR>
Bankruptcy procedures also provide an element of coinsurance. &quot;Is it
possible that a country can emerge from any sort of bankruptcy proceedings
unscathed?&quot; says Portes. &quot;This is nonsense. A workout is a workout.&quot;
Of course, a bankruptcy judge's ultimate sanction - that of replacing a
company's management - is not available. <BR>
<BR>
Recognizing the problems of an international bankruptcy code, in October,
Portes and Barry Eichengreen of the University of California offered a series
of more modest proposals, designed to provide some of the benefits of corporate
bankruptcy proceedings without resorting to a full legal code. <BR>
<BR>
Forcing a restructuring plan on a minority of dissenting creditors would
not be necessary, they argue, if the unanimity covenants in sovereign debt
contracts did not exist. Existing sovereign debt contracts should therefore
be amended to permit a majority of creditors to alter the terms of payment.
Dissident creditors would subsequently be referred to an arbitration tribunal.
In turn, this might be run under a broader mediation and conciliation service,
linking together the interests of the Paris Club, the London Club and a
proposed permanent international bondholders' council. Members of the council
might include representatives of emerging market mutual funds, pension funds,
banks, large individual investors and, perhaps, creditor country governments.
<BR>
<BR>
The strength of these suggestions is that they build both on existing institutions
and on the history of sovereign bond defaults. In 1868, the Corporation
of Foreign Bondholders was established in the UK. Although a private company,
it operated under a parliamentary charter. Ironically, the company was not
wound up until 1988 - about the time private holdings of developing country
sovereign bonds were once again becoming significant. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1930s, when the proliferation of bondholders' committees in the US
became a serious obstruction to debt negotiations, the Foreign Bondholders'
Protective Council was established with the explicit encouragement of the
state department. <BR>
<BR>
Opponents of a bondholders' committee argue that there is merit in flexibility.
Across the emerging markets spectrum, no two sets of investors are the same.
The foreign bond issues of some countries, for example, attract a strong
retail following. Other sovereign Eurobonds soak up the flight capital of
wealthy nationals, and so on. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Collective creditor action</B> <BR>
<BR>
But such a committee would at least provide bondholders with the opportunity
for constructive, collective action. Individually, their motives for such
behaviour are even weaker than bank creditors. Many emerging market investors
do not operate under the same set of economic imperatives as the banks did
in the early 1980s. Recovering at least part of the money they had lent
to Latin America was for some bank creditors a matter of financial survival.
<BR>
<BR>
Institutional investors operate in a fundamentally different way. &quot;Investment
funds adopt a balanced portfolio approach,&quot; says Tony Davies, a senior
general manager at Lloyds Bank. &quot;If they take a hit on one country,
they buy into the loss believing that the spread and diversity of their
investments will pull them through the problem. This is a very different
approach to that taken by bank lenders.&quot; In other words, it would be
a little like trying to rerun the debt negotiations of the 1980s with a
group of fully-provisioned banks. <BR>
<BR>
A mediation service between the Paris Club, the London Club and a bondholders'
committee would also build on the existing loose co-operation between official
and commercial creditors, with the IMF acting as an unofficial referee.
When they reschedule loans, for example, official creditors indicate that
they expect &quot;comparable relief&quot; from London Club creditors when
the banks come to negotiate with debtor governments. Likewise, commercial
bank creditors only reschedule with an agreed IMF programme in place. <BR>
<BR>
Portes and Eichengreen also argue for an automatic stay on assets in the
event of default. Again, they believe the IMF is the key to the solution.
This envisages a reorganized IMF advising individual countries on the justification
(or lack of it) for a debt moratorium. The Fund would also supply the debtor-in-possession
liquidity financing that Sachs believes could come from private sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Again, the suggestion is not without its drawbacks. The IMF's major shareholders
are also likely to represent the interests of a debtor country's biggest
creditors. The Fund can hardly be expected to conduct proceedings with the
impartiality of a bankruptcy judge. &quot;The problem with most of these
proposals,&quot; argues Davies of Lloyds Bank, &quot;is that it is hard
to find an honest broker that will be acceptable to all parties.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There are further problems. If investors have unfettered access to local
capital and foreign exchange markets, an automatic stay on a country's external
liabilities alone may not be enough. There are many ways to appropriate
central bank foreign exchange reserves<B>. </B>Ultimately, this may argue
for an IMF-sanctioned introduction of exchange controls. While there is
some internal debate at the<B> </B>Fund about the merits of limited exchange
controls, particularly with regard to the Chilean macroeconomic model, the
broad church is fairly hostile to the idea. Likewise, unless the IMF's deliberations
are legally binding, there will still be nothing to stop individual creditors
pursuing claims for seizure of sovereign assets in the courts. <BR>
<BR>
Does such talk merely amount to a lot of anguished hand-wringing from academics,
unable to see beyond their ivory towers, and public sector officials who
have lost their way in a hostile world dominated by private capital? Yes,
argue Dallara of the IIF and Citibank's Rhodes. &quot;I don't find many
of these proposals either attractive or meaningful,&quot; says Dallara.
&quot;Charles and I both agree that this change [to private finance] requires
a market-based solution to the problems,&quot; says Rhodes. <BR>
<BR>
This is a little rich. For a start, although their importance has grown,
it is not just private creditors who fund developing countries. Official
government creditors and multilateral development banks still have a significant
role to play. It is also worth remembering that the public sector did play
a major role in resolving the Latin American debt negotiations, which, after
all, were largely conducted between debtor governments and private sector
creditors. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, when asked who is likely to provide leadership in the next debt
crisis, Rhodes' likely candidates - the Bank for International Settlements,
the IMF and the group of seven leading industrial countries - hardly reads
like a list of the great and the good from the private sector. <BR>
<BR>
They are right in one sense: unless there is a revolution in attitudes,
all these proposals will founder on intense private sector hostility. At
a seminar held by the Bank of England in September, the Bank's chief economist
Mervyn King stood up and asked investors whether they would be willing to
join a bondholders' committee. The idea was greeted with a frosty silence.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>No clear way forward</B> <BR>
<BR>
Even though the advocates of bankruptcy codes are hard-nosed economists,
their ideas are often dismissed as forgiving, liberal nonsense. &quot;People
lend money because they want it back,&quot; says Palermo of Salomon Brothers.
&quot;These covenants are meant to be harsh.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some are affronted by the threat to their right to trade and profit. &quot;The
concept of a stay on sovereign assets is utterly abhorrent,&quot; says one
sovereign debt trader. Others don't care either way. &quot;I couldn't give
a damn if every emerging market in the world defaulted on its bonds,&quot;
says another trader. &quot;Even if they did, I'd still retire a wealthy
man.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Exhausted by the negotiations of the 1980s, commercial bankers have little
appetite for the subject. Those banks still running large emerging market
debt portfolios have also lost any economic incentive to act. Many have
now over-provisioned for their Latin American exposures. Some of those that
lent to Peru, for example, will be making a paper profit on the terms of
the Brady deal, despite the writedowns. <BR>
<BR>
Those that do make an effort to articulate their positions miss the fundamental
economics of debt crises. Dallara and Rhodes, for example, both believe
that the solution is for the IMF to forge closer contacts with private sector
traders and investors. &quot;The IMF knew for years that Turkey was running
serious structural imbalances,&quot; says Dallara. &quot;Yet they said nothing.
And because of the market's immaturity, it continued to fund the country.
When the IMF is quiescent, imbalances grow and grow, and we do end up with
a crisis.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want the IMF to engage in open, if somewhat discreet, dialogue
with the market,&quot; he argues. &quot;Even underplaying your hand is better
than not playing it at all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This might be a useful function for the IMF but it does nothing to resolve
the central problem of market failure that works against the interests of
both creditors and debtors. &quot;You must ask yourself the following question,&quot;
says Huhne. &quot;Would the bank and bondholder creditors of a company be
better or worse off if we had no bankruptcy procedures?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, this is the irony of the collective action dilemma. When
they scramble to their feet, football supporters believe they are behaving
rationally. Only after the event do they think again. &quot;The first and
most important thing to do is to fight the battle of ideas,&quot; says Huhne.
But he adds: &quot;Whether anything happens before another crisis hits I
doubt. It may even take two.&quot; <p>

<H2>What could kill the US bull? </H2>
<H4>Global market watchers like to keep the closest tabs on central banks,
Japanese institutional investors and wily hedge fund managers. But it is
the $3 trillion in US mutual funds that this year have kept the bond market
depressed, sent US stocks to new highs and helped prop up emerging markets.
When - and how - will the mutual fund frenzy end? <BR>
Michelle Celarier reports </H4>
The havoc created earlier this year in the us treasury market, which had
its biggest single-day tumble in history, had little to do with the much-feared
return of inflation. After all, notes James Bianco, research director at
the institutional bond brokerage house Arbor Trading Group of Barrington,
Illinois, there's little economic logic in a market that dips by almost
the same amount when the department of labor's monthly employment number
is 705,000 new jobs per month as when it is 150,000. That is precisely what
happened in March, when t-bonds fell by a record-breaking three points,
and again in April, when they dropped by a similar 2.25 points. <BR>
<BR>
More important than economic data, it seems, are the dominant movers and
shakers in the market. Japanese investors bowing to government pressure,
high-rolling hedge funds locking in arbitrage spreads and powerful central
banks cementing international diplomacy, all have had a hand in the recent
market turmoil. But another big player - largely ignored by professionals
till now - is the one to watch going forward: the $3 trillion of us
mutual funds investment. <BR>
<BR>
For decades these small-time individual investors played it safe in bank
certificates of deposit or the fixed income markets, fearful of the risks
in the stock market. Now, convinced of the superior returns of equities,
they have been deserting the bond markets in record numbers ever since the
1994 rout. Last year they sold $42 billion worth. For the six months ended
March 31 1996, only 9% of us mutual fund investment went into bonds and
the rest went to the us stock market at the rate of about $20 billion a
month, calculates Bianco. It is a sharp change from past peaks of mutual
fund investment, when between a half and two-thirds of the total went into
bonds. <BR>
<BR>
us stock market bulls have argued that a demographic shift caused by baby-boomers'
increased savings offers little cause for concern. But even though mutual
fund assets will soon exceed the nation's basic money supply and top the
assets of commercial banks, Bianco argues that it isn't new money. When
the rise in market capitalization is factored in, the total savings haven't
grown that much, if at all. There is merely a shift among asset classes.
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Bianco says, &quot;is going into anything but stocks.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ominous trend</B> <BR>
<BR>
Bianco credits Jeremy Siegel, whose book <I>Stocks for the Long Run</I>
made the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller list for months on end last year,
for drumming into the public the truth that over time, stocks outperform
bonds: &quot;It's starting to get into people's heads that this thing is
invincible, that it doesn't ever go down.&quot; He believes this is an ominous
trend. Mutual funds now own 20% of the us stock market, up from 2% in 1982,
and have sent it into a frothy mania seemingly impervious to reality. Even
the mighty hedge funds dare not bet against them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a money-flow argument that is driving the market right now,&quot;
says Bianco. Indeed, the psychology at work is so powerful that it seems
to have overwhelmed another driving market force: the us Federal Reserve.
While equities climbed steadily over the past two years, fixed income markets
have become even more volatile, almost totally at the whim of such speculative
forces as hedge funds and investment banks' trading floors. Even the Fed's
recent announcement that it was not likely to raise interest rates at its
May meeting could not give the bond market much of a boost. At the same
time, the stock market defied predictions by such renowned strategists as
Morgan Stanley's Byron Wien, who forecast that long bond yields above 7%
would cause a major decline in the stock market averages. Declining by about
10% this year, the long bond has topped 7%, whereas only a momentary downturn
in stocks has since been recouped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was
up 13% for the year towards the end of May. (Wien has revised his positon,
saying he is bullish on the stock market, medium-term.) <BR>
<BR>
The mutual funds' love-affair with us stocks has had far-reaching effects,
even helping to reflate emerging markets euphoria. Coupled with low interest
rates worldwide, &quot;the tremendous boom on Wall Street has made people
begin to worry whether it's sustainable, and they're starting to put their
money elsewhere,&quot; says John Armstrong, a partner at Independent Strategy
in London. After last year's Mexican crisis, investors became more discerning
about individual emerging markets, but in recent months, Armstrong says,
&quot;there's been a kind of indiscriminate rush&quot;. After all, it's
hard to find a market that could beat the main us stock market average returns
of 35% last year. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's Grant Kvaldheim in New York
adds, &quot;there's a demand for yield&quot;, and cites the strong interest
in dm-denominated Latin American debt this year. <BR>
<BR>
According to the Washington-based International Institute of Finance (iif),
emerging markets attracted $200 billion in private investment last year
and are expected to attract a similar amount this year, with more coming
from bond and equity portfolio investments. &quot;Equity prices have rebounded,
bond issues rose in the first quarter and spreads have narrowed,&quot; says
William Cline, deputy managing director and chief economist at the iif.
Cline says the emerging markets would be receiving even more capital had
a number of countries, such as China, Chile and Brazil, not instituted policies
to limit foreign investment. Even in India, whose recent elections are viewed
as a vote against economic reform, international investment had helped push
the stock market up 20% by mid-May. <BR>
<BR>
A sure sign of changing sentiment is renewed hedge fund activity. Some of
the bigger macro players have already left the emerging markets after a
punt last year, but smaller ones are picking up the slack. Hedge funds that
specialized in us equities sprouted up almost weekly last year, but since
the end of 1995 emerging markets have been the single most popular category
of hedge funds among investors, reports Tass Management, which tracks hedge
funds. &quot;We are seeing a lot of interest in emerging market funds and
a lot of emerging market funds being established,&quot; says Nicola Meadan,
chief executive of Tass. Tass is in the process of adding 23 new emerging
market hedge funds to its current database of 55 funds, which together have
$3 billion under management. Pension funds are following close behind in
the race to invest in emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
Until recently, capital flows at work in the international markets may have
obscured the mutual fund effect. Last year international fixed income markets
- from us treasuries to emerging market bond issues - were driven
primarily by the easy monetary policy of the Bank of Japan (boj) in conjunction
with its intervention in currency markets. The latter move, an attempt to
weaken the yen against the dollar, was part of an international accord hammered
out between Japan and the United States. The after-effects of this global
liquidity bubble are just starting to be felt. <BR>
<BR>
During 1995, notes Goldman Sachs partner and chief currency economist James
O'Neill, the boj spent $50 billion buying us treasuries in an attempt to
push the yen back above 100 to the dollar. That helped drive us bond yields
lower, which gave an additional boost to the us stock market. &quot;It's
the single biggest intervention by a central bank on a continuous basis
that's ever happened,&quot; says O'Neill. &quot;I am in the camp that believes
that central banks have enormous power in financial markets. When they decide
that trying to impact the value of their currency becomes their number one
priority, to ignore what they're trying to do is a bit crazy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The boj had some help. Big Japanese investors, such as its mammoth insurance
companies, were also pressured by the government to buy us treasuries. The
boj's monetary easing - an attempt to pull Japan out of a deflationary
slump it had been mired in for years, along with the its commitment to a
weak yen - was too much for hedge funds to resist. The combination
turned into a no-lose proposition for the big guys, who turned their flailing
fortunes around: shorting yen and investing the borrowed proceeds in us
treasuries. This is known as the &quot;yen carry trade&quot;. It helped
push the average returns for the macro hedge fund managers to over 30% last
year, with Soros' Quota fund up 160% after fees, according to Meadan. &quot;A
lot of it was driven by the yen/dollar trade,&quot; she says. <BR>
<BR>
Neither the Japanese investors nor the hedge fund operators are in for the
long haul, however. The chief investment officer of a big Japanese life
insurer says his company has grudgingly given in to the pressure -
but only for a short time. &quot;They're not here to stay,&quot; says a
source close to the insurance company. In fact, Japanese investors began
selling their us securities in the fourth quarter of last year, according
to chief economist Louis Crandall at rh Wrightson Associates, a bond market
research firm in New York. That was the same time hedge funds engaged in
massive buying. Their purchases kept the rally going until early 1996. According
to the us treasury, Japanese private investors sold $14.5 billion of treasury
notes and bonds during the fourth quarter of 1995, after buying $31.4 billion
earlier during the year. Purchases of treasury coupons by tax haven investors,
widely viewed as a proxy for hedge fund holdings, surged to $30 billion
during the fourth quarter. <BR>
<BR>
Global bond markets began to quiver in February, shortly after the Japanese
press quoted boj governor Yasuo Matsushita on the bank's likelihood of raising
rates in a recovery. Satisfied with the yen's depreciation against the dollar,
the boj had already stopped intervening in the currency markets. The central
bank was also believed to be concerned about the huge impact hedge funds
were having on their currency and interest rates, and wanted to get them
out. Then a much-watched survey of Japanese corporate expectations of the
economy was released, indicating a slight turnaround in the economy. &quot;All
of a sudden the markets became paranoid that the boj would raise rates,&quot;
says O'Neill. <BR>
<BR>
Fearful of a replay of the 1994 Fed interest rate hike that pummelled them,
some hedge funds began unwinding their positions. On the back of nervousness
about Japan came higher us employment figures than expected, and the bond
market tanked, making its single biggest dip since 1974, the beginning of
the long bear market in bonds during that inflation-wracked era. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Japanese portents</B> <BR>
<BR>
The debate over when Japan will raise interest rates has gripped the international
bond markets all year. Many have argued that the banking system is still
too frail for the boj to tighten, but some strategists and analysts are
beginning to change their views. &quot;I've spent a lot of time talking
to Japan experts and the boj, and you can tell they think the worst is over
and they want to move policy back to normal,&quot; says Bluford Putnam,
chief global strategist at Bankers Trust Investment Management Group. He
is predicting that the boj will raise rates in July. That's the judgment
of the futures markets too, where three-month yen deposit rates, now at
0.5%, are projected to be at 1.25% by the end of the year. Another portent
was last month's hike in the prime lending rate by the Industrial Bank of
Japan and other long-term credit banks. <BR>
<BR>
With rates in decline for most of a decade, most economists and market strategists
realize it's just a question of <I>when</I> Japanese rates will rise. Although
recent comments from the boj indicated no rate rise is imminent, another
corporate survey is due out in June, and if the boj were to decide after
that to raise the discount rate, now at 0.5%, by even 25bp, the effect could
be tremendous. &quot;If they raise the discount rate, the impact is big,&quot;
says Yuichi Matsushita, market strategist at the Nikko Research Centre in
Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
Higher Japanese rates would likely affect the boom in yen-denominated securities
in the international markets. For example, some 33% of all emerging market
bond market issues were denominated in yen last year, more than twice the
previous year's 16%. &quot;Many borrowers, including those in Latin America,
who had raised funds mostly in the us market in previous years, took advantage
of the low rates in the Euroyen and samurai markets in 1995, and the appetite
of Japanese investors for higher yielding paper,&quot; says the iif's Cline.
The trend has continued into 1996, but the hasty retreat from the us government
securities market by Japanese investors late last year is an indication
that other markets could also lose their appeal as Japanese investors find
that the costs of financing their positions are rising. Many have already
been raising cash. <BR>
<BR>
One immediate loser would probably be Japan's stock market: the Nikkei 225
stock index has risen about 50% since last summer. Certainly a 25bp rate
hike won't hurt corporate profits or even destroy the huge spread banks
need to rebuild their balance sheets. But it could undermine the stock market
nonetheless, since its rebound over the past year was largely driven by
foreign investors, including the big hedge funds that shifted out of emerging
markets into the Japanese stock market, sensing an economic recovery in
the making. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Even though the hedge funds are a tiny amount of the market, they
have an impact,&quot; says Eric Starr, a principal at Aventine Investment
Management, a small New York-based hedge fund whose arbitrage strategies
between Japanese warrants and the underlying securities earned it a 124%
return in 1995. &quot;They are the first ones to liquidate because of the
leverage of the strategy. A small increase in rates could have a big impact
on them.&quot; (His strategy would not be hurt, he says.) <BR>
<BR>
To avoid potential yen problems, some hedge funds have switched to funding
their us securities by shorting the Swiss franc, another overvalued currency,
and even the German mark, a favoured target for those worried about the
future of European monetary union. &quot;There's a strong sense that both
the mark and the Swiss franc have been pushed to such giddy heights that
it's starting to do a lot of damage,&quot; says Hunt Taylor, managing director
of Finex Europe in Dublin, the European trading operation of the New York-based
Cotton Exchange. <BR>
<BR>
In the same search for yield that has boosted emerging markets, investors
have been flocking to the high-yielding currencies of Europe. &quot;The
volumes and the averages in both the customer and interbank market are higher
this year than last,&quot; says Guy Whittaker, head of global foreign exchange
at Citibank in London. The winning currencies have been the Italian lira
and the Swedish krona, with the Swedish bond market last year's best performer.
This year hedge funds have even been playing the French franc against the
mark. <BR>
<BR>
While much of the action has shifted to Europe, not all hedge funds have
been able to unwind their yen/dollar positions. No-one knows how large the
business is, but traders estimate that as many as half of those positions
are still on the books. The continued slump in the us bond market has made
selling the us side of the trade a much less profitable position. And that's
because without the mutual funds in the game, there still aren't any buyers.
&quot;What we need is to see replacement buyers for us bonds,&quot; says
Goldman's O'Neill. <BR>
<BR>
But who will they be? &quot;The us bond market has big-time trouble,&quot;
warns Bianco. Even though 1995 was one of the best years ever in the bond
market, us stocks still performed two-and-a-half times better, which is
why Bianco thinks private domestic investors dumped bonds. &quot;Even the
government doesn't want to buy bonds, and pension funds are increasing their
investment in equities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Last year, foreigners bought $167 billion in treasuries, whereas the treasury
issued only $140 billion. More than half the buying was done by two groups:
central banks or tax haven countries. The third-biggest buyer was the trading
floors of investment banks, who purchased $58 billion. &quot;It was all
political and speculative money that bought it last year, and bought it
in records,&quot; Bianco says. &quot;The problem is that it's very fleet-footed
and strong-handed. It can be very fickle.&quot; That's why such widely-varying
employment numbers can cause similar effects. &quot;When there's so much
speculative money, if I'm a trader, it doesn't matter if the number is one
job or 100 above consensus, I sell and go short.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Because of its repo volume, the us treasury market is probably the most
highly-leveraged securities market in the world. The Fed knows how sensitive
it is, and that's why it has begun to warn the market what action it plans.
With both the Fed and the boj seeking to calm the markets with recent pronouncements
that rate hikes are not in the immediate offing, the concern seems obvious:
investors fear that a Japanese rate hike would be the signal that the global
economy is reflating and a us rate hike would follow. But would such actions
finally quash the us stock market ebullience and send mutual fund investors
back to bonds? <BR>
<BR>
<B>Gearing for a fall</B> <BR>
<BR>
By any yardstick, such as corporate earnings or short-selling ratios, the
us stock market is seriously overvalued, which makes the prognosticators
anxious. The initial public offering boom, where companies without any earnings
at all trade at incalculable price/earnings ratios, adds to the unease.
&quot;The further it goes, the more brutal it will be,&quot; says Bianco.
&quot;It will be a killer on the other side.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The viciousness of any downturn usually depends on the amount of leverage
being employed. Professionals say leverage has begun to return to the global
markets, but because there are no precise data on the debt that is financing
mutual fund investments, no- one knows how far leverage exists in the us
stock market. The outlook isn't too promising. &quot;In the aggregate there
is probably more leverage in the system than in 1994 [the last time markets
collapsed because of a rate hike],&quot; says Henry Kaufman, the former
Salomon Brothers economist turned money manager. He points to two indicators
- a higher volume of outstanding interest rate swaps and higher corporate
borrowing over the past two years. According to statistics from the Fed,
net liabilities of non-financial us corporations increased by $735 billion
between 1994 and 1995, compared with a total increase of just $133 billion
in equity. Investment banks have also been gearing up. Net borrowings against
us treasuries by us primary dealers are also at a record high: more than
$250 billion, compared to just under $200 billion at the end of 1993. <BR>
<BR>
As for mutual funds, Kaufman has long warned of the dangers they represent
to the financial system. &quot;The only thing you know is that households
have become greater financial risk-takers and that household debt has increased,
and that this is the group that invests in mutual funds,&quot; he says.
Between 1991 and 1995, such &quot;household&quot; debt (including mortgages)
increased by $1.2 trillion, while this group's investments in mutual funds
increased by $656.5 billion. What's significant is that the debt ballooned
during a period of low interest rates, while much of the mutual fund increase
is driven by the rising value of equities they already own. It doesn't take
a rocket scientist to see that higher interest rates could easily jack up
the debt and deflate the mutual fund numbers. <BR>
<BR>
Until now, mutual fund investors' perseverence has kept volatility in the
stock market to a mininum. But Kaufman argues it won't go on for ever. Structurally,
mutual funds consist of short-term liquid assets. &quot;When investors want
their money, fund managers must sell some portion of their portfolios.&quot;
Unlike traditional financial institutions, he notes, they have neither long-dated
financial obligations nor are they able to borrow from the central bank
in a crisis. <BR>
<BR>
And even though the mutual fund investors are viewed as long-term players,
Kaufman says that doesn't mean their holdings will always be stable. Since
most mutual fund investors are middle-aged or older, Kaufman says they are
unlikely to resist selling &quot;if their financial nest egg is being threatened
by a potential market slide&quot;. Then there are those newcomers to mutual
fund investing, who bought into the stock market at high levels. &quot;They
are often people who have a relatively high level of debt and therefore
modest financial net worth,&quot; Kaufman says. <BR>
<BR>
Traditional margin loans on stock purchases have minimal leverage, of two
to one. But there are other ways to leverage the market. The extent to which
mutual fund investors are financing their purchases with tax-deductible
home equity loans, which have been under 8% over the last year, or even
through the 5.9% credit card rates being offered, is unknown. But few will
deny such financing exists. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In terms of leveraging for investment, when interest rates are at
an all-time low, well, if I can borrow at 6% or 7%, and invest and hope
to make 10%, I'm still making a spread. I'm sure people are employing that
strategy,&quot; says Win Paul, a spokesman at Invesco, a us mutual fund
company that manages $14 billion in assets. At the same time, Paul says,
&quot;this whole consumer debt picture is blown out of proportion&quot;.
It's just such a sanguine attitude that could be the market's undoing. <BR>
<BR>
Kaufman argues that nightmare of a global market collapse could even occur
in an environment not unlike that beginning to be experienced today: moderate
global economic growth and steady, or even slowly receding, rates of inflation.
Such a benign atmosphere will lull more investors into ever more speculation.
&quot;But at some point households will begin to over-extend themselves.
Debt to income ratios will reach unsustainable levels, and liquidity will
begin to dry up,&quot; Kaufman told a group of European investment managers
and corporate finance executives in Milan earlier this year. &quot;When
prices do begin to slip from heady levels, the adverse effect on confidence
will be sudden and powerful.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Since 1994 there has been much talk of correlation of markets globally.
The mutual fund-led us stock market is the only one that has kept its independence,
hurtling to new high after high. Mutual funds' absence from the bond market
is already adding to the damage there. But what can happen when those investors
lead the next global stock market move is anyone's guess. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It will be the market equivalent of Britain's mad cow disease,&quot;
quips Bianco. &quot;One day everyone is eating beef, and the next day they
want to shoot all the cows.&quot;<p>

<H2>Did Merrill bid too low? </H2>
<H4>A bid so finely priced as to put profits in doubt, a smouldering argument
over 500 years of iron ore reserves, the lack of a new story to tell investors
- these are the problems Merrill Lynch faces after winning the mandate to
privatize Companhia Vale de Rio Doce. Competitors that failed to secure
the contract say they are sleeping better now it has gone to someone else.
Brian Caplen reports </H4>
Over the next nine months Merrill Lynch faces one of the toughest challenges
of its international equities career. The bank heads the consortium which
won the mandate to privatize Brazilian mining giant Companhia Vale de Rio
Doce (CVRD) for a wafer-thin 1.91% success fee. <BR>
<BR>
Emerging victorious from a highly competitive bid that attracted the cream
of Wall Street's finance houses, Merrill executives were naturally elated
when the result was announced in December. Together with colleagues from
consortium partners NM Rothschild, KPMG and Brazilian bank Bradesco, they
had worked day and night in shifts in the run-up to the deadline, determined
their 500-plus page proposal would be the best. To obtain top quality at
high speed, the final draft was put together in New York with 10 Brazil-based
staff including three secretaries flown in to ensure the presentation was
in faultless Portuguese. <BR>
<BR>
On the face of it, all the effort has proved worthwhile. Unlike the other
eight consortia, all of which worked as hard, the Merrill team could feel
satisfied that three months' preoccupation with the CVRD bid had delivered
a return. Rival groups can only consign their proposals to the dustbin and
put it all down to experience. <BR>
<BR>
But now the celebrations are over and the real work on evaluating CVRD and
recommending a sale model is in progress, those same executives may be wondering
what they have got themselves into. A fee of 1.91% sets a new precedent
in emerging-market privatizations, with comparable deals such as Argentine
oil company Yacimientos Petrol&iacute;feros Fiscales (YPF) - in which Merrill
joined CS First Boston as global coordinators - being cranked out at nearer
4% in June 1993. The first and second sales of Mexico's Telmex earned 4.5%
and 3% respectively. <BR>
<BR>
With the Brazilian government itself expecting CVRD bids in the range of
2.5% to 3.0%, the question being asked in S&atilde;o Paulo financial circles
is: &quot;Did Merrill bid too low?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Market observers, many of them admittedly from banks which failed to win
the mandate, estimate that a couple of million dollars is the maximum Merrill
could make on a deal requiring valuation from scratch of vast mineral resources,
and the distribution of some $3 billion of stock throughout the world. <BR>
<BR>
They question whether Merrill, in making such finely tuned calculations,
has allowed enough margin for error. As well as the usual expenses, the
CVRD mandate requires the winning consortium to pay for the roadshow and
the preparation of the prospectus - costs normally borne by the client.
Any unforeseen outlay and Merrill could find itself losing on the deal.
(Merrill officials decined to speak on the record about the deal.) <BR>
<BR>
Other critics go further. They wonder if the deal can actually get done
at this price. They suggest it makes sense only if large blocks of stock
are placed with strategic investors - a cheaper sale method than a mass
flotation and viable at a fee of between 0.6% and 1%. But because of political
sensitivities about Brazil's resource wealth falling under foreign control
(especially about its going to CVRD's competitors such as Australian mining
companies or customers such as Japanese steelmakers, both natural investors
in the company), Merrill may find this approach opposed by the government.
The vogue in Brazil is for &quot;pulverization&quot; of the company (adapted
from the Portuguese word <I>pulverizar</I>, meaning to spread) and implying
a wide distribution of stock among domestic retail investors. An expensive
pulverization is high on the government's agenda for CVRD. <BR>
<BR>
In which case, ask the sceptics, did Merrill and partners want the CVRD
deal for prestige rather than profits? Set to be a landmark issue for Brazil,
Latin America, emerging markets and the mining sector, a successful offering
would raise the Merrill flag higher in future privatization bids. <BR>
<BR>
But there are risks. The CVRD deal is in many ways more difficult to do
than, say, YPF's. Unlike YPF at the time of its offer, CVRD already has
a listing and the pricing of the new tranche of stock will be constrained
by the existing share price. Also CVRD, unlike pre-sale YPF, is a well-managed
company and the potential for adding value to the shares by turning it around
- an attraction for privatization investors - is more limited. Finally,
when YPF was brought to market, investor sentiment on Latin America was
notably more bullish than now. Argentina's economy minister, Domingo Cavallo,
personally involved himself in the sale. No equivalent high-level figure
has emerged to push CVRD stock. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The perils of winning</B> <BR>
<BR>
To succeed with CVRD would certainly bring spin-off rewards for Merrill
Lynch, but failure could set the firm back immensely in emerging markets.
Merrill will have to summon up all its resources to ensure the deal doesn't
flop, and could end up losing money. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Clearly, the winner of the bid was BNDES [Brazil's National Bank for
Economic and Social Development which is handling the country's privatization
programme]. The bank had nine of the best Wall Street houses struggling
to get the deal,&quot; comments Ruy Souza e Silva, executive director with
Citibank in Brazil. Citibank was part of a rival consortium. <BR>
<BR>
Alfredo Gutierrez, managing director of the Brazilian arm of JP Morgan,
also a contender for the CVRD mandate, says that in the run-up to the award,
when the fierceness of the competition and the tightness of the pricing
was becoming evident, &quot;there were times when all of us awoke in the
night thinking: 'What if we win?'&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Disillusioned by the toughness of the bid, many bankers appear to have forgotten
the reasons why they were first attracted to CVRD. As well as the iron-ore,
gold and other resources held by CVRD, which make it a direct investment
in Brazil's economic backbone, there was the prospect of using the deal
as a lead-in to work on the rest of the country's privatization programme,
involving some $40 billion-worth of assets. In the early stages, CVRD had
the look of being both a landmark and a lucrative mandate that all leading
investment banks should be competing for. <BR>
<BR>
Faced with such an onslaught, the Brazilian government realized it must
draw up strict rules for the CVRD mandate contest or risk high-profile accusations
of foul play. This it succeeded in doing and, with connections counting
for nothing, the result was a tough battle fought on technical qualifications
and pricing, which threw up more than the average amount of bid drama. <BR>
<BR>
Most spectacularly, the Morgan Stanley-led consortium, which had made plain
its intentions to win at almost any cost, was disqualified for bidding too
low on the fixed-fee part of the mandate. Since Morgan Stanley's Latin American
chief is Francisco Gros, a former president of the Brazilian central bank,
the government can feel satisfied that its bid rules were applied firmly
and fairly to all. And the bankers have no major grounds for complaint since
they were strongly vocal in favour of the chosen bidding procedures. In
fact Gros, who did not return telephone calls for this article, was said
to be among the most vociferous advocates of the CVRD <I>edital</I>, as
the bidding terms and conditions are known. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Every one [of the bankers involved] called me to say these are beautiful
bid documents,&quot; recalls Elena Landau, privatization director at BNDES.
&quot;Finally you have something that is worth working with, they said,
and worth spending the money needed to put together the proposal.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
On the issue of Merrill Lynch's slim fees, Landau says: &quot;It's a tough
challenge and they know that. They are not kids, they are doing these things
all over the world.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All the same, as Merrill executives wrestle with the realities of completing
the CVRD privatization at 1.91%, they may find themselves doing some fairly
rapid growing up. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, of the
total fee, 1.5% will be needed to motivate the selling syndicate, leaving
only 0.41% for the lead manager. With $3 billion put as the maximum size
of a first tranche of CVRD stock, Merrill's commission would be $12.3 million.
The firm estimates its costs at $10 million, which leaves only a $2.3 million
reward for a year's work. While returns should be better from any second
or third tranches (the total sell-off is put in the region of between $5
billion and $6 billion), these may not come to fruition before 1997 or even
later. <BR>
<BR>
Still, it's easy to see how Merrill and the other banks were filled with
awe on seeing CVRD's asset book. Described by a SBC Warburg report as a
&quot;tier one natural resources and transportation company&quot;, CVRD
is the fourth-largest conglomerate of its kind in the world. It is the world's
largest producer and exporter of iron ore and, with reserves sufficient
for 500 years, is likely to retain this position. High-quality ores make
production costs among the lowest anywhere, and included in the assets is
Caraj&aacute;s, the world's largest iron-ore mine. <BR>
<BR>
But iron ore is only one of the positive features of CVRD. The company is
also Latin America's biggest gold producer and the eleventh-largest gold
mining company outside of South Africa, with great potential for improvement.
CVRD's target is to double output to a million ounces a year by 2000, a
feasible aim given the vast exploration areas under its control and its
low production costs of only $170 per ounce (South Africa's are typically
$280 an ounce). <BR>
<BR>
Then, there are pulp and paper, fed from the 560,000 ha (1.38 million acres)
of forests CVRD owns; aluminium with the group's major producer Albr&aacute;s
once again at the low end of the industry cost curve; stakes in Brazil's
largest steel companies; 1,800 km (1,100 miles) of railways accounting for
64% of Brazilian freight transport; ports; shipping, including 20 or so
company-owned vessels; manganese and potash mining; and mining rights on
2 million ha of the world's best undeveloped mineral districts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Essentially all of Brazil's mining resources have gone into CVRD,&quot;
says Anthony Daniell, executive director of SBC Warburg, a partner in the
ill-fated Morgan Stanley-led consortium. &quot;It has been the national
company to manage the country's resources. Over the years, there has been
a massive amount of development work that has never been exploited, such
as in gold where CVRD could raise its production rapidly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Private sweeteners</B> <BR>
<BR>
Founded in 1942 to operate iron ore mines in Itabira, in Minas Gerais state,
CVRD was aptly named given the positive outcomes it has delivered for its
owners - Vale do Rio Doce means sweet river valley in Portuguese. Once a
government preserve, in recent years the sweet river has begun to flow more
in the direction of private investors. The company was partially privatized
on the S&atilde;o Paulo stock market with the government retaining 51% of
the total shares and 76% of the ordinary shares which have exclusive rights
to elect board members. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign investors were welcomed in with a level-one American depositary
receipts (ADR) programme begun early in 1994. Permission has since been
granted for level-two and level-three issues and a New York listing. ADRs,
each of which represents 250 CVRD preferred shares, now account for 2% of
total stock with foreign funds holding a further 10%. Brazilian private
pension funds, which control some $60 billion worth of assets, hold 20%
of CVRD and are expected to be highly active in the upcoming second privatization
stage. <BR>
<BR>
To retain credibility, this second stage must involve the government selling
down its control which means reducing its holding of ordinary shares below
50%. With a market capitalization of between $10 billion and $11 billion,
this involves selling between $2 billion and $3 billion worth of stock.
Merrill Lynch is noted for its strong distribution capabilities, but there
remains doubts as to whether it can motivate a selling syndicate on such
narrow margins. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Source of confusion</B> <BR>
<BR>
Kleinwort Benson was in the JP Morgan-led consortium which bid 2.495% for
the mandate. &quot;Even at that price the syndicate desk had fears that
you could not motivate the lower levels of the sales force,&quot; says the
president of Kleinwort Benson Brazil, Winston Fritsch. &quot;Everyone thought
going below 2% was suicidal unless you could do a trade sale as part of
the deal.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This issue of the sale model seems to have been a source of confusion among
the banks and may account for bid prices ranging from Morgan Stanley's undisclosed
but widely accepted figure of 1.5% to the 3.125% offered by the Goldman
Sachs consortium. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Francisco Gros had a view that it was going to be a block sale,&quot;
says Jos&eacute; Monforte, a vice-president of Citibank, part of the Bear
Stearns consortium which delivered the second-highest bid of 2.79%. &quot;Ourselves,
Bear Stearns and Goldman had a view that it was a public offering.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Goldman Sachs was also motivated to pitch high because of its top rating
in the technical section of the bid, which it believed would carry it through
even at the high end of the price range and, more important, the fact that
it is believed to have secured the mandate to privatize Deutsche Telekom
at slightly less than 3%. A low bid on CVRD could have upset relationships
in the much bigger German deal. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The bid documents were not very specific on what the adviser was supposed
to do, so different consortia bid for different processes,&quot; says Eduardo
Henrique de Souza Rangel, in charge of capital markets for Banco Pactual,
part of the Morgan Stanley group. &quot;The way we bid for the deal was
because our idea of selling the company involved a mix of trade sale and
flotation in two steps. So we were aggressive on pricing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But it is unclear why the Morgan Stanley group was so certain that CVRD
would be part trade sale. While government officers stress that all options
remain open, Kleinwort's Fritsch, himself a former secretary of economic
policy with the finance ministry, says: &quot;The government wants this
to be the first example of the British mass-privatization concept applied
to Brazil.&quot; Says a S&atilde;o Paulo-based banker close to the deal:
&quot;The message was that the Brazilian government wanted to do something
similar to YPF.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This suggests the CVRD sell-off will be a flotation. In fact, the government
may have little choice because selling control of CVRD is too politically
controversial to attempt and placing smaller stakes of around 5% to 10%
will be unattractive to strategic investors. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Instinctive opposition</B> <BR>
<BR>
The privatization of CVRD arouses great emotions in Brazil. The company
is active in nine Brazilian states and numerous municipalities. Congress
members from these areas are instinctively opposed to a sell-off which they
regard as giving away Brazil's mineral wealth. Under the discounted cashflow
method of valuing companies, only 30 years worth of iron ore reserves can
be accounted for in the sale price. Congress members complain that this
amounts to making a free gift of the remaining 470 years. They have come
up with estimates of several times Brazil's GNP for what they think the
company is worth. <BR>
<BR>
Regional politicians are also concerned that the social development role
of CVRD will be lost through privatization. Currently, the company channels
up to 8% of net income, limited to 5% of capital, in the form of loans,
grants and donations for projects such as rural electric power and highways.
While a senior officer in the finance ministry says it is likely some part
of privatization proceeds will go to a social fund to remove this obligation,
CVRD investor relations manager Marcos Antonio Pinto warns: &quot;We know
that if we don't give money to the Indians, they will sit on the railroad
and we can't move our iron ore.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Pinto says that CVRD's developmental role should continue after privatization.
&quot;Private companies also do socially responsible things ... CVRD will
continue to help people.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In this political climate, the government will have to tread carefully to
get CVRD sold off at all. Even though the concept of a public company, with
an apparent lack of ownership, is an unfamiliar one in Brazil, its chances
of success still outweigh those of a sale of control. <BR>
<BR>
An alternative could be a combination of trade sale and flotation, as was
in the minds of the low bidders on the deal. Landau of BNDES says this is
a possibility and the chosen formula could include retail and institutional
tranches, slices sold to strategic investors and the government retaining
a stake that it can dispose of later when the share price has risen. <BR>
<BR>
But Landau says: &quot;We can't sell control to Australian [mining companies]
or Japanese [steelmakers] alone. This is a problem. We don't want to use
CVRD to change the international market [in iron ore]. This is not a prejudice
against Japanese or Australians but because they are in the business.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Such an outcome is also opposed by the company. CVRD's Pinto believes that
in the hands of Australian mining companies the Japanese iron-ore market
would be supplied from Australia and operations in Brazil wound down. Under
Japanese ownership, CVRD would become a cost centre and not a profit centre,
he says, and iron ore would be sold at a minimum price. &quot;All the profits
would go to Japan. This would not be good for the company.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, Pinto thinks that strategic acquisitions are unlikely as long as
CVRD is sold as a whole. The price would be too high for an investor only
interested in a single activity such as iron ore or pulp and paper, he says.
<BR>
<BR>
Splitting the company and selling in parts is an option that the government
is still officially considering. In reality, it is unlikely to come about.
The task would be highly complex because of the shareholder agreements between
CVRD and joint-venture partners. The partners would have the right to suspend
existing contracts, which would delay the breaking up of CVRD. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Selling CVRD in parts is unfeasible,&quot; says Paulo Ferraz Pereira,
president of Brazil's Banco Bozano Simonsen. &quot;It [the privatization
in parts] certainly wouldn't get done in 1996, and probably not even by
2000.&quot; Ferraz also thinks the combined trade sale and flotation option
for CVRD as a whole is unworkable. &quot;That is the worst alternative ...
Who will pay for a 10% stake not to have control?&quot; he asks. <BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, however, Banco Bozano Simonsen did not join the bidding process
for the mandate because of the chance that it could be a trade auction.
The bank expects to be active on the buy side of the CVRD privatization
and involvement in the mandate would have meant a conflict of interest.
If the sale is a flotation, the bank hopes to be part of the underwriting
syndicate. <BR>
<BR>
The method of disposing of CVRD may have been hazy, but the bid rules for
securing the mandate were totally clear. They were drawn up on the basis
of past experience, the advice of the investment banks and World Bank guidelines
(the World Bank is lending the government money for the fixed fee).<B> </B>The
aim was to have a totally clean bidding process, free from allegations of
corruption or nepotism, and to ensure that the final valuation would be
defensible against domestic criticism of the sell-off. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Benchmark deal </B><BR>
<BR>
Two contracts were involved, Service A and Service B. The first one, purely
a valuation, was awarded to a consortium including Salomon Brothers, Robert
Fleming, Ernst &amp; Young and Patrimonio at a fixed fee of $3 million.
Service B also includes a valuation and having two assessments is a further
sign of the government's desire to justify the deal. <BR>
<BR>
The Service B contract also requires the winning consultant to propose a
sale model and, if the government approves it, to carry out the privatization
for an agreed success fee. It was this prospect of the parcelling out to
investors of a veritable Eldorado that originally had the investment banks
falling over themselves to secure the contract. &quot;CVRD will be Brazil's
benchmark deal for international investors,&quot; says Landau of BNDES,
adding that in terms of restructuring the country, planned privatizations
in the electric and telecoms sectors will actually be more important. <BR>
<BR>
With so much overseas attention, the government wanted to be sure that quality
of service would be as important as price in awarding the contract. So the
bid was divided into three parts, with the first part - assessing a bidder's
technical qualifications - counting for 80% of the points. The second part
involved the fixed fee that would cover the consultant's costs of doing
the evaluation and constructing a sale model for the privatization. If the
government decided not to proceed with the privatization, this would be
the amount paid to the banks for their work. But if the offer went ahead,
the banks would receive the success fee, the subject of the third part of
the bid, and pay for their costs out of that. Success fees were quoted as
a percentage of the sale value of shares and counted for 20% of the total
bid. It was at this stage of the process that Merrill Lynch's 1.91% bid
took on so much gravitas. But it was the second stage, the fixed fee - which
counted for nothing in terms of contract points and was merely a hurdle
to be cleared - that tripped up Morgan Stanley. The purpose of inserting
the minimum-price mechanism which defeated Morgan Stanley was also to keep
quality high. <BR>
<BR>
The technical part of the bid was straightforward enough, although one banker
complained of the heavy emphasis on mining-rights experience as opposed
to financial experience, another of the stress on the professional qualifications
of individual team members. The results were extremely close: less than
1.5 points separated Goldman Sachs's score of 10, the maximum possible,
and Bear Stearns' 8.59. Morgan Stanley placed second with 9.95 and Merrill
third with 9.54. &quot;It was a bit like the samba school ratings at the
Rio carnival where everyone comes in within a few points in all categories
- music, dancing and costumes,&quot; says Nicholas Reade, a Bear Stearns
managing director. <BR>
<BR>
The problem was that the proximity of the technical bids placed additional
weight on the price bids even though the <I>edital</I> had been deliberately
structured to avoid this. One suggestion is that a grid should have been
used in the technical part to place consortia at definite intervals from
each other. &quot;Otherwise 20% [the price component] becomes 100%,&quot;
says one banker. <BR>
<BR>
After announcement of the first-stage results, the Morgan Stanley-led consortium
became extremely confident of victory. With such a good technical rating,
a moderate price bid would have been enough to clinch the deal. Market gossip
gives all players an idea of the bid range and some members of the Morgan
Stanley consortium, say S&atilde;o Paulo sources, were celebrating ahead
of the results. <BR>
<BR>
Then the bombshell dropped. The Morgan Stanley group had been eliminated
for bidding too low in the fixed-fee section. According to the <I>edital,</I>
&quot;proposals with clearly unexecutable prices and proposals with clearly
excessive prices&quot; would be disqualified. This meant kicking out bids
less than 80% of the average of the lowest five bids and 50% above the average
of the highest five bids. With most bids coming in at around $10 million
to $11 million, the low-side minimum worked out at R7.604 million<B> </B>($7.98
million). Itajuba, as the Morgan Stanley consortium was known, pitched at
R7.5 million, only R104,000 below. <BR>
<BR>
Although Pactual's Rangel agrees with the concept of a minimum cut-off price,
he says: &quot;R7.5 million would have been enough to cover our costs since
we were assuming a partial trade sale.&quot; But Pactual's brave face may
be hiding a rift between the Itajuba partners. A S&atilde;o Paulo-based
banker who did not wish to be quoted says that Pactual was opposed to the
low fixed fee proposed by Morgan Stanley and wanted something higher. There
was a dispute over the price, and positions had to be taken. SBC Warburg
sided with Morgan Stanley, the low bid went through and the deal was lost.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Someone around the table must have pushed for that decision and be
feeling pretty bad now,&quot; says Nicholas Hurd, director general of Robert
Fleming do Brasil, part of the Salomon Brothers group. Says Fleming's London-based
global head of privatization, Chris Kirkness: &quot;We spent many hours
debating the tactics of the fixed-price bid. You could work out mathematically
what you would need to bid without any chance of falling out. There were
no prizes for coming in cheap because it wasn't part of the evaluation.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The incident has sparked off a debate as to whether this part of the <I>edital</I>
was correctly structured. Citibank's Souza e Silva says the minimum price
was a reaction to past infrastructure bids in Brazil where companies winning
contracts have been unable to complete them at the projected cost. &quot;There
were cases in the past where companies underbid for a highway and then stopped
in the middle of the contract to renegotiate,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
But was the minimum price mechanism in the right place? After all, the winning
consortium is going to pay the fixed costs out of its success fee so whether
the price is high or low it does not truly reflect what the bank is going
to make out of the deal and whether it is pricing too tightly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Overprotection</B> <BR>
<BR>
A case can be made for having high-side protection for the fixed fee should
the privatization be cancelled and the government end up paying the bill.
But low-side protection would have been more useful for the success-fee
bid, where the 1.91% rate has raised fears about whether this is really
sufficient to get the deal done. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is a question as to whether a deal structured this way can actually
get done,&quot; says Carey Hall, senior managing director with Bear Stearns.
&quot;It is very thinly priced. With a global offering, you have to convince
the sales force to work for you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Says Bear Stearns' Reade: &quot;Where they [the government] needed to protect
themselves against a less-qualified consortium winning with a low success
fee, they didn't have anything. And they had unnecessary protection on the
retainer.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Fleming's Kirkness does feel BNDES got it right. He says the <I>edital</I>
had the effect of persuading banks to put in sensible numbers. The fixed
fee covers the bulk of the work so if a bank put in a low bid there it might
indicate a willingness to skimp and hold on to more of the success fee.
<BR>
<BR>
The drama in the CVRD mandate contest continued right up until the final
deadline for submitting bids. At the appointed hour, BNDES executives coolly
adhered to protocol by assembling in the basement of their Rio de Janeiro
headquarters. They were faced with a rather motley collection of bankers,
some of whom were hot and flustered having scrambled to get there on time.
One group, thought to be Lehman Brothers, was actually late and had to plead
not to be disqualified. Salomon Brothers' group only paginated their proposal
on the morning of the deadline and were relieved when it came out close
to the 500 pages stipulated - unlike a rival's, believed to be Merrill Lynch's,
which was some 50 or so pages over. Still, these infractions were overlooked
by BNDES and at the end of the meeting the bankers left feeling that maybe
it was the government that had the rawest deal - the task of reading 4,500
pages of dry text. <BR>
<BR>
The unusual length of the proposals and the desire on the part of the banks
to leave all possibilities open meant that large parts of them were written
in vague and non-committal terms. &quot;You could have swapped chunks of
Merrill's proposal with that of Goldman and no-one would have noticed,&quot;
says Bear Stearns' Reade. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A nice surprise</B> <BR>
<BR>
Despite the high jinks, the Brazilian government is satisfied with the outcome.
&quot;I am absolutely confident that all the legal procedures were met and
the final contenders were the best we could have in the world,&quot; says
Jos&eacute; Roberto Mendon&ccedil;a de Barros, secretary of political economy
in the finance ministry. &quot;I know that Gros and Morgan Stanley had some
hard feelings but it was a normal process. We were surprised by the lowness
of the bids but then CVRD is a first-class enterprise ... it was a very
high-quality competition and, as usual, competition produced a lower price.
For us, it was a nice surprise.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The real surprises in the CVRD privatization, however, may still be on the
way. Disgruntled unions and minority shareholders in Brazil have perfected
the art of delay. Time-wasting court actions known as <I>liminars</I> are
common and one was used in December to put off the sale of electricity distributor
Rio Light. CVRD employees have to be kept happy and this will probably require
putting their way a tranche of shares on favourable terms with all the structuring
difficulties involved. <BR>
<BR>
Wider retail distribution is also a problem since both ordinary and preference
shares are traded in blocks of 1,000 and the ordinary share price is around
$250, which is two and half times the minimum monthly wage. Few ordinary
Brazilians have the money or the stomach for stock market investing. But
pulverization is going to be important to the government for political reasons
and will have to form part of the sale. Then there will be the congressional
arguments over valuation of mineral rights and CVRD's social-development
role. All these factors are likely to slow down the process and add to the
Merrill consortium's costs. <BR>
<BR>
Even if all goes to plan, the Merrill Lynch group will not complete its
report before June, no global offering can take place during the northern
summer months of July and August, and Brazilian municipal elections in October
and November could push the offering into next year. But push it back too
far and the deal will run into presidential elections in 1998 for which
campaigning will begin in 1997. If the deal slips too much, it could wind
up being indefinitely postponed. <BR>
<BR>
Then there is the opportunity cost to Merrill of being involved in the project.
Rival banks say there is other privatization work be-sides that related
to the selling of assets, such as work on new concessions being granted
in former areas of monopoly. With margins cut to the bone on CVRD, such
projects may turn out to be relatively as profitable. And there is even
doubt as to whether the CVRD sale will lead on to other projects or whether
the Brazilian government will prefer to spread future work among the banks.
Such sentiments certainly contain an element of sour grapes from bankers
who missed out on the deal but the virulence of their comments suggests
genuinely that all is not well with the mandate. <BR>
<BR>
As the Merrill team struggles and tears its hair over the CVRD mandate,
they may feel comforted by one banker's thoughts. &quot;Merrill Lynch's
reward will be in heaven on this one,&quot; he says. This seems a fitting
place to receive the payback on what is fast turning into the mandate from
hell. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1> <TR><TD COLSPAN=4><B>The

<H2>How to do the deal </H2>
Along with their criticisms of Merrill's thinly priced mandate, investment
banks have come up with some helpful suggestions for getting the CVRD deal
done and maximizing returns. <BR>
<BR>
These include releasing funds from a government-run provident scheme to
allow ordinary Brazilians to make share purchases; turning CVRD's preferred
shares into ordinary shares; and stripping out mineral rights that investors
are not prepared to pay for. <BR>
<BR>
If the deal is fully a flotation, a workable distribution breakdown, says
one banker, would be 70% placed internationally and 30% placed domestically.
Of the 70% going overseas, slightly more than 40% might go to US investors,
20% to European and between 5% and 10% to Japanese investors. Domestically,
the split might be three ways equally between retail, institutions and CVRD
employees. The offering could be placed in three tranches averaging $2 billion
each with the first coming at the end of this year, the second in the second
quarter of 1997 and the final one at the beginning of 1998. <BR>
<BR>
In the domestic market, the challenge is to put shares into the hands of
the Brazilian public, which mostly lacks the disposable income to make such
purchases. The solution, says Eduardo Henrique de Souza Rangel of Banco
Pactual, is to allow citizens to use money from the Fundo de Garantia por
Tempo de Servi&ccedil;o (FGTS). &quot;To create a huge demand you need a
strong instrument that everyone has access to,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
In past Brazilian privatizations, companies holding debt securities of the
state concern have been able to use these to buy equity on attractive terms.
This has boosted demand for the stock by creating what analysts call a &quot;privatization
currency&quot;. But since in the case of CVRD the government has said it
only wants to receive cash, this might be an attractive way of boosting
sales. Funds in the FGTS are estimated to be more than enough to purchase
the total offering. <BR>
<BR>
The government thinks so too but has run into union opposition in trying
to pass the necessary legislation. &quot;Last time we tried to do this,
we were opposed by unions which said we were trying to use workers' money
for neo-liberal projects,&quot; says Jos&eacute; Roberto Mendon&ccedil;a
de Barros, secretary of political economy at the finance ministry. But the
government has not dropped the idea and there is still a possibility of
having it up and running in time for the CVRD offering. <BR>
<BR>
Since the privatization has been announced, a premium of as much as 50%
has opened up between CVRD's ordinary and preferred shares. Though the government
holds only 6% of the preferred shares, as compared with 76% of ordinary
shares, one proposal is that if the preferred shares could be turned into
ordinary shares the government could get a higher price for its preferred
shares. A shareholders' meeting would have to be called prior to the privatization
to approve this and there is a risk that the action could pull down the
price of the ordinary shares. <BR>
<BR>
The idea has drawn scepticism from fund managers. &quot;It sounds like something
dreamed up by a corporate financier but which would be unlikely to happen
in real life,&quot; says Fiona Tchen, fund manager with Foreign &amp; Colonial
Emerging Markets, which holds both kinds of CVRD stock. &quot;What would
be the benefits to the other shareholders?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Finally, one obstacle in the way of CVRD privatization is the 500-year reserves
of iron ore that opposition politicians fear will not be fully valued by
investors. The simple answer is take out whatever the market will not value,
for example, reserves in excess of between 30 and 50 years. Jos&eacute;
Monforte, a vice-president of Citibank, says that in future auctions of
reserves could be held in which CVRD would have first right of refusal at
the highest price. - <B><I>BC</I></B><p>

<H3>AUSTRIA</H3> 
<H2>Creditanstalt - haggling over the bride-price </H2>
<H4>The scrap over Creditanstalt defies description. The government wants
to maximize sale proceeds but management thinks the bank is overpriced.
Foreign bidders were invited although the government favours Austrian ownership.
And an Austrian-led consortium favoured by the bank's management was rejected
by the finance minister. Ronan Lyons looks at the confused attempts to sell
Austria's second-largest bank </H4>
The collapse of Austria's coalition government has scuppered the latest
attempt by the state to offload its controlling interest in Creditanstalt.
The new government will face the same problems in maximizing the sale value
of a bank trapped in a quagmire of jingoism and vested political interests.
<BR>
<BR>
How long does it take to privatize a bank? This may seem like a rather facile
question to most of us, but not to the Austrians. In April 1991, the Austrian
parliament passed a law permitting the privatization of Creditanstalt-Bankverein.
The manner of the sale was not to be fixed by parliament but was to be left
to the discretion of the government. But after almost five years of quibbling
over the minutiae of enabling legislation and the merits of a flotation
or a tender sale, people began to wonder if the government really wanted
to privatize the bank at all. <BR>
<BR>
In September 1995, however, the government took the plunge and opted for
a competitive tender. The state owns 68% of voting shares and 48% of total
shares in the bank, and these were both put up for sale to the highest bidder.
If maximizing the sale proceeds is the primary goal then a trade sale rather
than a flotation is the obvious choice. &quot;The bottom line is that whoever
pays the most will win control of the bank,&quot; says the socialist minister
of finance, Andreas Staribacher. The tender documents - drafted by JP Morgan,
the government's adviser on the sale - clearly stated the intention of the
government &quot;to maximize the price of the Creditanstalt stock and to
sell it against cash&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
But selling Creditanstalt was never going to be so simple. Within a week
of the October 9 deadline for bid submissions, the government collapsed.
The year-old coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SP&Ouml;) and conservative
People's Party (&Ouml;VP) fell apart over measures to cut the government
deficit in the 1996 budget. The inevitable postponement of the sale means
that the government must forgo Sch18 billion ($1.8 billion) of badly needed
revenue. If Austria is to meet the 1997 deadline set by the EU for prospective
member countries of the monetary union to have a budget deficit of no more
than 3% of GDP, the only alternative to a large-scale privatization is draconian
cuts in public expenditure. <BR>
<BR>
Before its abandonment, the tender process put a magnifying glass to the
jingoism and protectionism blighting Austria's banking sector. The ground-breaking
purchase of Austrian savings bank Bank f&uuml;r Arbeit und Wirtschaft by
Germany's Bayerische Landesbank in May 1995 provoked little opposition.
But Creditanstalt is different. Apart from being the country's second-biggest
bank, it also has close links with the conservative &Ouml;VP (known as &quot;the
blacks&quot;) and acts as a funnel for political patronage and nepotism.
The socialist &quot;red&quot; camp maintains its interest in the banking
sector through the country's largest bank, Bank Austria. The red and black
camps will cling desperately to their banking interests until banks divest
themselves of their massive industrial holdings. <BR>
<BR>
The tender documents make no explicit reference to the preservation of Austrian
interests, despite the clamour from the &Ouml;VP for a clause to be inserted
favouring an Austrian solution. But allowing Creditanstalt to fall into
the hands of foreigners is still anathema to most Austrians. Even the federal
chancellor, Franz Vranitzky of the SP&Ouml;, is on record as saying that
he favours Austrian core-ownership for Creditanstalt. The deputy chancellor
and leader of the &Ouml;VP, Wolfgang Sch&uuml;ssel, favours a similar solution.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Should foreigners be feared?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The fear is that, with a foreign takeover, the important strategic decisions
of the bank might be subjugated to the policy of the multinational buyer.
But those whose judgement is less clouded by political considerations state
a clear preference for a foreign takeover, and with it an injection of new
funds into the banking sector. Once a local buyer had consolidated its balance
sheet, there would be no net increase in funds in the sector. In addition,
a foreign buyer would be a strong force for rationalization in a sector
already overbanked, overbranched and overstaffed. <BR>
<BR>
But the omens for a clean transfer to a new owner, whether foreign or domestic,
are not good. Creditanstalt leaves behind it a string of spurned suitors.
In May 1993, a hostile bid from Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB), the traditionally
conservative umbrella group of Austria's rural banks, was rejected by the
government on the grounds that it was not backed by a credible financing
package. RZB offered to buy a controlling stake in Creditanstalt and then
to merge both institutions, amounting in practice to a reverse takeover.
From then on, the management and the ownership were to go their different
ways. <BR>
<BR>
A subsequent bid from CS Holding was shot down with a nationalistic fervour
that alarmed many. CS wanted to buy the bank outright but the conservatives
scuttled the bid with barely disguised xenophobia. &quot;The CS bid was
different,&quot; says one source at Creditanstalt. &quot;They made it clear
that Creditanstalt would have been integrated with its new owner. As a result,
important strategic decisions would have been made in Z&uuml;rich.&quot;
CS is unlikely to be lured back into the fray. &quot;The file on Creditanstalt
remains closed,&quot; says Gerhardt Beindorff, director of public relations
at CS Holding. Insult was added to injury when the then head of the &Ouml;NB
(the central bank), Maria Schaumayer, proclaimed that the Swiss flag would
never fly from Creditanstalt. <BR>
<BR>
The &Ouml;NB later disowned the comments. &quot;We take no formal position
on the matter of the sale of Creditanstalt,&quot; says Dietmar Spranz, a
member of the bank's executive board. &quot;The task of regulating the banking
sector lies with the ministry of finance and it is not obliged to ask the
opinion of the &Ouml;NB. Our only desire is to see negotiations completed
as soon as possible.&quot; But Schaumayer's outburst met with a warm reception
from the management of Creditanstalt. A subsequent approach in February
1995 by German insurer Allianz was similarly given short shrift by Creditanstalt
when information was requested from the bank. Allianz promptly withdrew
its offer. <BR>
<BR>
When the privatization of the bank was first mooted, the popular view was
that it would be as part of a mass privatization of state assets involving
a public offering of shares or a secondary offering for shares already listed.
The conservatives wanted to privatize via the Vienna Stock Exchange even
though its total capitalization is only Sch300 billion. &quot;The exchange
is a very narrow market,&quot; says Staribacher. &quot;Any major player,
even the bank itself, could influence the price.&quot; Indeed it's worth
noting that Creditanstalt has a 9.92% weighting in the ATX, an index of
18 blue-chip Austrian shares. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Missed opportunity</B> <BR>
<BR>
The management of Creditanstalt made little secret of its preference for
a flotation in 1993 when bank stocks were in demand throughout Europe. While
acknowledging that the Austrian market is illiquid, Joachim Kuehnert, spokesman
for the managing board of the bank, contends that the market in Creditanstalt
shares is liquid. &quot;With 52% of the bank's shares in private hands,
there is already a high turnover of bank shares,&quot; he says. Nor did
Kuehnert see any need to restrict the sale to a domestic offering. &quot;The
bank could have been sold through the international capital markets,&quot;
he says. &quot;In 1993 and 1994, this would have been viable because bank
shares were in demand. Banks in France, Spain and Italy were not restricted
to a local sale.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Others at the bank are more scathing about the government's refusal to consider
an IPO. &quot;Under a mass privatization, they couldn't rule out that a
big institution such as RZB would buy up a large stake, and the socialists
are loath to see Creditanstalt fall into the control of the 'black' farmers,&quot;
says one board member. &quot;Cooperatives like RZB are in a favourable position
because they pay low dividends and can adopt a wait-and-see approach. Look
at the returns on Creditanstalt shares. Are they really that attractive
to a buyer wishing to maximize returns?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When the government opted for an international competitive tender, the management
of Creditanstalt threw its weight firmly behind a consortium led by EA-Generali,
a subsidiary of Italian insurer Generali. Indeed, it may have masterminded
its formation. Creditanstalt is the foremost bank in financing corporate
Austria and the consortium includes many of its long-term business partners.
<BR>
<BR>
Much to the chagrin of Creditanstalt, Staribacher casts doubt on the Austrian
pedigree of the bid. &quot;The EA-Generali bid is a foreign bid,&quot; he
says. &quot;The company is 80% owned by an Italian company.&quot; Despite
what Staribacher says, EA is regarded as part of the local business establishment.
For the SP&Ouml;, however, this may be the reason for their mooted enthusiasm
for the bid. &quot;Ideally, the SP&Ouml; would rather a controlling interest
was kept by the government,&quot; says a senior banker at Creditanstalt.
&quot;If privatization is unavoidable then the bank should not fall into
the hands of the Austrian business establishment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Generali was established in 1831 in Trieste - then a major port of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. After World War I, Trieste was ceded to Italy. But the roots of
the company remained in Austria. &quot;We've been in Vienna for 164 years,&quot;
says Dietrich Karner, the chairman of EA. This may explain why the Italian
parent company, Generali, grants EA an unusual level of autonomy, despite
owning 80% of its stock. <BR>
<BR>
Commercial links between Creditanstalt and EA date back to the last century.
More recently, relations were cemented by mutual stock holdings: Creditanstalt
holds a 10% stake in EA and EA a 5% stake in Creditanstalt. In 1989, when
Creditanstalt was looking for an insurance partner, EA was the natural choice.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Looking for independence</B> <BR>
<BR>
The EA- or Austrian-led consortium also includes Die Erste &Ouml;sterreichische
Spar-Casse, a group of Austrian industrialists, Germany's Commerzbank, Banca
Commerciale Italiana, and Creditanstalt's regional banking subsidiaries
Bank f&uuml;r Tirol und Vorarlberg, Bank f&uuml;r K&auml;rnten und Steiermark,
and Bank f&uuml;r Ober&ouml;sterreich und Salzburg. The consortium members
plan to invest about Sch9 billion in the Creditanstalt stake, with the remainder
of the purchase price being financed with loans. Karner sees the consortium
as a group of core shareholders with a stake of between 10% and 20%, and
with the balance to be placed via a secondary offering on the Vienna Stock
Exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Insurance companies, apart from ING, are generally not interested in running
banks, and EA is no exception. This fits in neatly with the interests of
the bank's management. &quot;More than half our stock is already in private
hands, so we must pursue a policy based on the independence of the bank,&quot;
says Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman of Creditanstalt. <BR>
<BR>
The consortium claims to be seeking financial return on its investment and
not to be concerned with buttressing the conservative interests in the banking
sector. &quot;Under our ownership, Creditanstalt would preserve its autonomy,&quot;
says Karner. &quot;We would not interfere in its management. The main motivation
for the bid is to secure distribution channels through their outlets. We
want to be Creditanstalt's only insurance partner.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Karner claims to be flexible on the balance of domestic and foreign ownership
of the consortium. &quot;In May of 1995, we placed a bid and offered to
reduce the Italian participation,&quot; he says. A tone of exasperation
is increasingly evident. &quot;Nobody could have seen that Lacina would
have abandoned the ship. Another month would have been enough. And now the
government has fallen.&quot; The former minister of finance, Ferdinand Lacina,
resigned from the government mid-way through 1995, disapproving of the direction
the government was taking. Before his departure, he held talks with the
consortium on the sale of the bank. <BR>
<BR>
It seems, however, as though the consortium may be foundering. Commerzbank's
chairman, Martin Kohlhaussen, is on record as saying the bank is standing
by the consortium but will not be buying at the price demanded. (Commerzbank
is to acquire a 5% stake in Creditanstalt under the consortium plan). <BR>
<BR>
The government is obliged to ask the consortium for a fair price because
the sale must be vetted by the public audit office. &quot;By international
standards, the bank is not overpriced,&quot; says Staribacher, an auditor
by profession. &quot;It is capitalized at Sch25 billion.&quot; But JP Morgan's
valuation of Creditanstalt at Sch28 billion breaks down to a share price
of Sch900. Shares are trading at a little over Sch500. A control premium
of 30% is to be added to JP Morgan's estimate of the intrinsic value of
the bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Priced out of the market</B> <BR>
<BR>
The management of Creditanstalt complains bitterly that the government is
asking too high a price for the bank, and has cast doubt on the valuation
method. &quot;Listed companies are normally sold on a different basis -
either with a premium on the book value or on the price per share on the
stock exchange,&quot; says one disgruntled board member. &quot;The market
valuation and even the balance sheet of the bank were not taken into account.
If JP Morgan had recommended a 30% premium over book value, we would have
understood.&quot; Hinting at some foul play on the government's part, he
goes on to say that the SP&Ouml; has so overvalued the bank that the EA-Generali-led
consortium has been priced out of the market. <BR>
<BR>
When the tender was launched, the target price was 80% above the market
value. In typically temperate language, Karner describes this as naive.
&quot;Maybe the SP&Ouml; wanted to discourage bids,&quot; he says. &quot;We
know that no serious domestic or international player would pay the price
being asked.&quot; The EA-Generali-led consortium's latest offer is not
thought to be far off its initial offer, lodged in May 1995, of Sch680 per
share. <BR>
<BR>
At the time the valuation was made, the stock was trading at 96% of its
book value. Since then it has slid to 85% of its book value. Either you
assume the market knows something and trades at a discount, or that it undervalues
the stock. JP Morgan clearly believes the latter. Indeed, Walter Schuster
of the bank's advisory group acknowledges that the control premium is high
relative to the market's valuation of the bank, but stresses that most pundits
predict the stock will outperform the market over the next year. &quot;It
is difficult, if not impossible, to find other examples of a profitable
bank trading at a discount,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Ripe for asset-stripping</B> <BR>
<BR>
Creditanstalt has always been a moneyspinner, except for the bad years of
1991 and 1992 when bank shares all over Europe were in the doldrums. But
1993 and 1994 saw a big turnround in the bank's fortunes. Finally, it seemed
the time was right to privatize. In 1995, however, all Austrian blue chips
were afflicted by the general malaise of uncertainty over the stability
of the government. <BR>
<BR>
Rival bankers are queuing up to hurl mud at Creditanstalt over the stance
it has taken. &quot;Have you ever heard of a management board complaining
of overvaluation,&quot; says one, &quot;especially the management of a quoted
company where some 50% of the stock is listed. They are arguing that the
bank is worth less than its capital. In fact, they seem to want to broadcast
the fact.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If the current asking price were to stand, Creditanstalt would be a more
enticing purchase to a foreign buyer who would show little compunction in
stripping the assets of the bank. At its present market capitalization,
it would be possible to generate Sch7 billion from the sale of building
materials company Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, one of the bank's main
holdings, together with a control premium. Selling stakes in the three regional
banks could be expected to raise a further Sch3.2 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Thus a controlling interest in Creditanstalt could cost a foreign buyer
as little as Sch8 billion. An Austrian buyer, on the other hand, would run
the risk of upsetting mainstream political opinion if it attempted a similar
stripping of the bank's assets. Karner is at pains to stress that the EA
consortium would preserve Creditanstalt as a single entity. <BR>
<BR>
Staribacher would not be drawn on who the bidders are. But the secrecy surrounding
the bids is fuelling speculation in Vienna that no major international players
met the October 9 deadline. ING denies any interest in the bank, seeing
little if any synergy between the institutions. Nor is Creditanstalt on
the shopping list of Dresdner Bank. According to management board spokesman,
J&uuml;rgen Sarrazin, the bank is not interested in buying into a commercial
bank with a branch network outside of Germany. <BR>
<BR>
Much of the speculation about a potential foreign buyer centres on General
Electric Capital (GE), which will neither confirm nor deny an interest.
But Creditanstalt is loath even to feign enthusiasm for a GE bid. &quot;GE
has been successful up to now because it stayed out of classical branch
banking,&quot; says one source at the bank. Until September 1995, when it
placed a preliminary bid for Hungarian state-owned bank Budapest Bank, GE
had described itself as a &quot;non-bank bank&quot;, avoiding classical
lending and deposit-taking for ancillary business such as storecards and
leasing. <BR>
<BR>
Whether or not the SPO remains the dominant party in a new coalition government,
the sale of Creditanstalt will require the consent of the socialists - a
grim prospect given the bitterness already blighting the sale. Relations
between management and government reached their lowest ebb at the beginning
of October 1995 when the chairman of Wienerberger accused JP Morgan of actively
soliciting bids for the company. <BR>
<BR>
The US bank vehemently denies the charge. &quot;Why would we solicit bids
for the company when its owner, Creditanstalt, had not awarded us the mandate
for the sale?&quot; says a senior member of the bank's advisory division.
&quot;We don't do work that we haven't been asked to do.&quot; Staribacher
has maintained all along that the government would sell the bank as a whole,
including its industrial holdings. <BR>
<BR>
The aggrieved JP Morgan sees itself as the scapegoat for a crude attempt
to taint the sale process with the prospect of asset stripping. So what
prompted the scaremongering? Perhaps it was an attempt to stir up some popular
opposition to a foreign takeover. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Government-bank acrimony</B> <BR>
<BR>
The acrimony generated by a one-page advertisement which appeared in the<I>
Financial Times</I> on September 7 1995, outlining the terms of the tender,
is further proof of the depths to which relations between owner and management
have sunk.<B> </B>&quot;We are a publicly quoted company,&quot; says a Creditanstalt
board member. &quot;Why did the government officially ask JP Morgan to publicize
the price in a one-page advert in the<I> Financial Times</I>. This did not
help the government's negotiating position.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan, however, tells a different story. &quot;The management of Creditanstalt
demanded a full-page advert in the<I> Financial Times</I>, contending that
everyone should have the same access to the terms of the privatization,&quot;
says a source at the bank. JP Morgan claims that it pressed for a list of
potential buyers to be discussed with the seller so that the negotiations
could be kept secret. &quot;We said we wanted to pursue this route, so they
demanded the publication of the text,&quot; says the source. <BR>
<BR>
Mending bridges will be an urgent task for the new government, as it faces
tough budgetary negotiations in which Creditanstalt will play a crucial
role. But the bank cannot be privatized in the first quarter on the basis
of a balance sheet that dates from a year ago. So the process can only be
revived at the end of the first quarter. The JP Morgan valuation was based
on the 1994 results and estimates of the 1995 results, and so will have
to be revised in 1996. &quot;I will be happy to reopen negotiations with
the EA consortium and any other bidders next year,&quot; says Staribacher.
&quot;But the JP Morgan estimate of the price will depend on the 1995 results.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Whether he is allowed to honour this pledge is another matter. Staribacher
is young, inexperienced, and lacks a power base, although the chancellor
is on record as saying he would reappoint him if the SP&Ouml; remained the
dominant party in a future coalition. <BR>
<BR>
The tender process Staribacher initiated, by enticing large foreign players
to look seriously at the potential of Creditanstalt, would be a worthy legacy
for the young minister. An injection of foreign management into the bank
would shake up a turgid Austrian business establishment, which has traditionally
pursued market share at the expense of profit. Low margins in the Austrian
market will deter some foreign buyers, but the bank's bedrock of contacts
and branch network in Eastern Europe would be difficult to match with greenfield
operations. <BR>
<BR>
Walter Rothensteiner, the chairman of RZB, neatly sums up the folly of the
conservative's opposition to the sale of a majority stake to a foreign buyer.
&quot;European banks will enter the market and will not observe party allegiances,&quot;
he says. &quot;As bankers, our primary concern must be to manage a balance
sheet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Bank Austria and GiroCredit: an uneasy partnership </H3>
Creditanstalt's arch-rival, Bank Austria, is enduring its own growing pains.
Late in 1994 it bought a controlling interest in GiroCredit, the umbrella
bank of the savings bank sector, through its parent company Anteilsverwaltung
Zentralsparkasse (AVZ). The takeover was financed through a loan from Bank
Austria to AVZ, a foundation controlled by the city of Vienna, enabling
AVZ to buy 56% of ordinary shares in Giro. <BR>
<BR>
But AVZ also has a near 51% holding in Bank Austria. This neat little accounting
trick is only tenable as long as AVZ maintains its status as a foundation
and not a holding company. If AVZ has its status changed under Austrian
law to that of a holding company, it will be required to produce a consolidated
balance sheet of its holdings in Bank Austria and GiroCredit which would
entail a drastic reduction in its total assets. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stronger ties with savings banks</B> <BR>
<BR>
During the period of almost four years since the merger of Zentralsparkasse
and &Ouml;sterreichische L&auml;nderbank which formed Bank Austria, AVZ
has resisted attempts to change its status. And although the socialist SP&Ouml;
will also resist any moves to redefine AVZ as a holding company, now that
Austria is a member of the European Union, there may be no alternative.
EU rules oblige financial holding companies in member countries to produce
consolidated balance sheets. <BR>
<BR>
AVZ is on the retreat and desperately seeking a grace period from the ministry
of finance to prevent its capital base shrinking by some Sch8 billion, given
that an increase in capital from the markets is unlikely. Because a consolidated
bank would have had problems meeting its capital adequacy requirement, a
10-year implementation period was proposed by the last government - although
the consent of the conservative &Ouml;VP still had to be secured. <BR>
<BR>
The concern at Bank Austria was that once Zentralsparkasse was submerged
within the operations of a larger more diversified bank, it would forfeit
its dominant position within the savings bank sector. Bank Austria wanted
to strengthen its ties within this sector and GiroCredit seemed the perfect
vehicle to this end. <BR>
<BR>
But the takeover has not gone as smoothly as Bank Austria would have hoped.
Whatever its strategy, Bank Austria is committed to maintaining GiroCredit's
role as a quasi-central bank for the savings bank sector. <BR>
<BR>
Under Austrian banking law, a proportion of larger savings banks' reserves
and smaller banks' total reserves must be held with Giro. But as the sector
consolidates, many of the other services provided by Giro are no longer
required by the larger regional savings banks, particularly in securities
trading and foreign business. <BR>
<BR>
A number of bad loans add to the problem. Despite a 60% increase in earnings
in 1995, GiroCredit is still hamstrung by large provisioning requirements
amounting to Sch1.8 billion for the year. These provisions are the legacy
of the 1980s when it tried to break into the big league, lending to entrepreneurs
such as Ireland's Larry Goodman. <BR>
<BR>
The bank has since restructured, strengthening credit controls and risk
management. It has also sought to diversify its capital base away from the
regional savings banks. Late last year, it raised $30 million by converting
participation certificates - a hybrid of bonds and shares - into preference
shares, and by issuing warrants with the new preference shares. The move
was aimed at strengthening the bank's capital base which was previously
dominated by the savings banks. <BR>
<BR>
Bank Austria is likely to merge most of GiroCredit's activities with its
own, leaving only the core of its old business. &quot;They took us over
with specific franchises in mind,&quot; says a senior banker at Giro, &quot;such
as specialized finance in London and lending out of New York.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, Bank Austria's chairman Gerhard Randa has made little secret of
his dissatisfaction with the cooperation between Bank Austria and GiroCredit.
He points to the potential for savings at the subsidiaries in London and
New York, where both Bank Austria and GiroCredit have representative offices.
An agreement was reached at a board meeting in October between Bank Austria,
GiroCredit and AVZ to complete a report on the rationalization of both banks
by the end of the first quarter of 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Rationalizing overseas branches</B> <BR>
<BR>
Analysts at Bank Austria put the operating costs of the four Bank Austria
and GiroCredit branches in London and New York at about Sch750 million a
year. Potential savings would be between Sch250 million and Sch300 million.
But relinquishing these branches would wipe about Sch60 billion off Giro's
balance-sheet total. Thus, Die Erste &Ouml;sterreichische Spar-Casse (&quot;Die
Erste&quot;) could in future be larger than GiroCredit if it were to consolidate
its stake in Salzburger Sparkasse. <BR>
<BR>
Personal relations between Giro's chairman Herbert Lugmayr and Bank Austria's
Randa are increasingly strained, despite previous experience of working
together. Before becoming chairman of GiroCredit, Lugmayr was at Zentralsparkasse.
And <BR>
who was his secretary? None other than Randa. <BR>
<BR>
Lugmayr denies that he is being uncooperative. &quot;We are doing it in
a reasonable way,&quot; he says. &quot;The owners have the right to force
the management of the bank to earn money for their investments.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The signs are, however, that their working relationship may be coming to
an end. It seems likely that Lugmayr will present the 1995 final results,
announcing the resumption of dividend payments and subsequently step down
on health grounds. <B><I>-RL</I></B><p>

<H3>RATING AGENCIES </H3>
<H2>How many can play the rating game? </H2>
<H4>As bond markets develop in emerging economies, local rating agencies
have sprung up, often at the bidding of the regulators. But investors remain
sceptical about their objectivity, and the big two - S&amp;P and Moody's
- look set to defeat the newcomers. Ronan Lyons reports on differing
approaches to similar goals </H4>
Bond markets are in their infancy in Asia. In Malaysia, for example, only
M$25 billion ($10.9 billion) was raised through the local debt markets between
1991 and 1994, a tiny sum compared with the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's
market capitalization of M$518 billion and banking-sector assets that exceed
M$300 billion. <BR>
<BR>
All that is about to change. With growing affluence, a big pool of pension
and insurance funds throughout Asia will become available for investment
in debt. Japanese investors will also begin to seek attractive fixed-income
assets in the region. <BR>
<BR>
But if Asian issuers are to attract funds at attractive rates, they will
need reputable credit ratings. These may not be easy to achieve. Standard
&amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, which dominate ratings in Europe
and the US, provide little comfort to investors in Asia, or indeed in any
of the emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The big agencies have made tentative moves but have yet to make a
significant push in the emerging markets,&quot; says Bruce Johnson, co-chairman
of research at ING Barings in London. Failure to understand local accounting
norms and business culture could lead to mistakes and the erosion of the
agencies' credibility, which has been so painstakingly nurtured in developed
markets. An editorial in an August 1995 issue of S&amp;P's <I>Creditweek</I>
put it bluntly: &quot;While no-one should deny the potential of these many,
diverse and volatile markets to provide excellent investment opportunities,
the bottom line is that we do not know much about them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
S&amp;P has sought to overcome the problem by forming alliances with local
agencies. &quot;Over time we want to penetrate domestic markets in developing
countries as we have already done in France, Spain, Italy and Germany,&quot;
says George Dallas, managing director for European ratings at S&amp;P. In
1990, S&amp;P bought a 50% stake in France's Adef. The agency, renamed S&amp;P
Adef, continued to be staffed by French analysts and to produce research
literature in French. S&amp;P has since bought out the remaining 50%. <BR>
<BR>
This strategy has its pitfalls. S&amp;P's link-up with the largest credit
rating agency in India, Crisil, highlights the risk it runs of tainting
its reputation by getting involved in less-developed markets. According
to a February agreement, expertise and information will be exchanged between
the agencies, and S&amp;P retains the option to buy a minority stake in
Crisil. The hope is that Indian companies tapping the Euromarkets will eventually
be awarded joint ratings by S&amp;P/Crisil. <BR>
<BR>
There are, however, lingering doubts about Crisil's credibility, because
its core shareholders are financial institutions. The principal criterion
for assessing the independence and objectivity of an agency is whether or
not it could benefit from one of its own ratings. &quot;The idea of a bank
owning an agency would run counter to principles of credit rating,&quot;
says Dallas. &quot;This explains why a link with publishing houses is so
prevalent.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Once a government has given its blessing, a rating agency can be established
fairly easily. The barriers to entry are low. Capital outlays are limited
to an office, a couple of analysts and some computers. So a reputation for
independence and impartiality is crucial. <BR>
<BR>
The ownership structures of the large US agencies do not present any obvious
conflicts of interest, as they are all either independent or owned by non-financial
companies. Throughout Asia, though, agencies are owned by consortia of financial
institutions, including ones for which credit ratings are issued. The question
is especially salient in India. The two leading agencies, Crisil and Icra,
are respectively sponsored by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
of India (ICICI) and the International Finance Corporation of India (IFCI),
both of which channel business through their own agencies. <BR>
<BR>
Since being set up in 1987, Crisil has rated 1,700 entities, amounting to
$30 billion in total debt. It commands 70% of the market and employs 150
analysts, dwarfing rivals Icra and Care. ICICI, the Housing Finance Corporation
of India and Unit Trust (India's largest mutual fund), hold 30% of the agency's
equity. In a blatant conflict of interest, ICICI holds a seat on the agency's
board and an AAA rating by its credit committee, as does the Housing Finance
Corporation. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the relative sophistication of the market for ratings in India,
most foreign banks there holding portfolios of assets employ their own analysts,
while corporate debt is largely of the plain vanilla variety. But Gunit
Chadra, head of corporate finance at Citibank in Bombay, predicts the development
of a yield curve for liquid and traded corporate debt, based on reputable
local credit ratings. He sees little wrong with the ownership structure
of India's three local agencies. &quot;Cross-holding structures are the
norm in India,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Nevetheless Crisil needed a foreign partner if outsiders were to be convinced
of this - which explains the enthusiasm with which it courted S&amp;P.
&quot;I wrote a letter to S&amp;P in 1991 inviting them to take a token
equity stake but not a contingent interest,&quot; says Pradip Shah, former
chief executive officer of Crisil. &quot;They refused my offer. Around the
same time the IFC pushed us into a relationship with Fitch [the US credit-rating
agency], but as far as we were concerned they were an also-ran.&quot; S&amp;P
remained the favoured choice for a partner. &quot;Our methodology is most
akin to S&amp;P's,&quot; says R Ravimohan, managing director of Crisil.
&quot;We don't do unsolicited ratings - nor does S&amp;P.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On this point S&amp;P draws a sharp distinction between itself and arch-rival
Moody's, which last month faced an inquiry by the US Justice Department
after allegations that it was issuing unsolicited ratings as a way of encouraging
companies to pay for more thorough rating reviews. &quot;Unlike Moody's
we rate issues only on request,&quot; says Michael Petit, director for international
ratings at S&amp;P in New York. &quot;So our market penetration depends
on demand.&quot; But the agency's expansion has focused on agreements with
other rating agencies, rather than directly courting custom from issuers.
Although in India Crisil's owners have refused to relinquish control, in
other countries S&amp;P has been forming alliances with local agencies,
taking equity positions with options to buy them outright. Such an arrangement
led to the purchase of Mexico's Caval. <BR>
<BR>
Thai Rating and Information Services (Tris) may be the next on S&amp;P's
shopping list. Tris has a &quot;technical services agreement&quot; with
S&amp;P, having linked up with the US agency when it was established. A
source at Tris describes its agreement with S&amp;P, under which the larger
agency retains the option to buy it outright, as &quot;a pact with the devil&quot;,
because the desire to expand is tempered by a fear of being taken over by
its larger partner. &quot;Tris was naive and inexperienced and is justified
in feeling short-changed,&quot; says a representative of another member
of the Asean Forum of Credit Rating Agencies (Afcra). Crisil, on the other
hand, had a large book of ratings before joining forces with S&amp;P. <BR>
<BR>
Moody's strategy in emerging markets has tended to be to establish its own
agencies rather than take stakes or forge alliances. In Cyprus, for example,
it initially approached local firm Capital Intelligence with an offer of
outright purchase. When the Nicosia-based agency asked for too much money,
Moody's outflanked it by poaching its three senior analysts and setting
up its own office from scratch. <BR>
<BR>
Moody's Cyprus office will spearhead its advance into the emerging markets
of the Middle East, eastern Europe, south Asia and Africa. The agency's
Hong Kong office covers southeast Asia and its New York office deals with
Latin America. Moody's maintains credit ratings on about 600 banks, more
than half of which are outside the US. &quot;We want to raise our total
coverage to at least 1,000, and we expect that most of these banks will
be in non-OECD countries,&quot; says John Bohn, president of Moody's. <BR>
<BR>
The agency expects to rate some 250 banks through its Cyprus office over
the next five years. The ratings will consist of traditional bank-debt ratings,
which measure the ability and willingness of banks to meet cross-border
obligations, and bank-financial-strength ratings (BFSRs), which assess a
bank's inherent strength, regardless of implicit or explicit support from
the government. <BR>
<BR>
The Cyprus office has already begun to flex its muscles in the region by
sending letters to Turkish banks notifying them of pending unsolicited ratings.
&quot;Most of the banks went ballistic,&quot; says a foreign banker based
in Istanbul. &quot;Moody's uses unsolicited ratings as a means of getting
its claws into clients in emerging markets,&quot; says another. <BR>
<BR>
The banks are left with little option than to co-operate. &quot;We got a
letter from Moody's saying they would be in Istanbul in two weeks and would
like to come and look at our accounts,&quot; says a source at a Turkish
bank. Turkish bankers are particularly annoyed because they are being asked
to pay for the unsolicited ratings. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We don't discuss our business development strategy in public,&quot;
says George Fasel, managing director of global communications at Moody's
in New York. Rival agencies are not so circumspect. &quot;We conduct ratings
on the basis of demand,&quot; says Lionel Marsland Shaw, general manager
of Capital Intelligence in Cyprus. &quot;But we are all tarred with the
same brush, as few issuers distinguish between the expansion strategies
pursued by different agencies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Warring with ratings</B> <BR>
<BR>
Issuers are also unhappy. &quot;It's a form of moral blackmail,&quot; says
an issuer on the receiving end of an unsolicited rating from Moody's, &quot;as
they tend to rate a notch below the opposition, which can increase the yield
paid at issuance.&quot; It's a ploy Moody's has used over and over again
to lever open a market. Much to the chagrin of issuers, there is no note
attached to the rating indicating that it was unsolicited. <BR>
<BR>
Moody's has also begun to issue unsolicited ratings for Indonesian banks.
Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) was given a D plus rating. BNI's executives
were infuriated by the rating, given the significant improvement in the
bank's performance in the last three years. Profits rose by 31.3% to Rp405.8
billion ($174.4 million) last year from Rp309.2 billion in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Other agencies have taken a less controversial approach to the emerging
markets. Thomson Bankwatch has embarked on a joint venture in Argentina,
signed an agreement in principle for a joint venture in Peru, and is holding
discussions with agencies in Taiwan and India. Thomson rates more banks
in the emerging markets than any of its rivals, maintaining over 1,000 ratings
in over 50 countries. <BR>
<BR>
Duff &amp; Phelps (DCR) has formed alliances in Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru and Venezuela, taking minority stakes and giving the local agency the
kudos of access to DCR's brand name. &quot;In Mexico we are known as a Mexican
agency because we have taken a minority interest alongside Mexican companies,&quot;
says David Roberts, head of DCR's international department, and to this
he attributes DCR Mexico's status as the largest agency in the country.
By contrast, S&amp;P bought outright Caval, the second-placed agency. <BR>
<BR>
Econsult, another DCR partner, is the largest agency in Chile, where all
issuers must have at least two ratings. These agencies provide ratings for
local markets, ranking banks and companies within the confines of one country.
The scale begins with an AAA rating and so is not constrained by a sovereign
ceiling. DCR's presence on the ground in Asia is sparse by comparison, although
expertise has been traded with Rating Agency Malaysia (Ram) and DCR offices
are planned in India and Pakistan. <BR>
<BR>
Latin America has experienced more competition for ratings among local agencies
than Asia. The number of agencies in Chile peaked at eight but has now fallen
back to three. &quot;The Chilean government mandated ratings for issuers
but allowed too many agencies to rate,&quot; says Robin Monro-Davies, managing
director of rating agency Ibca. These agencies have nowhere to go outside
their own markets. So it seems the future for most is to nurture a steady
local business with little growth - assuming they're not swallowed
by a larger agency or forced out of business altogether. <BR>
<BR>
In Asia, governments have sought to maintain tighter control over local
agencies. Indeed, the genesis of most local Asian agencies can be traced
directly to governments. &quot;The involvement of governments is a double-edged
sword,&quot; says Capital Intelligence's Marsland Shaw. &quot;Governments
can get these agencies off the ground but often they seek to use them as
a regulatory tool.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Malaysia and Indonesia are prime examples. In Malaysia, the law requires
a company that wants to issue debt to have a rating. But Ram is the only
agency, so it has a captive market. Pefindo in Indonesia enjoys a similar
monopoly. <BR>
<BR>
Pefindo president Farid Harianto dismisses the suspicions investors have
of a rating agency controlled by state-owned companies and commanding a
domestic monopoly. &quot;Once the level of companies being rated reaches
a certain level,&quot; he says, &quot;there may be a need for a second agency,
as is happening in Malaysia. But for now we control the market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Pefindo was established in 1993 and has since rated about 50 Indonesian
companies. Despite the fact that none of its 122 shareholding companies
has more than a 10% stake, it must overcome a mountain of scepticism from
investors. Reluctance to form an overseas alliance compounds the problem,
since the agency is unlikely to cede much to a foreign partner. &quot;It
would not be politically acceptable for Pefindo to fall into the hands of
a foreign agency,&quot; says Harianto. <BR>
<BR>
Malaysia's Ram, which has completed 290 ratings since being set up in 1990,
enjoys similar protection. The agency does not hold a licence from the central
bank or Malaysia's SEC. But both regulators have decreed that issues must
carry a rating. Because Ram is the only agency in the country, this amounts
to de facto official recognition. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Local vs international agencies</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Asian Development Bank and Ibca each hold a 4.9% stake in Ram. &quot;We
do not want an international agency to take a larger stake in Ram,&quot;
says Wong Fook Wah, the agency's general manager. &quot;The government wants
to see ratings carried out by agencies with majority domestic ownership.
But we are looking at the possibility of establishing a joint venture in
Singapore.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government is planning to set up a second agency and is encouraging
local companies to provide equity capital. Wong is not unduly worried by
the prospect, as it seems likely issuers of commercial paper and short-term
debt, previously required to have one rating, may in future require two.
<BR>
<BR>
Tris, Thailand's sole credit-rating agency, is the only member of the Asean
Forum of Credit Rating Agencies to have struck a formal alliance with a
leading international agency - S&amp;P. Tris aims to have rated 100
companies by the end of this year and expects to break even with income
of at least Bt50 million ($2 million), matching its accumulated net loss.
<BR>
<BR>
Local agencies which attempt to go it alone will face unyielding scepticism
from international investors. Unlike banks, which can be regulated by stipulating
minimum requirements for tier-one and tier-two capital, the reliability
of a rating agency is more difficult to appraise. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout the emerging economies there is a general requirement on the
part of the local securities regulator that an agency satisfies standards
of independence and sound methodology. However, as in the US, there are
no arbiters of methodology. &quot;Local SECs have not substituted their
judgments for those of the rating agencies,&quot; says Roberts. <BR>
<BR>
So international investors remain sceptical of local agencies. &quot;The
credibility of local agencies is, for the moment, restricted to local markets,&quot;
says Gregory Root, until recently Thomson Bankwatch president. &quot;Companies
in emerging economies tapping the Euromarkets still need a rating from one
of the larger agencies.&quot; Root believes that for local agencies to be
truly credible, even among local investors, they must be affiliated with
one of the large agencies. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I would place a lot of credence in a rating from Moody's or S&amp;P,&quot;
says a banking analyst in London. &quot;If the only rating was from DCR
or Thomson Bankwatch, I would be reassured but still slightly sceptical.
So if all I had to go by was a rating from a local agency, I would be very
sceptical.&quot; Even if a bank is convinced, its clients may not be. &quot;It
would be easier for us to broaden our client base marketing stocks in companies
carrying a rating from a larger agency,&quot; says Peter Geraghty, managing
director of ING Barings in London. &quot;And with a dollar-based instrument
a rating will always be sought from a larger agency.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DCR wins plaudits for its presence in Latin America. &quot;Duff &amp; Phelps
are very strong in Latin America, but they don't rate Asian bonds,&quot;
says Helene Williamson, director of fixed-income investments at Foreign
&amp; Colonial. &quot;The big two - Moody's and S&amp;P - tend
to be too conservative when rating emerging markets issuers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
These markets provide the best opportunities for smaller agencies, whether
locally owned or in partnership with DCR or Thomson Bankwatch, seeking to
challenge the S&amp;P/Moody's duopoly. In western Europe it would not be
financially viable to establish a new agency as it would face immediate
competition from the established ones. &quot;It would take several years
before any revenues could be generated, let alone profits,&quot; says Ibca's
Monro-Davies. &quot;Revenues can only be generated on the strength of a
reputation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But even in the emerging markets, smaller agencies may merely provide stop-gap
ratings until Moody's and S&amp;P consolidate their presence. &quot;Investors
will seek an opinion from a local agency and from one with a global presence,&quot;
says Crisil's Ravimohan. This may be the spin that the new agencies will
put on it, but the market for ratings will quickly become saturated by the
presence of Moody's and S&amp;P in a country. Although there is a high marginal
benefit to seeking a second opinion, the marginal benefit of a third or
fourth rating is slight. The process is time-consuming for the issuer and
investors gain little. Indeed, too many ratings makes for a confused and
ultimately dysfunctional marketplace. <BR>
<BR>
The ratings provided by Moody's and S&amp;P set the international benchmark
and are instantly recognized and understood by investors. So a patchwork
of local agencies is of little use. Ten agencies, using 10 different methodologies
and scales, will confuse and panic most investors. <BR>
<BR>
If the investor is diversifying only into one country it's not such a problem.
But most will want to trawl across countries without having to worry about
whether or not their information is accurate. Even if agencies provide accurate
rank-orderings of default risk within their own countries, these ratings
may be useless to international investors. A rough correspondence will emerge
between the scales used, but the meaning of each rating will vary over time
and between agencies. <BR>
<BR>
The involvement of banks in local bond markets further complicates matters.
Local banks participate actively in the local bond market by offering guarantees
for paper issued. However, this defeats the purpose of rating a bond issue
or a company's credit standing, since investors are guaranteed against the
default of the issuer anyway. In guaranteeing bonds, the risk is transferred
from the borrower to the banker, rather than from the borrower to the buyer
of the bonds. Also, the rating of the paper reflects that of the guarantor
rather than the borrower, so the stand-alone credit rating of the company
is of little real significance. <BR>
<BR>
But the potential benefits to be reaped from local agencies are vast. Often
they are proselytizers for more sophisticated financial markets and could
help to kick-start the development of a market for private debt securities
and, particularly, a liquid secondary-bond market. Ram is promoting the
establishment of an asset-backed securities market and encouraging foreign
investors to place funds in Malaysia. &quot;Domestic bond markets should
not be confined to domestic issuers,&quot; says Wong Fook Wah, the agency's
general manager. &quot;So international investors must be comfortable with
our ratings.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Only time will tell if international investors will place any real credence
in local agencies. The danger is that issuers will seek ratings from agencies
charging the lowest fees and offering the highest ratings. But rating shopping
is ultimately self-defeating: if investors lose confidence in an agency's
ratings, issuers will no longer be able to lower their funding costs by
paying for a rating. So it seems the stage may be set for Moody's and S&amp;P
to seize control of the market for ratings in the emerging markets as they
have already done in Europe and the US.  <HR><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1>

<H3>REGULATION </H3>
<H2>The agony of the global supervisor </H2>
<H4>A handful of the world's top financial institutions have not one regulator
but many, spread over diverse products and markets. These regulators, scared
by Barings, Daiwa Bank and other disasters, are trying to plug holes in
the supervisory net. But it's a tough job to coordinate oversight <I>and</I>
to ensure that at least one supervisor has the full picture. David Shirreff
reports </H4>
Laocoon, the Trojan priest, didn't trust the Greeks and their wooden horse.
But before he could warn his fellow Trojans, the hostile gods sent two snakes
to throttle him and his sons. The sculptor's treatment of this event seems
to epitomize the struggle between the regulators and the regulated in today's
financial markets. But who is being strangled and who's doing the strangling?
<BR>
<BR>
A score of diverse institutions, operating globally in the major money centres
and emerging markets, present supervisors with an increasingly tortuous
task. &quot;The concept 'small is beautiful' doesn't exist in the financial
services industry,&quot; laments Tom de Swaan, executive director at Holland's
central bank. <BR>
<BR>
No single lead supervisor can hope to get the full picture - encompassing
all subsidiaries and financial affiliates - of one of these sprawling
entities which might include banking, fund management, securities and commodities
trading, and insurance. Indeed, it might be dangerous to try. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Over-supervision can disrupt the markets,&quot; warns Clifford Smout,
head of supervisory policy at the Bank of England. There may be legitimate
worries about systemic risk but &quot;you don't want to extend the regulatory
net to give the impression that dealing with subsidiaries is as safe as
dealing with the [regulated] bank&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The solution lies not in developing perfect insight into what these institutions
are doing, nor in tearing up the rule-book and starting again, most practitioners
conclude. The answer is less dramatic: more coordination between regulators,
better information gathering and sharing, and swifter procedures for dealing
with anything that threatens to jolt the financial system. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Baring gifts</B> <BR>
<BR>
The world's banking, securities and insurance supervisors and the authorized
exchanges were moving towards this anyway, so they say. But the collapse
of Barings in February 1995 and the unmasking of Daiwa Bank's 11-year deception
in New York last September gave them a big shove: financial supervisors
and the supervised were driven closer together in the common pursuit of
standards that might minimize shocks without distorting markets. <BR>
<BR>
At a meeting in May 1995, securities regulators from 16 countries signed
the so-called Windsor Declaration, calling for closer cooperation and better
information-flow between futures exchanges, and better procedures in cases
of insolvency. The Futures Industry Association (FIA) launched a &quot;global
task force&quot; in March 1995 which, by June, had produced recommendations
on financial integrity for futures and options markets, and their participants.
Within a year, some 55 exchanges had signed a cooperation agreement on information-sharing.
<BR>
<BR>
In July 1995 the so-called Tripartite Group of bank, securities and insurance
regulators published a report on the supervision of financial conglomerates.
It recommended setting up a nine-person joint forum representing the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organization of Securities
Commissions (Iosco), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors
(IAIS). The forum is now up and running. <BR>
<BR>
UK and US financial regulators have also organized joint visits to some
of the major global financial firms, primarily to examine management controls
- the weak link in the Barings and Daiwa fiascos. They have typically
visited firms for three-and-a-half days and &quot;asked intelligent questions
about management and reports&quot;, says a Goldman Sachs source. The UK
Securities &amp; Investments Board (SIB) and US Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission (SEC) selected two guinea-pig firms for a thorough study of how
such global investment and wholesale banking operations are run. &quot;We've
done the first two, and we're on to the next pair,&quot; says Tim Shepheard-Walwyn,
special adviser to the SIB. <BR>
<BR>
The practitioners too have sought to make their industry more transparent
to regulators and end-users - and to each other - by issuing their
own guidelines. The G30 report on derivatives practices and principles,
produced in July 1993, was the first attempt to fight fire with fire, anticipating
a crackdown by regulators. It offered a set of principles for the management
of a derivatives trading operation. In March 1995 the Derivatives Policy
Group (DPG), drawn from six US securities firms, produced <I>Framework for
Voluntary Oversight</I>, a code for better disclosure of their over-the-counter
(OTC) derivatives activities which they mostly book in unregulated affiliates.
Quarterly reports by these firms give more information on total marked-to-market
exposure to derivatives counterparties and their credit ratings, but there
is still little on daily market risk profit-and-loss. Such disclosure doesn't
make scrutiny by supervisors a redundant exercise. In the UK a &quot;major
task of the SFA&quot;, says chief executive Richard Farrant, &quot;has been
reminding firms that they're not doing what they say they're doing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Group psychology</B> <BR>
<BR>
The consulting arms of accounting firms have also attempted to fill a gap
by developing principles and checklists. In January, Coopers &amp; Lybrand
published a checklist of 89 risk principles designed to guard against weaknesses
in management controls. &quot;The DPG and the G30 publications were good
for advice, but not on control,&quot; says Patrick Fell, a principal at
Cooper's &amp; Lybrand. <BR>
<BR>
Since Barings, the focus has shifted somewhat from number-crunching exercises
and the bugbear of derivatives to a broader view of market and credit risk
management, operational risk and control, standards of business conduct,
and even the culture of an institution and the character of the people who
run it. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, management control is harder to codify than buckets of market
risk and counterparty exposures. Measuring how a firm manages itself is
as much a job for the company psychologist as for the auditor. <BR>
<BR>
But the numbers cannot be ignored. The supervision and the good internal
control of these firms is a complex combination of disciplines: understanding
and quantifying market risk, including low-probability but highly damaging
price movements, the so-called &quot;fat tails&quot;; factoring in credit
exposures and their sensitivity to the above market risk; mastering information-flow,
systems, command structure, independent oversight and risk control; and
monitoring the culture fostered by the people at the top. Just as an exceptional
gymnast performing a triple somersault knows at every instant exactly what
his position is, relative to the earth and the flying trapeze, so a complex
financial institution needs up-to-the-minute - and, if possible, real-time
- information, to assure its performance and to avoid a crash. Supervisors
shouldn't aspire to handling so much information. That would be equivalent
to getting onto the trapeze themselves. Nor should they micro-manage their
charges. Moreover, there are obstacles to a single supervisor attempting
to gather solo all the relevant information about a global firm. <BR>
<BR>
It is expedient for supervisors to rely on outside agents and their supervisors
to gather much of the information. But they can't rely on them to do their
job as policemen. Auditors may not see the wood for the trees; rating agencies
don't have access to some sensitive information; nor do auditors or rating
agencies review firms frequently enough; and internal risk controllers,
theoretically independent, are paid employees of the firm and might have
difficulty blowing the whistle. As one UK compliance officer told <I>Euromoney</I>:
&quot;I'm paid by my firm to help it develop its business successfully and
effectively within a regulatory framework. If senior management overrules
me I have a choice: either I can whistle-blow or move somewhere else.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Some experts would like to see market forces applied to the regulation of
major financial institutions. Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Kansas City, suggests severely reducing the regulation and oversight
of large, globally-active institutions, to save costs and reduce moral hazard
(the assumption that because they're regulated, the regulator won't allow
them to fail). New Zealand has already lifted supervision from its banks,
relying on quarterly disclosure, comment from rating agencies and the press,
and placing greater responsibility with bank directors. New Zealand is not
a great pilot project for other jurisdictions, since all but one New Zealand
bank has a foreign-regulated parent. But the experiment may show how disclosure
and making directors <I>de facto</I> supervisors can shift the supervisory
burden closer to the market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Risk management ratings</B> <BR>
<BR>
These concepts don't cut much ice in the US or the UK. But some risk controllers
like the idea of supervisors rating firms publicly for their management
controls. In the US, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
and the New York Federal Reserve have gone some way towards this by ranking
banks on the basis of &quot;supervision by risk&quot;. Central banking expert
Bert Ely has suggested that instead of a regulatory umbrella, banks should
form syndicates which sell individual members a cross-guarantee. The premium
for this guarantee, paid by each bank, varies according to its relative
capital strength and risk control. Supervisors, however, have a role that
would be difficult to replace, as a check on monopolistic tendencies. They
are also best-placed to warn on distortions in the sector, such as over-zealous
property lending or a skewing of the bonus system in favour of employees.
Whether their warnings are heeded is another matter. <BR>
<BR>
Financial institutions are not good at acknowledging their mistakes. Disclosing
bad loan provisions or outstanding litigation is one thing. Revealing quarterly
how accurate their value-at-risk (VAR) calculations have been would jar
with most institutions. Yet that is the basis of a proposal last year by
two New York Fed researchers: that financial institutions should themselves
decide what capital to hold against their risk positions, quarter by quarter.
If losses during that quarter exceed the pre-committed capital then the
firm is penalized by having to disclose the fact publicly and, possibly,
by suffering a financial penalty. JP Morgan, Chase/Chemical and Bankers
Trust helped with the research and appear to support the idea. So does Michael
Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who endorsed it
in a speech on June 6. Moskow and others are attracted by the idea of market
forces providing the discipline for market participants. But the pre-commitment
approach has its critics. Robert Gumerlock, managing director for risk control
at Swiss Bank Corporation, fears the encouragement to commit just enough
capital to avoid penalties would lead to brinkmanship and possibly increased
systemic risk. &quot;Pre-commitment aims to construct a scheme of speed
limits and fines for speeding,&quot; he wrote recently, &quot;while the
[Basle] committee [proposal for a minimum of three times a bank's own VAR
calculation] seeks to guarantee that vehicles are roadworthy at all speeds.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
There is a danger of risk management theories, techniques and numbers getting
too specific. Mark Brickell, managing director at JP Morgan, and former
chairman of the International Swaps &amp; Derivatives Association (Isda),
argues for regulatory diversity which allows &quot;each regulator to specialize
in a particular part of the market, instead of forcing one agency to attempt
to cover all&quot;. The towering authority of one monolithic [US] regulator
&quot;could translate into less certainty in markets&quot;, Brickell says.
Instead, he favours the existing diversity and market discipline -
&quot;a uniform force for good behaviour, which works through the competitive
process and the value of reputation&quot;. But regulators, who are paid
to be cynical, might not agree with Brickell's Panglossian view of markets
and market participants. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the ideal micro-model for audit and supervision of complex financial
activity is the triple-A derivative products company (DPC) as set up by
a dozen or so banks and investment banks (see <I>Euromoney</I>, June 1996,
page 120). These creations are subjected to frequent and intensive scrutiny
by auditors and rating agencies, whose reputation is on the line if the
DPC ever failed to perform in extreme conditions. However, the cost of the
surveillance is considerable, and DPCs are only simple structures with a
limited range of products and limited exposure to market and operational
risks. <BR>
<BR>
Financial supervisors are faced with a diversity of complex institutions.
None of the top 20 institutions is constructed alike or has exactly the
same range of businesses. The global name SBC Warburg &quot;is just a logo&quot;,
complains one supervisor. ING is an unregulated holding company which owns
a banking group and an insurance group. Although the Dutch central bank
says it has a satisfactory dialogue with the holding company, it has limited
legal rights there. The boundaries of a group may become increasingly blurred
as more services, such as information processing, payments and settlement
are outsourced. &quot;Instead of processing transactions, you have to manage
the interface,&quot; says Stephen Kingsley partner at Arthur Andersen. &quot;The
regulatory responsibility stays with the institution.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The regulator's ultimate sanction, if it finds the structure of a group
not sufficiently transparent, is to withhold authorization from the regulated
affiliate. This is a very blunt instrument: supervisors establishing a recognized
rating system might be part of the answer. <BR>
<BR>
But with a diverse group, deciding which of its many regulators should be
the lead supervisor and should take responsibility for overseeing the group
is an increasingly difficult problem. <BR>
<BR>
The European Union's investment services directive (ISD), which officially
took effect from January 1, has brought matters to a head. Although the
ISD was drawn up in 1993 and there were nearly three years to work out its
implications, some fundamental details are still unsettled. Euro-lawyers
are still wrangling about where a cross-border deal is deemed to have taken
place. Is it where the customer is, where the dealer is or where an exchange-traded
transaction has occurred? For example, if the Italian branch of a British
securities firm uses a remote terminal to trade a German Bund future for
a customer in Paris, where did the transaction take place, which supervisor
has oversight of the trader's conduct and which supervisor monitors the
integrity of the deal? Does an exchange have supervisory powers over a dealer
in another jurisdiction? Such questions were still being raised between
EU regulators last month. &quot;Oversight and enforcement tend to be territorial,&quot;
opines a UK regulator. But the wrangling is likely to continue for months
if not years. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the Europeans will reach sensible solutions. But if harmonizing
local rules on a European scale is a headache, attempting it on a global
scale, including less developed markets, would be a nightmare. It is one
that may be forced on regulators by the spread of Internet dealing, which
arguably has no geographical location. Germany is already attempting to
restrict money transfers on the Internet to licensed banks. <BR>
<BR>
Cooperation between regulators is simply a matter of more coordination and
communication, says de Swaan, of de Nederlandsche Bank, who is chairman
of the joint forum on international regulation. &quot;If, in the process
of mapping that out, you discuss how you can fill in gaps and cut out overlaps,
so much the better,&quot; he says. All participants now &quot;recognize
the need for coordination and sharing information, but the big issue is
how do you translate it into practical terms&quot;. The Basle committee
has been able to wield influence because it is 20 years old and has only
11 members - the G10 countries plus Switzerland. Iosco and the IAIS
are younger groups with wider membership and have more trouble reaching
a consensus. Recently, Iosco's technical committee, comprising only 16 major
countries, has done better in this respect. Last year's Tripartite Group
report concluded that coordination must be formalized to work better. Since
then, global supervisory coordination has proceeded by memorandum of understanding
(MOU). <BR>
<BR>
The most important aspect is to develop crisis management procedures. The
quicker and better the cooperation between supervisors, the less likely
it is that a problem will disrupt the markets. <BR>
<BR>
But de Swaan warns: &quot;You can't make a scenario [beforehand] on whether
you'd intervene or wind up.&quot; Each situation is different and to have
a lifeboat on standby increases the moral hazard and the temptation to launch
it. <BR>
<BR>
When the Ariane 5 space rocket veered off course last month, with its $500
million payload in jeopardy, the mission controllers blew it up before it
could do more damage on the ground. It was a costly decision but it was
taken promptly. In the financial markets the decision to intervene is seldom
as clear-cut. But hesitation by risk controllers or regulators faced with
a nasty choice is often expensive. BCCI was allowed to operate long after
the first suspicions of nefarious dealing were raised. Barings' risk controllers
dithered when faced with some puzzling unreconciled trades. Daiwa Bank's
top management, and then the Bank of Japan, tried to tidy up their problem
internally, inviting US regulatory wrath and heavier penalties. Losses taken
early, as every trader will tell you, can forestall a lot of subsequent
grief. But these decisions need to be taken with the help of good information.
The agony of the global regulator continues. <HR><BR>

<H2>Regulation writ Large </H2>
<I>Andrew Large, chairman of the uk's Securities &amp; Investments Board,
explains his approach to regulating diverse financial groups.</I> <BR>
<BR>
<B>What's your biggest problem?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We have a mismatch. We have an international capital market which we all
value. It's been a benign factor in the last 20 or 30 years, and its continuance
depends on confidence in it and its processes and the players within it.
But who plays referee? The answer is: a number of bodies regulate different
parts of the market, but there's no one regulator in particular. We're all
seeking the most satisfactory way to underpin the international capital
market without tying it up in red tape. Big financial services groups operate
across sectors and across frontiers. The regulators on the whole are national,
and often sectoral. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you have a solution?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The regulator can't very easily lay down a blueprint. There's an interplay
between the supervisor of global conglomerates and the supervised, and they're
mutually reliant. The supervisor will never have the same understanding
of all the risk control models, so it has to be a collaborative endeavour.
But what happens if the supervisor comes to the view that the party being
supervised isn't doing it right? How do you move from 'we're all in this
together'-mode to 'sorry I'm putting my policeman's hat on'. It's not easy,
particularly if the same people are adopting both roles. We've got to develop
and understand the human aspects of how and at what juncture the supervisor
can take off the hat that says we're working together to get an understanding,
and, on the basis of that understanding say &quot;We're now going to require
you to do x&quot;. On the other hand, if you have different people handling
the collegiate and the policeman's role, how many regulators do you need?
As supervisors we can't do it on our own; we need to work with the industry,
and that does happen. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Are you working without a blueprint in mind?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Do we build up a great academic model? I say no, because you've got to be
thoroughly practical. For example, right now we're working with our colleagues
in the States looking at the activities of a number of significant groups
and asking them to show us how their control procedures work. We're learning
a lot. It becomes a step by step, practical process, which we hope other
countries will find useful too. <BR>
<BR>
<B>It's very cosy though isn't it, if you're cynical. These global investment
banks are driving the regulatory process: you're fitting in with what they're
doing and saying 'you show us'.</B> <BR>
<BR>
No, that is far from being the whole truth. Being mutually reliant is not
the same as being cosy. You have to remember the speed with which the world
is moving, the sheer capabilities of information technology advances and
the technical advances in financial instruments and risk management. If
you then say the regulator ought to be ahead of all this and have resources
and people there, and then lay down a blueprint, I don't think it's realistic.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Should markets set their own pace of development?</B> <BR>
<BR>
You could say it's better to slow things down and put a bit of red tape
into it because then the system will be safer. Others would say that it's
not the regulator's job to stop anything going wrong because then you would
reduce the incentive for responsible behaviour. You might possibly even
hasten some of the accidents you're seeking to avoid. If your philosophy
was a <I>dirigiste</I> one, slowing down the international capital market,
or indeed stopping it, might be the price you would have to pay. I don't
take that view. I think we can find a middle way between total freedom and
over-regulation. <BR>
<BR>
<B>You could say that Glass-Steagall slowed down what was happening in the
States, and that the freer capital markets have been exported to London
and to the ether. They've exported their problem, and now we're having to
cope with it.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Hang on, that's a bit far-fetched. You're suggesting the international capital
market is a problem without a solution. I disagree. It's been an extremely
valuable source of capital and lubricant to the world economic process.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Let's call it a challenge, rather than a problem.</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is a challenge. I acknowledge that having such a market poses a number
of questions and dangers. I'm not saying we should avoid them altogether.
We ought to try to facilitate the future of the overall marketplace. This
means mitigating systemic risk. The most important element here is for firms
to have effective controls in place and to operate in a prudent manner.
But it goes beyond investment firms and groups. We've also got to look at
the supervision of markets, at issues such as transparency, at the clearing
and settlement arrangements, the legal infrastructure, and ensure, mostly
through better transparency, that warning signals appear more quickly and
that information is transferred from one party to another before something
goes wrong. If you take the Barings case. Okay, so the exchanges in the
Far East were aware of the positions that existed and the question that
everyone's been asking is &quot;How is it that the information was not made
available to the lead regulator?&quot; Now regulators have very elaborate
and good ways of passing information from one to another but it's often
on a reactive basis. The challenge is that you want to make sure that, when
something is important is happening, you get to know it. So we've got to
speed up the move from a reactive to a proactive volunteering of information.
That's a bit of a cultural change, which events like Barings have encouraged.
It's why last March over 50 exchanges and regulatory bodies signed a memorandum
of understanding at Boca Raton, so that information about a firm's large
exposure on one market would automatically be shared with the right supervisor
and lead regulator. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do you think it would be possible to have global monitoring of positions?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
No. And I'm not suggesting it. If you have global monitoring then you're
saying we need a sort of global surveillance machinery; but real life's
not like that. And even if the political will and financial resources were
there, it might not work organizationally. So we have to do the best we
can as a proxy for that, but it needn't be flabby at all. If there's a better
understanding of what sorts of information in possession of an exchange
could be important to a lead regulator, and the exchange felt an obligation
to transmit that information to a party that had power to do something with
it, that's not global surveillance but it's a great deal better than the
situation you have up to now, domestic and sectoral. It isn't going to cost
much, just the cost of a phone call, and the time it takes to get people
to think about who needs to know what. One doesn't need big bureaucracies
and superstructures. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hasn't that happened already?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It's an evolutionary process. It's in place, but the proof of the pudding
is in the eating. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Does it concern you that an unregulated entity, such as Sumitomo, can
cause such disruption?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Yes it concerns me, because this is one case and there have been others
where end-users have been involved. But I don't necessarily conclude that
therefore end-users should be regulated. One's got to rely on the market
to ensure that the users of markets are themselves people who have satisfactory
controls. We have responsibilities for, and feel able to exercise some influence
and control over, the fitness and properness of firms that are authorized
to do investment business. But if you said you've got to put controls on
people who use investment business I would say you really are going down
a slippery slope. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Is the SEC in a better position, regulating listed corporations?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
If you look at the history of regulation in the US, it was always based
on markets and exchanges and manipulation of markets. Our regulatory system
has been going less than 10 years. The initial emphasis was very much on
conduct of business. Integrity of markets is a pretty serious matter. We're
definitely going to have to find a way forward here, so that market integrity
is taken seriously but in a way which enables markets to operate. <HR>
<H2>End-user nightmare </H2>
Sumitomo Corporation's copper adventures have shown once again that the
stability of financial markets is at the mercy of big, unregulated players.
Metallgesellschaft, which came unstuck in oil futures at the end of 1993,
was an earlier example. <BR>
<BR>
There are many points on the interface between markets - particularly
derivatives markets - and end-users, where lack of transparency or
ignorance can cause big losses, misunderstanding and disruption. <BR>
<BR>
A bank or broker dealing with a fund manager often doesn't know whether
its true exposure is with the fund manager or with one of the fund manager's
clients. Unless accounts are segregated and referred to individually, the
dealer cannot build up a detailed picture of his value-at-risk. &quot;Blind
counterparties are an issue that concerns us,&quot; says Douglas Harris,
until recently senior deputy comptroller at the US Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC). <BR>
<BR>
End-users of futures contracts are frequently exposed unwittingly to an
additional risk - exposure to a third-party broker through which their
own broker has dealt as agent. The end-user may think that because it owns
a position on an exchange it has only the credit risk of the exchange. But
if the third-party broker defaults, clearing members of the exchange don't
guarantee the trades of a defaulting member's customers. If the end-user's
broker hasn't taken collateral to cover the position then the end-user faces
a loss. &quot;There's an unspoken conspiracy to keep end-users in the dark
about this,&quot; warned Verne Sedlacek, CFO of Harvard Management, at a
futures industry conference last month. &quot;Customer ignorance is a risk
to the system.&quot; Andrea Corcoran, division director at the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), says it is unlikely that a reputable
broker acting as agent would fail make good the client's loss if it had
put a trade through a third-party broker which had defaulted. But that would
be a business decision not a legal requirement. A UK lawyer says that a
UK broker is obliged to warn a client if it is putting funds with, say,
a Tokyo broker in a non-segregated account. The UK Securities &amp; Futures
Authority (SFA) has imposed new requirements on firms if their clients object
to them passing their money to a third-party broker in an overseas jurisdiction:
firms must either pass their own money - instead of the client's money
- to the third-party broker or return the money to the client.

<H3>PEOPLE</H3> 
<H2>The privatization club </H2>
<H4>They are politicians, bankers, bureaucrats and academics. They range
from British cabinet ministers, to Hungarian lawyers, to Wall Street investment
bankers. But the number of individuals who have had a decisive influence
on the course of world privatization since 1980 is surprisingly limited.
Steven Irvine and other <I>Euromoney</I> journalists pick out 14 stars of
privatization and visit its spiritual home, NM Rothschild </H4><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>John Redwood </H2>
&quot;I was the founding father,&quot; says John Redwood, the former government
minister who fought UK premier John Major in a Conservative leadership election
last summer. &quot;I was the pioneer who told them it could be done.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It's privatization the one-time Oxford university historian claims to have
invented. Drinking a cup of coffee in a couple of quick gulps, he offers
some evidence. &quot;I wrote a series of articles in the 1970s setting out
why we had to introduce private capital and I took the case to Margaret
[Thatcher] who was then leader of the opposition.&quot; He explained his
ideas to her at a lunch in 1978: &quot;She combined a gleam in her eye with
profound caution,&quot; he recalls. <BR>
<BR>
After teaching at Oxford, Redwood had joined investment bank NM Rothschild
where he wrote <I>Public Enterprise in Crisis,</I> published in 1980. Researching
the book crystallized his thoughts and steered his course towards politics.
He was appointed an adviser in Thatcher's Number 10 Policy Unit after she
came to power in 1979. <BR>
<BR>
Redwood's research on state-owned industries in the UK pinpointed trading
performance, costs of external financing to the government, what bits could
be privatized, and the attitude of the government. &quot;I knew you had
to start gently with a small successful business like Amersham International
[a pharmaceuticals company], that had no business being in the public sector.&quot;
Then, he says: &quot;I tackled British Telecom [BT]. I drew on the US and
the AT&amp;T monopoly having been broken.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He returned to Rothschild in 1985 but told director of corporate finance
Sir Michael Richardson that he couldn't work on UK projects for ethical
reasons, because he retained close high-level contacts with the UK government.
So he was given carte blanche to set up an international business. &quot;He
let me set up an office. I asked for a secretary and then did three or four
months' marketing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It wasn't easy at first - he recalls that he funded his travel expenses
by going to speak at conferences that offered to pay them. One turned out
to be very important: a US State Department conference in Washington where
he met the Jamaicans, his first clients. The state department, he says,
was very supportive of this &quot;Brit going to impossible places&quot;
who &quot;went round the world energizing&quot; privatization. It helped
that in February 1986 USAID had begun to link lending to privatization.
<BR>
<BR>
His fondest memories are of &quot;pioneering&quot; in Jamaica. &quot;I said
to the prime minister that we should begin with the National Bank of Jamaica
- the old Barclays bank. The prime minister said OK, and I told him it would
take a couple of months.&quot; Redwood had to stimulate domestic institutional
demand, because the government did not want an international placement.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I wanted to see the stock exchange when I arrived on the Monday. I
was told, 'you can't, it's closed'. 'I'll go on Tuesday afternoon,' I replied.
But this wasn't possible either. It was open only on Tuesday and Thursday
mornings.&quot; Once there he saw lots of &quot;guys drinking orange juice&quot;
who were amazed by the size of the issue he was planning, and had a few
pieces of structural advice. &quot;They said you can't distribute forms
by post because they won't arrive.&quot; The issue was a success. Cement
companies and hotels followed. <BR>
<BR>
Jamaica was important as a marketing tool: &quot;If you can privatize in
Jamaica you can privatize anywhere,&quot; was the pitch. Soon, however,
the Americans started to compete - &quot;six-foot blondes, very well turned
out, making detailed presentations&quot; - and some places, such as Israel,
fell to them: &quot;Rothschilds never win the business there because of
the importance of the US economy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Big kicks</B> <BR>
<BR>
Redwood's favourite privatization was the UK's National Freight Corporation
(NFC), which was bought by its 24,000 workers in 1982. One of the drivers
told him: &quot;When I was just an employee I used to kick my truck. Now
I own part of it, I polish it every morning.&quot; But perhaps truck-kicking
is back in vogue - 83% of the shares were owned by employees and families
when NFC was privatized, but it's now nearer 40%. In the past two years
the company has had three chief executives and two chairmen. What's more,
in the past three years it has underperformed the market by 60%. <BR>
<BR>
Of the big UK privatizations Redwood says only BT has gone really well.
&quot;I remember shortly after privatization a guy came round to install
my phone and did it like greased lightning. I said, that was quick and he
replied, 'I'm a shareholder now. I'm off to do the next one.'&quot; British
Gas was less of a success. &quot;It should have been broken up instead of
privatized whole. Creating competition is the most important thing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The interview over, the man who still has an outside chance of becoming
Britain's next prime minister takes a slim paperback off the shelf. &quot;You
might find this useful,&quot; he says. The book's called <I>Popular Capitalism</I>,
published in 1988, and it's by John Redwood. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Tamas Suchman </H2>
Sitting in his Budapest office overlooking the Danube, 41-year-old Tamas
Suchman appears an unlikely champion of privatization. His blue suit hangs
askew on his meaty frame. His hands are huge and callused, tangible evidence
that his first job was shovelling coal. <BR>
<BR>
Yet in 1995, this self-described left-winger was Europe's most successful
privatizer, selling $3.3 billion worth of state assets, including much of
the country's gas and electricity utilities. That figure nearly matches
the total amount Hungary's first post-communist government sold between
1990 and 1994. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a convinced left-wing politician, I would not have stepped on this
road if I had not seen it as unavoidable,&quot; says Suchman. Hungary began
1995 with both its trade deficit and government budget deficit shooting
towards 10% of annual GDP. If there had been no privatizations, disaster
would have loomed. &quot;If we see it from a left-wing point of view that
means the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs,&quot; says Suchman. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Country bumpkin</B> <BR>
<BR>
Last March, Suchman was greeted with sneers when he became minister without
portfolio in charge of privatization. Hungary's intelligentsia prides itself
on its &quot;European outlook&quot;, its urbanity, its diplomas, and its
fluency with languages. Suchman was a red flag to their elitist bull. In
interviews, he unabashedly cracks his knuckles and alternately puffs working-class
Symphonia cigarettes and upmarket Marlboros. <BR>
<BR>
Suchman appeared immensely underqualified. He had spent most of his adult
life working as a lawyer for a village council before becoming a member
of parliament in 1990. He speaks no foreign languages. The Socialists' junior
coalition partner, a party of liberal intellectuals, threatened to withdraw
over Suchman's nomination. At best, they derided him as a country bumpkin,
at worst as an obstructionist tool of the Socialist Party's core constituencies:
unions and an &quot;industrial lobby&quot; made up of ministry bureaucrats
and utility executives. <BR>
<BR>
At the time, Suchman said little to rebut his critics, hesitant to brag
before his job was done. &quot;I started my life as a physical labourer.
I was hard as a rock. I had the biggest shovel. I never gave up at that
time, and I didn't give up now because the stakes are a million times higher.
I think one of the biggest successes in a man's life comes when he shows
others that he is not what they say he is.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Peter Mihalyi, chief economist at the APVRt (state privatization and holding
company), offers a similar view. &quot;Suchman took personal pride in [privatizing].
'God damn I will do it. I will show these idiots. I'm a peasant, speaking
no languages, coming from the provinces - but I will push it through'.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The deals could not have happened without Suchman's drive, Mihalyi says.
&quot;There was tremendous opposition to privatization, opposition from
all points - the industrial lobbies, the local governments, the trade unions,
the public at large.&quot; Suchman lobbied everyone, shoved through a regulatory
framework for the gas and electricity utilities, then set and kept a breakneck
schedule for selling them. Suchman &quot;behaved like a steamroller, paying
very little attention to legal and other objections or constraints&quot;,
says Mihalyi. <BR>
<BR>
Suchman's detractors, faced with $3.3 billion in deals done, say he privatized
with such vigour because he hoped to spend excess proceeds on make-work
projects that would inspire Socialist voters. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;These are crazy ideas,&quot; Suchman retorts. &quot;Now I assume that
capitalism is the way to go. Now I've brought more than $3 billion into
the country. Why do people presume that I want socialist solutions, if I
see that the ideas don't work?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Of his critics, Suchman says, &quot;These people haven't sold an apple in
their lives. And they haven't ever created anything.&quot; He holds up two
gnarled hands. &quot;I've created a lot of things with these two hands.
And they should know that these are strong hands. There are many people
with hands like this in Hungary, and together we'll build up this country
just as America and the west were built.&quot; <BR>

<H2>Xavier Blandin</H2> 
Several British politicians and bankers have claims to being the architect
of UK privatization. But in France one man stands out as privatization's
founding-father - Xavier Blandin. Not only was he Edouard Balladur's key
lieutenant when French privatization law was drawn up in 1986, he went on
to head the privatization advisory group at Banque Paribas, which has arranged
most of France's important privatization issues. <BR>
<BR>
The distinguished-looking 45-year-old has the background to fit the part.
After attending the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, he joined
the ministry of finance in 1978. After a spell as alternate executive director
at the IMF and World Bank, he became a bank regulator. His life changed
in early 1986 when the right-wing coalition won the parliamentary election.
Jacques Chirac became prime minister and committed to reprivatizing the
companies nationalized by the socialists. Chirac made Balladur his minister
of state with a brief to sell 50 large companies over five years. And Balladur
chose Blandin and Jean-Marie Messier (now chairman of G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
des Eaux) as his special advisers on privatization. <BR>
<BR>
Blandin remembers it as an exciting period. The first sale was timetabled
for the end of 1986, so the privatization law had to be drawn up in the
space of only a few weeks in the spring. Blandin worked very closely with
Balladur during this period. What was he like as a man? &quot;He could be
perceived as distant. But when you discussed things in private with him
you got a very different perception. He was actually quite close to and
even warm with his staff.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One of the most controversial aspects of the privatization programme was
the creation of <I>noyaux durs</I> - core shareholding groups designed to
protect the company from takeover. Blandin is only lukewarm about the concept.
&quot;They were seen only as a transitory step,&quot; he says. &quot;The
commitment was to keep shares for five years. I still think it was probably
the only alternative.&quot; To explain this, he points to the lack of developed
pension funds in France. The use of a government &quot;golden share&quot;
was largely ruled out because &quot;we were worried the market would think
that the government still ran the companies&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Blandin now believes, though, that the days of noyaux durs are numbered.
&quot;Ten years on,&quot; he says, &quot;our capitalism is evolving and
the system is changing. Cross-shareholdings have become something of a problem.&quot;
He points out that the sale of Pechiney in December last year did not include
a noyau dur. <BR>
<BR>
Immediately after France's first privatization - of glass company Saint-Gobain
in December 1986 - came the most successful privatization: that of Banque
Paribas. A powerful advertising campaign featuring Paribas' palatial doors
slowly opening (&quot;the idea was to give a prestigious but mysterious
image&quot;) attracted 3.8 million shareholders in February 1987. <BR>
<BR>
Blandin's work on the Paribas issue clearly impressed the bank. After the
socialists returned to power in 1988, Blandin moved to less exciting jobs
in the ministry of finance (including, ironically, heading the department
in charge of public companies). In 1991 Andr&eacute; L&eacute;vy-Lang, chairman
of Paribas, approached Blandin to ask him to set up a privatization advisory
group for the bank. The socialists looked about to lose power again and
Paribas wanted to be ready for the expected next wave of privatizations.
<BR>
<BR>
Blandin has achieved some success in this role. Paribas has run most of
the biggest French deals, including the Ffr14 billion ($3.9 billion) sale
of Usinor last June - France's biggest privatization to date. Indeed, such
has been Paribas's dominance that &quot;at one stage there was a perception
in France that Paribas got too many privatizations&quot;, says Blandin.
In the league table of world privatization bookrunners from 1980 to 1995,
Paribas ranks third, behind only Goldman Sachs and SBC Warburg. <BR>
<BR>
But this position derives mainly from its strength in the French market.
Although it has won a good number of small privatization mandates outside
France (particularly in Latin America and the former Soviet Union), Paribas
is not yet in the first tier of global coordinators on large, headline-making
deals. And the recent French deals have been considerably less well received
than those in the early days of the programme. &quot;Recent privatizations
have shown disappointing results for shareholders,&quot; admits Blandin.
But, he says, &quot;the problem is the stock market, not the individual
companies&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Blandin's success in French privatization has been rewarded by Paribas.
Last month, as part of a bank-wide restructuring, he was promoted to &quot;senior
banker&quot; in charge of Paribas' relationships with a number of large
French companies. This, adds Blandin, &quot;includes keeping an eye on all
the companies that might be privatized in future.&quot; <B>Garry Evans</B>

<BR>
<H2>Eric Dobkin </H2>
Eric Dobkin was six foot tall and good-looking before he started in the
privatization business. At least, that's what he tells everyone. <BR>
<BR>
His physical sacrifice has not been in vain. &quot;Dobkin is the first American
who really made an impact,&quot; says Steve Robson, director of finance
industry and regulation at the UK treasury. <BR>
<BR>
Dobkin first became involved in privatization in 1986 when Goldman Sachs
was given the lead US role on British Gas. He was not instantly popular.
John Guinness, the civil servant responsible for the transaction at the
UK department of energy, recalls: &quot;The first time I ever met Eric Dobkin
he said it was the most uncomfortable interview of his life. Goldman had
not originally put a good team together, so I drew up a list of where they
had fallen down. He put an extremely good team on it from that point.&quot;
Relations quickly became less frosty. Guinness would gauge Dobkin's mood
by asking: &quot;Did your dog have a good day today?&quot; which derived
from a threat Dobkin once made that &quot;if he didn't get more stock he
would go home and kick his dog&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, Eric Dobkin's dogs may have played a bigger role in world privatization
than many members of the Goldman origination team. When Dobkin got a second
dog, he threatened Guinness that he wouldn't call it Electricity unless
Goldman was appointed US lead on the UK electricity privatization. It was.
But did his dogs die of natural causes or were they kicked once too often?
&quot;Let me tell you,&quot; says Dobkin. &quot;My dogs survived gas, and
electricity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Dobkin believes British Gas is one of the most important transactions he
has ever worked on, because it sealed Goldman Sachs's reputation as a privatization
specialist in the UK, Europe and worldwide He remembers the final pricing
meeting. Goldman was the last to be interviewed about its price views: &quot;I
walked in and I said I am going to do something special for you. I will
give you a list of the names of every buyer in the US, what they will pay,
and what they will pay in the aftermarket. There were a lot of surprised
faces, because that was breaking the paradigm. But I didn't know any differently
than to tell the client 101% of the truth.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Dobkin began his career at Goldman as a sales manager in Philadelphia. After
covering institutional sales in the Midwest he was charged with trying to
breathe life into Goldman's flagging primary-issuance business, which in
1984 totalled a mere $400 million in public offerings. &quot;It was a mixed
blessing,&quot; he says: &quot;having a great team and being fortunate to
be promoted to the position and yet unfortunate to have to take on one of
the toughest jobs in the business. But I love it and I thrive on the pressure.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Selling is still a strong point. When he's talking the book on the phone
he has a sheet of paper and a ruler in front of him. He writes down the
orders and tears off the strips. At the end of the day someone has to come
along and put his strips into some sort of order. <BR>
<BR>
But his main skill, says Robson, is marketing: &quot;He watches out for
mandates a long time in the future. He gets to know the main people, and
talks to them about ideas. This helps him to understand the thinking of
these people.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
His most difficult moments were on the second tranche of the British Telecom
privatization in 1991. One of those involved recalls: &quot;We used a computer
to build the book, and the system worked perfectly for two-and-a-half weeks.
However on the last night, a girl at Goldman in New York pressed all the
wrong buttons and all the information came through garbled. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We had to allocate a $20 billion book over the pricing weekend. But
without Goldman's information we couldn't run the computers overnight which
would mean we'd lose eight hours.&quot; Dobkin had arrived by Concorde from
New York at midnight. So an &quot;energetic&quot; Australian from SG Warburg
solved the problem by phoning him at the Savoy at 4am. Dobkin jumped out
of bed and, in his haste to get to Warburgs, arrived wearing not much more
than a mackintosh, and started working the phones, eventually sorting out
the problem. <BR>
<BR>
<B>German ambition</B> <BR>
<BR>
Other deals he considers important are Singapore Telecom - &quot;it credentialized
us in Asia&quot; - and Conrail - &quot;it credentialized us as the bank
to the US government&quot;. But all deals pale into insignificance beside
Deutsche Telekom, which will be the biggest transaction of 1996. So much
so that Dobkin considered getting German lessons but realized he didn't
have the time. They might have proved useful. On one occasion he was nearly
evicted from a taxi because he shouted at the German driver that he was
going the wrong way. The situation was only resolved when Dobkin called
up a German colleague on his mobile phone and had him pacify the cabbie.
<BR>
<BR>
Dobkin stresses that there are 20 to 30 others in the Goldman team who are
&quot;as good if not better&quot; than he is. And he loves what he does,
which now includes being a member of Goldman Sachs's operating committee:
&quot;They are going to carry me out of here in a pine box,&quot; he says,
&quot;with my two wonderful dogs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>David Mulford </H2>
David Mulford, head of CS First Boston Europe, spends a lot of time in the
air. So it was appropriate that <I>Euromoney </I>caught up with him at London
Heathrow airport on a two-hour stopover en route from Los Angeles to Rome,
where he was to have dinner with Italian prime minister Lamberto Dini. <BR>
<BR>
The former US undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs loves
to talk about privatization. &quot;It's exciting to me. It's where public
policy and finance meet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He has won two important mandates: Argentine oil company YPF, floated in
1993, and Italian oil company ENI, the biggest IPO of 1995. Last year he
also won the mandate to sell the remaining parts of Hungarian telephone
company Matav to Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech. Perhaps more impressive
was his success in persuading the Greek administration to retain CS First
Boston as its adviser on the sale of telecoms company OTE after a change
in government and doubts about whether it should be sold at all. &quot;I
believe I convinced them that we are professionals, who do our work for
the elected government in power, and that we give the best advice we can
to help a government meet its commercial objectives.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mulford graduated in the US and studied in Cape Town, before moving to Oxford
to study psephology (the science of elections), and he wrote two books before
deciding he wanted a life of action. <BR>
<BR>
He met the president of the Carnegie Foundation who recommended him to apply
for a White House fellowship, a programme offering posts in the US federal
government to high-fliers. &quot;I was one of the 15 selected from 4,000,
and I served in the treasury, where I was a special assistant to treasury
secretary Joe Fowler.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mulford then moved on to Wall Street, joining White, Weld &amp; Co. His
life changed when he went for a three-day meeting in Saudi Arabia in 1974,
and the Saudis hired the firm on the basis that Mulford would stay for six
months. He stayed nine years, heading the advisory team managing Saudi Arabia's
investment portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
At the height of this period there was $10 billion of new money to be invested
each month, and a team of eight managing a portfolio of $180 billion. He
became used to tough negotiations, none tougher than when the IMF actually
had to borrow money. &quot;I negotiated the $10 billion private placement
loan to the IMF, the largest private placement in the world. We were negotiating
with an institution whose mentality was that of a lender. Their first experience
as a borrower proved extremely difficult.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When Merrill Lynch bought White Weld in 1978, Merrill chief Don Regan became
Mulford's new boss. But Regan became US treasury secretary shortly afterwards.
In 1983 he told Mulford: &quot;You know more about international money flows
than anyone I have ever met. You have created this terrible debt problem
[via Saudi money], so why don't you help us sort it out.&quot; Back in government,
Mulford played a large part in creating the Brady plan - and gained a lot
of grateful emerging market contacts. <BR>
<BR>
In 1992 he returned to investment banking, secretly wondering if he still
had the necessary commercial edge. &quot;I was a little uncertain, but after
a few weeks I was fine. I think commercial skills are simply part of one's
make-up. Besides I did a lot of negotiating in government.&quot; So what
does he bring with him? &quot;I am a working investment banker, not simply
a retired government official who goes around knocking on doors. People
know I am experienced in financial markets and they trust me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;Come to me&quot;</B> <BR>
<BR>
What makes Mulford so persuasive? &quot;To me understanding the public-policy
aspect of a transaction is essential. Too many investment banks are corporate-focused.
They want to do a deal and move on to the next one.&quot; When he's asked
by government officials who is responsible for any problems in a deal, his
answer is, &quot;You come to me. I am personally responsible for this operation.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
His powers of persuasion were used to full effect in the YPF deal. &quot;All
the banks were telling Argentina to sell 10%-15% of YPF stock. In early
1993, Argentina's leaders were concerned about the country's lack of credibility
in international markets following years of poor policies. They believed
that, if less than 50% of YPF was sold, investors would not really believe
the company had been truly privatized. In the end we sold 45% of YPF for
cash, with the balance of 13% sold in the form of exchange shares for pensioners
bonds, making a total sale of 58% of the company. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I went to every roadshow in the world with [Argentine economy minister]
Domingo Cavallo],&quot; he recalls. This was important: &quot;A former undersecretary
to the US treasury standing up and speaking of the success of the reforms
counted for a lot with international investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
ENI was just as important. According to one of those present, his first
words to the CS First Boston faithful after he won the ENI mandate were:
&quot;Look, I have my reputation at stake here and CS First Boston's, so
I don't want to hear any complaints during execution that I am too senior
to do this. I don't have the time. This is a deal we have to make work.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
A vote of no-confidence in the Dini government fell on the same day as the
pricing and sizing of ENI were to be determined. &quot;Although Dini won,&quot;
says Mulford, &quot;we had already committed ourselves in writing to going
ahead because Italy's privatization programme was separate from the political
process at the time of the no-confidence crisis. We were ready to set the
price range and to size the issue, irrespective. This was a courageous thing
to do.&quot; Who decided that then? Mulford looks back, steely-eyed: &quot;I
did.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Maxim Boycko </H2>
Maxim Boycko, as principal adviser to former Russian deputy prime minister,
Anatoly Chubais, stood at the centre of the largest and most controversial
privatization programme ever undertaken. In the shadow of bitter parliamentary
hostility, culminating in the storming of the parliament building, Boycko
and a small group of economists, most not yet 30, privatized two-thirds
of Russian industry, turning 40 million Russians into shareholders. Most
of that action was crammed into 15 incredibly busy months between late 1992
and spring 1994. <BR>
<BR>
These were the young reformers whom Afghan war veteran and former vice-president
Alexander Rutskoi sneeringly described as the &quot;boys in pink pants&quot;.
The boys got a lot done. Over 80% of the country's labour force is now in
the private sector. The state's participation in the Russian economy is
less now than Italy's. Despite Chubais's recent sacking, it seems highly
unlikely that privatization can be reversed, though its pace may slow. <BR>
<BR>
From 1992 to 1994, Boycko's office was first stopping-off point for countless
western bankers and consultants keen to participate in this capitalist revolution.
&quot;There were about a dozen of them working flat out around the clock
in what looked like a dungeon,&quot; recalls one banker. At one point Boycko's
own health almost gave out. <BR>
<BR>
The character these western bankers encountered must have seemed reassuringly
familiar. He was drawn into the Chubais camp from an economic research institute,
IMEMO. Although at times gregarious and high-spirited, Boycko more often
comes across as a serious young economist who might have just walked out
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the University of Chicago.
He describes privatization techniques that don't work as &quot;sub-optimal
solutions&quot;. His book on the mass privatization, <I>Privatizing Russia</I>,
co-authored with colleagues Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, is a dry
account of an astonishing episode. Though lucid, it is long on theory, short
on drama. <BR>
<BR>
Now, as chief executive of the Russian Privatization Centre, a non-profit
body channelling foreign assistance funds to restructuring privatized companies,
Boycko has graduated to more modern and pleasant offices than most foreign
investment bankers in Moscow enjoy. He talks optimistically about the way
some Russian companies are now finding their feet in a new world. He mentions
a furniture factory in a small town outside Moscow. It used to turn out
very poor quality goods. Tough competition from abroad has forced it to
improve. It has now found its niche, using the advantage of low labour costs
to produce average quality furniture. He offers a list of 20 similar success
stories. &quot;My strong sense is that it is the core of medium-sized companies
that will determine the future of Russian industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Competitive markets</B> <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps Boycko seeks in such stories an escape from the constant criticism
of Russian privatization from abroad and at home. He tries to be hopeful.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is a fact of life that, if you start with no corporate governance,
it takes time for the situation to improve. It comes down to restructuring.
Even in the west, it can take a couple of years for a large company to restructure.
So to say that Russian privatization doesn't work, just because companies
have not changed within six months, is a little premature.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But it is quickly clear that corporate governance is not something in which
Boycko places great faith. These companies will not become more efficient
nor restructure on their own, just because it is a good thing to do. Nor
will much telling pressure come from outside shareholders. He says, simply:
&quot;The most important thing is to make sure that the markets for companies'
products are competitive and that the government taxes them properly.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
For the moment, banks are the richest group of new owners in Russia. Boycko
expects this will change, as the country slowly develops more conventional
pools of managed capital. &quot;During the transformation from a socialist
to a market economy, certain things can be done in a big bang - mass privatization,
price liberalization. Others have to grow. Russia needs insurance companies,
pension funds, mutual funds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Following the controversy over loans-for-shares deals, popular anger that
a greedy few are benefiting from privatization and the recent sacking of
Chubais, the prospect for privatization looks dark. But it always did. <BR>
<BR>
For all the criticism and treacherous political currents, Boycko and his
reformist colleagues have plenty of incentives to press on with their work.
There are still a significant number of companies only partially privatized
or just entering privatization. And there are areas where it has not yet
started, such as privatizing land, buildings and apartments. Boycko says:
&quot;The job isn't done yet.&quot; <BR>
<B>Peter Lee</B> <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Mario Draghi </H2>
Mario Draghi is dry. In every sense from economics to personal life. &quot;You
do your duty,&quot; he says, &quot;and that is to serve the state.&quot;
He doesn't like to speak to the press and tries to keep a low public profile
that is so low he is almost supine. &quot;Given his delicate task,&quot;
says a friend, &quot;it's not surprising that he's always very careful.&quot;
In Italy where magistrates will take every opportunity to launch a judicial
investigation, his reticence about his work as director general of the national
treasury may be forgiven. But it's less surprising that he has also been
very successful. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;He has good relations with everybody,&quot; says one banker, &quot;without
getting too close to anybody.&quot; This approach has served him well in
the topsy-turvy world of Italian government where he has held his post for
five years His style is gentle, intellectual and persistent. &quot;In Italy
you do not bang your fist on the table, but keep pushing. You must exercise
unrelenting pressure on events,&quot; he says. <BR>
A voracious reader of Greek and Latin classics, and of the novels of Henry
James - &quot;I recommend the short stories of 1916&quot; - it is said of
him: if the challenge isn't impossible, it doesn't interest him. And privatization
is among the most impossible in Italy. <BR>
<BR>
It is also among the most thankless. Privatization had been on the agenda
in Italy since the 1980s when Romano Prodi, then chairman of IRI, the giant
state holding company, took the first steps down the road. But Prodi, now
leader of a centre-left grouping, lacked the political support he needed
to accomplish the job. An entrenched political class, known as the CAF (Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani
- a particularly unholy alliance of Socialist and Christian Democrats),
was reluctant to give up the patronage which state control of the commanding
heights of the economy gave them: including IRI, a curious conglomerate
of three of the country's biggest banks, most of the telecommunications
industry, the steel industry as well as highway caf&eacute;s and anything
else irrelevant it had acquired. <BR>
<BR>
It was Draghi's job to try to push back the frontiers of the state. His
academic pedigree was impeccable: an outstanding undergraduate career in
Rome was followed by a doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
&quot;He has no idea of politics,&quot; says one observer, &quot;I think
he's more centre-right than centre-left but others may put it differently.&quot;
Besides his academic record, he had experience of the (almost) real world
of the IADB and the World Bank in Washington as an executive director before
moving back to Italy in 1990. <BR>
<BR>
He became Italy's anointed privatizer from 1992, and beneath him has 20
relatively young zealots who believe they are working at a historic moment
in the life of the treasury. Draghi, who works till 10pm six days a week,
laughs at the suggestion they are akin to an order of monks. &quot;A mission
is overstating it,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
But in spite of all the political resistance the list of completed privatizations
is growing: banks IMI and Credito Italiano, insurance group INA and oil
company ENI, 1995's largest deal. Which was his favourite? &quot;You want
to know the real answer?&quot; he says. &quot;The next one - I never look
back.&quot; The &quot;next one&quot; looks to be electricity generator ENEL.
<B>James Ball</B> <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Francis Maude </H2>
&quot;A privatization is a five-day test match. This isn't limited-overs
cricket. You have to build the innings methodically. You don't succeed by
a couple of sixes over the bowler's head,&quot; is the verdict of cricket-mad
Francis Maude, Morgan Stanley's head of global privatization. <BR>
<BR>
The 42-year-old former Conservative politician and financial secretary to
the treasury lost his seat at the last UK election, and has spent the past
four years as an investment banker. &quot;Yes, it's been an incredibly useful
experience,&quot; he says. &quot;It's been most interesting to be on the
other side of the table.&quot; He was the government vendor when the second
tranche of British Telecom was sold in 1991. So he knows what it's like
to be pitched to. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless it was a surprise when Maude joined Salomon Brothers in 1992.
Previously a barrister, it was assumed he would return to the law. But former
UK secretary of state for trade and industry Lord Young, who was a member
of Salomon's board, said that there might be a global privatization role
available. He decided to leverage his experience at the treasury and become
an investment banker. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A big gun?</B> <BR>
<BR>
On his first day, he recalls, he pitched to the Hungarian government for
the mandate to advise on the privatization of Matav, the telecoms company.
He was successful. A year later he moved to Morgan Stanley. <BR>
<BR>
Maude says Salomon was &quot;cheerful&quot; but didn't get taken seriously
enough in this kind of work. &quot;Morgan Stanley is a fully rounded investment
bank. I wanted to be with a firm that could both be an effective adviser
on pre-privatization issues but at the same time has a full-scale equity
capability.&quot; His earnings are a secret - the press's largest guess
is &#163;500,000 a year. <BR>
<BR>
Opinion is divided as to whether Maude is anything more than a big gun to
be wheeled out to pitch for a mandate. &quot;I bring to this business the
knowledge that governments as clients don't just have financial objectives,&quot;
he says. &quot;People feel one is talking the same language - because the
guy on the other side of the table feels you have been in the same position.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Asked what his pitching style is, he replies &quot;no idea&quot; but adds:
&quot;My experience is that aggressive pitching does not work.&quot; His
pitching can't have been too bad - Morgan Stanley has won some high-profile
advisory roles: Nuclear Electric in the UK, Belgian telecom company Belgacom,
and the quest for a strategic partner for Ireland's telecoms company. <BR>
<BR>
A banker recalls his first meeting with Maude: &quot;I went in to see this
young, unstuffy-looking minister, fiddling with these bright yellow worry
beads. It was more the sort of thing one would expect more from a minister
in Athens than a member of Her Majesty's government.&quot; He never uses
them on a pitch, others note. But, when he was in government, a Whitehall
source remembers, &quot;he forever had to have something in his fingers.
He has a love affair with paperclips: he'll twiddle them around and put
them together. And at parties he'll play with cocktail sticks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley knows its head of global privatization is heading back into
politics, to fight the next general election in a safe seat. &quot;Horsham
should be safe enough even for me,&quot; Maude says - it has a 25,000 Conservative
majority. 
<BR>
<BR><BR>

<H2>Per Tegn&eacute;r</H2> 
Per Tegn&eacute;r has not always found it easy to be Sweden's Mr Privatization
at the ministry of industry and commerce. What with swings from left to
right and back again in the Swedish political spectrum, bankers detect there
is a certain hostility to selling off state-owned property. &quot;Swedes
have concerns over privatization. It might inhibit their right to roam through
the forest,&quot; jokes one observer. This is no joking matter, says another,
there are lots of forests in Sweden. Fortunately Tegn&eacute;r has a very
good sense of humour. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization began in 1987 when the government allowed its 100% ownership
of conglomerate Procordia to be diluted. Late in 1989 this company merged
with healthcare leader Pharmacia, bringing the government stake down to
40%. This was a &quot;typical Swedish way of doing it,&quot; says Tegn&eacute;r,
&quot;making bigger, more efficient companies.&quot; The treasury earned
nothing from either transaction. <BR>
<BR>
But this mentality led to conflict - in January 1992, for example, when
Volvo launched a hostile takeover for Procordia to create an even &quot;bigger&quot;
company. Tegn&eacute;r says this was an &quot;enormous adventure&quot; -
because the right-wing government did not approve. In 1993 the company was
split: the government took Pharmacia and successfully floated it. Volvo
got Procordia's other businesses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Rough treatment</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Pharmacia float was the culmination of several IPOs for Tegn&eacute;r.
&quot;I have certainly improved,&quot; he says. &quot;If you believe in
learning by mistakes then I've learnt a lot.&quot; His reference is to Celsius,
an engineering company, which was his debut IPO, and was heavily underpriced.
By the time Pharmacia was done, international methods of bookbuilding were
used. Bankers speak admiringly of Tegn&eacute;r &quot;roughing up&quot;
the Swedish institutions - abolishing their traditional right to cosy preferential
allocations. <BR>
<BR>
According to Tegn&eacute;r, Sweden has Europe's largest concentration of
small shareholders. There are 2.5 million - 30% of the population. There
is also a difference of style: &quot;We don't privatize monopolies, but
good efficient companies.&quot; Examples include a forestry products company
(AssiDoman), and a bank (Nordbanken). Total revenues from privatization
are Skr30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers universally like this opera-loving Swede whose career at the ministry
of industry has spanned 20 years. Bob Boas, SBC Warburg's managing director
of corporate finance, worked closely with him during the merger and acquisitions-style
privatization of Procordia. When not discussing hostile bids they debated
the merits of opera sung in the vernacular and in the original Italian.
&quot;I prefer it in the original, with subtitles&quot; is Tegn&eacute;r's
verdict. Boas, a director of English National Opera, was of the other persuasion.
<BR>
<BR>
Has Sweden reached the end of the privatization road? &quot;That is a highly
political issue,&quot; he says. The right-wingers would like to sell telecoms
company Telia. But this would be an unusual sale by telecoms standards,
since the Swedish market is already deregulated. &quot;We haven't got a
proper valuation yet,&quot; says Tegn&eacute;r. &quot;But it's obviously
a lot of money. Several billion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>David Clementi </H2>
&quot;Privatization veterans like me go back to 1979,&quot; says David Clementi,
chief executive of Kleinwort Benson. He even remembers how the term got
into circulation. &quot;We won the first mandate in 1979 for British Aerospace.
The government announced it had appointed Kleinwort Benson to do its first
'privatization'. We retorted, you don't mean this, you mean 'to take it
public', in reference to the investment banking term 'going public'. But
despite our difficulty with the term, the government would always refer
to it as privatization. After three or four months we just rolled over and
have called it that ever since.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
After the success of the first BT flotation, the big one for Kleinwort,
Clementi's advice was in demand. &quot;I could have spent the whole of 1985
talking to the delegations that came from abroad to find out how the thing
was done.&quot; Between May 1982 and December 1984 he lived BT - &quot;I
think I got close to being a civil servant,&quot; he says. Kleinwort suggested
floating 30% might be wiser than unloading &#163;4 billion of stock at the
one time. &quot;I was told, 'David, in our world, it's not a privatization
unless majority control passes'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It was a period of continuous innovation. Clementi says: &quot;I was in
minister Kenneth Baker's office in 1984. I said, 'We'll need a new concept
here. We need to send out a prospectus ahead of time to have an informed
debate with institutions about price'. I said, 'In America this is called
a red herring'. Baker said, 'That's a very odd term. No what you mean is
someone who lights the way like a pathfinder [sent out to check for mines]
in the second world war'. We said, 'Yes minister, that's what we mean'.
So the term pathfinder prospectus was born.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dream background</B> <BR>
<BR>
Clementi remains active, especially in electricity, a sector where Kleinwort
Benson and he are acknowledged specialists. He led the National Power/PowerGen
secondary offering last year, and Kleinwort is advising the Italian government
on the IPO for state electricity company ENEL. <BR>
<BR>
A keen sailor, Clementi has a &quot;dream background&quot; according to
a former colleague: Oxford followed by an MBA at Harvard and accountancy
qualifications while at Arthur Andersen - he joined Kleinwort in 1975. <BR>
<BR>
Steve Robson, former privatization head at the UK treasury, says: &quot;David
just seems to have been part of the scene so long that I can't remember
when I first met him.&quot; Robson is impressed by Clementi's skills. &quot;In
the early part of 1990 we'd just finished the RECs [regional electricity
companies] which sold at a large premium. We were looking at ways to improve
- David came up with the idea of a back-end tender [the opposite of a green
shoe]. This showed there was a UK house prepared to innovate.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>James Sassoon </H2>
&quot;I don't really have a patch,&quot; says SBC Warburg's director of
privatization, James Sassoon, who these days roams the world. China is a
favourite. &quot;There are particular problems,&quot; he says. &quot;For
example, Yizheng Chemical, which we did. The company owns the town and all
the public services. But how do you tell the management that institutional
investors probably do not want the fire service or the hospital?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Described by a former colleague as meticulous, his first experience of pitching
for a mandate in China was unconventional. The company was Harbin Power
Equipment, one of two leading power station builders, located in what used
to be Manchuria, an hour's flight north of Beijing. &quot;No investment
banker knew anything about it, but it was on a list of 22 companies to be
privatized in the second wave. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It had no accounts and we had no idea of the quality of the management.
The meeting was on Saturday, but as the company was rebuilding its headquarters
we met in an East German-funded training centre nearby. There was no central
heating and everyone was smoking so a window was opened. It was sub-zero
and there was snow on the ground. A colleague made a presentation wearing
a fur hat. I wore a mac and a pair of gloves. The dialogue went on for three
hours.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the end the Warburg team were invited for dinner - what really impressed
the Chinese management team was the Warburgers' declining the polite suggestion
to eat in the Beijing-style restaurant, opting to go native and eat local
Manchurian food. &quot;The chairman even served the food out to us, and
three weeks later we formally won the mandate.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sassoon, whose background is in corporate finance, spent four years leading
Warburg's equity corporate finance team, which meant he was sitting alongside
capital markets. He was one of those involved in introducing bookbuilding
to the UK in the 1991 British Telecom second tranche. <BR>
<BR>
He remembers an ice-hockey match at Broadgate, London, the night the issue
was priced and started trading. &quot;I captained a Warburg team that played
the treasury and its other advisers. I forgot I was supposed to do an interview
with Capital Radio so I had to dash round and do it in my hockey gear. I
remember I was panting furiously as a Bee Gees record was finishing and
I was being cued to speak. I announced to the listeners their shares had
gone up before another record came on. I haven't appeared on Capital since.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Little details</B> <BR>
<BR>
Privatizations are different from other investment banking activities, he
believes. &quot;On privatizations there are more teams of people and the
deals last over a more extended period,&quot; says Sassoon. &quot;This gives
you more time to worry about little details. There was a time when a certain
US joint global coordinator and us were having an argument over ink on a
prospectus. We wanted dark blue used in the regions of the world we ran,
and they wanted it all black.&quot; Neither side trusted the other so both
had junior executives standing by at the printers till 3am to check the
prospectuses through the presses. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<H2>Steve Robson</H2> 
Steve Robson, director of the finance industry and regulation at the UK
treasury - motto: &quot;There is no such thing as a successful privatization.
Privatization is a political process&quot; - came into privatization in
the mid-1980s. He is to privatization what the Godfather is to organized
crime. <BR>
<BR>
But unlike the Godfather he has never refused to see an investment banker:
&quot;You both always get something out of such meetings. They are good
value for both sides.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He is well liked in spite of the fact that he has repeatedly ditched old
practices - such as dispensing with underwriting - in favour of making the
process cheaper for the issuer. And he has almost single-handedly made bookbuilding
the chosen technique for international privatization. Bankers say he knows
the book better than they do. On the second tranche of British Telecom (BT)
in 1991, he didn't go to sleep each night until the bookbuilding data was
delivered to his home, where he would sit in bed reading it. <BR>
<BR>
In the process he has added his own innovations. BT3, for example, was the
first occasion when a global syndicate sold everywhere in the world. A level
playing-field produced an interesting result. &quot;We saw that the banks
that brought in the orders were from the UK. NatWest Securities outsold
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley combined.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But he does not shrink from &quot;banging on tables&quot; when the investment
banking community stonewalls innovative new methods. In such instances &quot;I
get them in a conference room and say 'Look, we, the UK treasury, have looked
very hard at this measure and we think it will work. If you don't want it,
you're not part of the transaction. And remember we're a repeat vendor.'&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate accolade for a bank is to have one of its presentations preserved
in the large grey cabinet in the corner of his tombstone-filled room. Just
below a pair of white gym shoes - for squash and cycling to and from work
- he keeps a small selection of the best he has received - there are fewer
than 20. One was written by Mark Evans, now chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia.
&quot;It was the first one he wrote,&quot; says Robson. &quot;But he was
an Olympic gold medallist for Canada so he knew how to go the extra mile.&quot;
Something Robson admires. <BR>
<BR>
Today he is no longer simply responsible for privatization. His patch has
expanded to comprise regulating the City of London. But he estimates 20%
of his time is still spent on his first love. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Anthony Carlisle </H2>
Some say Dewe Rogerson's Anthony Carlisle invented the retail market for
privatizations on a Friday afternoon in September 1984 by calling the Sunday
newspapers. <BR>
<BR>
Carlisle, the communications agency's executive chairman, smiles: &quot;I
know where that story comes from. We organized a lunch with John Bell, then
city editor of the <I>Sunday Express </I>and Kleinwort Benson. I explained
the structure of the British Telecom offer: the bonus shares, the part payment,
the money off telephone bills, and he produced an article entitled 'British
Telecom to go on super 17% yield'. That article was incredibly important.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Carlisle and Dewe Rogerson have worked on almost every important privatization
since, with a brief to create the impression of success, and so fuel demand.
This means dealing with the press, organizing media campaigns and keeping
the general public informed via mailings. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not complicated,&quot; says Carlisle. But Dewe Rogerson's admirers
say he does the simple things thoroughly and puts the best people on the
job. A rival agency, Brunswick, was initially chosen for the third tranche
of the British Telecom (BT) privatization in 1994, but it was dismissed
in the follow-up campaign six months later and Dewe Rogerson came back.
A banker from Rothschilds says: &quot;Carlisle simply gives good advice
and that's why he gets hired again, and again, and again.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Carte blanche</B> <BR>
<BR>
Carlisle's experience of privatization began in 1981, when Cable &amp; Wireless
was floated - a relatively straightforward operation. BT was much more complex.
For a start it was eight times bigger than any deal that had gone before.
In marketing terms Carlisle was given virtual carte blanche. The UK government's
brief was so slender Carlisle can quote it from memory: &quot;You may be
aware of the government's intention to offer for sale all or part of its
holding in British Telecommunications. The objectives are success and wide
ownership. Would you be interested in putting forward your ideas of how
to achieve these objectives?&quot; Carlisle sought amplification: &quot;'Would
you like to define success?' and they said no. 'Would you like to define
wide ownership?' and they said no. I said 'There's not much point asking
any more questions then', to which they agreed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
BT was hard, and editorial comment was negative. In the event there were
2.4 million retail applications. Carlisle is proudest of one sentence written
when he pitched for the mandate: &quot;The marketing objective is the creation
of a perception of scarcity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Carlisle is credited with inventing the mini-prospectus, coming up with
the idea of a share information office and the mailing of friendly letters
to the public with their BT bills, as well as setting out the overall retail
marketing approach. But, says Carlisle, &quot;I'm reluctant to claim any
of these ideas as mine alone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
His job wasn't made easier by a government which initially considered TV
advertising unsuitable. &quot;This isn't toothpaste, Tony,&quot; he was
told &quot;These are risky financial assets.&quot; Getting his &#163;13
million budget was no foregone conclusion either. &quot;Things like that
always end up in big meetings,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I had three or four
minutes to present the marketing strategy and the budget. The minister,
Kenneth Baker, said 'Tony, as I understand it, you're asking us to spend
more in three months than any marketer has spent in a year. I cannot believe
this is necessary'. To which I replied, 'Minister if you will change your
objectives I will change my advice'.&quot; He got his money. <BR>
<BR>
Dewe Rogerson is still as persuasive. In Europe last year the firm ran all
the major deals, from Repsol to ENI. Coming up? Railtrack in the UK and
what is billed as the BT of the 1990s, Deutsche Telekom. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Giles Henderson </H2>
Giles Henderson of law firm Slaughter &amp; May<B> </B>first became involved
with privatization in 1977 with the sale of British Petroleum (BP), but
made his mark with the British Gas flotation in 1986, pioneering key developments
in global underwriting. He helped the UK government persuade the foreign
underwriters to forgo their normal procedures and instead adopt those applying
to the UK underwriting - achieving the first-ever fully synchronized international
share flotation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When we first put out the proposition to foreigners,&quot; Henderson
says, &quot;the US and Japanese houses thought we weren't serious. Then
we sent them a detailed memorandum explaining the importance to the government
of the changes we wanted. The US bankers continued to be astonished at the
revolutionary changes to the US underwriting practices they were being asked
to make. Ministers, however, said that 'You either make these changes or
we will drop the US tranche'. The changes were agreed. <BR>
<BR>
Once the US houses capitulated, the Japanese and the Canadians followed
suit. This approach was essential with the secondary offering of BP in 1987.
The changes were agreed. &quot;If they hadn't been, all the UK underwriters
could have been liable without any of the US also being liable and the government
would only have achieved a partial sale,&quot; says Henderson. <BR>
<BR>
The fortnight following Black Monday in which the Americans pushed for that
BP issue to be pulled proved to be the most exciting of Henderson's career.
But there were lighter moments amidst the long hours and tension, including
culinary revelations for the treasury mandarins. &quot;The permanent secretary
to the treasury was Sir Peter Middleton [now chairman of BZW]. I remember
a large group of us were in his office, which was rather grand. It was getting
late, and Peter complained that the treasury could sometimes provide drinks
after hours, but no food. My assistant replied, 'If you're really desperate
we can get a pizza'. He replied in amazement, 'What? How can you do that?'
We phoned out for a delivery and elaborate arrangements were made so the
security guards would let the delivery-men through. Then a guard came up,
opened a large box and asked whose was the pepperoni. This delighted Middleton,
who called it the pizza trick.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the height of the electricity privatization, Slaughters had 100 of their
500 lawyers working on what was perhaps the most complicated privatization
ever completed. Henderson was the only lawyer invited to a weekend brainstorming
session with civil servants and government ministers to discuss how it should
be done. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;He's not your typical lawyer,&quot; says Keith Palmer, director of
the natural resources and utility group<B> </B>at Rothschilds. &quot;He
thinks of the questions before you ask him.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>The Rothschild mafia </H2>
Housed in a rather drab 1960s building in St Swithin's Lane in the City
of London, NM Rothschild is the spiritual home of the privatization club.
Those who have worked there have perhaps done more to further the selling
of state enterprises than any others. <BR>
<BR>
Sir Michael Richardson, who is now 70 and at financial boutique Hambro Magan,
was the director of corporate finance who made Rothschild the leaders in
government advisory. &quot;I gave a lunch for Margaret Thatcher in the City
when she was leader of the opposition [before 1979],&quot; he says. &quot;She
said 'I'll privatize'. Everyone's mouths were wide open, but no-one really
knew what she was talking about.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rothschild got its first advisory role when it won the beauty contest for
the flotation of British Gas in 1986. This was no foregone conclusion. John
Guinness, the civil servant chairing the selection, says the feelings towards
Rothschild were not &quot;in the least bit warm&quot;. This was because
18 months earlier Richardson, who was advising RTZ, had bought 49% of the
newly privatized Enterprise Oil for RTZ just as the government announced
its commitment to wider share ownership via privatization. The government
made RTZ scale back its holding. But the quality of the team Richardson
took to the beauty contest persuaded the department of energy to award Rothschild
the mandate. <BR>
<BR>
The fees were low, but there were greater things at stake. &quot;Richardson
was dead right to take low fees on Gas,&quot; says Guinness. &quot;Some
of his Young Turks thought Rothschild had been conned by the government.
But it made Rothschild probably the predominant privatization adviser worldwide.&quot;
<BR>
Simon Linnett and Tony Alt were the most promising of the young men at Rothschild.
Linnett is described as a &quot;one-man merchant bank&quot;, an extremely
creative mind with a mathematics degree. UK treasury civil servant Steve
Robson says you can discuss an idea with Linnett in the evening, and find
a crisp five-page brief on your desk the next morning at 8am. <BR>
<BR>
Tony Alt, who is cricket-mad, is the dealmaker. A &quot;75-cigarettes-a-minute
man&quot;, he never dallies - &quot;Come on...I've got 30 seconds...I've
got to play squash&quot;, is one impersonation of him <I>Euromoney</I> heard.
<BR>
<BR>
Richardson was the leader and elder statesman. He was good at finding first-class
talent like Linnett and Alt, ensuring they were treated well, sharing the
credit for successes, and fusing the different styles. A typical meeting
might involve Richardson leading off, Alt saying &quot;Michael, that's rubbish&quot;
and Linnett kicking Alt under the table. <BR>
<BR>
Rothschild now has advisory roles worldwide. It offers specialized sectoral
cover. Keith Palmer, director of the natural resources and utilities unit,
focuses on oil and gas projects. He has been with the firm for 11 years,
having previously worked in Papua New Guinea, at the World Bank and at the
IMF, never staying in a job for more than two and a half years. <BR>
<BR>
Another Rothschild star is Oliver Letwin an expert on telecoms privatizations.
He was brought into the firm with John Redwood (see main article) from Margaret
Thatcher's Number 10 Policy Unit. The idea was that both he and Redwood
would get elected to parliament as Conservative MPs, but Letwin fought a
near-impossible seat in 1987, and was then beaten in Hampstead by actress
Glenda Jackson. At the next election he is standing for West Dorset. <BR>
<BR>
Rothschild privatizers have to grapple with unexpected challenges. For example,
during the three years it took to privatize the Hungarian gas industry,
Rothschild faced a change of government, seven changes of sponsoring ministry,
and six chief executives. The trick was to persuade people to do something
before they lost their jobs <BR>
<BR>
Letwin remembers a gas project in an emerging market. Rothschild asked the
minister/regulator about the 50% discrepancy between gas going into the
pipeline and the amount delivered. &quot;We were pretty certain it wasn't
our modelling,&quot; Letwin says. &quot;It's a matter of men and machinery,&quot;
the minister explained. At dead of night, villagers would emerge from their
houses with blow-torches, make a hole in the pipe and construct their own
pipeline to their homes. &quot;This,&quot; he concluded, &quot;had led to
a large rural outflow of gas.&quot; - <B><I>SI </I></B><p>

<H3>FROM THE EDITOR</H3> 
<H2>Nobody's perfect</H2>
<H3></H3>
A troubled west should not look to the east for utopias. every model has
its own virtues and problems<BR>
The debate about what east and west can learn from one another lives on:
as the World Economic Forum meets again in Singapore this September for
its annual Europe/East Asia summit, it is worth exploring how that debate
might move forward into new areas. <BR>
<BR>
Discussion to date has centred on worries in the west about the growing
challenge to its economic supremacy from the high-growth east. This is highlighted
by studies such as the annual <I>World Competitiveness Report</I>, released
on September 6 and summarised here, whose latest rankings show Singapore
and Hong Kong maintaining a close second and third place to the US. The
results of such dynamism, the emergence of regional Asian corporate powers
in their own right, feature in the cover story. <BR>
<BR>
On a popular level the debate is often presented as a contest for investment
and jobs, with politicians fanning the fears of marginal people who fear
globalisation of the world economy, a process described in this issue by
Harvard management professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter. <BR>
<BR>
Another, more cultural, line of argument revolves around the comparison
between those now much-cited Asian values such as hard work, obedience and
strong family networks and the signs of western social breakdown. Western
fascination with the issue comes mixed with a nagging awareness that the
world is not reduceable to economic rules and contracts. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, when it comes to emerging markets this debate is often posed
in terms of a choice between economic and political reform, as if liberalism
in the second harms liberalism in the first. This is particularly true when
some investors and analysts, justifying their interest in an economically
booming but politically repressed China, use it as a stick to beat the less
successful Russia where political glasnost came before economic perestroika.
Not only is this evidence of an unedifying double standard about what other
cultures are entitled to expect, in the long run it is not really true.
<BR>
<BR>
As Gerald Segal describes in his panoramic analysis of China's hastening
devolution of power, things there have reached the point where further economic
progress is now dependant on political flexibility. This viewpoint is supported
by Jeffrey Sachs' argument that cross-country studies such as the competitiveness
report show what a difference is made to performance by the right policies,
including openness and the rule of law. After all, as Charles Darwent finds
in Cuba, the one thing besides Washington's compulsive opposition which
puts off investors is a lack of clarity about the rules of the game, created
in that case by a government still torn about the benefits of the policies
recommended above. <BR>
<BR>
If Beijing continues to give up its centralised economic power but at the
same time holds on to an unaccountable political system it could lead to
the worst of all worlds: all the stifling disadvantages of centralised control
and arbitrary power without the advantages of order. At worst it could end
up with an eastern version of the former Yugoslavia, where eight regional
replicas of the single-party state helped lay the basis for the conflicts
which followed. <BR>
<BR>
Another reason for flexibility is given by Francis Fukuyama who argues in
his latest book <I>Trust</I>, reviewed in this issue, that the rule of law
is a crucial ingredient for development of that crucial middle layer of
civil society, between family and state, which nurtures large and durable
companies. Japan is a good example of Asian success cooked to this recipe
but, as Kevin Rafferty shows, once-good practices are in danger of being
set in bureaucratic concrete. <BR>
<BR>
The lesson is that a troubled west should not look to the east for utopias.
Face up to your own problems and learn from others but remember, nobody's
perfect.<BR>

<H3>INTERVIEW</H3>




<H3> <B>Edson Mitchell's game plan</B> </H3> 

<H4> <B>Edson Mitchell's bold
attempt to turn Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) into a world-beating bond house
has made headlines in the past year. He has employed about 500 new staff &#173;
including many from his old firm, Merrill Lynch &#173; in little more than 12
months. But until now Mitchell has shied away from talking publicly about his
plans. Here, for the first time, he reveals what his aims are &#173; and how he's
going about achieving them. Mitchell spoke to Garry Evans</B> </H4> 

<P> <B>Why
did you leave Merrill Lynch?</B>

<P> The firm was asking me to take responsibility for equities. I was beginning
to think a bit about what I really wanted to do over the rest of my career in
investment banking.

<P> <B>You must have had a shot at becoming chairman of Merrill. Didn't you give
up a lot by leaving?</B>

<P> No. I made the move for reasons I'm very comfortable with. I'd rather not
speculate about what could have been. I very much enjoyed my years at Merrill;
it's a great firm. But I am happy to have made the move.

<P> <B>What was your perception of Deutsche Bank?</B>

<P> That it had tremendous potential with the combination of Morgan Grenfell's
culture and entrepreneurial spirit and Deutsche's global customer reach,
reputation and balance sheet. I thought that was a really powerful combination.
It represented one of the few remaining institutions that could aspire to be a
world-class investment bank.

<P> <B>But wasn't one yet?</B>

<P> Exactly. Deutsche or Morgan Grenfell were not institutions I had run into
much as a competitor. Of course, Deutsche Bank was active in global bonds, but I
really had not come across them in swaps or structured private placements or any
of the other businesses I was responsible for at Merrill Lynch.

<P> <B>Why did you take the job?</B>

<P> I was impressed with all the people I met, Mike Dobson [chief executive of
DMG] in particular. He was the person I would be reporting to. This seemed to be
a very exciting platform with people who appeared committed, and an institution
that had global reach and the resources to be successful. So it was the lure of
building a business with a very interesting starting-point. It wasn't as though
there was nothing here to start with. But the pieces were not working together as
well as I, and the bank itself, thought they could.

<P> <B>You made your mind up to move in a very short time &#173; less than two
weeks.</B>

<P> The process happened very quickly. Merrill wanted to announce at an upcoming
board meeting that, as part of a whole series of management changes, I would be
taking over equities. I was not comfortable with that if there might be an
alternative I wanted to pursue. That accelerated the process.

<P> <B>When was your first day at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell?</B>

<P> I took a week off, and then started. It was May 1 last year.

<P> <B>What did you do first?</B>

<P> I met the DMG people, and the Deutsche Bank people in Leadenhall Street. Then
I went to Germany and spent time with people there. I travelled to the US, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore and the main places where we had offices.

<P> <B>The idea was to go around and see everyone?</B>

<P> I wanted to see what we had. There were some things that needed doing
immediately. We had no global head of sales, for example. We had nobody running
capital markets in the US. There were some other obvious spots that needed
filling. So I immediately went into recruiting mode .

<P> <B>Who did you hire first?</B>

<P> Michael Phillip [from Merrill to head fixed-income sales], and then Anshu
Jain to run relative-value sales. We didn't have that position filled either. We
also recruited Grant Kvalheim [from Merrill] to run capital markets.

<P> <B>That all happened quickly?</B>

<P> In the space of two to three weeks.

<P> <B>You already had your eye on these people?</B>

<P> I had no discussions with anyone before I left Merrill. All these
conversations took place after I joined. But I had worked with these people for a
long time. Grant had come over from JP Morgan to work with me at Merrill in
building capital markets. He's one of the best capital markets people in the
world. I'd known Michael [Phillip] for a long time too. He came to Merrill from
Goldman Sachs. Then I hired Rob Stein [from Merrill] for Japan. We didn't have
anybody running Japan, which is a critical position. He had worked with me for 12
years either in London or in Asia.

<P> Then David Campbell came from JP Morgan to run fixed-income trading in
London. That position had been vacant for more than 18 months. It was critical to
bring in some leadership on the trading side in London, where the firm had been
struggling for several years. We also recruited a number of other key people from
different firms.

<P> <B>It sounds as though the business had been allowed to run down.</B>

<P> Some of the businesses had &#173; but certainly not all of them. There was
never really a sales culture at Deutsche, it was very focused on trading. I don't
think there was <I>ever</I> a global head of sales, even though every investment
bank has one. The US operation was run as a separate North American entity rather
than as part of capital markets.

<P> <B>Who came next?</B>

<P> They were quickly followed by Colin Grassie [from JP Morgan] as head of sales
in Asia, and Paul Spillane [from Goldman]. Paul came in to run sales in the US.
Both have worked out spectacularly well.

<P> <B>Is it true Spillane gave up a Goldman partnership to take that job?</B>

<P> I have heard that.

<P> <B>The market believes you paid way over market rates to hire all these
people.</B>

<P> Not at all. We were able to bring many of the early people in at compensation
that was either flat to what they were making, or for just a small premium. In
some cases, though, we had to compensate the people for loss from restricted
stock or long-term incentive programmes.

<P> Remember, it is a lot easier for a competitor to say a high-quality employee
left because of compensation, rather than because the opportunity at DMG was more
exciting. If you look at our cost structure &#173; which I do a lot &#173; it is
remarkably lean for the size and scope of our operation. It compares very
favourably to all our major competitors.

<P> <B>But isn't that just because you have more of your employees in Europe,
where pay is less, than your US competitors?</B>

<P> That explains some of the difference, but not all. Compensation levels in
Europe are rapidly catching up with the US anyhow. We benefit from a very lean
hierarchy. Many of our top managers still cover clients. I am also fortunate that
many of the key people I hired early on are persuasive recruiters. That has
helped us significantly. It has been a point of pride among these guys that we do
not have to pay a risk premium.

<P> There have been cases where people have gotten significant increases because
they are coming into a more senior job than at their previous firm. But I can
give you dozens of cases &#173; including cases from some of those firms that
have criticized us &#173; where firms have matched or exceeded the compensation
we offered in an attempt to keep people. In addition, we have lost people to the
competition for levels we were not prepared to pay.

<P> <B>Have you guaranteed bonuses for two years, as competitors claim?</B>

<P> Very rarely.

<P> <B>How rarely?</B>

<P> There have been some cases where the second year has a floor significantly
lower &#173; 40% or 50% lower &#173; than the first-year guarantee. But, even if
you count those cases, the number of two-year guarantees is certainly less than
25%. I have never gone beyond two years. In May 1995, some of the people came in
with two years, but since the start of 1996 I have been able pretty much to limit
it to one year.

<P> <B>If you have a substantial percentage of staff with one- or two-year
guarantees, isn't there a risk they'll leave once the guarantee period ends?</B>

<P> Every firm faces that problem, since this is an industry with mobile people.
But if you look at all our key people, including the people already at DMG and
Deutsche Bank, their history has been to stay at firms for long periods of time.
I am very sanguine that these people all feel there's a lot to accomplish, and
want to be part of it. There are many things I worry about, but that's not one of
them.

<P> <B>The people you hired are mostly paid better than existing staff. How much
of a problem was that?</B>

<P> It was an issue, clearly. It's a natural human reaction to feel a bit upset
with different compensation levels, but many of the existing staff saw this as an
opportunity to be part of a global investment bank paying competitively.

<P> <B>So you had to raise a lot of people's compensation?</B>

<P> Some went up, some actually went down. At the same time, overall compensation
levels across Europe and in Germany have been under upward pressure. The comp
level would have had to rise with the market, regardless of whether the
investment bank was formed in the way it was and whether I came here or not.

<P> <B>How many people have you hired altogether? I've heard 200.</B>

<P> No, the number is closer to 500. And we have had quite a few people leave:
our net increase in head count is only about 10%. But the hiring is 90% done now,
and we're turning our energy to graduate recruiting.

<P> <B>Did you plan from day one to hire as many as 500 people? </B>

<P> We knew we needed substantial resources. I came up with a head-count budget
in the late summer of last year. We have stuck to that strictly. After two or
three months we had a good sense of what was needed in stage one.

<P> <B>When you interviewed people for jobs, what did you look for?</B>

<P> We wanted people who were still enthusiastic about the business, highly
motivated, and who looked at this as a long-term commitment. Most of the people
we hired had been with their firms for a long time. David Campbell was 13 years
with JP Morgan, Rob Stein 12 years at Merrill and Paul Jacobson [head of fixed
income in New York] spent almost his entire career at Goldman Sachs. In our group
there are very few capital market butterflies flitting from flower to flower.

<P> <B>You've hired more than 50 from Merrill Lynch. Aren't you just trying to
create another Merrill?</B>

<P> You've got to remember that Merrill is number one in market share in many of
the areas we wanted to build in. The fact so many people came from Merrill should
not be a surprise. But I've got more people reporting to me who didn't come from
Merrill than those that did.

<P> We are not trying to create another Merrill. Merrill has unique strengths and
challenges that do not necessarily mirror ours. This is a different institution.
The environment is different, and the strategy we're pursuing is different to
that pursued by Merrill in building its fixed-income operation in the 1980s.

<P> <B>What from the Merrill model would you want to improve on? </B>

<P> No, I'm not going to go down that path. Merrill is a very good firm. But
there are things we can learn from all our competitors. We are not trying to
mimic any other firm, we're trying to come up with a strategy that fits our
institution.

<P> <B>Did you expect to lose as many as 200 people?</B>

<P> It is certainly higher than I expected, and some of the people we would have
preferred to stay. But with this amount of change, it was inevitable. Some of
these people had joined a very different organization. For example, in New York
the aspirations of the fixed-income group were very different two years ago. Now
we want to be, and will be, a significant player. We're in the top 10 in the US
league table &#173; but a year ago we were number 40.

<P> <B>There were a lot of mediocre people?</B>

<P> There was mediocrity in some places. But there were also many areas of
excellence &#173; for example, European syndicate. Deutsche has traditionally
been strong in this area, with Walter Henniges in London and Roman Schmidt in
Frankfurt.

<P> <B>After you'd been here six weeks and travelled around, did you sit down
then and write a strategy paper saying what you wanted to do?</B>

<P> Yes, we put a strategy together and said: here are our overall objectives,
here's the strategy we want to pursue, here are the short-term tactics, here's
what resources are needed, here's the return we think can be produced, and here's
how it fits in with what DMG as a whole is doing. This was then presented to our
colleagues in London and Frankfurt.

<P> <B>What was the main strategy?</B>

<P> One of the key planks was to act quickly. We felt there was a window of
opportunity that would close, and that we needed to act fast to get up to
critical mass in these key areas as quickly as possible.

<P> <B>Why would the window of opportunity close?</B>

<P> In early 1995 many of our competitors were in a state of disequilibrium, but
we believed that would end &#173; which it has to some extent. We thought that
clients around the world were looking for another strong global markets firm,
because many of our competitors were pulling capital out of client business and
shifting it into proprietary trading. We knew there were a number of good people
available who I thought we could get excited about our vision. But would it sound
as exciting in a year or two?

<P> So the strategy developed was: "Act quickly, get critical mass, fill product
and geographic gaps, and develop a sales culture." Developing that sales culture
was key, not only for us in global markets but for the investment bank as a
whole. We were relying too much on proprietary trading. Now we place a lot more
importance on sales.

<P> <B>But isn't the trend for banks to shift towards proprietary trading and
away from sales?</B>

<P> That is why we thought clients were anxious to have a firm focused on client
business. Look at our competitive advantages: a huge number of clients, global
reach &#173; we have branches all over the world &#173; good research, strong
balance-sheet, triple-A rating. With those ingredients, client business is a
natural. The quality of earnings should be better too.

<P> <B>That sounds very like Merrill Lynch's approach. </B>

<P> Look, in and of itself, there's nothing particularly virtuous about being
client-driven. If we felt we could improve shareholder value by being a
proprietary firm, that is what we'd have recommended. But we thought that, for
DMG, the best approach was to be customer-focused, with 80% of revenues from
customers, and 20% from proprietary. We're not saying no proprietary trading,
because that's a way to stay in pace with some of our most sophisticated clients.
But we don't want it to dominate: it should be the turbo-charger on the engine,
not the engine itself.

<P> <B>The choice must have been made easier because Deutsche had such a terrible
year in proprietary trading in 1994.</B>

<P> It <I>had </I>been a bad year but, even if it hadn't, the decision would have
been the same. But 1994 was further confirmation of how poor quality of earnings
in proprietary trading can be.

<P> <B>Deutsche Bank's management structure was very geographically based. You
wanted to change that?</B>

<P> The bank had already made the decision to change to a more global approach.
Bringing me in was one of the results of that decision.

<P> <B>Before, capital markets in London and New York were run separately?</B>

<P> Yes. There was some interaction, but not a lot. The swaps group did their
government hedges with competitors rather than deal with our government desk. Our
private placement group would do swaps with competitors &#173; and nobody was
particularly upset about it. That was ended very quickly.

<P> <B>Deutsche Bank was always said to be riddled with fiefdoms. Did you find
that?</B>

<P> To some extent, but it was not as pervasive as some people said. The way the
bank had evolved was very much geographic, which was true of most commercial
banks. When the markets were compartmentalized &#173; when the Deutschmark was
basically a domestic German product, for example &#173; a geographic set-up was
logical. But as markets became globalized, and international investors made up a
bigger part of the Deutschmark market, the structural flaws became more evident.
Deutsche Bank recognized this.

<P> <B>But Deutsche was a leading arranger of global bonds. That must have
involved co-ordination.</B>

<P> Some things were working very well &#173; syndicate was probably the most
global of the functions. But, even in the new issues business, Deutsche had
traditionally done a wonderful job covering sovereigns and supranationals, but
was not as strong with corporate issuers as it wanted to be.

<P> <B>Why not?</B>

<P> A variety of historical reasons. The salesforce was used to selling triple-A
and sovereign credits. The bank lacked a strong capital markets group in the US
where a lot of big corporates are. There was a lack of co-ordination between
capital markets and the derivatives group.

<P> <B>Deutsche was also over-dependent on Deutschmark products.</B>

<P> Yes. It wasn't a major player in dollars and it had no yen capability at all.
In some markets, such as Swiss francs, it wasn't where it should be. Merrill got
to be number four in Swiss francs. That should have been a natural, and will be a
natural, for Deutsche. For Merrill to be ahead of Deutsche Bank in Swiss francs
seems a bit peculiar.

<P> <B>Which areas of new issues do you want to be in?</B>

<P> We want to be a leading player in any new issue market that matters.

<P> <B>In any currency?</B>

<P> In any currency that matters. And we will be. Of that I have absolutely no
doubt.

<P> <B>What's your goal?</B>

<P> We want to be a top-three player within three to five years, as measured by
market share, profitability and reputation.

<P> <B>Including profitability? Rumours have it that your mandate is only to
break even for a couple of years...</B>

<P> That's rubbish. We were quite profitable last year. We hope to double it this
year. Deutsche Bank's annual report singled out the improvement in trading income
in 1995 compared to 1994. We've gone from a poor performance in global markets in
1994, to solid profitability in 1995 and significantly higher profitability in
1996.

<P> This is pay as you go. We're not saying, "Give us two years. We're going to
re-tool this and then go back into the race." We're doing this while we're
building relationships with clients and generating revenue. That presents a whole
set of challenges.

<P> <B>You've got 90% of the people in place now. Is that beginning to pay
off?</B>

<P> I would say we are 30% or 40% of where we want to be. It will take another
couple of years to get there. Now that we have hired most of the key people,
stage two is to focus on businesses we are not in but we should be: high-yield in
the US, for example.

<P> <B>What evidence is there your strategy is working?</B>

<P> I'll give you an example. Our salesforce is much stronger now. For example,
we outsold Merrill Lynch on the $1 billion Fannie Mae dollar global in January.
Merrill outsold us in the US but not dramatically; we outsold them in Europe, by
about the same amount as they outsold us in the US; and we outsold them in Asia.
I think we've got the best distribution force now of any firm in Europe. Our
objective is to be as strong in the US as our American competitors are in Europe.

<P> <B>Any other examples?</B>

<P> Foreign exchange. The poll <I>Euromoney</I> did last year showed us at number
23. This year we're number 9, and next year I think we'll be higher than that. A
recent survey in <I>Corporate Finance</I> magazine showed us at number four among
corporates.

<P> Another example is Italy. We are now number one by market share in Italian
government bonds.

<P> <B>Let's look at it business by business. First, derivatives. Deutsche Bank
was always dismal in derivatives. </B>

<P> That's a bit harsh, but it's true we weren't top-tier. Saman Majd came from
Salomon to run the derivatives group. He's a good manager and a very competent
businessman. He has made a tremendous difference. The quality of our research is
much better, earnings are significantly higher than they were, and the group is
well integrated with the rest of the business.

<P> <B>Which derivatives businesses do you want to be in?</B>

<P> All the key geographic areas and all the key businesses. We can not be a
boutique. We're just getting involved in credit derivatives. In emerging markets
derivatives, we've done some, but we're not nearly where we should be. We want to
be able to price and hedge any type of transaction, any type of risk our clients
want either to assume or avoid.

<P> <B>Again, that will be a client sales approach?</B>

<P> Yes. To use an analogy, we want to be the doctor not the pharmacist. We've
made good progress. I think you'll see us going up the polls in derivatives. And
we've protected our franchise in Germany where we had come under pressure. The
competition in Germany has gotten tougher. Many of the German banks are staffed
with ex-Deutsche people, and the American banks have moved aggressively into
Germany.

<P> <B>Next, MTNs. Deutsche was never strong there either.</B>

<P> We're not where we should be, and we'll correct this. We didn't even have an
MTN trader here, just one person originating. I'm changing that and getting our
processes to work better. Results have been encouraging.

<P> <B>You'll have a dedicated MTN desk?</B>

<P> Yes.

<P> <B>You're still recruiting for that?</B>

<P> That's part of the 10% we have remaining. We know we're not where we should
be &#173; our clients are telling us that. We've been very successful getting on
programmes, particularly European programmes, but not as successful at
delivering.

<P> But I've got to tell you this. An official from one of the big supranationals
called me recently. He had been complaining a month before about our MTN
execution. Our share of deals off his programme had been dropping. I told him it
would improve as our Japanese placement started to click in. He called the other
day to say he'd noticed a tremendous improvement in our structured note
placement. It was good to hear that.

<P> We're probably in the top eight globally in terms of placement off MTN
programmes. But we are not content to be there.

<P> <B>How are you doing in the US?</B>

<P> Our basic premise is that, for a firm to be successful globally, it's got to
have a strong presence in the US. And we've made very good progress there. Carter
McClelland, the CEO of DMG North America, has been a big help.

<P> <B>You've won some deals in the US &#173; but not many yet.</B>

<P> We're doing some agency deals, and a few yankees. It takes longer to win
corporate business. Last week I met with one of the big corporate issuers, and
the CFO said: "You guys are doing a great job. You're covering us well, you're
doing all the right things, including debt buy-backs and showing us smart ideas.
But you'll have to continue doing this for several more months before you even
have a chance at a mandate." Nonetheless, we should be in the top 10 this year in
the US league table.

<P> <B>Up until now New York's been a black hole for European banks. Why have
they all failed?</B>

<P> Wrong people, wrong strategy, wrong structure.

<P> <B>Why did they go wrong?</B>

<P> Who knows. But I'll tell you what you have to do to make it work: the firm
has got to be global. Bringing a global perspective to areas such as
distribution, trading ideas, and swaps is vital. And having first-rate people. In
the end it comes down to the people who are talking to clients. Do they have good
ideas? Are they helping the portfolio manager or the treasurer do his job better?

<P> <B>The target is to be in the top 10 in the US?</B>

<P> Top 10 in new issues. We feel we can be better than that in other businesses.
We think we can be in the top seven or eight in US treasuries, top three or four
in FX, top five in derivatives, top five in money market and repos &#173; and
reasonably quickly. The toughest business is the most visible: the league-table
business. And many of our US competitors have had a good year and are prepared to
spend money to maintain market share.

<P> <B>Isn't the public new issues business old hat?</B>

<P> No, it's important.

<P> <B>But it doesn't make much money.</B>

<P> No, it doesn't. But it's integrally connected to lots of other pieces:
secondary trading, derivatives, MTNs. Our view is that market share <I>does</I>
matter. I'll say that when we're not number one, so it's more credible when we do
become number one.

<P> <B>What is stage two of your strategy?</B>

<P> There are probably four or five areas we need to fill in. That's
significantly fewer than a year ago, and it becomes easier to fill in when you
have critical mass. It won't involve adding so many people, just a few here and
there. We're at the point now where we can start to leverage our existing
resources. The incremental value of adding another salesman is much higher now.

<P> A priority is to leverage the bank's relationships better. For example, when
we do an equity trade now, we ask for the FX business too. In the past we never
did. We have set up a cross-products group that just promotes business with other
parts of the bank.

<P> <B>What does it do?</B>

<P> For example, they go to the M&amp;A bankers and say: "We know you're thinking
about an M&amp;A deal. Maybe we can do a hedge for you." They do the same with
project finance. A lot of it is just educating other departments. Meeting with
associates and saying: "Be alert to this; bring us in, we'll help with your
clients." It's been an unmitigated success. We want to expand it, and the next
step is to find better links with the commercial bankers. Some of that's already
happening on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis, but we want to make it more systematic. The
commercial bank has wonderful relationships around the world. We want to make
sure we're leveraging them as much as possible.

<P> <B>This doesn't happen already? </B>

<P> It was hard when we didn't have the product capability. For example, a year
ago we had no ratings advisory capability. If one of our clients was concerned
Moody's was going to drop their rating, they had to go to JP Morgan or Goldman.
Now we can offer them a very high-quality service.

<P> <B>How do you create a culture at DMG when you've hired so many staff from so
many firms so quickly?</B>

<P> A precondition to a culture is some degree of success. We first have to
produce a winning team. That is true throughout the investment bank.

<P> In terms of blending people together, we took a great deal of care whom we
brought in. While they come from a variety of firms, there are common
denominators. Everybody we brought in was already well known by a number of
people here. Many had worked with me or with other people I'd hired.

<P> <B>What are the strengths of the old Deutsche you'd want to incorporate?</B>

<P> The reputation for long-term relationships, consistency, solidity, the pride
that a lot of people had in working as part of Deutsche. Those are all things we
want to retain.

<P> <B>What sort of culture would you like to see evolve here?</B>

<P> Throughout the investment bank, we want high-quality people, working in a
global environment. We want a good balance in how we approach the business, not
having sales dominate trading, or trading dominate sales. A sense of humour is
important &#173; taking our jobs and responsibilities seriously, but not taking
ourselves overly seriously. We're trying to balance the importance of the
individual with the need to work within a team.

<P> <B>What are you doing to get these people to work together?</B>

<P> In global markets we've arranged a number of off-sites. Mike Dobson has done
the same for the whole investment bank. They are a big part of pulling things
together. In global markets, we met in Spain for three days in June. Next will be
in Hong Kong in October.

<P> <B>Who goes?</B>

<P> The top 100 or so people in global markets &#173; basically all my direct
reports and the people that report to them. I try to rotate too. Say we have a
new vice-president in our Frankfurt syndicate, we'll bring that person along. We
also invite senior members of the Deutsche group management. It's been
extraordinarily helpful, particularly as we go through a period of rapid change.

<P> <B>The point is to let people know what other parts of the group are
doing?</B>

<P> Exactly. We also leave time for people to get together. We mix people around
at dinner, and set up a time when nothing is scheduled &#173; where people can
just get together and have informal discussions. A fair amount of time is spent
preparing for these off-sites. People are expected to have good-quality
presentations. There is peer pressure on them to do that.

<P> <B>What other methods do you use to get your people to communicate?</B>

<P> It's quite remarkable how quickly people can make connections if they're
working on transactions together or recruiting. People across groups within
global markets are beginning to play athletic events with each other in their
off-hours. They've set up a cricket team here in London &#173; not that I'm a
member [laughs]. Things like that are quite helpful in getting people to know
each other.

<P> <B>Handling relations with Frankfurt must be tricky. Don't people there
resent you?</B>

<P> Nobody has said that directly, but I imagine there is some resentment. It has
helped that a lot of the senior people in the investment bank in Germany have
been advocating change too. While there is general support for the changes we've
made, it's also important for all the new people to remember that Deutsche has
been a successful institution for a long time. I think most people in Germany
feel that, on balance, we're heading in the right direction.

<P> <B>Do you go to Frankfurt much?</B>

<P> Virtually every week that I'm in Europe, I try to spend a day or two in
Frankfurt. Germany is our home market. We have tremendous strengths and excellent
customer relationships there. I try to spend some time internally as well as time
with clients.

<P> <B>The management style at German banks is very conservative and
consensus-driven. You like to take decisions fast and show leadership. Don't you
find that gap hard to manage?</B>

<P> Those stereotypes are exaggerated &#173; both Deutsche Bank's management
style and mine. Deutsche is an institution that's been going through a tremendous
amount of change. I've found senior management very willing to embrace change as
long as they felt it well thought out and consistent with the overall objectives
of the group. That's been much less of a problem than many people predicted.

<P> <B>Who do you talk to most at Deutsche in Frankfurt?</B>

<P> The investment banking board, which I am now part of, includes Dr [Ronaldo]
Schmitz, Dr [Rolf] Breuer, and Mike Dobson &#173; so I talk to them a lot. I also
have a lot of interaction with Dr [Ulrich] Cartellieri, who is responsible for
risk management and Asia. Dr [J&uuml;rgen] Krumnow is responsible for internal
controls, and so there's interaction there, and with Dr [Michael] Endres, who is
in charge of operations and technology.

<P> <B>Do you talk directly to them, or do you go via Michael Dobson?</B>

<P> Mike is my prime vehicle, but also he encourages direct access.

<P> <B>You seem to have a good relationship with Dobson. But you're such
different people. He's cautious, carefully-spoken and slightly shy. I find it
hard to imagine how you get on.</B>

<P> Our backgrounds and personalities are quite a bit different, that's true. I
don't know what to say, except that he's one of the people who most impressed me
in the process of thinking about joining this firm, and he's somebody I very much
enjoy working with.

<P> <B>Does he interfere a lot? </B>

<P> He's very interested in the overall objectives, allocation of resources, and
integrating with the rest of the investment bank. And he's very involved in
measuring performance against those objectives. But he also delegates well.

<P> <B>How do you see your role?</B>

<P> It's working with the management of global markets, setting the objectives,
deciding strategy, making sure we have the right people in the right spots,
thinking how to allocate resources &#173; whether they are risk resources,
balance-sheet resources or people resources &#173; and making sure the groups are
working together well. Recruiting has been a big part of it up until now. In
addition, I also play a role, as a member of the board of the investment bank, in
helping plan the overall strategy.

<P> <B>Of the 500 people the firm has recruited, what percentage did you
interview?</B>

<P> A large percentage. I couldn't give you the exact number, but virtually all
the senior people, vice-president and above.

<P> <B>It sounds as though your role is mainly internal.</B>

<P> No, I do quite a bit of client work too. I'm anxious to do more since it's
something I enjoy. Over time the balance will shift towards external from
internal. That's happening already. During the past six months I've done much
more client work than in the first six months.

<P> <B>People say you're working far harder than you did at Merrill.</B>

<P> I thought I worked pretty hard at Merrill.

<P> <B>Let's talk about your style of management. People say you're good at
wandering round and remembering people's names.</B>

<P> It's important to know the people who are generating the revenue, and to
understand what they're doing, what their problems are, and to let them know you
are interested. That is important in terms of deciding how to allocate resources,
as well as understanding what clients we should be focusing on.

<P> But I like to have strong managers underneath me and to delegate a reasonable
amount of responsibility to them.

<P> <B>How have you structured the management? For example, do you have an
executive committee?</B>

<P> We've been experimenting with several structures, but really haven't come up
with the structure we are going to go with. I set up a management committee. We
try to get together by telephone every couple of weeks or so.

<P> <B>How many people are on this committee?</B>

<P> Probably 10.

<P> <B>It's a conference call?</B>

<P> That's because they are all over the world: Rob Stein in Tokyo, Hal Herron in
Australia, Detlev Bindert in Frankfurt and so forth. That has not worked so well,
so I'm still experimenting. I want a forum where we can share information and
discuss common problems, but at the same time I do not want these people tied up
in endless telephone conferences and meetings.

<P> <B>A long-time Deutsche employee in London told me the biggest change is
that, before, he would not hear from his bosses from one week to the next. Now he
gets two phone calls from you a day, two from Grant Kvalheim...</B>

<P> I'm interested in knowing what's going on, and Grant is as well. Yes, my
style is to be very close to the dynamics of the business, what we are doing and
what we are not doing. But I do not believe in micro-managing, and I make sure
the business heads feel they are accountable for running their businesses. I hope
they don't view my style as micro-managing. If they did, I hope they would tell
me.

<P> <B>People say you prefer to build an operation, rather than run one. Is that
true?</B>

<P> I plead guilty. Yes, I much prefer to build.

<P> <B>Merrill people say of you &#173; and you've admitted yourself &#173; that
you were an empire-builder. You always felt you could run other departments
better than the people actually running them.</B>

<P> That was a misquote. I never said I was an empire-builder, and I'm not. I
like building, but that's different. If I feel I can add value in a particular
area, then I'm anxious to be involved, but only to the extent people want me to
be.

<P> <B>Your goal is to be in the top three in capital markets worldwide within
five years. How do you rate your chances?</B>

<P> Do you want odds? It's very hard to predict. We're battling against highly
motivated, high-quality, very competitive firms that have been developing their
capabilities, in some cases, for decades.

<P> <B>And other firms are coming up, starting from the same position as you.</B>

<P> Yes. So it will be a fascinating period. I would just say that I like our
chances.

<P> <B>Would it derail your plans if the markets turned down?</B>

<P> What we're trying to do, in reducing our reliance on proprietary trading, is
to build a franchise that's not overly dependent on market conditions. When we do
our budgeting, we don't make assumptions in terms of interest rates. Obviously,
when markets are up, there's generally more issuance and more activity. But our
approach is to try to build a business that's market-neutral.

<P> <B>Do you worry about running up more costs than you can cover with
revenues?</B>

<P> I believe we have been very careful. I'm very confident that, if we give our
people the right support and the right infrastructure, they will be successful.
We spend a lot of time thinking about what cost structure makes
sense.&#009;&#009;*

<H2> <B>Mitchell on markets</B> </H2> <P> <B>How will financial markets change in
the next five or 10 years?</B>

<P> The distinction between markets will blur: the distinction between the
private placement market and the public market; or between listed and
over-the-counter derivatives; or the blurring of distinctions between European
currencies to the extent that EMU develops. The implications for the
organizational structure of investment banks are significant. The nice,
convenient boxes that made sense in the past no longer do so. We have to be much
more flexible in our organizational structure, much more project-oriented, more
taskforce-team oriented &#173; as opposed to having a rigid delineation of
product responsibility. That's why it's so important for our managers to be on
top of what's going on in the business in order to make the right organizational
decisions.

<P> Another trend I see is continued pressure on margins. You see that manifested
in global bonds. The commission structure for globals is significantly lower than
it would be for yankees. The continued pressure on spreads has lots of
implications for our business. One is the continued concentration of
intermediaries. I believe that, over the next five or six years, eight to 10
firms will come to control 70% to 80% of activity.

<P> <B>What are the forces driving that?</B>

<P> The institutionalization of savings, for one. The Belgian dentist doesn't buy
bonds much anymore. He now has a mutual fund, or invests through a life-insurance
company. Those investors deal in bigger sizes. The phenomenon of hedge funds is
having a big impact. They will be a permanent feature of the financial landscape.
Those big investors need counterparties that can execute in size. In the new
issues market, a $500 million transaction used to be rare, but now nobody blinks
at $1 billion.

<P> <B>What does this mean for your business?</B>

<P> One of the issues we'll have to think about is how big our salesforce should
be. The industry is changing, and I'm not convinced we need a salesforce as big
as our major competitors. You'll see many more joint ventures in our business,
primarily on the distribution side. People will start to focus on how expensive
it is to have a fully-fledged distribution system. At the same time, there are a
lot of firms with distribution capacity, but which don't have the critical mass
to originate and trade with all the attendant research and capital requirements
that go with that. You could very easily see joint ventures that take advantage
of those relative strengths.

<P> <B>Will technology disintermediate securities firms? </B>

<P> That is a risk, and it's been a risk for a long time. For instance, the MTN
market in the US developed as a direct-placement market where the finance-company
subsidiaries of the US car-manufacturers sold paper directly to investors. Then
brokerage firms got involved and started adding liquidity. As long as the
intermediary is adding value, there will be a role. The minute it stops adding
value, it will be disintermediated. That value could be liquidity, trading ideas
or relative-value analysis across markets.

<h3>HEDGE FUNDS</H3> 
<H2>Clipped </H2>
<H4>Is the heyday of hedge funds over? After the 1994 watershed, these former
masters of the universe found they had become the market they were trying
to outsmart. Investors were scared off, and now newcomers are jostling for
a smaller, more risk-averse pool of capital. Downsizing, disclosure, lower
fees and surefire strategies are the order of the day. Even the veterans
have had to change, or quit. By Michelle Celarier </H4>
Charles (Karolos) Fix, who fled to Gstaad in 1982 when the socialist Greek
government expropriated the family brewery, soon found an easier way to
put his capital to work. Bored by the alps, and frustrated by the lacklustre
returns from his Swiss bankers, he began to thumb through US investment
periodicals. There he learned about an obscure type of investment vehicle
known somewhat paradoxically as a hedge fund. <BR>
<BR>
Fix met Paul Tudor Jones and through that relationship was introduced to
the elite of secretive American traders whose hedge funds seemed to have
a patent on making money. Fix says he &quot;collected&quot; all the top
names. As well as Jones, there was George Soros, Julian Robertson, Louis
Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Mark Strome, Leon Cooperman, and Bruce Kovner.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Soros was a god - but they were all stars. You had blind faith,&quot;
recalls Fix, whose leveraged portfolio chalked up an impressive 30% annual
return for almost a decade. Then came 1994. As star after star stumbled,
so did Fix. His investments were down 13% during the first quarter of 1994,
and Fix says he only managed to stem his losses after firing most of the
managers. (He stuck with Tudor Jones's Tudor Investments which weathered
1994 better than most, and after exiting a fund run by Bacon's Moore Capital
Management, reinvested in it.) <BR>
<BR>
Today Fix is no longer impressed by names. He is so sceptical of this ego-driven
industry that his preferred hedge funds now take a distinctly mathematical
approach to trading, which he considers is more objective: &quot;It's the
future,&quot; he predicts, listing among his favourites Long Term Capital
Management and Renaissance Technologies, two of today's hottest hedge funds,
both run by former mathematicians. Long Term Capital has been up 25% to
30% this year, says Fix, while Renaissance's Medallion Fund boasted a 65%
return last year, which proved to be one of the most bearish environments
in hedge fund history. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sea change</B> <BR>
<BR>
For the majority of hedge funds, however, the immediate future doesn't look
too bright. A swarm of newcomers is battling over a smaller pool of capital
and increasingly sceptical investors - a combination which managers fear
is making the lofty returns of the past harder to achieve. European investors
- who traditionally comprised more than half the market - have largely retreated.
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile the US institutional investors that hedge funds were trying to
lure into the market have been scared off by a number of scandals involving
funds whose strategies included derivatives and mortgage-backed securities.
And many of the surviving investors are clamouring for disclosure, transparency
and even lower fees - things they never dared to mention before. These trends
may be tempting some old-timers to get out of the business altogether. At
the same time, the profile of the investors targeted by new funds is changing
dramatically. A number of funds no longer ask for a minimum $1 million investment;
some new ones demand as little as $100,000. <BR>
<BR>
It's a far different world from the one Fix first entered. Around the time
Soros was bragging that he had broken the pound in September 1992, when
he and other traders forced it out of the EU's exchange rate mechanism,
these wily operators were being viewed as omniscient rulers of markets.
Central bankers considered regulating the funds as often as they sought
their managers' opinions. But Soros and his like were humbled when interest
rates rose in January 1994 and also by the fact that their own leverage
hastened the fall - one after the other - of the very markets they had begun
to dominate. From French, German and Italian bonds to the emerging markets,
they tumbled like dominoes. <BR>
<BR>
Hedge fund earnings plummeted and offshore investors like Fix rushed to
redeem their shares in the funds. Total assets in hedge funds fell from
$100 billion at the end of 1993 - the industry's peak - to $80 billion by
June 1994. By the end of the year, after US investors had started to redeem
their shares, total hedge fund assets had slipped to $75 billion. Lee Hennessee,
the co-director of the WPG-Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group at Weiss,
Peck &amp; Greer, which tracks hedge fund performance, says the 25% decline
was a combination of poor performance and drawdowns which affected the industry
across the board. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Traditionally, managers made money outsmarting the market,&quot; says
Ron Lake, president of Lake Partners, a fund of funds (a fund that invests
in other hedge funds). &quot;But two things happened. First, they stopped
listening to the market and they paid the price. Second, they became so
large that they became the market they were trying to outsmart.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Watershed</B> <BR>
<BR>
This year, while hedge funds have still largely underperformed the more
plebeian mutual funds, most of the veterans have started to recover, thanks
to the turn in the dollar, on which they bet correctly, and a phenomenal
US stock market, where many first started out. By June, investors had begun
to return. Total assets jumped $10 billion from year-end to $85 billion,
according to Hennessee. Yet a number of the former &quot;stars&quot; have
either given up the business for good - most notably veteran Michael Steinhardt
-, returned a good chunk of assets to investors, or are still suffering
from heavy redemptions. One such individual, who requested anonymity, says
he believes &quot;self-consciousness&quot; affected performance. &quot;For
the first 10 years I was doing this, nobody knew we existed. It was easier.
When every move we made started to be announced, tracked and talked about,
it created a level of consciousness that made it harder to trade.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Soros's 1992 boast - which irritated players who preferred to keep a low
profile - may have been the watershed. &quot;It brought hedge funds into
the public consciousness,&quot; says one operator. Soon the hedge fund universe
exploded. MAR/Hedge, a company which tracks hedge funds, notes that 80%
of those in existence are less than five years old. Hennessee estimates
that the number of hedge funds in the index she tracks almost doubled -
from 440 to 800 - between 1992 and 1994 (the year hedge funds posted an
average 1.04% return, and the former stars were down an average 16.54%).
By June this year, she estimates there were 1,300 hedge funds in existence
- her firm has interviewed 140 new managers this year alone. Back in 1982,
by contrast, the known hedge fund universe consisted of only 19 managers.
But those few boasted a 36.15% return. <BR>
<BR>
A number of the newcomers in recent years have come from such Wall Street
powerhouses as Goldman Sachs, Bankers Trust and Salomon Brothers. Others
are veterans of the top hedge funds themselves. While investors like Fix
marvel at how young the new managers are, Hennessee argues that this year's
entrants are on average around 45 years of age - often experienced Wall
Street veterans who were victims of the 1994 cutbacks. Market realities
appear to be forcing them to put up more of their own capital to get started.
&quot;In 1993, the average new manager was putting in only a third of what
is the norm today,&quot; she notes. New institutional players add to the
glut of operators. Propelled by the bull market in stocks, retail-oriented
Wall Street firms such as Bear Stearns, PaineWebber and Merrill Lynch are
getting into the business. Institutional money manager Alliance Capital
has opened a fund, and veteran mutual fund manager Mark Mobius, who manages
$7.5 billion in Franklin Templeton's emerging markets funds, is in the process
of raising capital for a hedge fund. Even Japanese securities houses are
toying with the idea of setting up hedge funds. <BR>
<BR>
Mobius, speaking at the second annual hedge fund conference sponsored by
MAR/Hedge last month in Bermuda, says he prefers to call his fund an &quot;edge&quot;
fund. Historically, the edge that these private partnerships have enjoyed
is an ability to operate with virtually no oversight from regulators, or
even from their investors. Mobius, whose Russia mutual fund has stalled
after running into snags on settlement and custodial issues, seems to view
hedge funds as more appropriate for such troublesome markets. He says he
plans to use his hedge fund to go into &quot;leading edge&quot; markets
not yet suitable for mutual fund investors, such as Ecuador, Slovenia or
even Cuba. <BR>
<BR>
Hedge funds are distinguished by their ability to take on more risk than
supervised market players. At their height, the biggest hedge fund managers,
known as global macro-players, used leverage with impunity, shorted markets
and bought virtually any instrument or security across the world - future,
currency, stock or bond - that they wanted. (The ability to use derivatives
earned them the name hedge fund, but many consider it a misnomer when applied
to the highly leveraged directional macro-players who generally do anything
but hedge.) <BR>
<BR>
Many managers now fear that the heightened competition and the institutionalization
of the market may be blunting the hedge fund's competitive edge. Hedge fund
operators tend to exploit inefficiencies in the markets, and the more people
who do, they argue, the more efficient the markets become. The popularity
of the MAR/Hedge event, which was attended by over 400 managers, investors
and people from supporting businesses, is a sign that the industry is coming
of age. The growth of industry consultants and marketing experts is another
indicator. The industry itself is decidedly glum about the future. An informal
poll taken at the conference indicated that most managers expected hedge
funds to earn an average of only 10% next year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Disclosure campaign</B> <BR>
<BR>
With forecast as well as current performance on the decline, investors are
beginning to attack the veil of secrecy that has obscured the business.
As private partnerships, hedge funds have generally refused to reveal their
strategies and their portfolios. Now investors want to know what's going
on. &quot;Our experience has taught us that very few fund managers lose
money in the same way they made it, and it's often a change of strategy
that seals a manager's fate,&quot; says Kevin Gundle, vice-president of
Aurum Fund Management of London, a fund of funds. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Changes in strategy,&quot; says Gundle, &quot;need to be disclosed
to shareholders in sufficient time that would allow investors to redeem
their holdings should the new strategy not fit in with their investment
objectives.&quot; But &quot;this disclosure seldom takes place,&quot; he
adds. He recalls one fund run by &quot;nice homey boys&quot; who were &quot;terrific&quot;
at regional stock picks. But when they turned in a minus 35% performance,
it turned out they were investing in Mexican ADRs (American depositary receipts).
&quot;They're in Minneapolis. What do they know about that?&quot; he asks
bitterly. Gundle has a litany of complaints. &quot;Breaches in compliance
have been observed by some big names in the industry,&quot; he says, pointing
to shaky administration and inadequate custodial arrangements. Then there's
the star complex: &quot;Some guys tend to have an ego problem. They get
too much money and get obnoxious. It's never pleasant to deal with.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Investors and managers contend that the global macro-players, which MAR/Hedge
estimates still control about two-thirds of hedge fund assets, have been
the main offenders on all counts. Size also works against them, as they
find it cumbersome to invest in quantity in the type of markets that have
offered some of their best returns, and they also find it difficult to liquidate
positions when markets turn. The veteran hedge fund operators - Soros, Steinhardt
and Robertson - started out in the US stock market, where their edge was
the ability to short, allowing them to profit even during bear markets.
Their success and growth in assets propelled them into bigger, more liquid
currency and bond markets. (MAR/Hedge's Lois Peltz estimates that, at the
end of 1993, Soros's funds topped $11 billion; Robertson's two funds, offshore
Jaguar and US-based Tiger, totalled $7 billion; while Steinhardt's assets
were about $4.6 billion.) <BR>
<BR>
<B>Soros hits size barrier</B> <BR>
<BR>
Soros made a reasonably smooth transition to a global strategy, though his
funds did lose their 36% premium during 1994, despite managing to end the
year on an upturn. The current $10 billion in the Quantum family of funds
run by Soros, estimated to be up more than 20% this year, is apparently
running into continual difficulties. In a letter to investors this summer,
Soros indicated that size was hindering the performance of his funds. Market
sources say that the Soros funds are farming out some of their investments
to smaller funds, particularly in such speciality areas as Russia, to help
alleviate the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Newer entrants - Leon Cooperman, the former Goldman Sachs research director
who started the offshore Omega and US-based Odyssey Funds, and Stanley Shopkorn,
the former Salomon equity trader who opened Ethos Management - branched
out into global stocks, bonds and currencies, and were hammered in 1994.
(Cooperman's assets declined from $3 billion to $1.9 billion, estimates
Peltz.) Both men are said to have gone back to basics this year - the US
stock market - and are slowly recovering. <BR>
<BR>
Mark Strome, a former California stockbroker, suffered a fall in assets
handled by Strome Susskind Investment Management from $800 million at the
end of 1993 to $645 million at the end of 1994, according to<B> </B>MAR/Hedge,
before bouncing back this year. Moore Capital Management, run by former
futures trader Louis Bacon, shrank from $3.5 billion to about $2 billion
in assets today, according to Peltz. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tudor downsizes</B> <BR>
<BR>
Bacon's close friend and fellow futures trader Tudor Jones has a habit of
returning money to investors in order to prevent his Tudor Investments growing
too large; his assets dropped $700 million to $1 billion during 1994. Tudor
Jones has also shut down two funds - the G-5, which invested in the stock
markets of the five major industrialized countries, and his US stock vehicle,
the American Eagle Fund. This year futures trader Bruce Kovner of Caxton
Management returned $1.2 billion to investors, keeping $700 million to manage,
and Steinhardt announced, despite a performance comeback, that he would
close his funds, which had slipped to about $2.7 billion. According to sources
close to Steinhardt, the fund lost $1 billion during 1994, suffered $800
million in redemptions, and had made $400 million this year before he opted
to retire. <BR>
<BR>
In their search for new markets to recoup losses, these hedge fund operators
have often stepped into another minefield. Few areas have been more dangerous
than investment in Russia, a market so tiny and undeveloped that even a
small percentage of their assets there allowed them to dominate it. Domination
didn't help their performance, however. Many funds have suffered losses
in their volatile Russian portfolios which became virtually unsellable.
Strome Susskind and Ethos have confirmed losses in Russia. It is believed
that Tiger Management is carrying losing positions there too. <BR>
<BR>
Hedge fund operators often claim that such risky investments are so insignificant
a part of any manager's portfolio that losses there can't hurt. But that
isn't how investors see it. In countries such as Russia, India and parts
of Latin America, it's often difficult or impossible to sell the shares
in a falling market because the stock markets are underdeveloped and riddled
with corrupt practices. Frequently, hedge fund investors have only learned
about such investments when they've tried to redeem their shares. Then,
instead of receiving cash, they are stuck with illiquid securities. According
to Peltz, when investors in Ethos, disgruntled by a negative 33% performance
in 1994, tried to redeem shares earlier this year, they learned they would
have to take 7% to 9% of the redemption in illiquid securities - including
Russian stocks - instead of cash. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Illiquid positions</B> <BR>
<BR>
Ethos wasn't the only one. Nor was Russia the only problem. When Fix tried
to redeem his shares in Robertson's offshore Jaguar fund: &quot;I found
myself with completely illiquid positions in a failing insurance company.
I didn't like it,&quot; he says. Robertson is considering spinning off the
insurance investment into a separate, distressed security fund, and if he
does so, &quot;maybe I'll reinvest [in Jaguar]&quot;, says Fix. <BR>
<BR>
The problems encountered by the hedge fund stars are prompting a resurgence
of interest in smaller niche players, and no doubt that has led to raised
hopes among the newcomers - who dismiss their predecessors as &quot;dinosaurs&quot;
- that they will attract some of the new interest. MAR/Hedge reports that
the best performing group this year are hedge funds invested in the US stock
market, whose returns were approximately 15% up to October (still far behind
the 30% return on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500). The worst performers were
the short sellers, down 10% in this bull market. <BR>
<BR>
One reason hedge funds have performed so poorly, says Hennessee, is because
they turned cautious after 1994, and for once being true to their name,
hedged their portfolios. Leverage also declined, although managers say it
is beginning to resurface, raising concerns about what a bear market in
US stocks would bring. <BR>
<BR>
Hennessee, who tracks a smaller group, notes that hedge funds invested in
financial equities have performed the best this year, up 47% to September.
Other good performers were growth stocks (up 31.58%), convertible arbitrage
managers (up 19.65%), distressed securities (up 21.17%) and risk arbitrage
(up 15.92%). Levered bond hedge funds have also done relatively well, with
a 13.45% performance by the end of September. <BR>
<BR>
But the so-called macro-managers have also staged a comeback, and according
to Hennessee, were up 14.81% as a group to September. In addition to their
long dollar positions, she says they have profited from bets on German and
Italian bonds, and option strategies on the S&amp;P Index and the Nikkei.
Where are they going next? Hennessee notes that the macro-managers are watching
Japanese capital outflows closely, anticipating that a turnround in this
activity will boost financial assets worldwide. Hedge fund manager Mark
Strome confirms the view, adding that he believes Japanese flight capital
will benefit &quot;junky&quot; countries such as emerging markets and Italy.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>New stars on the horizon</B> <BR>
<BR>
After being burned, however, many investors remain sceptical about the prowess
of the macro-players and are looking at managers with different strategies
which they hope are more fireproof. That has created a new cluster of stars
on the hedge fund horizon. Long Term Capital, starting out with $1.25 billion
capital, is led by former Salomon Brothers arbitrage king John Meriwether,
who has employed a slew of former mathematicians like himself to engage
in bond arbitrage strategies. <BR>
<BR>
Long Term Capital was successful even during 1994, earning returns above
20%, say investors. Similarly successful has been Renaissance Technologies,
whose manager James Simons is a doctor of mathematics and former professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Simons' $500 million Medallion
fund is turning in stunning returns using a computer-driven black-box approach
to trading. Now that he's grown successful, he fears he may have topped
out, according to investors who say he hosted them earlier this year and
warned them not to expect the same lofty returns in future. Another hotshot
is day-trader Steven Cohen, whose $110 million SAC Capital Management earned
70% last year, net of a hefty 50% performance fee. <BR>
<BR>
Historically at least, higher fees have accompanied higher returns. At least
that's the surprising conclusion of a study of 400 hedge funds undertaken
by TAG Associates, which invests money for a number of wealthy families
in some 40 hedge funds. Yet most observers agree that extraordinarily high
fees are the exception, and certainly not the way forward: the fee structure
is starting to crack. Hedge fund managers have grown fat by taking at least
a 20% performance fee plus a 1% management fee. But as the deadline for
the year-end drawdowns grows closer, says Hennessee, &quot;investors are
now asking why they should be paying a 20% performance fee to underperform
mutual funds that carry a 1% fee.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Aurum's Gundle argues that the poor performance of the recent past has thrown
into question the fairness of the incentive-fee structure, whereby managers
earn fees even if they lose money. &quot;We have made various proposals
where either a tiered or phased-in fee structure is applied to a poorly
performing fund. As expected, our proposals were not embraced, but they
did send a sobering message to the fund managers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Aurum, he notes, only charges an incentive fee once the returns for investors
have exceeded 20% a year, known as a hurdle rate. Since 1994 there has been
a trend for managers not to charge an incentive fee until investors' losses
are recouped and their assets return to the level of the initial investment
- called a high water mark. (Investors believe such trends encouraged the
exit of Steinhardt, whose funds lost half their value in 1994 but who refused
to institute a high-water-mark policy.) A further suggestion has been that
fees should be based on a three-year-rolling average, rather than annual,
performance. Predicts TAG Associates' managing director Andrew Malloy: &quot;Competitive
Darwinian forces will make it happen.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One competitive factor is the sought-after new institutional investors who
are bound to demand additional disclosure and lower fees from hedge funds.
Foundations and endowments are already relatively active, comprising 25%
of fund assets, according to Hennessee. Yet even these players have grown
cautious. If endowments lose money, notes Mary Ann Johnson, president of
Johnson Custom Strategies, a hedge fund adviser, &quot;they have to go back
to investors and raise more&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the big growth area is pensions, which now account for only 5%
of total hedge fund assets, according to estimates made by Hennessee. She
forecasts that these players will become more significant participants in
the future. She estimates that by 2004, some 30% of hedge fund assets will
be held by ERISA (pension) accounts, swelling the total assets in the industry
to $500 billion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reluctant institutions</B> <BR>
<BR>
Such prognostications are small comfort to those trying to attract institutional
money today. Appaloosa Management, a hedge fund run by former Goldman Sachs
partners, has done reasonably well by catering to institutional investors.
Even so, when the firm decided to set up a special fund to invest in mortgage<B>-</B>backed
securities - a sector which principal Michael Spirlock acknowledges &quot;strikes
fear in peoples hearts&quot; - Appaloosa had to scale back its expectations.
Hoping to raise $150 million, Appaloosa had to settle for $50 million. <BR>
<BR>
The derivatives debacles of the recent past - beginning with the 1994 collapse
of David Askin's highly leveraged mortgage-backed securities hedge fund
- have scared off many institutional investors. &quot;The fiduciary police
have been called out,&quot; says David White, executive vice-president at
AIG International Asset Management. He complains that the sophisticated
value-at-risk analyses now being undertaken by corporations are just ways
to justify terminating programmes, following losses by both Askin, and more
recently, the Common Fund, a fund of funds which made investments for universities.
<BR>
<BR>
The institutional marketplace was further shaken by a recent decision by
Kodak to cancel its hedge fund programme. &quot;The performance was not
positive enough to make the risks they were taking worth it,&quot; explains
Johnson<B> </B>of Johnson Custom Strategies. <BR>
<BR>
Pension funds that are regulated by the US' ERISA are forced to be cautious,
and as White says, &quot;the burden of proof is on us to prove we're suitable&quot;.
He notes that institutional investors want to make sure that the hedge fund
isn't leveraged, doesn't use derivatives, and isn't complex - which rules
out just about everyone. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the European investors are still gun-shy. Fix estimates it will
be another two to three years before the industry fully recovers. &quot;Offshore
people are still very scared,&quot; says Fix. &quot;They're coming back
very slowly. They need much more knowledge to follow these funds.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Guiseppi Ciardi, a principal at London-based Park Place Investors - which
finally got its hedge fund off the ground in November 1994 after almost
a year of trying - acknowledges the difficult environment. &quot;Our effort
in raising money was impaired a lot by the fact that people were burned
so much,&quot; he says. Now he argues, things have changed: &quot;The industry
has improved - 1994 shook down a lot of ideas that people had about hedge
funds. It's not an industry of pirates or guys going after 60% returns.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Like many, he argues that the pressure which investors are slowly bringing
to bear on the hedge fund industry will benefit it in the long run. &quot;Hedge
funds have gone into a big shakeout, and now people are more aware of the
risks inherent in running hedge money. Investors are being more cautious
and more thorough in terms of due diligence, and I think that quality will
come out in the long run.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hedge funds have long feared that the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission
would try to force greater transparency on the industry, but ironically,
it is self-regulation that is having the biggest impact. &quot;The greater
threat is the investor. He's tired of it and demands more visibility of
the portfolio,&quot; says James Hedges, managing director of LJH Alternative
Investment Advisors, which manages money for a number of family interests.
Adds Gundle: &quot;1994 taught us to ask questions. We spend most of our
time monitoring our managers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>The disclosure debate</B> <BR>
<BR>
Some managers complain about the drive for disclosure, claiming that giving
out such proprietary information hurts them when their merchandise is bandied
about in the marketplace. One manager notes that after telling an investor
in confidence about a unique mortgage security it owned, it received an
unsolicited query from a small regional bank. <BR>
<BR>
As a marketing device, many new fund managers take the opposite tack, noting
that they are offering full disclosure on their fund's strategies and portfolios.
&quot;We're just flat out committed to communicating,&quot; says Bruce Sammut,
a principal of a small newcomer, Florida-based T-500 Capital Management,
which offers an options-driven S&amp;P 500 product. &quot;Obviously we're
not going to give away our algorithms and programs, but we give a quite
in-depth explanation of how we execute that process,&quot; says Sammut.
He says an investor would know if the fund were to change strategy because
the model produces a specific result. The fund, which requires only a minimum
$100,000 investment, asks a mere 10% performance fee and a 1% management
fee. <BR>
<BR>
Fix says that his managers still won't disclose their portfolios. But he
has learned that he has the ultimate say. &quot;If the record starts to
diverge, I try to ask for an explanation. And if I don't get it, I fire
the manager.&quot; Managers are learning this lesson the hard way. <BR>
<BR>
The once highly regarded Fenchurch Capital Management, previously owned
by Kleinwort Benson, suffered a run of redemptions earlier this year and
was forced to close down its European positions. Investors say the run happened
because Fenchurch, whose returns have reportedly slumped by more than 30%
this year, refused to disclose its portfolio to worried investors for fear
of exposing its strategy. (Fenchurch did not respond to calls on this matter.)
<BR>
<BR>
Even as these changes shake the hedge fund industry, this contrarian group
of individuals refuse to admit they're beaten by changes in circumstances.
When asked about the meaning of the departure from the business of such
icons as Michael Steinhardt, hedge fund manager Mark Strome is undaunted:
&quot;Things like this don't happen at the top,&quot; he says. As a trader
who is always looking for the market turn, he insists: &quot;I'm bullish
on hedge funds.&quot; Presumably Strome can afford to carry that position
for a while. <BR>

<H3>FEES</H3> 
<H2>Gravy train gets bogged down </H2>
<H4>Competition is driving down the fees banks charge for running privatization
issues. Last year's 3% is heading below 2%. Top firms argue that skimping
on fees damages issue quality and, especially, after-sales service. But
the same firms are cutting their charges to stay in the game. Peter Lee
reports </H4>
In January, Merrill Lynch won a mandate in Brazil as global coordinator
for the privatization of mining conglomerate CVRD. The fee will be just
1.91% of the funds raised. This is bad news for other leading investment
banks which regularly compete for the world's top mandates. Fees are coming
down. Rewards for executing large, complex, time-consuming privatization
issues are falling, just when the deals are getting tougher to complete,
and the cost of maintaining a high-powered privatization team is still rising.
<BR>
<BR>
The drop in fees is especially pronounced in emerging markets. Goldman Sachs
took 4.5% on the first offering of shares in Mexican telephone company Telmex
in 1991. In 1993, CS First Boston earned 4% for the privatization sale of
Argentine oil company YPF. Already fees were under pressure. When Goldman
came to do a second Telmex tranche in 1992, the fee was 3%. <BR>
<BR>
The bad news for the banks is that the slide will probably continue. Competition
is still strong from firms desperate to establish their credentials in the
international equity market. In emerging markets, even though mandates can
become a curse - last year's plum Asian deal, Indonesia's PT Telkom, turned
out an embarrassing failure - the desire to win them is still fierce. <BR>
<BR>
By contrast, in the developed markets, the hierarchy of equity firms is
clearer. An extreme example is the corporate new issue market in the US.
Three or four firms dominate. And within that group, a firm knows that unless
it boasts the top-ranked analyst on a stock or the leading secondary trading
market share for that sector, it won't win the deal. The result is a well-established
fee schedule - ranging from 7% for small IPOs to 2% or less for large secondary-block
trades - that is the envy of non-American firms. <BR>
<BR>
In emerging countries, equity market leaders are less well established.
Because many finance ministries have appointed home-country banks to prominent
roles in privatizations, the pool of contenders claiming privatization experience
is ever-widening. The global American firms find themselves competing with
UK, continental European and local banks to win mandates. They are facing
three or four times the competition they used to. <BR>
<BR>
But so far that doesn't seem to be dampening their interest in winning privatizations.
Not many firms have followed Goldman Sachs, which appeared to rule itself
out of the running on CVRD by bidding 3.125% on fees. Some competitors suggest
the firm is more interested in chasing corporate equity deals. <BR>
<BR>
For all their disappointment over CVRD, the losers were soon fighting hard
for this year's big mandate in Latin America - Telefonica del Peru. &quot;That's
the only large deal due to come out of Peru and it may be one of the most
interesting in Latin America,&quot; says Michael Ryan, managing director
at Merrill Lynch. &quot;Several firms may see it as an opportunity to build
a track record in the telecoms sector and bolster their league table position
and decide, for these strategic reasons, to bid low.&quot; At the end of
January, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan secured the mandate. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is already ridiculous to be running emerging market deals for less
than 3%,&quot; complains a banker at another American firm. Apparently,
not all his peers agree. Strong rumour says that Morgan Stanley was prepared
to bid even lower than Merrill - a mere 1.5% - on CVRD. <BR>
<BR>
The trend will not be confined to Latin America. The long-awaited privatization
of Turk Telekom may finally be mandated this year. Partly because there
is no established market leader selling Turkish equity internationally,
many bankers fancy their chances of winning a lead role. Says one: &quot;The
so-called short-list of finalists for that deal is very long. You can bet
that someone ambitious to build their reputation in privatizations, or telecoms,
or fringe European equities, will bid low.&quot; Appointing the lowest bidder
is a way of demonstrating to critics at home that the government is driving
a hard bargain with foreign bankers. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cutting to win</B> <BR>
<BR>
Many bankers now worry that they will suffer similar cuts in fees in developed
market privatizations. &quot;How can Merrill Lynch now ask any European
government for 3% for a privatization when it accepts such low fees in Brazil?&quot;
asks one banker. To date, there have been no spectacular declines. The rule
of thumb for European deals is that fees are steady at around 3%. But there
have been exceptions. The all-in cost to the Spanish government on the last
offering of Telefonica stock was 2.95% plus expenses. The Dutch government
paid 2.5% on the second sale of KPN stock last year. &quot;We are now at
a crucial juncture on fees,&quot; says Jerker Johansson, executive director
at Morgan Stanley. &quot;It will go one of two ways: either to a clear differentiated
fee structure as in the US; or it will be like the Eurobond market, with
firms cutting fees to win business.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In European corporate equity deals, bankers see encouraging signs, with
chief financial officers ready to pay over 5% for initial public offerings
(IPOs). But the signs are less hopeful on privatizations. Behind the scenes,
strong pressure is being applied. One banker says: &quot;In the later stages
of mandating the ENI deal, the Italian authorities were pressing all the
time, calling the banks to say they had not made up their minds who to mandate
and asking how low firms would bid on fees.&quot; Another banker says: &quot;Firms
have already quietly breached 3%. On one forthcoming Italian transaction,
a UK bank has promised to pay back a portion of its fees to the government.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Many global coordinators blame specialist advisory firms for their woes.
They are especially bitter at firms with no capital markets expertise which
interfere with the process of selling equity and justify themselves to the
governments by cutting back on fees paid to banks. At the same time, advisers
tend to push for larger-sized deals and higher valuations. They also bring
confusion. Syndicate members on the second KPN sale last year say that the
Dutch government's adviser, NM Rothschild, and the global coordinator, ABN
Amro, tried to upstage each other throughout. Junior banks weren't sure
who was running the deal or who to ask for guidance on myriad issues. <BR>
<BR>
It's a typical example, bankers say, of advisers stepping beyond giving
advice and trying to police and run deals, which they are not qualified
to do. &quot;They're creating an adversarial climate, pushing investment
banks more into the role of advocate for investors,&quot; complains one
banker. That shouldn't happen, unless a bank is taking on a hard underwriting
and has a vested interest in securing stock at a low price. The overwhelming
majority of privatizations incorporate book-building, whereby the selling
government and the banks share the common goal of maximizing proceeds. <BR>
<BR>
Global coordinators also blame each other for cutting fees. &quot;European
banks are biased towards lower fees,&quot; complains one American banker.
&quot;Those firms from countries used to fixed-price equity offers are accustomed
to selling stock at a discount to the market and charging a low fee of under
2%. The total cost to the issuer is higher because it includes the discount
and the fee.&quot; He argues that European banks have applied low fees to
book-building deals, not realizing that fees ought to be richer because,
in the process of maximizing proceeds, an arranger has to motivate its sales
force as well as paying research and corporate finance staff. <BR>
<BR>
European bankers deny they are leading fees down. They point out that it
was Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley which squeezed the CVRD bid below 2%.
But European firms agree that inexperienced lead managers, having won a
toe-hold in their own market perhaps by under-bidding, are likely to miscalculate
the revenues and costs of the privatization business. The head of equity
capital markets at one UK firm says: &quot;It's easy for some of these banks
to say that if you earn 3% on a multi-billion dollar deal it must be profitable.
But bear in mind the cost of the research, sales and corporate finance infrastructure
required.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Equity firms claim that the costs of employing hundreds of salesmen and
analysts have to be met partly from fees for arranging privatization deals.
These might take years to complete from early pitches, through winning the
mandate, to executing the deal. They add that even when fees appear healthy,
these are often spread among a large syndicate of banks, many of which perform
little useful work and are only included at the whim of the host government.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Opportunity cost </B><BR>
<BR>
A co-lead management is not much consolation these days for a firm which
has failed to win the lead mandate after months of work. &quot;On deals
where we used to earn $1.5 million as a co-lead we are now lucky to bring
in $500,000,&quot; says one banker. Even for successful bidders, returns
are thin in what is supposed to be one of the most profitable segments of
investment banking. &quot;The return on effort in privatizations is low,&quot;
insists Merrill's Ryan. Last year - a good year for stock markets - Morgan
Stanley's return on equity was 16%: good but hardly excessive. It has a
lot of fixed costs. Investors must worry if it has to compete in future
with firms pricing IPOs on the margin. <BR>
<BR>
Comparing costs against revenues accurately in the privatization business
is difficult because you need to gauge the opportunity costs. What could
a firm's staff be earning if they were freed from the endless bureaucracy
of privatization deals? Nevertheless some firms try to keep track, by filling
in time sheets rather like lawyers and accountants, to measure how much
time privatizations take up. The results are disquieting. Many bankers now
suggest that privatizing governments should, wherever possible, speed up
the whole process of selling off companies. <BR>
<BR>
Another European banker compares his firm's return on two deals executed
last year. One was a privatization for which it initially pitched in 1993.
It won the mandate and executed the deal last summer. Total revenues for
18 months' work, involving eight managing directors working near full-time
for six months assisted by many more salesmen and support staff, was $2.5
million. Later in the year, the firm executed a bought deal on which it
earned $5 million in 24 hours. The bought deal was not even particularly
risky, the banker says. &quot;This should scare governments,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Some firms will stop tendering for conventional business. Today, the
French government might get 15 pitches on a deal and those 15 firms will
do anything to win the mandate But two or three years ago, 50 banks might
have put themselves forward.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most banks warn about other dire consequences for governments which squeeze
too hard on fees. &quot;Because the economics available to banks are being
reduced, many syndicate banks just don't perform.,&quot; says Michael Evans,
partner and managing director at Goldman Sachs. Governments don't seem to
realize this. A particular danger is that firms will commit fewer resources
to researching and making markets in privatization stocks, potentially putting
investors off future privatization sales. Eventually, they may stop competing
for anything but the easiest-to-sell blue-chip companies. <BR>
<BR>
More immediately, firms will be less inclined to commit their capital to
stabilizing prices when share prices fall in the immediate after-market.
In recent months that has been the common fate of many privatization stocks.
One banker admits: &quot;Firms make all sorts of promises about committing
capital when they are pitching for deals. But it is very difficult to argue
internally that we should devote more of our capital to supporting an aggressively-priced
new issue in a volatile market, when this business already consumes substantial
resources at a moderate return.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even on book-built deals, firms take some risk-capital positions in trading
new issues. On most deals firms are given a notional underwriting amount.
If a firm encounters strong demand and sells stock way beyond its notional
underwriting allocation plus its share of the green-shoe option [the syndicate's
option to take more stock from the selling government] , it is short of
the stock. If it only sells up to the green-shoe limit, it may find itself
long of stock. Some recent privatization deals, notably Pechiney, have been
almost impossible for syndicate members to sell. And in many deals, firms
have to take on hard underwriting commitments during open fixed-price offers
to domestic retail investors. &quot;Banks were on the hook for nine days
in Telefonica while the European stock markets were highly volatile,&quot;
says one syndicate head. If firms feel they have been short-changed on fees
they will be even more inclined to let difficult deals like Pechiney plummet
in after-market trading. <BR>
<BR>
Firms can suffer a capital hit long after completing a privatization offer.
Some firms which made rich fees from Latin American privatizations in the
early 1990s took heavy losses in falling markets following the peso crisis
of 1994. They suffered because they were by far the leading market-makers
in stocks they had taken public. When markets turned sour, investors dumped
stock to traders at the firm which had led the deal. Some argue that their
4% and 5% fees should be measured against those losses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Asset quality</B> <BR>
<BR>
Global coordinators are growing increasingly uneasy about privatizations
in general, not just about fees. Privatizations have lost their scarcity
value, they say. Most European and many emerging countries are pursuing
programmes. Investors can afford to pick and choose as never before. Many
recent offerings have been marked by stock price falls in secondary market
trading. Investors have less incentive to snap up shares in the primary
market. The British government built up goodwill among domestic retail investors
in the 1980s by privatizing companies at prices which allowed for share
price appreciation in the after-market. Only later did they tighten up on
pricing. Other governments have tried to jump into privatization further
along in the process, without building up enthusiasm among retail investors
over a series of deals. <BR>
<BR>
Another growing problem for global coordinators is the doubtful quality
of the assets they are being asked to privatize. In the successful early
UK privatizations of utilities operating as near monopolies, it was usually
easy to identify cost savings which might boost profits and share prices.
In recent European deals, this has been harder to do. Some countries are
selling off companies that have long operated as quasi-independent corporates,
reporting a recognizable P&amp;L, such as KPN. Easy cost savings are less
readily achievable. Other countries have tried to sell off the wrong companies
at the wrong time in the stock market cycle. The French stand accused of
this on several recent deals, including aluminium company Pechiney, which
was sold late last year. The deal bombed in the after-market and many firms
now express surprise that it went ahead at all. &quot;It was nearly a BP,&quot;
says one American banker, recalling the infamous UK issue with which underwriters
were stuck following the 1987 world stock market crash. <BR>
<BR>
Some governments seem to be ignoring today's tough market conditions. Final
pricing meetings are difficult. In most book-building deals, banks produce
a chart of the amount of demand against the price investors will pay. Initially
sellers are always tempted to take the highest price that will allow them
to fully subscribe the offer. But that may be a mistake. If markets are
volatile, investors may dump shares quickly. That will sour the reception
for future sales. &quot;It's difficult to persuade governments to leave
anything on the table for investors. Understandably, they have to maximize
proceeds for the taxpayer.&quot; says Lucinda Riches, executive director
at SBC Warburg. Another banker complains: &quot;Government officials are
saying: 'I don't care what my bankers tell me, I won't let them talk the
price down.' But we have to allow the markets to set pricing, not politicians.
Some governments have pushed too far.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The French and Italian privatization programmes are the ones most likely
to struggle this year. One banker says: &quot;In pricing French deals, the
notion of leaving something on the table for investors doesn't even rate
consideration.&quot; In recent deals, domestic retail investors have been
much less enthusiastic and share prices have fallen sharply from the IPO
price. If those trends continue, deals will be impossible to complete. The
disappearance of domestic retail buyers is particularly worrying. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the UK,&quot; says Riches at Warburg, &quot;domestic institutional
fund managers almost <I>have</I> to buy privatizations because of their
weight in the indices, so retail support is not as vital, at least on the
smaller offerings. But in Spain and Italy, where domestic institutions are
not as large, the retail response is more important.&quot; International
investors like to see strong signs of domestic support before committing
to buy privatization stocks. Bankers blame the weak Italian domestic demand
on ENI for pricing that deal at the bottom of the indicated range and failing
to secure a larger deal. The weak domestic response worried other investors.
American institutions sold considerable amounts soon after the deal closed.
<BR>
<BR>
The hardest thing for governments to control is the combined scale of their
privatization programmes. Together they have a lot of stock to sell. And
while they may regulate their own privatization calendars, they rely on
occasional compromise and common sense to clear the way for deals that will
obviously compete for the same investor dollars. The sale of Deutsche Telekom
is set for November. That may prove to be a bad time to sell telecom stocks,
but no other sensible government would schedule a telecom privatization
to compete with it. Unfortunately, such good sense is not guaranteed. <BR>
<BR>
An easy solution for governments is to price issues so low that investors
snap them up. But that is hard to justify to political opponents. What advice
would lead managers offer? Simple, they reply. Look at the portfolio of
companies for sale, choose a good one for which there is a realistic prospect
of strong demand; put together a syndicate of banks which is not skewed
in favour of domestic firms and do a transparent, well-marketed deal priced
to perform reasonably well. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A number of governments are now at the crossroads on privatization,&quot;
says Amir Eilon, managing director at BZW. &quot;They must decide that they
are not just shovelling out any old thing that's to hand but are trying
to sell off quality assets for which they need to develop some appetite,
starting at home.&quot; Tough sectors to sell this year will be telecoms,
metals and chemicals. Easier sells may be energy utilities, oil and gas,
and airports. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Quick deals</B> <BR>
<BR>
If governments could quicken up the privatization process, they might find
it easier to match company sales to cyclical peaks in demand for a particular
sector. The ultimate quick deal is the block trade. Late last year, the
British government disposed of its remaining 1.8% holding in BP, through
a block trade worth &#163;513 million. SBC Warburg won the deal against
competing bids from a handful of other firms. It bought 101 million shares
at 508p, representing a 4.3% discount to the prevailing market price for
BP shares of 531p. It quickly placed shares with over 100 accounts, over
half in the UK, the rest in Europe and America. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers expect the UK government to use bought deals to dispose of several
of its 28 small residual stakes in other privatized companies. Some European
governments may follow suit. Following its next marketed sale of Repsol
stock, the Spanish government will retain under 10% of the company which
it might sell through a bought deal. The Dutch government also holds several
small residual blocks. <BR>
<BR>
The advantage of the technique for governments is that it offers speed and
certainty of proceeds. The drawback is that there is no absolute guarantee
that bought deals bring the highest possible price. They are of limited
use in IPOs, or even second- and third-tranche sales. Most rival firms applauded
the BP deal. But another UK banker points out: &quot;Bought deals are all
about banks managing their risk and reward. Banks will calculate where they
can sell the stock, subtract a discount of around 1% and make their bid.
But just because four or five banks bid in the same range, that doesn't
prove it's the best price. You find the best price by sounding out as many
potential investors as possible.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Unorthodox approach</B> <BR>
<BR>
A compromise between the traditional, protracted privatization and the bought
deal is the quick book-building. Last December, UBS and Dresdner Bank-Kleinwort
Benson sold $376 million of shares in the National Grid, held by North West
Water and Scottish Power, through what they called a global accelerated
tender. The firms built a book of orders over two days, rewarding institutions
for bidding early and aggressively. They priced shares after securing a
heavy oversubscription. Bankers who worked on the deal argue that the fees
were probably lower than the discount that would have been required on a
bought deal. The vendors also avoided the expenses of a lengthy roadshow.
&quot;And investors don't have to listen to dozens of brokers selling the
same story,&quot; says Connor Killeen, head of equity capital markets at
UBS. <BR>
<BR>
Quick book-building could be used for some second- or third-tranche privatization
sales, where domestic institutional support is likely to be so strong that
a cumbersome retail offer is unnecessary. But pushing out quick deals remains
an unorthodox approach. BZW advised the UK government against using a bought
deal for its BP stake. The firm's message to privatizing governments is
to be wary of innovation and instead to return to the basics of privatization.
&quot;Plan carefully, avoid glitzy, glamorous deals, explain the investment
story, don't rush the process,&quot; says Amir Eilon. &quot;If you do all
that, you can extract enough information to allocate stock to quality buyers
and price dispassionately.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Last year's privatization of Pechiney highlights the dangers of the quick
and dirty route, he says: &quot;As well as being a cyclical stock, this
company had just gone through six months of aggressive asset disposals.
As well as the privatization there was a simultaneous rights issue, a take-out
of non-voting shares and of a minority international subsidiary. With deals
this complicated it's dangerous to skimp on investor education.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
BZW still hails the process it and Kleinwort Benson used in last year's
second offering of shares in the UK power generators (GenCos) as the deluxe
privatization model. <BR>
<BR>
The GenCos deal was flagged months in advance. The global coordinators monitored
dealing in outstanding GenCos shares for the best part of a year to ensure
institutions did not drive the stock price down in expectation of covering
their short positions in the new offer. The global coordinators, together
with the rest of the syndicate, spent two months pre-qualifying institutions,
grading them for favourable allocation depending on several criteria including
how long they had held their existing investments in the GenCos. <BR>
<BR>
But many firms are tired of such elaborate procedures. &quot;We have to
crush these secondary sales down to two or three weeks,&quot; argues Killeen.
He also expects greater volume of privatizations to be completed through
bought deals. Other bankers are coming round to the same view. &quot;On
certain deals we have changed our view on the ideal structure for a marketed
offer,&quot; says Johansson. &quot;We now believe in a much more truncated
timetable from announcement to pricing, simply because investors are becoming
more expert at evaluating whether or not to buy offerings.&quot; He adds
that governments should prevent deals becoming too bureaucratic. <BR>
<BR>
Accommodating retail investors limits governments' ability to speed up deals.
Retail support is an important aspect of many privatizations, especially
IPOs, for two reasons. Many governments wish to build up their local capital
markets and encourage wider share ownership. International investors, which
in the early days of cross-border equity investing sought values in stock
which domestic buyers had not seen, now take a different approach. They
prefer the comfort of knowing that local investors are buying. Stock market
regulations may require fixed-price offers for retail to be held open for
two or more weeks. The process of gearing up share shops and other retail
outlets can take longer, even many months. <BR>
<BR>
Although compelled to follow long timetables, governments could be more
innovative on retail offers. Eilon says: &quot;I'm staggered that more governments
haven't followed the UK government's example and used the partly paid structure.&quot;
Experience in the UK suggests that the risk of non-payment of second and
third instalments on privatizations is very low: around 2% to 3%. The advantage
for share buyers is that they can put some of their purchase capital into
money market investments for several months. Investment banks also feel
a benefit. Eilon adds: &quot;Say banks earn 1% on total proceeds on an offer
paid over three equal instalments. It's as if they're earning 3% on initial
proceeds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Other innovations may be useful on retail-driven deals. Goldman Sachs and
BBV offered Spanish retail investors a refund against the first 10% of any
capital losses on last year' sale of stock in Repsol. It addressed their
chief fear: that the price of a privatization stock might fall soon after
the initial offer. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bells and whistles</B> <BR>
<BR>
Other wrinkles can be introduced: such as offering bonus shares for retail
investors that hold privatization stocks for a year or longer after launch.
But it doesn't always work. A similar formula was adopted in the ENI sale.
The head of capital markets at one syndicate member says: &quot;Italian
retail investors were already worried by political turmoil and stock market
volatility. They interpreted the offer of down-side protection as an admission
that the deal was likely to bomb out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
No amount of tweaking deal structures for domestic retail investors will
allow a government to sell a huge amount of stock at an aggressive price
following a string of poor deals. Institutions are even less likely to be
impressed by gimmicks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Institutions will figure out very quickly the net present value of
a part-pay option, or any other option,&quot; says Johannsson. &quot;So
by using a lot of fine-tuning you won't necessarily add much demand. If
a stock is worth 100p and you add bells and whistles worth 10p to try to
sell it, you might just as well sell it at 90p.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yet bankers are racking their brains to devise new structures, even for
privatizations aimed mainly at institutional investors. At least one European
government is expected to use a convertible-bond offering in its privatization
programme this year. That makes sense for investors. The bond component
of convertibles provides substantial protection against capital loss. The
drawback for governments is that a full equity sale is not assured. Governments
also take on higher public sector indebtedness until the bonds are converted
into equity. <BR>
<BR>
Some practitioners argue that tinkering with structures can confuse the
economic issue. Says Eilon: &quot;In debt markets, it's worth trying any
nuance to squeeze out one or two basis points of value. In equity markets,
you're not dealing with basis points but with stocks that can rise or fall
by 20% very quickly. By playing with a structure here or there, you can
take your eye off the fundamentally important thing, which is to sell the
stock properly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But other bankers reply that governments must be opportunistic and look
at alternatives. &quot;You can't trust the markets to bail out every deal,&quot;
says Merrill's Ryan.<p>
